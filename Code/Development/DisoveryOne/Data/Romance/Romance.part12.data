          TITLE SEQUENCE

      1   EXT. MOUNTAINS, NEAR GENEVA, SWITZERLAND - NIGHT

          The snow covered Alps stand out clearly in the light of a full
          moon.  A fortress-like CHATEAU is situated in a flat saddle of
          forest partway up the mountain, next to a frozen lake.  The
          property is surrounded by high stone walls, and the stately
          grounds are bathed in floodlights and patrolled by armed guards
          with dogs.


      2   EXT. CHATEAU - NIGHT

          The driveway and motorcourt are filled with cars.  A formal-
          dress party is in progress... a private reception for a middle-
          eastern dignitary.  Tuxedoes men escort their diamond-encrusted
          ladies through the huge front doors, where they doff their
          overcoats and are politely scanned with hand-held metal
          detectors by white gloved security staffers.

          The walled perimeter of the house runs along the lake, forming
          a kind of rampart.  There is an opening, to a kind of waterway
          or canal, which connects to the private docks inside the
          grounds.  There is a steel grating across the opening.  The
          bars disappear down into the thin ice of early winter.

          With the house visible BG, we CRANE DOWN below the parapet wall
          along which a guard is a white exposure-suit is walking... down
          along the dark wall to the grating... TILTING DOWN to see a
          glow pulsing under the ice.

      
      3   EXT. BENEATH THE ICE, UNDERWATER - NIGHT      
      
          Camera moving toward:  A FIGURE in diving gear working at the
          metal bars with an oxygen arc cutting torch.  One bar has
          already been cut out.  Two quick cuts and a second bar falls to
          the muddy bottom.  Lit now only from the floodlights filtering
          down through the ice, the figure slips through the bars and
          swims powerfully along the stone canal wall.

          Seem from below, the figure is a black shadow moving against
          the rippled-glass of the ice above.


      4   EXT. CANAL AND BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

          A dock extends into the frozen canal, just behind a large
          boathouse.  There is a faint chipping sound.  The ice breaks
          quietly, and the pieces are slid back.  A head appears, in a
          rubber drysuit hood.  The DIVER slips the regulator out of his
          mouth and turns slowly, scanning...  revealing:

          HARRY TASKER.  Our hero.  Harry floats with just his eyes above
          the surface, silent as a water snake, as a guard passes on a
          footpath nearby.

          After a few beats Harry slips out of his tanks and fins,
          letting them sink, and climbs the frozen ladder onto the dock.
          He moves like a ninja into the shadows of the boathouse.
          Opening a WATERPROOF BAG, he pulls out a walky talky.

                              HARRY
                    Honey, I'm home.


      5   INT. / EXT. SURVEILLANCE VAN, MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

          Meet Harry's partner, ALBERT "GIB" GIBSON, an overweight twenty-
          year-man with a lived in looking face.  Gib answers Harry via
          his headset.

                              GIB
                    Roger that. 
                         (he covers the mike and
                          turns)
                    Hey, Fize!  Get your butt in
                    here.  Harry's inside.

          Outside, FAST FAISIL, an Iranian-American, finishes making
          yellow snow and hurries back to the van.  They are parked on a
          winding mountain road a half-mile from the chateau, whose
          lights are visible through the trees.

          Faisil jumps in and goes to the eyepiece of a huge telephoto
          nightvision scope.  The eerie green image lurches as he sweeps
          the grounds, locating the boathouse.


      6   EXT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT

          Concealed in the shadows, Harry is shucking out of his drysuit.
          Underneath is he is wearing black tux pants, suspenders,
          cummerbund and a formal shirt.  He puts a tiny plug, like a
          hearing aid, deep in his ear canal.  A SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER.
          Very advanced.

                              HARRY
                    Switching to sub-vocal.  Gib, you
                    copy?

                              GIB (OVER)
                    It's Talkradio.  You're on the
                    air.

          Harry slips into his shoulder harness... holster on one side,
          containing his .45 auto Glock-22, and the transmitter pack for
          the ear-piece slung on the other.  He slips on a formal jacket,
          concealing the rig.  Then a final touch.  A little aftershave
          from a tiny plastic vial.

          Harry adjusts his bow-tie and strides confidently out of the
          shadows, crossing quickly to the main house.  He looks
          ultrasharp in his black tux with the white silk cummerbund and
          his hair slicked back.  He enters the main house through a back
          service entrance.


      7   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
                                
          Harry strides through the huge kitchen like he owns the place.
          The kitchen staff are scurrying around, too busy to really
          notice.  He finger-tastes a dish as he passes.

                              HARRY
                         (French/ subtitled)
                    This needs more garlic.

          He breezes through unchallenged, exiting into the--


      8   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          Here the party is in full swing.  Harry blends smoothly into
          the crowd of foreign dignitaries, businessman and minor mid-
          east nobility.  They are a high-octane mixture of new oil money
          and old European money, and run the spectrum from stodgy
          bankers to playboy arms dealers.

          Harry strolls amiably among the glittering woman, the cigar
          smoking men, casually snagging a glass of champagne and a
          canape from the passing waiters.  He nods to someone as if he
          knows them.  Greets another is quite fluent Arabic.  People in
          his wake look at each other like "Do you know him?"   They
          shrug, go on with their conversation.  Harry moves through the
          crowd.  Scanning.

                              HARRY
                    There's Daddy Petrobucks.

          HARRY'S POV - Through the crowd is sees JAMAL KHALED, the host
          of the party and owner of the chateau.  He is fat and animated,
          greeting guests with a flourish.  As Harry watches he warmly     *
          greets a beautiful WOMAN.  They become absorbed in a             *
          conversation.

          The woman glances up and sees Harry checking her out.  There is
          a frank moment of returned interest.  Then the crowd shifts,
          cutting off their view of each other.


      9   INT. STAIRCASE AND SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Harry makes his way up the grand staircase to the second floor.  *
          He slips through doors into the private area of the mansion.     *


     10   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT

          The doors open and Harry slips into the darkened library.  He    *
          crosses quickly to a window and opens it onto a terrace.         *


     11   EXT. BALCONIES - NIGHT                                           *

          Harry goes onto the terrace, and in a display of acrobatic       *
          prowess, he pulls himself up onto the third floor balcony        *
          directly above.  He lets himself into--                          *


     12   INT. KHALED'S OFFICE - NIGHT                                     *

          Khaled's office is ornately furnished.  Beautiful antiques
          glint in the moonlight coming in the French-doors.  Harry
          crosses to an immense desk and boots up the computer there.
          Bathed in the glow from the screen, he pulls a FLAT BOX,  about
          the size of a paperback,  from the back of his cummerbund.  He
          connects it quickly to the modem port in the back of the
          computer.

                              HARRY
                    Modem in place.  Transmitting...
                    now.

          He pushes a button and a green light comes on.


     13   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib and Faisil watch as their monitor screen lights with DATA
          from Khaled's private computer.

                              FAISIL
                    Affirmatory.  We are in.                               *

          Fast Faisil is a computer ace.  His fingers fly on the keyboard
          as he types rapid key commands.  We see familiar "windows
          appear".  The words are all in Arabic characters.

                              FAISIL
                    These are encrypted files, guys.
                    This is going to take me a few
                    minutes.


     14   OMITTED                                                          *


     15   INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   *

          TIGHT ON LIBRARY DOOR.  It opens a crack and a dental mirror     *
          comes out, looking around like a U-boat periscope.  Seeing the
          coast is clear Harry slips out.  But just as he is closing the
          door, a GUARD rounds the corner ten feet away.  Harry turns
          smoothly.  He smiles sheepishly and moves toward the guard.

                              HARRY
                         (In Arabic/ subtitled)
                    Where's the john around here?  I
                    have to take a major leak.

          The guard points warily down the corridor.  Harry nods and
          heads that way, back toward the party.


     16   INT. MAIN HALL/ STAIRCASE - NIGHT

          Harry comes down the staircase amid the glitter of the party.
          He is sipping champagne and looking bored.  He sees two
          security guys moving purposefully through the crowd toward the
          stairs, walkies in their hands.  He turns away as they pass him
          and pretends to study a large fragment of bas-relief... a
          temple frieze depicting a war chariot drawn by four horses.

          He senses someone next to him and turns.  It is the WOMAN.  She  *
          is captivatingly beautiful, and her gaze is piercing.

                              HARRY
                         (indicating the bas-
                          relief)
                    Magnificent, isn't it?

                              WOMAN
                    Yes.  Hi, I'm Juno Skinner.  I
                    thought I knew most of Khaled's
                    friends but I don't believe I
                    know you.

          Harry offers his hand to her.

                              HARRY
                    Renquist.  Harry Renquist.


     17   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib whirls to the screen displaying the mission database.  He
          scans rapidly for--

                              GIB
                    Skinner.  Skinner.  Come on...

          Gib finds the entry he's looking for.  Juno's picture and data
          appear on the screen.

                              GIB
                    Juno Skinner.  Art and
                    antiquities dealer, specializing
                    in ancient Persia.


     18   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          Harry turns back to the fragment of frieze.

                              HARRY
                    This is Persian, if I'm not
                    mistaken.

                              JUNO
                    Very good.  It's sixth century
                    B.C.  Do you like the period?

                              HARRY
                         (shameless)
                    I adore it.


     19   EXT. DOCK/ BOATHOUSE (NIGHTVISION POV) - NIGHT

          Seen through the starlight scope, we see one of the guards
          shining his light on the hole in the ice and then on Harry's
          footprints leading to the boathouse.  He calls to one of the
          other guards, who comes running over.


     20   INT. MANSION - NIGHT

          Harry, still with Juno, hears Gib in his ear:

                              GIB (VO)
                    Harry, we got a problem.  Guards
                    are swarming all over the dock.

          Harry glances up the stairs.  Khaled's SECURITY CHIEF is
          gesturing to several of his men, and speaking quickly into a
          walky.  Three SECURITY MEN come down the stairs, scanning the
          crowd.  Harry turns smoothly away from them and takes Juno's
          arm.

                              HARRY
                    Do you dance, Ms. Skinner?

          He steers her toward the dance floor.


     21   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib, listening, rolls his eyes.  He looks through the night-
          vision scope.  Guards are running around outside the chateau.
          Harry's stirred up the hornet's nest.  Faisil is still jamming
          at the keyboard.

                              FAISIL
                    Okay, files are unlocked.  I'm
                    in. I'm down, baby.  I got my
                    hand up her dress and I'm going
                    for the gold.  I'm--

                              GIB
                    Just copy the goddamn files!
                         (into his headset)
                    Harry, don't be stopping to smell
                    the roses, now.  You hear me,
                    Harry?


     22   INT. MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          Harry whirls Juno aggressively across the dancefloor.  She
          responds deftly.  They are well matched.  She parries each of
          his smooth moves with a flourish.  It is a contest of wills,
          and a surprised appraisal for each that the other is worthy.
          Juno is hot.  He bends her back at the waist, then snaps her
          up.  She twirls into the crook of his arm.  Their faces are
          inches apart.  Wow.  The music ends and she gives him a wry
          grin.

                              JUNO
                    Well.  And I thought this was
                    going to be just another bunch of
                    boring bankers and oil
                    billionaires.

                              GIB (OVER)
                    Harry, seconds count, buddy.
                    Ditch the bitch, let's go.

                              HARRY
                    Unfortunately, Juno, I have a
                    plane to catch.

          She slips a card out of a pocket in her otherwise sheer dress.
          She hands it to him, maintaining eye contact.  Serious sparks.

                              JUNO
                    Call me, if you'd like to see
                    some of my other pieces.

                              HARRY
                    I'd like that.


     23   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib can't believe this conversation.

                              GIB
                         (to Faisil)
                    Son of a bitch is with her two
                    minutes and she's ready to bear
                    his children
                         (to Harry)
                    What's your exit strategy Twinkle
                    Toes?


     24   EXT. CHATEAU/ FRONT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

          Harry nods to the security men at the door as he strides
          confidently through.  He goes down the steps to the broad
          terrace above the motor court.  Behind Harry, a GUARD lowers
          his walky talky and starts after him.

                              GUARD
                    May I see your invitation, sir?

          Without turning, Harry slips a small flat box out of his breast
          pocket.  A REMOTE DETONATOR.

                              HARRY                                        *
                    Here's my invitation.                                  *

          He pushes the button and--                                       *

          KABOOM!  The  second floor office windows blow out in a fiery
          explosion.  Using the diversion, Harry leaps off the terrace
          before the guard can open fire.


     25   INT. / EXT. VAN - NIGHT

          Gib sees the rising fireball a half-mile away.  He starts the
          van.

                              GIB
                    Aw, shit.  Here we go--


     26   EXT. CHATEAU AND GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Harry sprints across the snow-covered lawn, through the trees.
          Guards with automatic weapons run after him, firing.  The snow
          explodes around him with bullet hits.

          TWO DOBERMANS pelt toward Harry, leaping at him in perfect
          unison.  He waits... and knocks their heads together in mid-
          leap with a crack like a baseball bat.  The dogs drop to the
          snow, wobbling around like they're drunk.

          As Harry sprints on, ANOTHER DOBERMAN lunges out of the bushes
          ahead, leaping directly for his throat.  Harry grabs the dog
          and shot-puts him up into a tree without breaking stride.  Dog
          Fu.  The dog yelps and scrambles to hold onto an icy branch,
          looking down in amazement.


     27   EXT. PERIMETER WALL/ MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

          Harry leaps down on the outside of the wall, hitting a snow
          bank and sliding downhill.  He sprints down the gentle slope
          toward the highway.

          Harry looks back as TWO GUARDS ON SKIS come out of a guard
          station beside the main entrance.

          TRACKING WITH THE SKI-GUARDS, searching through the trees with
          lights.  They have lost Harry.  They stop.  A snowbank behind
          them EXPLODES as Harry leaps out.  He disables them both with
          vicious street-fighter moves.  Harry looks upslope as--

          A service gate opens in the perimeter wall and TEAMS OF
          SECURITY MEN in white snow-suits pour out, some on skis, some
          on SNOWMOBILES.  A HELICOPTER rises over the wall in a blast of
          swirling snow.  Its xenon lights rake through the trees,
          casting lurid wheeling shadows on the snow.

          ON Harry, snapping closed the ski boots he has stolen from one
          of the disabled guards.  He pops the boots quickly into the
          bindings and takes off downhill with one of the guard's FN FAL
          rifles slung across his back.

          The helicopter swoops downhill, its searchlight blazing through
          the forest.  Snowmobile headlights illuminate the ski-patrols
          zig-zagging among the trees.

          Harry slashes expertly downhill.  He cuts a distinguished
          figure in his black tux.  Automatic weapons fire rips through
          the trees from behind him.  Harry is going flat-out.  The xenon
          light hits him.  A 7.62 mm machine gun in the chopper rips the   *
          slope into white clouds around him.  Harry slashes, turns,
          weaving among the trees at breakneck speed.  A snowmobile is
          closing in, outflanking him.  He turns toward it, suddenly.
          Hits a mogul.  Uses the air to slash his skis right across the
          rider's face.  The snowmobile crashes and tumbles into the
          night.


     28   INT. / EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

          GIB'S VAN takes an icy turn in a hairy slide.

          INSIDE Gib is peering upslope, trying to see what's going on.
          All he can see are lights and gunfire.

                              GIB
                    Harry, what's your twenty?  I
                    need a position, buddy--

          Suddenly a skier in a black tux launches across the road from
          the slope above, RIGHT OVER THE VAN, and lands deftly
          downslope.

                              GIB
                    Uh... right!  I'll catch you on
                    the next bend.

          Behind the van, pursuing guards leap across the road.  Only
          about half can make the jump.  The rest crash horribly.  The
          helicopter thunders overhead.


     29   EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

          Harry sees the chopper start an attack run.  He comes out into
          the open, going straight downhill like a rocket.  The chopper
          gets suckered in...  trying to hit him, getting right down
          behind him... and suddenly-- Harry slides to a stop in an
          explosion of powder and whips up the rifle.  P-P-P-POW!  He
          rakes a burst across the windshield.  The startled pilot
          swerves and-- Suddenly two tall pine trees are right in front
          of him.

          K-WHACK!  The main-rotor blade snaps clean off and the chopper
          drops into the snow, plowing into a snowbank.  It slides right
          to the edge of a steep ridge and stops, teetering.

          Firing from a snowmobile, one of the guards puts a burst right
          across Harry's path.  Harry's skis are hit and he tumbles,
          comes out of it...  running down the hill like a juggernaut in
          his heavy boots.  He has lost the rifle somewhere in the snow.

          Harry takes cover behind the burning wreck of the downed
          chopper, which still has its engine running.  The ski patrol
          opens fire from upslope.  Rounds whacking against the disabled
          helicopter.

          Harry looks down the slope and gets an idea.  He jerks the
          unconscious pilot out and pushes on the fuselage, rocking it.
          It slips over the edge.  He leaps inside as it topples forward
          and slides down the slope.


     30   INT./ EXT. HELICOPTER - MOUNTAIN SLOPE - NIGHT

          Harry adds throttle and works the footpedals, using the tail-
          rotor to steer.  The chopper had snow-skids, and Harry is
          skiing the damn thing down the mountain.

          The copter is burning as it rockets down the slope on its        *
          skids.  Bullets are hitting the fuselage, and everything around
          it.  Skiers are wiping out, hitting trees.  A snowmobile hits
          a rock and flies spectacularly into a ravine.

                              GIB (OVER)
                    Harry!  Where are you!

                              HARRY
                    In the helicopter.


     31   INT./ EXT. VAN - MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

          Gib slides the van around a curve.

                              GIB
                         (deadpan, to Faisil)
                    He's in the helicopter.

          Big is scanning above for the chopper.  Then upslope he sees
          the burning fuselage skiing expertly among the trees.

          The chopper hits a jump and launches into the air-- It crashes
          through trees, still soaring and-- Gib looks up, screaming as--
          The chopper drops right toward him-- He hits the brakes and--
          BLAMMO!  It drops onto the road ten feet in front of the
          skidding van...  then slides over the edge and tumbles into a
          rocky canyon where is BLOWS UP!  The fireball lights up the
          night.

          Gib and Faisil jump out of the van.  They look downslope at the
          burning wreckage.

                              GIB
                    Harry?  HARRY?!

                              HARRY
                    What?

          Gib and Faisil spin to look behind them.  Harry is lodged in
          tree-branches hanging over the road.  Gib hands his MP-5K        *
          machine gun to Faisil and reaches up to Harry, who grabs his     *
          hand and pulls.  Harry tumbles down into the snowbank.  He
          stands, brushing snow off his tux, and clomps toward the van in
          his ski-boots.  He is completely unruffled.

                              HARRY
                    Let's go.  We can still make our
                    flight.

          As Faisil is getting into the van behind Harry, TWO GUARD TEAMS
          ON SNOWMOBILES roar around the bend behind them, fish-tailing
          on the ice.  Faisil OPENS FIRE.  One snowmobile swerves over
          the embankment.  The other pulls up broadside, and the guards
          duck behind it.  Gib floors it and the van roars down the
          mountain.  Faisil is still Ramboing on full-auto.

                              FAISIL
                    This is GREAT!!  I never get to
                    shoot!

                                                      CUT TO:


     32   EXT. DULLES AIRPORT - NIGHT

          An American Airlines 747 touches down amid puffs of tire smoke.


     33   EXT. SUBURBAN D.C. STREET - NIGHT

          A NON-DESCRIPT SEDAN pulls to the curb in a neighborhood of
          modest middle-income tract homes.  The street is deserted.  It
          is 4 A.M.  Gib is at the wheel, dropping Harry off at his
          house.


     34   INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

          Harry is emptying his pockets... passport, business cards etc.
          All documents under his name "Renquist".  He double checks that
          his pants and jacket pockets and empty.  Gib fastidiously puts
          the items into a plastic zip-lock.

                              HARRY
                    Empty.  Go.

          Gib starts handing him items from a briefcase.  This should all
          feel like a tired ceremony between them.

                              GIB
                    Harry Tasker wallet.  Harry
                    Tasker passport.  Plane ticket
                    stub, hotel receipt, Tasker.  Two
                    postcards of Lake Geneva.  House
                    keys.  Souvenir snowing Swiss
                    village.

          Gib snows him how is snows when you shake it up and turn it
          over.

                              HARRY
                    What's this for?

                              GIB
                    For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your
                    kid something.  You know.  The
                    dad thing.

                              HARRY
                    Got it.  Nice touch.  Okay, pick
                    me up at eight.  The de-brief is
                    at ten hundred.

          Harry opens the car door.

                              GIB
                    Hey, hey, hey... what are we
                    forgetting?

          Gib holds up Harry's gold wedding band.  Harry puts it on.

                              HARRY
                    What a team.  See you at eight.

                              GIB
                    Yep.  Sleep fast.


     35   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Harry slips inside.  He sets down his suitcase and walks
          quietly down the hall.  He pauses at a door with lurid labels
          and stickers plastered all over it (Toxic Waste,  STAY OUT!, IF
          IT'S TOO LOUD YOU'RE TOO OLD, etc.)

          Harry silently opens the door and looks in at his sleeping
          daughter, DANA.  She looks like an angel in the moonlight
          coming in the window.  In fact, she is a typical 14 year old
          girl, and therefore hardly an angel.  But to Harry she is
          unflawed.


     36   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Harry, undressed now, slips into bed next to... a lump in the
          covers which we presume to be a human being.  This is HELEN
          TASKER, Harry's wife of 15 years.  He kisses her on the cheek
          and she stirs.  She rolls toward him, giving him a sleepy hug
          and a kiss.

                              HELEN
                         (a drowsy murmur)
                    Hi, honey.  How was the flight?

                              HARRY
                    Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.

                              HELEN
                    Okay.

          As she drifts off, Harry puts his head on the pillow and stares
          at the ceiling.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


     37   INT. TASKER HOUSE - DAY (MORNING)

          TIGHT ON SWISS VILLAGE.  It is snowing.

          ON DANA,  reaching to the present Harry just gave her.

                              DANA
                    Hey, thanks dad.  I never had one
                    of these.

          They are in her room, which is your basic room from Hell.
          Pearl Jam posters, and an unbelievable clutter of junk,
          magazines and cheap jewelry.  Harry kisses her on the cheek, to
          which she submits dutifully.  He looks at his watch and heads
          for the door.

                              HARRY
                    You better hurry.  You're going
                    to be late for school.

          Harry hurries out and Dana considers the Swiss village a
          moment.

                              DANA
                    Really lame.

          She plonks is straight in the wastebasket.


     38   INT. HALLWAY/BEDROOM/ BATHROOM - DAY

          Harry strides down the hall, avoiding their small but            *
          incredibly ugly dog, GIZMO, who skitters past him going the      *
          other way.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, don't forget to feed Gizmo!                      *

          Harry crosses the bedroom, hurrying past Helen who is clearly
          rushing to get ready herself.  We get our first good look at
          Helen.  She is wearing a terrycloth robe as she picks out an
          outfit.  Her hair is wrapped in a towel.  To call her plain
          would be inaccurate.  She could be attractive if she put any
          effort into it, which doesn't occur to her.

                              HARRY
                    I'm late.

                              HELEN
                    Me too.

          They talk without looking at each other, the way people who
          have been together a long time do.

                              HELEN
                    How'd it go at the trade show?
                    You make all the other salesmen
                    jealous?

                              HARRY
                    Yeah.  You should have seen it.
                    We were the hit of the show with
                    the new model ordering system,
                    the one for the 680... how you
                    can write up an order and the
                    second the customer's name goes
                    into the computer, it starts
                    checking their credit, and if
                    they've ordered anything in the
                    past, and if they get a
                    discount...

          She is already tuning him out.  And it hits us:  SHE HAS NO
          IDEA WHAT HARRY REALLY DOES.

                              HELEN
                         (barely listening)
                    That's fabulous Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Yeah, it was wild.

          Harry glances at her, oblivious to him and brushing her teeth.
          He smiles.  The best lies are told with enthusiasm.


     39   INT. FRONT HALLWAY, LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Gib opens the door, knocks a bit, then strolls in like he lives
          there.  He is wearing dark Ray Bans, like he's doing a Roy
          Orbison impression.  Gizmo runs toward him, yapping, but Gib
          gives him the evil eye.

                              GIB
                    Come any closer I'll kill you.

          The dog backs up, whining plaintively.  Gib throws his jacket
          over the back of the couch and then, inexplicably, he takes out
          a pack of CAMELS and sets it on the mantelpiece.  He adjusts
          its position carefully.  Hmmmm.


     40   INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          Harry  and Helen maneuver around each other expertly.  She is
          doing her make-up.

                              HELEN
                    The plumber came yesterday.  He
                    said they have to dig under the
                    slab or something and it's going
                    to be six hundred dollars to fix.

          Harry is not really paying attention as he ties his tie in
          front of the mirror.  His mind is elsewhere.  He couldn't care
          less about there domestic problems.

                              HARRY
                    Uh huh.  Okay.

                              HELEN
                    It's not okay.  It's extortion.

                              HARRY
                    What did you tell him?

                              HELEN
                    I slept with him and he knocked
                    off a hundred bucks.

                              HARRY
                    Good thinking, honey.

          Harry kisses her on the cheek and exits.


     41   INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Gib enters and pours two cups of coffee.  Dana is drinking
          orange juice from the bottle at the fridge.

                              GIB
                    Hi, kid.

                              DANA
                    Hey, Gib.  What up?

          She EXITS, eating an uncooked pop-tart.  Harry comes in a
          second later and Gib hands him his coffee.

                              HARRY
                    Thanks dear.

                              GIB
                    Here, check these out.

          Gib hands Harry the glasses.  Harry studies them, seeing the
          VIRTUAL VIDEO DISPLAY inside the left lens of the Ray Bans.
          Harry glances down the hall, making sure no-one is looking,
          then he puts them on.

          HARRY'S POV - INSIDE THE GLASSES - A black and white video
          image of his own living room.

                              GIB
                    The CCD camera and transmitter
                    and inside a pack of smokes.
                    Slick little unit, huh?

          IN POV we see Dana enter the living room.  She looks around
          carefuly, then quickly lifts Gib's jacket and slips out his
          wallet.  She palms two twenties in the blink of an eye and puts
          the wallet back.  Pro moves.

                              HARRY
                    Son of a bitch!

                              GIB
                    What?

          Harry whips off the glasses and charges out of the kitchen.
          Gib goes after him.


     42   EXT. HOUSE - DAY

          Dana comes out the front door, letting it slam behind her, and
          runs to her boyfriend, TRENT, who is waiting for her in the
          driveway on his idling YAMAHA.  Trent is 16, dressed in grunge-
          rock style, trying to look tough.  Harry comes out the front
          door as Trent revs the motor.

                              HARRY
                    Dana!!

          She waves from the back of the bike as Trent pops the clutch
          and they shoot down the driveway.

                              DANA
                         (yelling over the
                          engine)
                    Can't stop, I'm late.  Bye, Dad!


     43   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR/ STREETS OF WASHINGTON - DAY

          They are driving through D.C.  Harry is still shocked by his     *
          daughter's behavior.

                              GIB
                    Kids.  Ten seconds of joy.
                    Thirty years of misery.

                              HARRY
                    She knows not to steal.  I've
                    taught her better than that.

                              GIB
                    Yeah, but you're not her parents,
                    anymore, you and Helen.  Her
                    parents are Axl Rose and Madonna.
                    The five minutes you spend a day
                    with her can't compete with that
                    kind of constant bombardment.
                    You're outgunned, amigo.

          Gib and Harry turn onto Pennsylvania Avenue, heading toward
          Lafayette Square.  Capital Hill is behind them.


     44   INT. TEKTEL OFFICES - DAY                                        *

          Harry and Gib come out of an elevator on the 12th floor.         *
          Behind the receptionist is a burnished metal sign which reads    *
          TEKTEL SYSTEMS.  They cross a open floor of cubicle spaces.      *
          There is the hum of activity everywhere.  A normal day at a      *
          normal business.                                                 *

                              SECRETARY                                    *
                    Morning, Mr. Tasker.                                   *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    Morning, Charlene.

                              GIB
                    See, kids now are ten years ahead                      *
                    of where we were at the same age.
                    You probably think she's still a
                    virgin--

                              HARRY
                    Don't be ridiculous.  She's only --
                    how old is she?

                              GIB
                    Fourteen, Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Right.  She's only fourteen.

          They go into a corridor.                                         *

                              GIB
                    Uh huh.  And her little hormones
                    are going like a fire alarm.  I                        *
                    say even money that physicist on                       *
                    the bike is boinkin' her.                              *

                              HARRY
                    No way.  Not Dana.

          They stop at a door, like any other along the corridor.  It is   *
          blank.                                                           *

                              GIB
                    Okay.  Okay.  De-nail ain't just
                    a river in Egypt.  She's probably
                    stealing the money to pay for an
                    abortion.

                              HARRY
                    Will you just open the door!                           *

          Gib touches a plastic card to an unmarked spot just above the    *
          doorknob.  There is the CLUNK of a SOLENOID LOCK.                *

                              GIB
                    Or drugs.

     46   INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

          They enter a long corridor, which is featureless except for      *
          video surveillance cameras.  They walk along the silence for a   *
          moment, then .  .  .                                             *

                              GIB
                    Twenty here, fifty there... I
                    figured my wife's boyfriend was
                    taking it.

                              HARRY
                    I thought you moved out.

                              GIB
                    Well .  .  .  I moved back in.
                    My lawyer said it would give me
                    a better claim on the house in
                    the property settlement.  Don't
                    change the subject... you owe me
                    two hundred bucks.

          They approach another door, with a (bulletproof) glass window    *
          in it.  Beyond is a brightly lit room, with a woman sitting at
          a desk... and nothing else.  Gib presses a buzzer.


     47   INT. OUTER SECURITY ROOM - DAY

          JANICE sits at the non-descript desk like a receptionist... but
          she is a highly trained security specialist.  She is also hefty
          through the shoulders, aggressively unattractive and utterly
          humorless.  She watches them on a monitor screen as they stand
          outside the door.  Harry and Gib appear as living X-Ray images.
          Their weapons are visible in their shoulder harnesses.  Janice
          puts one hand automatically on the butt of a .45 tucked in a
          holster riveted beneath her desk.  She buzzes Harry and Gib in
          with the other.

                              JANICE
                    Gentlemen, please idenitify
                    yourselves to the scanner.

          Harry and Gib step up to the combination retinal-thumbprint-
          voice scanners.  Harry presses his thumb against a black-glass
          plate for laser scan, and looks into the eye-piece of the
          retinal scanner.

                              HARRY
                    Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two
                    four.

                              GIB
                    Albert Gibson.  Three four nine
                    nine one.

          Their clearance appears on a monitor on Janice's desk.

                              JANICE
                    Thank you.  You are cleared.

          She stands to give them plastic I.D.  badges which they hang
          around their necks.

                              GIB
                    Janice, how many years have you
                    been buzzing us in?

                              JANICE
                    Ten, Mr. Gibson.

                              GIB
                    And you still reach for your
                    piece every time.

                              JANICE
                    Yes sir.

                              GIB
                    God!  You have no idea how much
                    that turns me on.  I've never had
                    the courage to say this before
                    but... I love you, Janice.

                              JANICE
                    Yes, sir.

          He kisses her wetly on the cheek as he goes by.  She does not
          react is any discernible way.

          They pass through a heavy stainless steel door which opens
          automatically.  Beyond is a kind of airlock... a SALLY PORT.
          Behind a lexan shield are TWO GUARDS armed with MP5s.  They nod
          but do not speak at Harry and Gib pass them.

                              HARRY
                    You better watch it.  She might
                    file on you for sexual
                    harassment.

                              GIB
                    In her dreams.


     48   INT. OMEGA SECTOR INNER SANCTUM - DAY

          Gib and Harry pass through the inner door of the sally port
          into a large austere atrium.

          ANGLE FROM ABOVE as they cross.  A huge graphic logo covers the
          floor.  Across the center is says OMEGA SECTOR.  In smaller
          print, around the perimeter, is the motto: "THE LAST LINE OF
          DEFENSE".

          They enter a high-tech office space.  It is a maze of glass
          partitions surrounding a central floor-space of cubicles.
          There is a hushed quality here.  People do not joke.  They do
          not hurry.  There are a lot of computer screens displaying
          information from around the world.  It looks like a combination
          of NASA mission control and FBI headquarters.

          Fast Faisil greets them, yawning, as they pass his partitioned
          cubicle.

                              HARRY
                    Come on, Fize.  We're late for
                    our butt-grinding.

          Faisil gulps his coffee and hurries after them.


     49   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          A dark and severe conference room, with large-screen computer
          displays at one end.  Glowering at one end of the long,
          polished table, is SPENCER TRILBY, the chief of Omega Sector.
          Visualize a cross between Colin Powel and J.  Edgar Hoover.

                              TRILBY
                    Jesus, Harry!  You guys really
                    screwed the pooch last night.
                    Please tell me how I can look at
                    this, that it's not a total pooch-
                    screw.

                              HARRY
                    Total is a strong word--

                              GIB
                    There are degrees of totality.

                              FAISIL
                    It's a scale really, with
                    "perfect mission" on one end and
                    "total pooch-screw" on the other
                    and we're more about here--

                              TRILBY
                    Faisil.  You're new on Harry's
                    team, aren't you?

                              FAISIL
                    Yes.

                              TRILBY
                    So what makes you think that the
                    slack I cut him in any way
                    translates to you?!

                              FAISIL
                    Sorry, sir.  Uh... here's what we
                    got.

          He hits a button and a photo of Khaled fills a wall-screen.

                              FAISIL
                    Jamal Khaled.  We think he's
                    dirty so we raid his financial
                    files...  Check it out...

          Faisil hits some buttons and a second screen lights up with the
          data for their raid.

                              FAISIL
                    One hundred million in wire
                    transfers from the COMMERCE BANK                       *

                    activities.  Something big is                          *

                    So far this is not blowing my
                    skirt up, gentleman.  Do you have                      *

     50   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          It is the interior of a huge law office.  Helen works there as
          a paralegal.  She is going to the break room for coffee with
          her friend, ALLISON, a secretary.  Allison is black, younger
          then Helen, and still single.

                              HELEN
                    I mean, it's not like he's saving
                    the world or anything.  He's a
                    sales rep for Chrissakes.
                    Whenever I can't get to sleep I
                    ask him to tell me about his day.
                    Six seconds and I'm out.  But he
                    acts like he's curing cancer or
                    something.

                              ALLISON
                    So I guess you didn't get away                         *
                    for the weekend after all?                             *

                              HELEN
                    Are you kidding?  Harry had to go
                    out of town.

                              ALLISON
                    I'm shocked.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah.  You know Harry.

          Helen's nerdy boss BRAD, comes up behind her, scowling.

                              BRAD
                    Helen, have you pulled those
                    files yet?  I need them by lunch.

                              HELEN
                    I won't let you down, Brad.

          Brad leaves.

                              HELEN                                        *
                         (under her breath)                                *
                    You little pencil-neck.                                *
                         (to Allison)                                      *
                    So... yo... sista!  D'you do                           *
                    anything interesting?

                              ALLISON                                      *
                    Oh... Eric and I drove up to this                      *
                    little romantic inn, and...                            *
                    pretty much lapped champagne out
                    of each other's navels for two
                    days.

                              HELEN
                    You bitch.

                              ALLISON
                    Girlfriend, you got a man.  You                        *
                    just have to take control .  .
                    .  set up the right mood.                              *

                              HELEN
                    Harry only has two moods: busy...                      *
                    and asleep.

                              ALLISON
                    Then you better do something to                        *
                    jumpstart that man's motor.  You
                    know... wake up the sleeping
                    giant of his passion.

          They both crack up at that one.


     51   INT. OMEGA SECTOR (DATA CENTER) - DAY                            *

          Harry meets up with Gib and Faisil coming from the ANALYSIS      *
          Department.                                                      *

                              HARRY
                    What'ya got?

          The following will play as they wind their way through the rows  *
          of data-analysis workstations.

                              FAISIL
                         (handing Harry a
                          printout)
                    Here, check this out--

                              GIB
                    It's a two million dollar
                    disbursement from Khaled to...
                    Juno Skinner.
                         (Harry raises an
                          eyebrow)
                    Uh huh.  The babe at the party.                        *

                              HARRY
                    It doesn't mean anything.  She
                    buys antiquities for Khaled.

                              GIB
                    Nope.  The art buys are in a
                    separate ledger.

                              FAISIL
                    And this is a little above market-                     *
                    rate for the horizontal bop, even                      *
                    for a total biscuit like her.

                              HARRY
                    Alright, I want a complete workup
                    on her.  Do we know where she is?

                              FAISIL
                    Uh huh.  Right here in river
                    city.

                              HARRY
                    You're kidding.

                              FAISIL
                    She lives in Rome, but she does
                    stuff here the Smithsonian and
                    has a lot of diplomatic
                    connections, so she has offices                        *
                    here.                                                  *

          Gib starts tangoing with an imaginary partner.

                              GIB
                    Sounds like a job for a
                    specialist.


     52   INT. TASKER HOUSE/ KITCHEN - NIGHT (10PM)

          DING!  Harry opens the microwave as his dinner finishes re-
          heating.  He sits down alone at the kitchen table and pulls the
          Saran-wrap off the plate.  Another solo supper two hours late.
          His motions are so automatic we gather that this is the rule,
          not the exception.  Helen comes in from the living room,
          holding the suspense novel she is reading.

                              HELEN
                    I need you to talk to Dana.  The
                    vice principle called and she cut
                    class again this afternoon.

                              HARRY
                    I'll handle it.

          Harry picks up his porkchop and goes out the back door.


     53   EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

          A basketball hoop is bolted to the garage and Dana is shooting
          baskets in the driveway.  Moths orbit the outside floodlights.
          She sinks one, dribbled back to the foul line.  Harry comes up
          behind her and lifts the ball out of her hands as she stands
          poised to shoot.  She turns.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, Mr. Hardy called.  Why
                    weren't you in class today?

                              DANA
                    He lies!  I was there!  I was in
                    the nurse's office, cause I had
                    a headache.

                              HARRY
                    You seem fine now.

                              DANA
                    Great!  You're going to believe
                    that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over
                    your own daughter.

                              HARRY
                    I'm not sure what to believe
                    anymore, young lady.  You never
                    used to lie to me.  But lately
                    you don't seem to know the
                    difference between right and
                    wrong.

          Dana studies something really fascinating at the end of a
          fingernail.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, are you listening to me?

                              DANA
                    Yeah, Dad.

                              HARRY
                    You know you can always talk to
                    me.  Right?  Whatever is going on
                    in your life, your mom and I'll
                    understand.

                              DANA
                    Okay, Dad.

                              HARRY
                    You'd tell me if there was
                    something wrong, wouldn't you,
                    pumpkin?

                              DANA
                    I'm not a pumpkin!  Okay?!!  Do
                    I look even remotely like a
                    pumpkin?! I'm not a muffin, or a
                    cupcake or a honeybear either!
                    And you don't understand anything
                    Dad...

          Dana runs into the house, agent.  Hold on Harry, superagent,     *
          unable to comprehend the mind of a 14-year-old.  He looks up to  *
          see Helen at the backdoor.                                       *

                              HELEN                                        *
                         (macho voice)

     55   INT. / EXT. LIMO - DAY (NEXT MORNING)

          A BLACK LIMO cruises through a morning fill of bright promise.

          INSIDE, Gib is at the wheel in a chauffeur's uniform.  He talks
          to Harry, riding in the back, without turning.

                              GIB
                    It's all set up...  ghost phones
                    and fax, all the usual stuff.
                    You have a suite at the Marquis
                    Hotel under Renquist.  Okay,
                    reality check.  Go.

                              HARRY
                    Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--


     56   INT. JUNO'S OFFICES - DAY

                              HARRY
                    --corporate art consulting
                    company in San Francisco.  I have
                    an appointment with Ms. Skinner--

          Harry is extending his business card to the receptionist as
          Juno breezes into the lobby from a corridor.  She is dressed
          sharply and looks as stunning as Harry remembers.

                              JUNO
                    Harry!  I thought I might see you
                    again.  I just didn't  except you
                    to call so soon.

          Juno lingers a second or so long on the handshake.

                              HARRY
                    Well, what's the point of
                    waiting?

                              JUNO
                    I agree.

          There is definitely unholy magnetism here.  She indicates for
          Harry to walk with her and leads him through the suite of
          offices.  There are mounted fragments of ancient sculpture in
          niches on either side, and beautifully restored mosaics and
          tablets of hieroglyphics mounted on the walls.

                              JUNO
                    So your clients want something
                    for the lobby of their new
                    corporate headquarters?

                              HARRY
                    That's right.  They want
                    something...  dramatic.  I spoke
                    to a number of people who said
                    you're the one to see.

          Juno leads Harry through a door into a large warehouse area.
          There is a bustle of activity as workmen unpack crates.  An
          overhead crane is used to move huge stone pieces.  There are
          massive columns, and statues two stories high.  Even the entire
          facade of a tomb.

                              JUNO
                    So what did these... people...
                    say about me exactly?

          They stroll amongst the statues, as coveralled workmen move
          around them with tools, scaffolding, pneumatic equipment.  Most
          of the workers are middle-eastern.

                              HARRY
                    Let's see... that you can read
                    ancient Sanskrit without having
                    to sound out the words.  And that
                    other dealers and archeologists
                    don't like you much.

                              JUNO
                    Those wimps.  It's because I use                       *
                    my diplomatic contacts to export
                    cultural treasures from countries
                    which tell them to take a hike.
                         (yelling in Arabic to
                          two workmen)
                    I told you to move those crates
                    an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's
                    get going.

          We realize that A WORKMAN is watching them intently from
          nearby.  He is an intense looking MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN in his mid-
          thirties.

                              JUNO
                    You see, a lot of these pieces
                    are from ancient Persia.
                    Unfortunately, ancient Persia is

                    most popular places lately.  So
                    I've had to become an expert in
                    international diplomacy.

          Juno stops and looks at Harry.  Her smile indicates the
          possibility of more than just business.

                              JUNO
                    Well, do you see anything you
                    like, Mr. Renquist?

                                                      CUT TO:


     57   INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

          Harry, Gib and Fast Faisil are in a luxury suite at the MARQUIS
          HOTEL.  It is a corner suite, with a spectacular view of the
          city.  Faisil is routinely sweeping the room for bugs with an
          electronic DETECTOR.

                              HARRY
                    She's importing stuff from all
                    over the mid-east.

                              GIB
                    She could be moving money, guns.
                    Anything.

                              FAISIL
                    And the second you left there, we
                    started getting calls to the                           *
                    ghost numbers.  They were
                    checking out the Renquist front.

                              HARRY
                    Okay.  Let's step up the
                    surveillance on her.  Put on two
                    more guys.


     58   INT. JUNO'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

          WE FOLLOW the WORKMAN we saw watching Harry earlier.  He
          catches up with Juno, who is going through the doors to the
          office area.  His name is MALIK.

                              MALIK
                    Ms. Skinner?  Can I speak to you
                    for a moment please, in your
                    office?

          His manner is self-effacing.  Humble.  He doesn't meet her
          gaze.  She nods and they go into the private office.


     59   INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY

          MALIK comes in behind her and closes the door.  The moment they
          are away from public observation, his manner changes.  His
          humble posture straightens and his eyes flash intensely as he
          approaches her.  Without warning he SLAPS HER HARD ACROSS THE
          FACE.

                              MALIK
                    You stupid undisciplined bitch!

          Her jaw clenches but her reaction is surprisingly submissive.

                              JUNO
                    It's a good thing you pay me
                    well.

                              MALIK
                    Do you realize that there are
                    surveillance teams watching this
                    place right now?  Your phones are
                    almost certainly tapped.  And you
                    are busy laughing and flirting
                    like a whore with this Renquist,
                    who may be a--

                              JUNO
                    No.  He checked out okay--

          Malik slaps her again.

                              MALIK
                    That is for interrupting.
                         (He backhands her)
                    And that is for being wrong.  We
                    do not tolerate mistakes.

          Juno bites her lip.

                              JUNO
                    What do you want me to do?

                              MALIK
                    Find out who this Renquist it.

                              JUNO
                    How?

                              MALIK
                    Use the gifts that Allah has
                    given you.

          The phone rings on the desk of CHARLENE, Harry's secretary at    *
          Tektel Systems, the permanent front-company for Omega Sector.    *

                              SECRETARY
                    Hello, Tektel Systems.  Mr.                            *
                    Tasker's office.


     61   INT. TASKER HOUSE - DUSK

          Helen is in the kitchen, showing Dana how to put icing on a
          large birthday cake.

                              HELEN
                    Hi, Charlene?  It's Helen.  Is he
                    there?


     62   INT. TEKTEL OFFICES - DUSK

          Charlene doesn't hesitate a microsecond.

                              CHARLENE
                    Harry's in a sales meeting, Mrs.
                    Tasker.  Let me try him in there.
                    Hold please.

          She punches a key, engaging a digital scrambler and connecting
          to--


     63   INT. SUITE AT THE MARQUIS - DUSK

          A PHONE RINGS.  Gib opens his briefcase and looks at the
          console of the cellular scrambler-phone inside.  The display
          reads TEKTEL/CALLER ID POS -- TASKER, HELEN.                     *

                              GIB
                    It's Helen.                                            *

          Harry picks up the phone.  INTERCUT THE FOLLOWING WITH HELEN.

                              HARRY
                    Hi honey.  What's going on?                            *

                              HELEN
                    Sorry to bother you in a meeting,
                    but you have to promise me that                        *
                    you'll be home at eight.  I don't                      *
                    want Dana and I sitting here by
                    ourselves like we were last year.
                    You promise?

                              HARRY
                         (laughing)
                    Baby, I said I'd be there.
                    Really.  Trust me.
                         (the room phone RINGS)
                    Gotta go, honey.  Bye bye.

          RING.  Harry raises an eyebrow as he answers.

                              HARRY
                    Hello?  Oh, Juno, hi.
                         (pause)
                    Well sure.  I can be there in
                    twenty minutes.

          Harry hangs up.  Gib, checking his watch, has a look like he's
          got a bad gas pain.

                              HARRY
                    What?  It's on the way.  She says
                    she's got something for me.

                              GIB
                    Yeah, right.


     64   INT. JUNO'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

          A WORKMAN guides Harry through the maze of statuary.  He points
          toward the back of the warehouse and then leaves.  Harry is
          left alone in the vast space.

          Only a few lights are on, rendering the place somewhat Gothic.
          Harry strolls in the direction the workman pointed.  Ahead of
          him, is the huge facade of a royal tomb.  There is a flickering
          light inside.  A shadow moves across the wall in the entryway.

                              HARRY
                    Hello?

          He enters the stone doorway of the tomb.  FOLLOWING HARRY as he
          steps into the inner chamber.  There is an oil-lamp burning on
          a stone sarcophagus, the only light.  The room appears empty.

          REVERSE ON HARRY.  Behind him a figure emerges from a shadowed
          alcove.  It is Juno.  She looks ethereal in the strange light.

                              JUNO
                    Hello, Harry.

          Harry whips around, startled.

                              JUNO
                    Do you like my tomb?  The museum                       *
                    financing fell out, so I thought                       *
                    your clients might be interested.

                              HARRY
                    It's certainly... dramatic.

                              JUNO
                    Especially in this light.  This
                    is the only light they had then,                       *
                    so I like to study it this way.
                    I love this place.  I love all
                    ruins.

                              HARRY
                    Is that why you got into this
                    business?

          Juno turns to him in the flickering half-light.  She moves
          closer.  Her eyes seem to glitter.

                              JUNO
                    I've always been a collector at
                    heart.  When I see something I
                    want, I have to have it.

                              HARRY
                    And you have a reputation as
                    someone who gets what she wants.

          She is very close to him.  Her eyes seem to glitter in the
          light from the oil lamp.  She is unbelievably beautiful.

                              JUNO
                    Yes, I do.


     65   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib is sitting in the car, in the shadows, up the street...
          with his earphone in place.  Listening.

                              GIB
                    Harry, this is your conscience
                    speaking...


     66   INT. TOMB - NIGHT

          Juno picks up the lamp and walks along the wall, holding it up
          so that the flickering shadows seem to bring the bas-relief
          figures to life.  Stone faces shift and change, stone eyes
          move.

                              JUNO
                    Look at this.  People who dies
                    twenty centuries ago.

          Juno presses her cheek against the cold stone.  She runs her
          fingers slowly across the figures.  It is strange and erotic.

                              JUNO
                    They breathed and loved and wept,
                    just like us.  And now their
                    ideals, their religions, their
                    social orders... are gone like
                    mist.  What did any of it matter?

          She crosses to Harry.

                              JUNO
                    I only hope they lived well.
                    That they got what they wanted.

          She puts her hands on him and pulls herself close.  It is a
          hypnotic moment.

                              JUNO
                    Getting what you want is the only
                    important thing.

          She kisses him, very lightly, with infinite sensuality.


     67   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

                              GIB
                    Harry?  Listen to the following
                    code word.  Helen.  H-E-L-E-N.
                    Now, do you want me to I beep
                    you?


     68   INT. TOMB - NIGHT

          Harry breaks the kiss... slowly pulling back.

                              HARRY
                    Yes.

                              JUNO
                    Yes what?

                              HARRY
                    Uh, yes, it is important.

          Juno is moving in for a more passionate lip-lock when-- BEEP
          BEEP BEEP!!  Harry pulls his beeper off his hip and looks at
          it.  The moment is spoiled.

                              HARRY
                    Uh, it looks like I have to run.
                    I'll call you tomorrow.  Your
                    proposal is very interesting.


     69   INT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib lets out a big exhale of relief.  He looks at his watch.


     70   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Helen and Dana are sitting expectantly at the dining room
          table.  There is a big cake, and presents piled on the buffet.
          The food is getting cold.  Helen looks at her watch.

                              DANA
                    See.


     71   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Harry is changing clothes, getting ready to be Harry Tasker      *
          again, as Gib drives through evening traffic.  Gib keeps
          checking the rearview.

                              GIB
                    We have a friend.  Five cars
                    back, inside lane.  They've been                       *
                    on us since we left Juno's.                            *

          Harry adjusts the passenger side mirror.

                              HARRY
                    Station wagon?

                              GIB
                    Uh huh.  Want me to lose them?

                              HARRY                                        *
                    No.  We need this lead.                                *
                         (into his Rover)                                  *
                    Unit Seven.                                            *

                              UNIT SEVEN (FAISIL)                          *
                    Seven here.

                              HARRY
                         (into Rover)                                      *
                    I need you at the Georgetown mall                      *
                    in three minutes.                                      *

                              SEVEN
                    Copy that.  We're rolling.

                              GIB
                    Helen's going to be pissed.

                              HARRY
                    See, that's the problem with
                    terrorists.  They're really
                    inconsiderate when it comes to
                    people's schedules.


     72   INT.  STATION WAGON - NIGHT

          There are three men in the car.  YUSIF and MAHMOUD are in the
          front, with Mahmoud driving.  In the back, shadowed, we can
          just make out ABU MALIK.  Yusif is massively built, with a body
          like a beer-keg.  Mahmoud is skinny and intense.

     74   INT./EXT. GIB'S CAR - MALL - NIGHT

          Harry puts his SUB-VOCAL TRANSCEIVER into his ear canal.

                              HARRY
                    Test two three.
                         (Gib nods, receiving)
                    Pull over here.

          Gib pulls the car to the curb near the mall entrance.  Half a
          block behind them the station wagon does the same.  Harry slips
          on the virtual-image sunglasses and gets out of the car.


     75   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          Harry pauses on the sidewalk a moment to light a cigarette.  He
          coughs slightly.

                              GIB
                         (in his ear)
                    You don't smoke, dickhead.

          Harry lets his hand drop to his side, holding the pack of
          cigarettes casually.  He turns his hand.  The tiny lens in the
          cigarette pack glints.

          POV VIDEO SCREEN --inside the left lens of the glasses.  The
          camera in the cigarette pack reveals Yusif and Mahmoud getting
          out of their cars, crossing the street half a block away.

          HARRY strolls into the mall.  It is an open promenade design,
          with a moderate crowd of shoppers and movie-goers.  Harry
          watches in the glasses as Mahmoud and Yusif slip through the
          crowd behind him.

                              GIB (VO)
                    What's the plan?

                              HARRY
                         (apparently mumbling to
                          himself)
                    Gonna try to get a closer shot of                      *
                    Beavis & Butthead.                                     *


     76   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib looks in the rearview, studying the car behind him.

                              GIB
                    There's another guy, still in the
                    car.

                              HARRY
                         (on radio)
                    Stay on him.

          All Gib can see is a silhouette in the car.  A soft cherry
          glow, the tip of a cigarette in the dark.  No features.


     77   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          Harry turns off the main concourse, into a narrower walkway
          between shops.  In the video-glasses he watches Yusif and
          Mahmoud, who have split up to look less conspicuous, as they
          track him through the pedestrian traffic.


     78   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib in on the cellular phone.

                              GIB
                    Helen?  Hi, it's Gib.  Harry
                    remembered something he left at
                    the office.  You know Harry.

          As he is talking he sees that a bus has blocked his view of the
          station wagon.


     79   INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          She sighs fatalistically.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah, Gib.  I know Harry.

          Helen hangs up the phone just as Dana strides through the room,
          putting on a jacket and heading for the front door.

                              HELEN
                    Where are you going?

                              DANA
                    Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough
                    about us to be here on his
                    birthday, then why should I care?
                    I'm going to a movie.

                              HELEN
                    No you're not.  You're going to
                    stay here until your father gets
                    home and have cake!

                              DANA
                    Mom, wake up!  Dad barely knows
                    we exist.

          We see the hurt in her eyes.  She doesn't hate her father.  She
          just misses him.

                              HELEN
                    That's not true, honey--

                              DANA
                    It is true!  He doesn't know
                    anything about me.  He still
                    thinks I'm like ten years old or
                    something.  As long as I just
                    smile and say yes to whatever he
                    says, like his good little
                    fantasy daughter, he thinks
                    everything's fine.  But it's not
                    fine.  Nothing's fine.

          Dana runs out the kitchen by the other door.  Helen runs
          after her.

                              HELEN
                    Dana!  Come back here!

          The slamming door is her answer.


     80   EXT. MALL - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Yusif sees Harry, up ahead, enter a public restroom.  He
          signals Mahmoud with his eyes and the two of them close in on
          the restroom.


     81   INT. / EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib hangs up the car-phone.  Ten the bus blocking his view
          finally pulls away and Gib see that the station wagon is
          empty.  No silhouette.

                              GIB
                    Oh shit.
                         (into his headset)
                    Harry, I lost the third guy.
                    Harry?


     82   INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT

          Harry can't answer because Mahmoud just entered the room behind
          him.  Harry is at one of the urinals, apparently taking a leak.
          Mahmoud goes to the mirror.  Starts combing his hair.  He
          doesn't much notice the pack of Camels sitting on the counter
          nearby.  Harry is whistling.  Shaking himself.

          HARRY'S POV - In the video glasses Harry sees himself and
          Mahmoud.  Yusif comes into the restroom, seemingly ignoring
          both Harry and Mahmoud, as if heading for the stalls.  As he
          passes behind Harry he reaches into his coat--

          Harry spins lightning fast.  He knocks away the SILENCED PISTOL
          aimed at the back of his head with a sweeping block, capturing
          Yusif's arm in an arm-lock.  The shot goes wide, shattering a
          urinal.

          Harry slams his palm into Yusif's face like a piledriver, and
          spins him against the steel stalls.  The silenced pistol goes
          skittering across the floor.

          Mahmoud whips a pistol out of his waistband.  Still holding the
          bear-like Yusif, Harry draws his Glock so fast we can barely
          see him move.  BLAM!  BLAM!  BLAM!  Three .45 slugs  go through
          Mahmoud's chest, shattering the mirror behind him.  He flops on
          his butt, slumping against the wall.

          Yusif, who is easily Harry's size, bellows and grabs his gun
          arm.  They smash against the walls, struggling for the gun.
          Yusif, locked to Harry, hurls him against the stalls.  They hit
          a locked door, which pops open, banging inward.

          Yusif drives Harry to the floor.  Harry's head is between the
          shoes of an OLD GUY sitting on the can, who looks down
          uncomprehendingly at him.

          Yusif slams Harry's gun hand repeatedly against the doorframe
          of the stall.  He twists Harry's wrist brutally.  He even
          pounds against Harry's hand with his knee.  The old guy winces.
          That's got to hurt.  Harry cries out in pain and the gun drops.
          Yusif reaches for it, but Harry kicks it under the stalls.

          He punches Yusif in the face, driving him back.  They grapple,
          spinning.  Harry drives Yusif's head into the counter.  Then he
          elbows him in the throat and they crash together on the filthy
          floor.  Harry grabs Yusif's hair and pounds his face repeatedly
          against the rim of a urinal.  In case you haven't noticed, this
          is a messy, nasty fight.  Survival is like that.

          Yusif sags into submission.  Harry pulls a nylon zip-strip out
          of his pocket and uses it like hand-cuffs, securing Yusif's
          wrists.


     83   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          Gib is running full out, drawing his gun.  He has one finger
          jammed in his ear.  His gut is doing the rumba as he runs.

                              GIB
                    Harry?  Harry, you copy?!  Shit!


     84   INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT

          Harry is pulling Yusif to his feet when the door bangs open
          behind him.  He turns, thinking it is Gib.  It's not.  Malik
          raises a FULL-AUTO BERETTA 92-F and opens fire.  Harry spins
          Yusif between him and the machine pistol.  Yusif's beer-keg
          body stops the spray of 9mm slugs form hitting Harry long
          enough for him to dive into a stall.

          Malik hoses the room with the Beretta.  The metal stalls are
          riddled with hits.

          HARRY is in the stall with the old guy, who's just sitting
          there.  The walls of the stall are pimpling with the hits on
          the far side.  Harry reaches under the stall, retrieving his
          Glock.

          MALIK goes empty.  Harry hears that and pops out, cranking off
          rounds--

          Malik is a blur going out the door, as Harry's shots shatter
          tiles on the doorframe.  Then silence.

                              HARRY
                         (to the old guy)
                    Sorry.


     85   EXT. MALL - NIGHT

          MOVING WITH MALIK, who backs rapidly away from the restroom,
          reloading.

                              GIB (OFF)
                    FREEZE!!!

          Malik spins to see Gib nearby, going into a firing stance
          behind a light-standard.  The terrorist doesn't hesitate.  His
          Beretta ROARS at 900 rounds per minute.

          Gib tries to hide behind the light-standard, which is about
          half as wide as he is.  Shots hit all around him, shattering
          window glass behind him.  His stomach sticks out from behind
          the pole.  He sucks it in. Now his butt is sticking out on the
          other side.  Shots clang into the steel column, and riddle
          everything behind him.

                              GIB
                    WRONG!  THIS IS NOT GOOD!

          Just when it looks like Gib is going to get a 9mm tummy tuck,
          Malik turns and sprints away, through shocked pedestrians.
          Harry runs out of the restroom, trying for a shot, but there
          are too many people in the line of fire and Malik knows it.

                              HARRY
                    Get back to the car!

          Gib nods and heads the other way as Harry takes off after
          Malik.  Malik is fast and vicious.  He hurls people out of the
          way, sending shoppers sprawling.  Harry is ruthless in his
          pursuit.  They pound through the mall and out onto the street--


     86   EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Malik sprints straight into traffic.  A car screeches, not
          stopping in time... Malik goes right over the hood.  Harry
          leaps over the hoods of cars after him.  Malik sees Harry
          coming after him like a juggernaut.

          He turns and sees a MOTORCYCLIST coming down the street,
          accelerating from a right-turn.  Malik runs at him, clothes-
          lining him right off the bike.  The terrorist picks up the
          nimble little Kawasaki 250, which is still running, and leaps
          on.  He pops the clutch and takes off.  Harry pounds after him
          like a locomotive.  He sees Malik turn, taking the bike path
          into a large PARK.  Harry cuts into the park on a diagonal.


     87   EXT. PARK - NIGHT

          ON HARRY, running.  Ahead is a MOUNTED COP.  Harry doesn't
          break stride, heading right for the cop on the horse.  The cop
          turns, surprised, a split second before-- Harry pulls him off
          the horse and slams him to the ground (he's wearing a helmet).

                              HARRY
                    Federal Officer in pursuit of
                    suspect!  Sorry.

          Harry is in the saddle and galloping after Malik before the cop
          can get his gut out of the holster to stop him.

          MALIK roars through the park on the Kawasaki.  He looks back,
          amazed to see Harry charging after him on a horse.  They
          scatter joggers and bicyclists, people walking their dogs.

          TRACKING WITH THEM as they rocket through the park.  Malik
          leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees.
          Harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling.
          Malik fires his Beretta straight back at Harry, emptying it.
          He drops the pistol and crouches over the bike, twisting the
          last bit of throttle out of it.  They are going flat out,
          through the trees, in a kinetic blur.


     88   EXT. STREET - NEAR MALL - NIGHT

          Gib, panting and heaving, pulls his car into traffic.  The Unit
          Seven car pulls out as well, up the block.

                              GIB
                    Harry, what's your twenty?


     89   EXT. PARK/ STREETS - NIGHT

          Harry is legging the police horse hard.  He has his reigns in
          one hand, his Glock in the other.  It's the wild west.

                              HARRY
                    Westbound in the park... suspect
                    is on a motorcycle... he's going
                    to  come out on Franklin.  Hang
                    on--

          Harry leaps a park bench like he's in a steeple chase.

                              HARRY (CONT'D)
                    I want you on 14th in case he
                    turns south.  And I need Seven on
                    the north side to box him in.


     90   INT. /EXT. GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib is weaving furiously through traffic.  He slides into a
          turn.

                              GIB
                    Copy that.

                              HARRY
                    And make it fast.  My horse is
                    getting tired.

          ON GIB, mouthing "Your horse?"


     91   EXT. STREET - NEXT TO PARK - NIGHT

          Malik explodes through the bushes and out onto the street.
          Cars skid around him, out of control.  He turns south.  Weaving
          through traffic.  Harry leaps the hedgerow behind Malik and
          gallops among the spun-out cars.  He goes right over the hood
          on one which is blocking his path.  The driver ducks as the
          horse's hoof cracks the windshield.


     92   EXT. STREET/ HYATT REGENCY HOTEL - NIGHT

          Up ahead traffic is stopped, jammed tight at a light.  Malik
          goes into the oncoming traffic lanes, which are empty.  Gib's
          car slides around the corner in a blare of horns and comes
          barrelling down the street toward him.  Gib cranks the wheel
          the slides the car broadside, blocking both lanes.  Malik locks
          up the brakes and the bike slides to a stop.  Then the
          terrorist pops the clutch and wheels the bike around-- Jumping
          the curb and going straight at the entrance of THE HYATT
          REGENCY HOTEL.

          Bellmen and guests scatter as the bike roars right at them.
          The sliding doors and opening for a bellman coming out with
          bags and Malik blasts past him into the lobby.

          HARRY ducks, galloping through the doors after him.


     93   INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

          Acres of marble and red carpet.  Liveries porters.  Guests
          dressed for evening, the men in suits, diamonds on the women.
          And sudden pandemonium as Malik roars through the lobby, with
          Harry charging along behind him.  Malik guns it across the
          lounge, knocking over tables.  He gets air at the top of  the
          steps going up to the RESTAURANT.

          Harry swerves to avoid a panicking guest and finds himself
          careening toward the JAZZ QUARTET at a full gallop.  He gathers
          the animal and LEAPS (in glorious SLOW MOTION) over the
          bassist, who is diving for the carpet.  Harry and horse land
          deftly and then he urges his mount right up the steps after
          Malik.


     94   INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Malik roars between the tables, looking around wildly for a way
          out.  Harry charges in, ducking to avoid the chandelier.
          Waiters, trays, dinners, tables... everything seems to be
          flying at once as people dive out of the way.


     95   INT. HOTEL - MAIN HALL - NIGHT

          MALIK skids out into the main hall by another door, and sees--
          the ELEVATORS.  The door is just closing on one of them.  He
          guns it and slides through the doors.

          HARRY RIDES out of the restaurant in time to catch a glimpse of
          Malik as the doors close.


     96   INT. SCENIC ELEVATOR - NIGHT

          Harry canters the horse into the next elevator, which has just
          been boarded by an older couple.  He has to practically lie
          down on the horse to fit through the door.  The animal barely
          fits, nose to tail, in what turns out to be--

          A GLASS ELEVATOR with a view of the whole atrium of the hotel
          as it rises, right to the top of the building.  Harry looks
          through the glass at the elevator car next to him, fifteen feet
          away.  Malik is inside, punching a button.  He glances up and
          sees Harry.  There eyes meet for a moment, just before Malik's
          car ascends rapidly.  Malik's malevolent glare is etched on
          Harry's retinas.

          The older couple is jammed against the side-wall by Harry's
          panting, snorting horse.  It clomps around the tight elevator.
          The woman is trying to crawl between her husband and the wall.

                              HARRY
                    Can you just press the top floor,
                    please.

          The man nods mutely and complies.  Their elevator takes off,
          rising after Malik's.


     97   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

          Gib runs in with Faisil and Keough.  They follow the path of
          destruction, growing more and more amazed.  Gib yells to one of
          the porters.

                              GIB
                    The guy on the horse?!

          The porter points at the elevators.


     98   INT. / EXT. SCENIC ELEVATORS - NIGHT

          Harry has slid off the horse to get next to the control panel.
          He can look up at an angle and see Malik in the car above him.
          His thumb hovers over the emergency stop button.  If Malik gets
          out at any floor, Harry will have a moment to react and stop.
          Malik can look down and see this.  He knows Harry's got him.
          He just keeps going, floor after floor, using the time to
          think.

          The older woman is still just staring, trying not to breathe.
          The horse flicks her in the face with his tail.


     99   INT. /EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT                                       *

          The rooftop has a spectacular view of the city.  TRACKING WITH   *
          Malik as he comes out of the elevator, rides to the far edge of  *
          the roof and slides to a stop.  He looks  down twenty stories.

          THE SECOND ELEVATOR  arrives.  The doors part and Harry comes    *
          out, with his Glock poised and ready.  He sees Malik revving     *
          his bike.  The terrorist brodies the bike into a fast one-
          eighty and speeds back toward the edge of the roof.  Amazingly,
          he increases speed, ROARING RIGHT OFF THE EDGE,  ARCING THE
          BIKE SUICIDALLY OUT INTO SPACE!

          Harry rides to the edge in time to see Malik, on his bike,
          CLEAR A 60 FOOT JUMP and SPLASH INTO THE ROOFTOP POOL of a       *
          LOWER BUILDING next to the hotel!

          Harry is out of control now, seeing the guy setting away.  He
          wheels his mount and charges across the roof to get some
          running space.  Then he turns again, back toward the edge Malik
          jumped from.  He kicks the horse's flanks and yells HAAHH!!
          The horse's hoofs thunder on the roof as they go full tilt
          toward the edge.

          But a horse is not a motorcycle.  It is slightly smarter.  It
          slams its front hoofs down together, stopping suddenly.  Harry
          goes right over its head.  He flies forward, almost going right
          off the roof.  He slams to the edge, with his legs dangling
          over, holding onto a piece of pipe with one hand.  His Glock
          tumbles down into darkness.

          Harry sees Malik far below, climb out of the pool, running to
          the roof door of the other building.  Getting away.  Harry
          clambers up onto his own roof, breathing hard.  He walks over
          to the horse.

                              HARRY
                    What the hell were you thinking?
                    We had the guy and you let him
                    get away.

          He looks into the horse's innocent brown eyes.  Pats its neck
          fondly.

                              HARRY
                    What kind of  cop are you?


    100   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Helen is asleep at the dining room table next to a half-eaten
          cake and some melted ice cream.  His unopened presents are
          piled at one end of the table.  She raises her head as Harry
          enters sheepishly.

                              HARRY
                    Look, I know you're upset.  I'm
                    really sorry, honey.  I raced
                    home as quick--

                              HELEN
                    It's okay, don't bother, Harry.

          He goes to her and puts his arms around her.  He is tender with
          her.  He wishes he can tell her the truth.

                              HARRY
                    I'm sorry.  Thank you for the
                    party.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah.  It was great.

          Helen finds a smile for him somewhere.  She really does love
          him, though more and more often lately she finds her heart in
          pain.

                              HELEN
                    Let's go to bed, Harry.  There's
                    only one present you have to open
                    tonight.

          She grins and arches one eyebrow meaningfully.


    101   INT. BEDROOM / BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Helen walks Harry to the edge of the bed and sits him down.
          She puts her hand on his chest and pushes, causing him to lie
          back.

                              HELEN
                    Don't move.  I'll be right back.

          She turns on the stereo.  A Kenny G disc she put in there
          earlier.  Soft tenor sax flows around the room.  Helen enters
          the BATHROOM and shuts the door partway.  She opens a cupboard
          and quickly pulls out some things she hid there earlier.  A
          bottle of champagne on ice.  Two glasses.  Some trashy
          lingerie.

                              HARRY
                    Come on to bed, you don't have to
                    brush your teeth.

                              HELEN
                    I'll just be a second.  So what
                    happened tonight at the office?

                              HARRY
                    I couldn't believe it.  I go back
                    to get this report I need, right,
                    and the phone is ringing, so like
                    a bonehead I answer it--

          Helen is hurrying to put on the unfamiliar lingerie.  G-string
          panties and low-cut bra.  She holds up the garter belt, turning
          it backward and forward, trying to figure out which way it
          goes.

          ON HARRY, yawning.  Lying with the ease of years of practice.

                              HARRY
                    It's the big client in Japan,
                    and it's the middle of the
                    morning there and their whole
                    system is crashed... this guy's
                    having a meltdown--

                              HELEN
                         (keeping him talking)
                    What'd you do, honey?

                              HARRY
                    Well I pull out the manual on
                    their setup, which is the new 680
                    server...

          Helen is pulling up the black stockings.  She fastens the
          garters to the tops.  Her features are a scowl of
          concentration.  She is very earnest in her preparations.

                              HARRY (CONT'D)
                    ...and I'm troubleshooting it
                    with them over the phone...
                    talking to a translator, right,
                    who's getting half of it wrong...
                    it was unbelievable...  really
                    wild.

                              HELEN
                         (putting on black
                          pumps)
                    It sounds wild.  So now you're a
                    big hero, right?  For fixing
                    their system.

                              HARRY
                         (faintly)
                    Uh huh.

                              HELEN
                    My husband the hero.

          Red lipstick.  Then she puts a little perfume on her wrists.

                              HELEN
                    I'll be right there, honey.  Just
                    a minute.

          Harry doesn't answer.  Helen puts a little perfume down the
          front of her panties.

                              HELEN
                    Just a second.

          Helen quickly pours two glasses of champagne.  Then she slinks
          around the doorframe, making her entrance.  She looks like a
          living 900 number.  Helen stands before the bed, looking down,
          holding the champagne glasses.

          ON HARRY: sprawled on the bed, fully clothed, snoring softly.
          A little bit of drool is coming out the side of his mouth.

          HOLD ON HELEN, all dressed up with no place to go.  She gazes
          down at him, her shoulders slumping.

                              HELEN
                    Happy Birthday, Harry.

          She sighs deeply and downs her champagne in one long gulp.

                                                      CUT TO:


    102   EXT. STREET/ NEAR HIGH-SCHOOL - DAY

          It is the following morning.  Harry and Gib are staked out
          watching the front of Dana's school.  Actually, Harry is staked
          out, scanning the crowds of kids with binoculars.

          Gib just keeps looking at his watch.  He picks up a cellular
          phone and pretends to call the office.

                              GIB
                    Hey, did that guy Harry chased
                    last night call in to give
                    himself up yet?  Cause apparently
                    that's the only way we're going
                    to catch the son of a bitch --

                              HARRY
                         (not listening)
                    Okay.  Here she comes.


    103   EXT. STREET - DAY

          HARRY'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS - We see Dana come out to the
          curb and meet Trent, who pulls up on his bike.  She gets on
          behind him, adjusts her walkman headphones over her ears and he
          launches out into traffic.


    104   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

          Harry, who is behind the wheel, pulls out after her.  Trent
          weaves radically through the light traffic, going in between
          the cars.

                              HARRY
                    Look at the way the little punk
                    is driving.  He's all over the
                    place.  Look-- he hasn't
                    signalled once.

                              GIB
                    Goddammit!  That's outrageous.

          Harry speeds up.  Somebody honks as he cuts them off to stay
          with Trent.


    105   EXT. MOTORCYCLE - DAY

          ON DANA AND TRENT as she looks back and sees Harry following
          her.  She is mortified that her father is actually tailing her

                              DANA
                    Oh my God!  I think that's my
                    dad!

                              TRENT
                    Hang on!

          Trent downshifts and punches it.  The nimble little bike
          screams as it zips between cars.


    106   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

                              HARRY
                         (clenching his jaw)
                    So, you wanna play huh?  You
                    little--

                              GIB
                         (rolling his eyes)
                    That's it.  Get 'im Harry
                         (he draws a pistol)
                    We'll teach that little puke not
                    to signal.


    107   EXT. MOTORCYCLE

          BACK ON TRENT, who's actually a really good rider.  He zig-zags
          through the cars, cutting between them at the next light where
          Gib and Harry get blocked.  He cuts a sharp right turn and
          disappears.


    108   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY

          Harry is stuck in stopped traffic.  He pounds the wheel in
          frustration.

                              GIB
                         (exploding with
                          laughter)
                    Ha!  The little prick ditched
                    you!  That is so goddamn funny.

                              HARRY
                    Son of a bitch!

                              GIB
                    Can we go to the office now, Mr.
                    Superspy?

                                                      CUT TO:


    109   INT. OMEGA SECTOR / I.D. ANALYSIS ROOM - DAY

          Harry is sitting at a computer workstation, lit by the monitor
          screen.  Gib and Faisil look on as he clicks through HEADSHOTS
          of known terrorists.  CLICK.  CLICK.  CLICK.  Harry is very
          focussed.  He stops.  He goes back one.  Studies the face.


    110   INT. ANALYSIS ROOM - TIGHT ON THE SCREEN - DAY

          A defiant looking Syrian with a full beard.

          HARRY holds up his hand, blocking out the beard, concentrating
          on the eyes.

                              HARRY
                    That's him.


    111   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          Harry slaps photos down in front of Trilby.

                              HARRY
                    Abu Kaleem Malik.

                              GIB
                         (reading from a file)
                    Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-                     *
                    fundamentalist.  Linked to                             *
                    numerous car-bombings, that cafe                       *
                    bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of
                    Lisbon last year.  Major player.                       *

                              FAISIL                                       *
                    Now he's formed his own splinter
                    faction called CRIMSON JIHAD.

                              GIB                                          *
                    Guess he thought the other
                    terrorist groups were too warm
                    and fuzzy for his taste.

                              FAISIL
                    They call him "The Sand Spider".                       *

                              TRILBY
                    Why?

                              FAISIL
                         (he shrugs)
                    Probably because it sounds scary.                      *

                              TRILBY
                    This is impressive, gentlemen.
                    Of course, it would have been
                    even more impressive if you
                    actually knew where he was.

                              HARRY
                    We'll get him.

                              TRILBY
                    Yes.  You will.
                         (meaning-- you damn
                          well better)
                    Harry, I still want you in
                    charge, even though your cover is
                    blown.  Just keep a low profile.
                         (he slaps a newspaper
                          on the table)
                    I generally prefer it when my
                    covert operations don't make the
                    front page.

          The agents look at the headlines:  WILD WEST CHASE.  Harry and
          Gib wince.


    112   EXT. HELEN'S OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          Harry and Gib pull to the curb in front of the building.

                              GIB
                    What's going on?

          Harry gets out of the car and turns back, leaning in the door
          to talk to Gib.

                              HARRY
                    Look, uh... I've got to talk to
                    Helen about this thing with Dana.
                    I'm just going to run in and see
                    if she can get away for lunch.

                              GIB
                    You want me to just hang-- ?

                              HARRY
                    Just hang a minute.

                              GIB
                    I'll just hang then, shall I?


    113   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

          Harry enters the office of Helen's firm.  He stops at
          reception.

                              RECEPTIONIST
                    Hello Mr. Tasker.  Just a second,
                    I'll  buzz Helen.

                              HARRY
                    No.  No, I'd like to surprise
                    her.  Thanks, I know where her
                    desk is.

          He smiles and breezes past her before she has a chance to
          object.


    114   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

          TRACKING WITH HARRY as he moves through the offices.  He passes
          through a library-like maze of records stacks.  Through them he
          can see Helen at her desk.  But as he approaches, still
          concealed, ALLISON puts a call on hold and whips around to
          Helen.

                              ALLISON
                    Helen!
                         (grinning
                          conspiratorially)
                    It's your mystery man.

                              HELEN
                    Simon?  Ohmygod.

          Helen, normally the image of composure, goes suddenly fluttery
          and nervous as a high-school girl.  She takes the phone,
          turning away from Allison.

                              HELEN
                    Hello, Simon?
                         (pause)
                    It's all right.  There's no one
                    around.

          Helen glimpses Allison with her ears cocked and gives her a
          scowl and a shooing motion.  Allison turns away, grinning.


    115   INT. OFFICE - STACKS OF RECORDS - DAY

          ON HARRY, behind the stacks, reacting.  He silently mouths
          "SIMON?!"


    116   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

                              HELEN
                    You mean right now?
                         (she looks around
                          guiltily)
                    I guess so.  Okay.  I'll be right
                    there.
                         (pause)
                    Yes.  I can't wait.  Bye.

          She hangs up, a little flushed.  Then turns to Allison.

                              HELEN
                    Can you cover me for an hour?

                              ALLISON
                    Just an hour?  You should tell
                    this stud to take more time.

                              HELEN
                    Will you shutup.  I should never
                    have told you about him.

          Helen grabs her purse and rushes out, going right past the
          stack where Harry is standing, dumbfounded.  He looks like he
          was slammed in the stomach with a lead pipe.  His whole like is
          unravelling.


    117   EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          Gib sees Harry crossing the street, holding his stomach.  He
          seems dazed.  He is not so much walking to the car as wandering
          in its general direction.  He stops, in the street.  Gib gets
          out of the car and rushes to him.  He pulls him out of the path
          of a bus which is HONKING irritably.

                              GIB
                    You look like you got gut-kicked.
                    What's the matter?  You sick?

          Harry leans against the car for support.

                              HARRY
                         (barely audible)
                    He-- Helen.  Helen-- it's Helen.
                    It's Helen, Gib.

                              GIB
                    Something to do with Helen, is
                    what I'm getting.

                              HARRY
                    She's having an affair.

          Harry's best friend in the world brightens with the news.  He
          slaps him on the back.

                              GIB
                    Congratulations.  Welcome to the
                    club.

                              HARRY
                    It can't be.  Not Helen.

                              GIB
                    Nobody believes it can happen to
                    them.

                              HARRY
                    It can't be.

                              GIB
                    Same thing happened to me with
                    wife two.  I had no idea until I
                    came home and the house was
                    empty.  I mean empty.  She even
                    took the ice-cube trays from the
                    fridge.  What kind of person
                    would think of that?

                              HARRY
                         (not listening)
                    I still don't believe it.

                              GIB
                    Relax.  Helen still loves you.
                    She just wants this guy to bang
                    her.  It's nothing serious.
                    You'll get used to it after a --

          Harry wheels around on Gib, grabbing him by the lapels, and
          slams him against the car.

                              HARRY
                    STOP.  CHEERING.  ME.  UP.

          We see in Harry's rage, frustration, and hurt confusion a
          vulnerability we never expected to see.

                              GIB
                    What'dya expect Harry?  She's a
                    flesh and blood woman.  And
                    you're never there.  It was only
                    a matter of time.

          Harry sags.  His friend is right.  Gib opens the car door and
          helps him in like an invalid, talking soothingly the whole time--

                              GIB
                    I say we concentrate on work.
                    That's how I always got through
                    it whenever my life turned to
                    dogshit.  Let's catch some
                    terrorists and then you can beat
                    the crap out of them.  You'll
                    feel better.

          Gib gets in and starts the car, full of stoic cheer for Harry.

                              GIB
                    Women.  Can't live with 'em.
                    Can't kill 'em.


    118   INT. OMEGA SECTOR / LISTENING ROOM - DAY

          Harry and Gib are in the LISTENING ROOM.  Banks of tape-decks
          recording calls, rows of technicians in cubicles processing and
          collating transcripts.

                              GIB
                    He's giving us a blank check on                        *
                    wiretaps.  So I've set 'em up on
                    all of Juno's shipping agents,
                    her clients, and Faisil made up                        *
                    a list of possible contacts that
                    Crimson Jihad might have in this
                    country.  Now all we can do is                         *
                    wait --                                                *

          He notices Harry is not listening.

                              GIB
                    Is this national security stuff
                    boring you?

                              HARRY
                    Put a tap on her phone.

                              GIB
                    What're you talking about?  We
                    have that.

                              HARRY
                    Helen's phone.  Her office line
                    and the line at my house.

          Gib gives Harry a stricken look, and glances around nervously.
          He pulls him into an empty office.

                              GIB                                          *
                         (a whispered hiss)                                *
                    Okay .  .  .I have two words to                        *
                    describe that idea.  In.  Sane.
                    Unauthorized wiretap is a felony,
                    pard.

          Harry grabs him and rams him up against the wall, his teeth
          clenched.

                              HARRY
                    Yeah, and we do it twenty times
                    a day.  Don't give me that crap.
                    Just put on the taps.  Now.

                              GIB
                    Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.

          Harry releases him and turns away.  Gib straightens his jacket,
          looking at his friend like he's completely losing it.


    119   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          That night Harry is actually there on time for dinner.  He
          glances at Dana, who has been eyeing him warily.  She looks at
          her peas.

                              HARRY
                    How was school today?

                              DANA
                    Fine.

          Harry takes a bite of his food, watching her.  Silence.  Helen
          glances at him.

                              HELEN
                    So.  You came by to see me today?

          She is a too casual, masking her nervousness.

                              HARRY
                    I was in the area, and I thought
                    you might like to have lunch.

                              HELEN
                    They must've just missed me.

                              HARRY
                    They said you had to run out.

                              HELEN
                    Yeah.  It was a rush thing.  They
                    needed some documents down at the
                    court house.  I barely made it.

          Harry watches her lying to him with some amazement.  You can
          see the jaw muscles clenching.

                              HARRY
                    So, a little excitement in an
                    otherwise dull day.  Did is work
                    out okay?

                              HELEN
                    Oh, sure.  Fine.
                         (she gets up suddenly)
                    I'll get some more gravy.

                              DANA
                    I'm done.

          Dana bolts.  She has eaten about four bites.  Harry sits at the
          table, alone.  He feels isolated, knowing that everybody is
          lying to everybody else.  He is a man without a center, lost.

                                                      CUT TO:


    120   INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ LISTENING ROOM - DAY

          TRACKING ALONG THE BANK OF RECORDERS.  Harry comes to a
          particular set of machines.  He reaches past the technician and
          picks up the hard-copy of the transcripts.

          ON HARRY walking and leafing through the phone transcripts.
          Gib watches him through a glass partition, shaking his head
          slowly.  Harry freezes, staring at the page and WE HEAR THE
          SOUND OF THE CONVERSATION OVERLAID:

                              HELEN
                    Hello?

                              SIMON
                    Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe
                    to talk?

                              HELEN
                    Yes.  Go ahead.


    121   INT. CAR - FLASHBACK SEQUENCE - DAY

          A man in his mid-thirties, sitting in a car SOMEPLACE (DAY),
          speaks into a cellular phone.  This is SIMON.  He is dark
          haired, and fairly good-looking in an off-beat way.  He is
          unshaven and his clothes look slept in.  He glances around in
          a furtive manner.

                              SIMON
                    I can't talk long.  Can you meet
                    me for lunch tomorrow?  I must
                    see you.


    122   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

          NOW WE SEE HELEN, at her office.

                              HELEN
                    Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?

                              SIMON
                    The same place.  One o'clock.  I
                    have to go now.  See you
                    tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.


    123   INT. LISTENING ROOM - DAY

          The last line is played ON HARRY, reading.  Now he is seeing
          the proof in black and white.  He slowly crumples the paper in
          one hand, his expression dark.


    124   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Helen is reading in bed.  She glances up as Harry comes into
          the room.  Gives  him a quick smile.  Too quick.

                              HARRY
                    I thought we might have lunch
                    tomorrow.

                              HELEN
                    I can't, honey.  I promised
                    Allison I'd go shopping with her.
                    Sorry.

          Harry watches her smoothly lying to him.  It's surreal to him.

                              HARRY
                    No problem.

          He surreptitiously picks up Helen's purse from a dresser and     *

          THE FRONT DOOR OPENS and Harry comes out, walking Gizmo on a     *
          leash.  Harry walks briskly along the sidewalk, jerking the
          poor dog along twice as fast as his little legs will go.         *


    127   EXT. SIDEWALK, BY GIB'S CAR - NIGHT

          He reaches Gib's car, half a block up, and hands him Helen's     *
          purse.  Gib eyes the dog warily.  He growls at it.  Gizmo hides  *
          behind Harry's legs.

                              GIB
                    Look, Harry.  I know this is
                    rough.  I felt the same way the
                    first time it happened to--

          Harry holds up one finger.  His eyes and expression are so
          intense, Gib just soft of trails off.

                              GIB                                          *

    130   INT. / EXT. HELEN'S CAR - DAY

          TIGHT ON THE PURSE sitting on the seat next to her as Helen
          drives through the city.


    131   INT. / EXT. N.D. SEDAN - DAY

          Harry drives while Gib watches--


    132   INT. SEDAN, CLOSE UP ON MAP - DAY

          A COMPUTERIZED MAP below the dash.  Helen's purse appears as a
          moving blip on a street-map of the city.


    133   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - DAY

                              GIB
                    Okay, she's turning on
                    Seventeenth.  Make a left, you
                    should see her.

          Harry makes the turn.

                              HARRY
                    There she is.


    134   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

          Up ahead they see Helen's RED ACCORD pulling into a parking low
          next to a CAFE.  Harry parks the car a block away and gets out
          his binoculars.


    135   EXT. HELEN'S CAR THROUGH BINOCULARS - DAY

          HARRY'S POV through the scope.  Helen gets out of her car and
          looks around as she walks to the cafe.  It is not a nervous
          look, but it is clear she is making sure she is not followed.
          She goes inside.


    136   INT. SEDAN - DAY

                              HARRY
                    Give me audio.

          Gib hits a switch and they hear the clamor of the cafe at lunch
          rush come over a speaker.


    137   INT. CAFE - DAY

          The restaurant is nothing fancy.  A little dark.  Helen makes
          her way to a booth in the back.  Sitting in the shadows, facing
          the door, is SIMON.  She sits down opposite him.  He doesn't
          smile or kiss her in greeting, but glances around the room like
          he expects a threat to leap out at any moment.

                              SIMON
                    Are you sure you weren't
                    followed?

                              HELEN
                    I kept looking back, like you
                    taught me.  I didn't see anyone.

                              SIMON
                    Okay.  It's just, things are a
                    bit hot for me right now.  If I
                    get a signal...
                         (holds up a cigarette
                          lighter meaningfully)
                    I may have to leave suddenly.

                              HELEN
                    I understand.

                              SIMON
                    It's my job to risk my life, but
                    not yours.  I feel bad about
                    bringing you into this, but
                    you're the only one I can trust.

          Simon creates an atmosphere of danger.  His haggardness give
          him an air of mystery and desperation.

                              HELEN
                    Where were you?  On a... uh,                           *
                    mission?

                              SIMON
                    Ssshhh!  We say Op.  Covert                            *
                    operation.  And this one got a
                    little rough.

                              HELEN
                    Worse than Cairo?                                      *

                              SIMON
                    Cairo was a day at the beach next                      *
                    to this.

          Harry and Gib turn to each other, shocked with the dawning
          awareness.

                              GIB
                    Guy's a spook!

                              HARRY
                    Yeah, but for who?                                     *

                              GIB
                    He could be working her to get to
                    you.

          Harry waves his hand, silencing Gib.

          INTERCUT FROM HERE ON BETWEEN HARRY/GIB AND HELEN/SIMON.


    139   INT. CAFE - DAY

          SIMON puts a newspaper on the table, sliding it over to Helen.

                              SIMON
                    Did you read the papers
                    yesterday?

                              HELEN
                    Yes.

                              SIMON
                    Sometimes a story is a mask for
                    a covert operation.  See-- two
                    men killed in a restroom, and two
                    unidentified men in a running                          *
                    shootout, ending at the                                *
                    Marriot...


    140   INT. SEDAN - DAY

          HARRY AND GIB react, realizing that it is the story of their
          operation gone awry.


    141   INT. CAFE - DAY

                              HELEN
                    That was you?!

                              SIMON
                    You recognized my style.  See,
                    you're very good.  You're a
                    natural at this.


    142   INT. SEDAN - DAY

          Harry starts to get it.  Then is dawns on Gib.

                              GIB
                    The guy's a fake!  He's taking
                    credit for our moves.


    143   INT. CAFE - DAY

          HELEN LEANS CLOSE TO SIMON.  She clearly is hanging on his
          every word.

                              HELEN
                    Tell me what happened?

                              SIMON
                    I'm sorry, I can't.

                              HELEN
                    You can trust me completely.

                              SIMON
                    I know.  But it would compromise
                    your safety too much to know
                    certain things.

                              HELEN
                    Right, of course.  I was worried
                    when I didn't hear from you that
                    night.

                              SIMON
                    It's strange.  I knew I was in a
                    woman's thoughts when I was
                    shooting it out with those
                    assassins.


    144   INT. SEDAN - DAY

          HARRY REACTS to the outrageous fabrication.

                              GIB
                    Unbelievable.


    145   INT. CAFE - DAY

          BUT HELEN is eating it up.

                              HELEN
                    Were they trying to kill you?                          *

                              SIMON

                    talking about.  Two won't bother                       *
                    me again.

                              HELEN
                    And you chased one?

                              SIMON
                    Something came over me, I just
                    had nail him, no matter what the                       *
                    risk.  It was pretty hairy.  I
                    thought he had me, a couple of                         *
                    times.  But I really can't take
                    credit .  .  .

                    You can't?                                             *

                    No.  It's the training.  It                            *
                    shapes you into a lethal                               *

                    Not here.  I'll call you and
                    we'll rendezvous again.
                         (he looks around)
                    We have to leave separately, so
                    we aren't seen together.  For
                    your safety.

                              HELEN
                    You'll call me then?

                              SIMON
                    Yes.  Now go.

    156   EXT. STREET/CAR LOT - DAY

          Simon is cruising in the Corvette with the radio blasting.
          Thinking he is supercool.


    157   EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY

          Simon pulls into a used car lot, which is a run-down place.  A
          hodge-podge of makes and models, a few that might aspire to be
          classics.

          Simon backs the Vette into an open space on the front line.  He
          reaches into the back seat and pulls out a dayglo sign showing
          the SALE PRICE of the car.  He sticks it back on the dash.  The
          car doesn't even belong to him!


    158   EXT. ACROSS THE STREET FROM CAR LOT - DAY

          Harry and Gib pull up.  They watch as Simon jumps out of the
          Vette and goes into the sales office.

                              GIB
                         (laughing)
                    He's a goddamn used car salesman.
                    This just gets better.
                         (catching himself)
                    Sorry Harry, I know this is
                    painful.

          Harry's eyes are slitted down lethally as he stares across the
          street.


    159   INT. CAR LOT SALES OFFICE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)                 *

          TIGHT ON A TAPE PLAYER, with Simon's hand adjusting the volume.
          The sound of traffic noise and middle-eastern music blares from
          the deck.

          PULL BACK to see Simon on the phone, talking loud, as if over
          the din of a real place.

                              SIMON
                    It's a great little bar, Amanda,
                    you'd love it.  Beirut's a great
                    place if you know the city.                            *
                    Listen, this isn't a secure line.
                    I'll tell you all about it when
                    I get back tomorrow... if I live.
                         (pause)
                    Scared?  Never!  Except of you--

          During this, the owner of the place, DOUG WURTZ, has come out
          of the back room and looked out at the lot.  What Doug sees is--

          HARRY, browsing among the cars.

          DOUG turns from the window and bears down on Simon, who sees
          him coming and speeds up his rap.

                              SIMON
                    --I have to go, baby.  A guy's
                    coming toward me--

          Doug grabs the phone out of his hand and slams it in the
          cradle.

                              DOUG                                         *
                    Simon, look out there.  You see
                    that man?  Notice how he's
                    looking at the cars.  He's called
                    a customer.  I know it's been a
                    while, but do you remember what
                    you're supposed to do when we
                    have a customer?


    160   EXT. CAR LOT - DAY

          Simon bounces jauntily up to Harry, talking before he's even
          reached him.

                              SIMON
                    It wants you too.  Feel it
                    vibrate?  How about a little
                    spin?

          Simon opens the passenger door and sits Harry inside, then runs
          around the car.  He leaps over the closed door into the
          driver's seat and starts the car.

                              SIMON
                    You gotta jump in.  That's rule
                    number one.  It takes a little
                    practice, but there's no way
                    around it.


    161   EXT. STREET - DAY

          Simon swings the car out onto the boulevard, kicking back.

                              SIMON
                    See, it's not just the car, it's
                    a total image.  An identity you
                    have to go for.  This isn't some
                    high-tech sports car...  it
                    doesn't even handle that great.
                    But that's not the idea, is it.

          Simon gives Harry a big grin.  Harry returns a knowing chuckle.
          Ha ha.

                              SIMON
                    What're we talking about here?
                    Pussy, right?

                              HARRY
                    Absolutely.

          Simon laughs.  Harry laughs.  A big lusty, male-bonding kind of
          laugh.

                              SIMON
                    Well then this is a vital piece
                    of equipment.  Used properly, it
                    can change your life.  See, you
                    cruise.  No racing.  This ain't
                    a Ferrari.  You check out the
                    scenery, let the scenery check
                    you out.  You got to take it
                    slow.  Old cars are like good
                    women... they heat up fast.

          How do you grin warmly while your eyes are so cold?  Ask Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Keep talking.

                                                      CUT TO:


    162   EXT. TACO STAND - DAY

          Simon is holding court.  Over tacos, he waxes eloquent on his
          greatest area of expertise.  We see Harry laughing, going along
          with the guy.  Pretending to bond.

                              SIMON
                    Let's face it, Harry, the Vette
                    gets 'em wet.  But it's not
                    enough.  If you want to really
                    close escrow, you gotta have an
                    angle.

                              HARRY
                    And you've got one.

                              SIMON
                    It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm
                    not that much to look at.  No
                    really.  I can be honest.  But I
                    got 'em lining up, and not just
                    skanks, either.  Some are.

                              HARRY
                    So what's your angle?

                              SIMON
                    Sorry.  Trade secret.

                              HARRY
                         (grinning)
                    Sure.  Set me up and then don't
                    tell me.

          Simon leans forward, conspiratorially.

                              SIMON
                    Okay, just ask yourself.  What do
                    women really want?  You take
                    these bored housewives, married
                    to the same guy for years.  Stuck
                    in a rut.  They need some
                    release.  The promise of
                    adventure.  A hint of danger.  I
                    create that for them.

                              HARRY
                    So you're basically lying your
                    ass off the whole time?  I
                    couldn't do it.

                              SIMON
                    Well, think of it as playing a
                    role.  It's fantasy.  You have to
                    work on their dreams.  Get them
                    out of their daily suburban grind
                    for a few hours.

                              HARRY
                    Isn't that hard to keep up, in
                    the long run?

                              SIMON
                    Doesn't matter.  I like change.
                    You know, constant turnover.  As
                    soon as I close the deal, it's
                    one of two more times, then
                    adios.

                              HARRY
                    Use 'em and lose 'em.

                              SIMON
                    Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta
                    pick your target.  They have to
                    be nice little housewife types.
                    School-teachers.  But, I'm
                    telling you, you get their pilot
                    lit, these babes, they can suck-
                    start a leaf-blower.

                              HARRY
                    What about the husbands?

                              SIMON
                    Dickless.  If they took care of                        *
                    business, I'd be out of business,
                    know what I mean?

                              HARRY
                    Those idiots.


    163   EXT. STREET/ VETTE - DAY

          They are cruising along, with Harry driving this time.

                              HARRY
                    You working on someone right now?

                              SIMON
                    I always have a couple on the
                    hook.  You know.  There's one
                    right now, I've got her panting
                    like a dog.  It's great.

          Unconsciously, Harry's hands clench the wheel tighter.

                              HARRY
                    What does she do?

                              SIMON
                    Some kinda legal secretary of
                    something.  Married to some
                    boring jerk.

          Harry takes a corner too fast.  The tires squealing.

                              SIMON
                    And she could be so hot, if she
                    wanted to be.  She's like a dying
                    plant that just needs a little
                    water.

          When Simon is looking, Harry is open and encouraging...  they
          laugh together... then when he looks away Harry goes snake-
          eyed.  He could kill Simon with one punch.  He's visualizing
          his wife getting porked by this guy.

                              HARRY
                    But with you, she gets to be hot,
                    right?

                              SIMON
                    Red hot.  Her thighs steam.

          They laugh together.  Harry's laugh is getting a bit brittle.
          He speeds up, his knuckles white on the wheel.  Now for the big
          question: HAVE THEY OR HAVEN'T THEY?

                              HARRY
                    Sooooo... she's pretty good in
                    bed, then?

                              SIMON
                         (yelling suddenly)
                    Hey, slow down you're gonna miss
                    the turn!


    164   EXT. USED CAR LOT - DAY

          Harry comes barrelling into the lot at forty.  He cranks the
          wheel and hits the emergency brake, slewing the car into a
          smoking bootlegger-180.  It screeches backward, sliding right
          into its parking space perfectly.

          Simon is bugeyed.  But he is non-plussed for only about two
          seconds.  Then he's back to selling.  He scrambles out and goes
          around to Harry, coughing in the cloud of tire smoke.

                              SIMON
                    See.  You and this car were meant
                    for each other.  Why fight it?
                    Sure, I have a couple other
                    buyers lined up, but I like your
                    style.  Whattya say?  Should we
                    start on the paperwork?

                              HARRY
                    Let me think about it.  Hold it
                    a day for me?

          Simon grins and winks.

                              SIMON
                    Because it's you.


    165   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Dana is in the living room, watching TV when she sees her
          mother cross through, dressed to go out.

                              HELEN
                    Dinner's in the warmer.  Tell
                    your father I may be late.

                              DANA
                    Where are you going?

                              HELEN
                    Out.

          Dana is momentarily puzzled by the reversal of roles.


    166   INT. ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

          ON HELEN, checking herself in the hall mirror.  She looks at
          her big dowdy purse.  Hating it suddenly.  She pulls her
          pocketbook out and rummages on the top shelf of the hall closet
          for a small handbag, then charges out.

    167   OMITTED


    168   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - NIGHT

          Harry is driving.  Gib pulls a sheaf of pages out of his
          briefcase and hands them to him.

                              GIB
                    Here's today's transcripts.
                    There's nothing interesting.

                              SIMON
                    Nothing from Simon?

          Keeping one eye on the road, Harry riffles through the sheets.
          He glances at the top of the last couple of sheets.  He scowls.
          Then SUDDENLY SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.  The car dives to the curb,
          bumping one wheel.  Harry gets out and charges around to Gib's
          side.  Gib gets out, his expression blank.

                              HARRY
                    Give me the page.

                              GIB
                    What are you talking about?

                              HARRY
                    It skips from page nine to
                    eleven.  Where's page ten?

                              GIB
                    Aw, it's gotta be a typo--

                              HARRY
                    GIVE ME THE GODDAMN PAGE!!

          Harry hammers his fist against the car-window right next to
          Gib.  It explodes inward in a shower of glass.

                              GIB
                         (shrugging)
                    Okay.  Here.

          He fishes a crumples sheet of paper out of his pocket.  Harry
          grabs it from him, straightening it.

                              GIB
                    Jeez, Harry.  Seek help.

          As Harry begins to read, we go into FLASHBACK.


    169   INT. USED CAR LOT OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK

          ON SIMON - He is talking into the phone in hushed, urgent
          tones.

                              SIMON
                    Helen.  I need your help.  Can
                    you meet me tonight?

          INTERCUT WITH HELEN at her office.


    170   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK/INTERCUT

                              HELEN
                    What's happened?

                              SIMON
                    It's serious.  That's all I can                        *
                    say.  Just meet on K Street under                      *

                    Shit!  It's almost eight.                              *

          He jumps back in the car and activates the GPS locator.
          Helen's purse-blip flashes on the grid map.

                              HARRY
                    She's still at my house.                               *

                              GIB
                    The purse is still at the house.


    172   INT. SEDAN - NIGHT

          Harry growls and slams the car into gear, roaring out into
          traffic.  Horns honk as he cuts off people.  He is oblivious.
          He grabs his rover.

                              HARRY

                              HARRY
                    Immediate roll.  Acquire subject
                    at K Street and Key Bridge.                            *
                    Vehicle is red-and-white                               *
                    convertible.  You have six

                    Roger, One.  Rolling.

                              UNIT TWO
                    Copy that.

                              GIB
                    Wait a minute!  Are you out of
                    your mind?  You can't pull agents
                    off a priority surveillance to
                    follow  your wife!    It's gross
                    misappropriation of Sector's
                    resources, it's...  it's a breach
                    of national security.

          Harry drives on, ignoring him.  Gib grabs his shoulder, shaking
          him.

                              GIB                                          *
                    You copy, Harry?  This is too
                    far.  You're losing it big-time.
                    I have to stop you.

                              HARRY
                    Whatya going to do?   Tell?

                              GIB
                    Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our
                    butts.  So your life is in the
                    toilet.  So your wife is banging
                    a used car salesman.  Sure it's
                    humiliating.  But be a man here--

                              HARRY
                    You tell on me, I tell on you.

                              GIB
                    Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a
                    preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean
                    as a --

                              HARRY
                    What about that time you trashed
                    a six-week operation because you
                    were busy getting a blow-job?

                              GIB
                         (instantly contrite)
                    You know about that?

          Harry turns to him.  His glare could melt metal.  Gib gives a
          fatalistic shrug.

                              GIB
                    Take Franklin, it's quicker.

          Harry makes the turn, squealing tires.

                              GIB
                    You don't have any pictures
                    though, do ya.  Huh?                                   *


    173   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

          Helen pulls  her car under the bridge.  She checks her watch.
          Helen notices that her hand is shaking.  She looks around and    *
          the place seems deserted.  She is about to leave when she sees
          headlights flash briefly in the shadows.

          A red-and-white Vette emerges from the darkness and pulls up
          next to her.  Simon motions for her to get in quickly.


    174   EXT. PARKING LOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS - NIGHT

          LONGSHOT  on Simon and Helen in the Vette, coming out of the
          parking low under the bridge.  We are watching them through a
          sophisticated telephoto night-vision device.


    175   INT. UNIT TWO SEDAN - NIGHT

          Agent MORTON lowers the SCOPE and picks up his rover.  He puts   *
          the car in gear to follow.

                              MORTON
                    Two here.  Subject is southbound
                    on Key Bridge.  A man and a woman                      *
                    in the vehicle.

                              HARRY (RADIO)
                    Roger's two.


   175A   INT./EXT. SIMON'S CAR

          Simon makes a show of checking the mirrors.

                              SIMON
                    Now don't be alarmed... but if
                    I'm spotter, it would be best if
                    they don't see you.  You should
                    keep your head down until we're
                    out of the city.

          He pushes her head down onto his lap.  She crouches there, with
          her cheek against his thigh.  He's cruising along, loving it.


    176   INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT

          Gib is trying to watch the computerized city map on the screen,
          but Harry keeps cornering so fast he loses his place.

                              MORTON (RADIO)
                    The woman has her head in the
                    guy's lap.

          Harry is doing a jaw-clenched slow burn.

                              HARRY
                    Roger, two.  One to Condor, do
                    you have visual?

    184   EXT. HIGHWAY LEAVING CITY - NIGHT

          It is a highway heading away from the city.  IN A LONG LENS
          SHOT, the Vette appears over the brow of a hill.  A moment
          later A HELICOPTER rises up behind them, A DRAMATIC REVEAL.  It
          follows the Vette.

                              CONDOR (VOICE OVER/RADIO)
                    This is Condor.  We have the
                    ball, repeat... we have a good
                    lock-up on I.R.

          CUT TO: INFRARED VIEW of the Vette, from the helicopter's FLIR
          system.  The greenish, image-intensified view of the car is
          like daylight.

       as they head out into the country.

       EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT                                      188

       The headlights of the Vette light up a ratty single-wide
       mobile home, on the outskirts of a TRAILER PARK off the
       highway.  Simon and Helen get out of the car.

                            SIMON
                 My place in the city is too
                 hot right now.  So is the
                 penthouse in New York.  But
                 this place is secure.

       He takes her inside.

       INT. SIMON'S TRAILER - NIGHT                                   190

       Helen feels awkward in the small, junky space.  A tape deck
       is playing cool jazz.  Simon hands her a glass of cheap wine.
       He clinks her glass with his.

                           SIMON
                 To our assignment.

                           HELEN
                 What is it you need me to do?

                              SIMON
                    Helen, I want you to be my wife.

                              HELEN
                    I'm married!

                              SIMON
                         (quickly)
                    Just for the operation in Paris.
                    I need to be married.  They'll be
                    looking for a man traveling
                    alone.

                              HELEN
                    We're going to Paris?

                              SIMON
                    Helen, there's a double agent in
                    my outfit... I don't know who.
                    There's no one I can trust.
                    Except you.  Can you get away?
                    Just for two days.

                              HELEN
                    I don't know.  I have to think...

                              SIMON
                    Here.  Sit down.  Be comfortable.

          He clears a place for her on the bed, shoving clothes and
          magazines out of the way.  She sits down and he tops off her
          glass from the wine bottle.


    191   EXT. BILLBOARD AND TRAILER PARK - NIGHT

          The agents have gathered behind a billboard.  Harry, Gib and     *
          the other three agents have donned black jumpsuits.  They
          finish fitting battle-harnesses, then they grab black ski-       *
          masks.  They don them in perfect unison.  Commando precision.
          Harry leads off and they quick-time from behind the billboard,
          closing in on Simon's trailer.


    192   INT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          Helen looks up at Simon and nods slowly.

                              HELEN
                    Okay.  I'll do it.

          Simon shoots over and sits next to her, taking her hand.

                              SIMON
                    You are incredibly brave.  I have
                    to remind myself the fear you
                    must be feeling.  I've lived like
                    this for years, so I'm used to
                    it.  Every day when I get up, I
                    think it might be my last.  But
                    it makes you appreciate life.
                    And the moment.  Because that may
                    be all you have.

          He moves a little closer.  Casting his spell.

                              SIMON
                    To pull this cover story off, we
                    have to look exactly like two
                    people who are intimate with each
                    other.  The enemy can spot a fake
                    easily.

          He puts his hand on her knee.  She tenses up instantly.

                              SIMON
                    You see what I mean?  That
                    reaction would give us away in a
                    second.  Try to relax.

                              HELEN
                    It's just that... it's been
                    sixteen years since anyone but
                    Harry did that, I--

                              SIMON
                    Relax.  There, that's better.
                    Let yourself slip into the role.

          He puts his other arm around her shoulders and pulls her slowly
          into a kiss.  This doesn't seem real to Helen.  She finds
          herself not pulling away.  He lowers her slowly until they are
          lying together on the bed.

                              SIMON
                    There you go.  That's right...

          He slides his hand up her thigh.  The fingers, stroking in
          little circles, slips under her skirt.  And--

          She suddenly EXPLODES, pushing on his chest, forcing him up off
          her.

                              HELEN
                    NO!  Stop!
                         (he keeps kissing her)
                    Get off me RIGHT NOW!

          Simon struggles with her.  She gets one knee up under him and
          levers him up.  She pushes him to a standing position.  She
          sits up on the bed, straightening her skirt.

          He looks forlorn and pathetic.  Now he's going to try
          pleading...

                              SIMON
                    If not for me, do it for
                    democracy.


    193   INT. / EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          KABOOM!!  The back wall of the trailer is blown outward by tiny
          shaped-charges.  The concussion throws Simon forward on top of
          her.  Five BLACK-SUITED FIGURES swarm in, carrying machine
          pistols and flashlights.


    194   INT. TRAILER - HARRY'S POV - NIGHT

          Lit by the beam of the flashlight, he sees Simon on top of
          Helen, her knees up on either side of his hips.  It looks bad.
          Simon and Helen sit up... stunned.  They look like two rabbits
          in the headlights of a truck.  She screams.


    195   INT. TRAILER - ON SIMON - NIGHT

          Reacting as all his years of bullshit have suddenly
          materialized as a nightmarish reality.  He is stunned.
          Blinking, mouth hanging open.


    196   INT. / EXT. TRAILER - SIMON'S POV - NIGHT

          WHAT SIMON SEES -- Five demonic figures, backlit by the XENON
          LIGHT from a helicopter.  Smoke and dust swirling in the rotor-
          wash.  The figures lunge toward them, grabbing them both.
          Helen struggles fiercely as Gib (disguised) pulls her up.
          Harry yanks Simon to his feet.


    197   EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

          Gib comes out first with Helen.  She struggles like a wildcat,
          frankly surprising the hell out of Harry.  Simon is brought
          out, dazed and compliant.  Helen whips around, KNEEING GIB
          right in the balls.  Gib OOPHS and doubles over, and Helen runs
          for it.

          Harry leaves Simon with the other agents and runs after Helen.
          She sprints through the trees, Harry pounding after her.  He
          grabs her and gets her in a headlock.  She bites the hell out
          of his arm.  Harry yells and lets her go, just as-- Keough runs
          up and matter-of-factly clips her on the head with his weapon.
          Standard operating procedure.  Which is why he can't understand
          why Harry punches him, knocking him down.

          Harry supports a sagging Helen, gesturing sharply to the other
          agents and going RRRRR-RRRR to make his point (since he can't
          talk without her recognizing his voice).  They head for the
          cars.

                                                      CUT TO:


    198   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM/OBSERVATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

          An empty room with a single stool under a light, and a large
          two-way mirror.  The door opens and Helen is escorted in by
          Keough, still wearing his jumpsuit.  Helen has a black hood
          over her head.  Keough undoes a pair of handcuffs, freeing her,
          then leaves quickly.

          Helen whips the hood off and blinks in the light.  She wheels
          at the sound of the door locking and runs to it.  Pulls twice
          on the handle, without effect.  She crosses to the mirror and
          peers at her reflection, trying to see if anyone is there on
          the other side.


    199   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS is a dark chamber.  We see Helen
          perfectly, peering in, though she sees nothing.  Harry and Gib,
          in silhouette, sit at a console.  Harry speaks into a
          microphone.

                              HARRY
                    Sit down.


    200   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          ON HELEN'S SIDE of the mirror we hear Harry's voice shifted by
          a DIGITAL PROCESSOR.  It is a cold booming mechanical voice.
          Harsh and inhuman.

                              VOICE (HARRY)
                    I said SIT DOWN.
                         (she does)
                    Who do you work for?

                              HELEN
                    Kettleman, Barnes and McGrath.
                    I'm a legal secretary.

                              VOICE (HARRY)
                    Of course.  Mrs. Tasker.  And
                    what were you going with the
                    international terrorist, Carlos
                    the Jackal?  Taking dictation?

                              HELEN
                    He said he was an American agent.


    201   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          INSIDE THE CONTROL room we can see Harry, Gib and, through the
          glass, Helen.  Their voices sound normal on this side.

                              HARRY
                    How long have you been a member
                    of his faction?

                              HELEN
                    I don't know anything about a
                    faction.  I just met Simon...  or
                    whatever his name is...  a couple
                    of weeks ago.  I barely know him.

                              GIB
                    That's not what it looked like
                    when we found you.

          Harry scowls at Gib in the dark.  Helen flushes, remembering.

                              HARRY
                    How did you meet him?

          FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:


    202   INT. MALL - DAY/FLASHBACK

          We see Helen sitting at table at a mall near where she works,
          having a cappucino and a croissant.

                              HELEN (V.O.)
                    About two weeks ago I was at the
                    mall, having coffee...

          Simon appears behind her, sort of stalking up to her.  He
          approaches quickly the last few steps and slips into the seat
          next to her.  His manner is furtive.  He keeps looking around,
          as if for hidden assasins.  He hands her a briefcase.

                              SIMON
                         (speaking very low)
                    Keep this for me.  I can't afford
                    to be taken with it.  National
                    security is at stake.  I'll
                    contact you if a can.  Okay?  Oh--

          He seems to suddenly spot something OFF CAMERA and dashes off
          the other way.


    203   EXT. BUSINESS DISTRICT - DAY/FLASHBACK

          Helen walks back to her office building, carrying the
          briefcase.  She keeps looking over her shoulder.


    204   INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY/FLASHBACK

          She has the briefcase on her desk while she works.  She keeps
          glancing at it as she types.  Finally she hunches over it and
          starts picking the locks with a paper clip.

          TIGHT ON SECOND LOCK, popping open.

          ON HELEN as she opens the case.  She gasps.

          INSIDE THE CASE are the following items:  A tiny camera, some
          loose tapes, some circuit diagrams, some transcripts that look
          like gibberish which must be ENCRYPTED, some street maps of
          Beirut, Rome and Berlin, and a Walther P.P.K.  PISTOL.  Helen,
          eyes wide, closes the case.


    205   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT / PRESENT

          Helen shrugs, finishing up her story.

                              HELEN
                    I should have gone to the police,
                    I suppose.

                              GIB
                    But you didn't.  Why not?

                              HELEN
                    I don't know.  I guess... I
                    wanted to see what would happen.

                              HARRY
                    What did happen?

                              HELEN
                    Three days later, he called me.
                    He told me to meet him at
                    Overlook Park.


    206   EXT. OVERLOOK PARK - SUNSET/FLASHBACK

          Through the trees is a sweeping view across the Potomac to
          Georgetown and Embassy Row.  Helen is sitting on a park bench
          when Simon shows up, sitting beside her.  She hands him the
          briefcase.

                              SIMON
                    Thank you.  You saved my life.
                    What's your name?

                              HELEN
                    Helen.

                              SIMON
                    You can call me Simon.
                         (he touches her hand)
                    You're very brave to do this...
                         (then notices the locks
                          have been opened)
                    You opened it.

                              HELEN
                    I just glances inside.


    207   EXT. OVERLOOK PARK - CLOSE UP ON SIMON

          CLOSE ON SIMON, looking right into her eyes.

                              SIMON
                         (solemn)
                    Then you know.


    208   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT / PRESENT

          Harry shakes his head and rubs his eyes, picturing the whole
          thing.

                              HARRY
                    Why did you continue to see him?

                              HELEN
                    He needed my help.

                              HARRY
                    Not because you were attracted to
                    him?

                              HELEN
                    No.

                              HARRY
                    You weren't attracted to him at
                    all?

                              HELEN
                    Well, maybe a little.

                              GIB
                    Is this a common thing for you?
                    Cheating?

                              HELEN
                    No!  Never!

                              GIB
                    So, it was your first time.

                              HELEN
                    I wasn't cheating!

                              HARRY
                    Tell me about your husband, Mrs
                    Tasker.

                              HELEN
                    Harry?  What can I say about
                    Harry?  He's a sales rep for a
                    computer company.

                              HARRY
                         (hard question for him)
                    Would you say he was boring,
                    then?

                              HELEN
                         (she sighs, nodding
                          fatalistically)
                    Yeah.  I suppose he is.

                              GIB
                    So sex with him isn't exactly
                    making your flag wave anymore.

          Harry cuffs him on the shoulder.  Signals with a scowl for him
          to stay out of it.  Gib smirks.  Harry's put him through enough
          shit the last couple of days, it's time for a couple digs.

                              HELEN
                    That's none of your goddamn
                    business!  What kind of questions
                    are these?

                              HARRY
                    You're in a lot of trouble, Mrs.
                    Tasker, so I suggest you
                    cooperate.  If we want to know
                    the most intimate details of your
                    life, you'd better tell us.

          Helen glowers at the mirror.  Her hands are shaking and she
          hates it that they can probably see she is afraid.

                              HELEN
                    My husband is a good man.

                              GIB
                    But he's not exactly ringing your
                    bell lately, right?  I mean--

          Harry covers the mike and whips around on Gib.

                              HARRY
                    Let me handle this part.  Do you
                    mind?
                         (to Helen)
                    Why did you go to Carlos'
                    hideout?

                              HELEN
                    He wanted me to go with him on a
                    mission, to pose as him wife.

                              HARRY
                    And you agreed?

                              HELEN
                    Yes.

                              HARRY
                         (amazed)
                    Why?

          Helen searches herself for the explanation.

                              HELEN
                    I don't know.  I guess I needed
                    something...

                              HARRY
                    What did you need?

                              HELEN
                    I needed to feel alive.  I wanted
                    to do something...  outrageous.
                    And... I don't know... it felt
                    good to be needed.  To be
                    trusted.  To be special.

          In verbalizing it she just feels smaller, more pathetic that
          she ever did.  She hates the unseen voices for making for try
          to explain her deepest, unvoiced needs.

                              HELEN
                    There's so much I wanted to do in
                    this life, and it's like I
                    haven't done any of it.  And the
                    sand's running out of the
                    hourglass.  I want to be able to
                    look back and say:  See!  I did
                    that.  It was wild and it was
                    reckless and outrageous and I
                    fucking did it!
                         (she glares at the
                          mirror)
                    And I frankly don't give a shit
                    if you understand this or not.

          Gib looks at Harry, eyebrows raised.  Whew!  Harry is studying
          his wife like she's some fantastic new species.

                              HARRY
                    This Simon.  Did you sleep with
                    him?

                              HELEN
                    No.

                              GIB
                         (covering the mike)
                    She's lying.

                              HARRY
                    You didn't have sexual relations
                    with him?

                              HELEN
                         (acidly)
                    Look, if you ask me everything
                    twice, this is going to take a
                    really long time.  And I have to
                    get home to my family.

                              GIB
                    You're not going anywhere.

          Helen loses it.  It is fury and fear, tears and rage all at
          once--

                              HELEN
                    Let me out of her!  Right now!

                              HARRY
                    Answer the question--

          She picks up her stool and charges toward the mirror, swinging
          it with all her might.  It bounces off harmlessly.

                              HELEN
                         (she swings again,
                          yelling)
                    I didn't sleep with him!
                         (and again--WHAM!)
                    You hear me, you chickenshit
                    bastards--

          WHAM!  She hits the mirror again.

                              GIB (INHUMAN VOICE)
                    Everyone tries.  It's
                    unbreakable.

          WHAM!  WHAM!  WHAM!  The mirror suddenly stars from side to
          side with huge cracks.  She's about to beat her way through it.


    209   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          INSIDE THE OBSERVATION ROOM Harry and Gib jump back.

                              GIB
                    She could be telling the truth.

                              HARRY
                         (to Helen)
                    Wait!  Calm down, Mrs. Tasker.
                    There is only one more question.

          Helen drops the stool.  She stands there panting.  Her fury
          spent, she begins to cry.

                              HELEN
                    What?

                              HARRY
                    Do you still love your husband?

                              HELEN
                         (softly)
                    Yes.

                              HARRY
                    Louder please.

                              HELEN
                    I love him.  I have always loved
                    him and I will always love him.
                         (she wipes at her eyes)
                    Can I go home, please?


    210   INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

          INSIDE THE OBSERVATION ROOM Harry states at her.  He smiles.

                              GIB
                    Now what?

                              HARRY
                         (leaning forward to the
                          mike)
                    There is only one solution to
                    your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You
                    must work for us.

                              GIB
                         (whispering to Harry)
                    Oh shit.  Harry... what're you
                    doing?

                              HARRY
                         (like: isn't it
                          obvious?)
                    I'm giving her an assignment.
                         (to Helen)
                    I am offerring you a choice.  If
                    you work for us we will drop the
                    charges and you can go back to
                    your normal life.  If not, you
                    will go to federal prison, and
                    your husband and daughter will be
                    left humiliated and alone.  Your
                    like will be destroyed.

                              HELEN
                    Oh, gee thanks.  Mmmm, let me see--

                              HARRY
                    Yes or no.

                              HELEN
                    What do you think?  Of course
                    yes!  What's involved?

                              HARRY
                    You will be contacted with the
                    assignment.

                              HELEN
                    My husband can't know about this.

                              HARRY
                    No one must know!  Especially
                    him.  You must appear to live
                    your life normally, conveying
                    nothing.  The security of this
                    nation depends on it.  Can you do
                    that?

                              HELEN
                    I think so.

                              HARRY
                    Think carefully.  You will be
                    lying to the man you love.  The
                    person who trusts you the most.

                              HELEN
                         (fearless)
                    I can do it!

                              HARRY
                    The code name of your contact
                    will be Boris.  Your code name
                    will be--

                              HELEN
                         (excited)
                    Natasha?

                              HARRY
                    No.  Doris.


    211   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          ON HELEN, not liking her wimpy code-name.


    212   EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

          The unit-seven van pulls up in the spooky shadows under the
          bridge, stopping next to Helen's red Accord.  The door slides
          open and Helen gets out, helped my black-garbed hands.  She is
          wearing her hood, which is whisked off by one of the hands.
          She whirls in time to see the door slide shut and the van speed
          off.  She watches it drive off into the night.


    213   EXT. ROCK QUARRY - NIGHT

          The van pulls up near the edge of a large quarry.  The door
          opens and Simon is pushed out, followed by Harry, who is in his
          black jumpsuit and wearing a ski-mask.  Gib follows as Harry
          guides Simon to the edge of a sheer drop.  Harry whips off the
          hood and Simon takes in his surroundings.

                              SIMON
                    Yeeaoowww!!

                              HARRY
                    You son of a bitch.  Did you
                    really think you could elude us
                    forever, Carlos?

                              SIMON
                    Wait!  You got the wrong guy.  My
                    name's Simon.  Look, just let me
                    go.  There's no need to kill me.
                    I haven't seen your--

          Harry whips off his ski-mask.

                              SIMON
                    -- face.  Shit!  Shit!!

          Simon has ducked his head and won't look at Harry.  Then it
          dawns...  He looks up, brightening hopefully.

                              SIMON
                    It's you!  Hey, you still
                    interested in that Vette at all?

                              GIB
                    You can drop it now, Carlos.  The
                    game is over.  Your career as an
                    inter-national terrorist is too
                    well documented.

                              SIMON
                    No... I sell cars.  That's all!
                    Not even foreign cars.  Nothing
                    international, I swear.  I'm no
                    terrorist.  Everything I said was
                    a lie... you have to believe me.
                    I'm actually a complete coward.
                    If I ever even saw a gun I'd--

          Harry whips his pistol out in one liquid motion and snaps the
          muzzle right in front of Simon's eyes.

                              SIMON
                    -- faint.  Aahhh!  Don't kill me.
                    I'm not a spy.  I'm nothing.  I'm
                    navel lint.  I have to lie to
                    women to get laid.  And I don't
                    score much.  It's pathetic.
                         (he looks down)
                    See, look... would a spy pee
                    himself?

          Harry is finally sickened by his grovelling.  He pulls Simon
          away from the edge, then gestures with his gun.

                              HARRY
                    Beat it.

                              SIMON
                    No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot
                    me.

          Harry starts back to the truck.  Simon stays right with him,
          facing him, terrified to turn away.  Like a dog following him.

                              SIMON
                    Please don't.  You can have the
                    car for free--

                              GIB
                    Take off, dipshit!

          Gib finally shoves Simon back and Harry contemptuously cranks
          THREE ROUNDS into the ground by his feet, forcing him to dance
          backward.  The two agents get into the van and tear off in a
          cloud of dust.  Leaving Simon alone in the moonlight, miles
          from nowhere.

                                                      CUT TO:


    214   INT./ EXT. SEDAN - DAY

          TIGHT ON LOCATOR SCREEN as a blip moves across the grid of city
          streets.  Gib drives while Harry watches the screen.

                              HARRY
                    We should pick up visual at the
                    next light.

          The scrambler phone in Harry's briefcase rings.  He picks it
          up.

                              HARRY
                    Morning, boss.


    215   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - DAY

          INTERCUT WITH SEDAN.  Spencer Trilby stands glowering as he
          talks to Harry.

                              TRILBY
                    Harry, this report on last
                    night's operation is the thinnest
                    piece of crap I've ever seen from
                    you.  I'm sure you won't mind
                    giving me a little more detail on
                    why all these assets were
                    deployed.


    216   INT./EXT. SEDAN - DAY

                              HARRY
                    Absolutely.  But can it wait?
                    I'm on a critical surveillance
                    right now.

          Harry spots something up ahead.  He snaps his fingers and
          points, then whips a pair of gyro-stabilized binoculars to his
          eyes.

          HARRY'S POV THROUGH SCOPE:  Trent, on the Yamaha with Dana on
          the back, rides through the intersection up ahead.  Dana bops
          to the sound coming over her walkman headphones as Trent zips
          between cars.  Gib makes the turn, pulling in behind them at a
          distance.

                              TRILBY
                    Harry.  Is there anything you
                    want to tell me?

                              HARRY
                         (innocently)
                    No.  Not that I can think of.

          THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ominously on Spencer Trilby.

                              TRILBY
                    Harry?  You know we never fire
                    anybody.

          Click.  Harry hangs up the phone slowly.

                              GIB
                    We're dead, right?  So...
                    where'd you put the transmitter?

                              HARRY
                    In her Walkman.  It's the one
                    thing I knew she'd be taking.


    217   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

          Harry walks toward the closed warehouse doors, past Trent's
          parked Yamaha.  We hear MUSIC from inside.


    218   INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

          INSIDE THE WAREHOUSE, we see what it is that Dana has been
          doing when she skips school.  A garage band of teenagers,
          mostly older than her, are playing loudly.  Dana has the
          microphone, belting out a punchy cover of the old Cream classic
          "Sunshine of Your Love".  The guitar parts have been industrial-
          ized, and it actually sounds pretty hip.

          Harry watches from the shadows, standing behind a pillar not
          far from the stage.  Watching his daughter gyrating in the
          spotlight.  His reaction is hard to read.


    219   INT. WAREHOUSE - CLOSE UP OF CIRCUIT-BREAKER - DAY

          TIGHT ON THE MASTER CIRCUIT-BREAKER as Harry's hand throws the
          switch.


    220   INT. WAREHOUSE - STAGE - DAY

          The stage is plunged into darkness and the music stops
          abruptly.  Before the band members can react, they hear the big
          metal doors rolling and sunlight blazes in.  Dana stares into
          the glare, seeing an ominous silhouette standing there.  The
          shadowy figure walks toward them.

                              FIGURE
                    You! Come with me.

          The figure comes straight toward Dana.  To her horror is turns
          out to be her dad.  Her heart stops.

                              DANA
                    Oh my Gooooood.


    221   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

          Harry appears through the doors, marching Dana by the arm.  He
          walks her over to some industrial junk nearby, overgrown with
          weeds, and sits her down for a talk.

          She is sullen, still mortified from getting dragged out in
          front of her friends.

                              HARRY
                    There are going to be some
                    changes Dana.  You're going to
                    start following some rules.  And
                    I'm going to be there to see that
                    you do.

                              DANA
                    Yeah, right.

                              HARRY
                    You're going to stay in school.
                    Do you understand?

                              DANA
                    Why?  So I can wind up like you?
                    What's the point?

          You think Harry's going to really rain on her parade.  But he
          doesn't.  He becomes very tender.  He pushes the hair back from
          her face.

                              HARRY
                    Did I tell you about the time we
                    first met?

          She looks up at him, puzzled?

                              HARRY
                    You were quite young at the time.
                    All wet and still attached to
                    your mom by a cord.  You opened
                    your eyes and looked right at me.
                    And I knew then I would always
                    love you with all my heart.

          Dana stares at her father with a dawning awareness.  This is
          not just some chump that she has to put up with.  This is her
          father.  He is a part of her.  No matter what happens they are
          in this thing together.  Tears start to run down her cheeks.

                              HARRY
                    Somewhere along the way I got
                    lost, honey.  I forgot about what
                    was really important.  I'm sorry
                    pump-- I mean--

          She grabs his in a fierce hug.  Harry closes his eyes, letting
          the moment purify him.

                              HARRY
                    Dana, regarding this singing--

          She pulls back, suddenly wary.  Oh shit.

                              HARRY
                         (grinning)
                    You were pretty good.


    222   INT. / EXT. SEDAN - DAY

          Dana sits wedged into the front seat between Gib and Harry.
          Father and daughter are singing raucously loud, with the
          windows down.

                              HARRY/ DANA
                    I've been waiting so long To be
                    where I'm going In the sunshine
                    of your looooove

          They crack up after the long sustain.  They are both suffused
          with a glow of rediscovery.  Harry pulls the car to the curb in
          front of Dana's school.

                              DANA
                    Dad, how come you know the words?

                              HARRY
                    Honey that song came out in 1968,
                    when I was exactly your age.

                              DANA
                    Unbelievable!  Trent told me he
                    wrote it.  He's history.


    223   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          The image of a family dinner.  Helen is avoiding Harry's eyes.
          Harry looks over at Dana and she gives him a tiny smile.  Then
          she rises from her half-finished dinner and heads out of the
          kitchen.

                              DANA
                    I'm done.

                              HELEN
                    Where are you off to young lady?

                              DANA
                         (pointing toward her
                          room)
                    I have a book report.

          Helen watches her go.  That's strange.

                              HARRY
                    So last night was pretty
                    exciting, huh?

                              HELEN
                         (alarmed)
                    What?
                         (then smoothly--)
                    Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I
                    thought the damn towtruck was
                    never going to get there.

          Harry smiles, reaching for more chicken.  The phone RINGS.
          Helen controls the urge to run to it.

                              HELEN
                    Hello?

                              METALLIC VOICE
                    Doris?

                              HELEN
                    Oh.  Yes?


    224   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - NIGHT

          GIB, AT OMEGA SECTOR, uses the SPEECH SYNTHESIZER to disguise
          his voice.

                              GIB
                    Listen carefully.  Go to the
                    Hotel Marquis in one hour.  Pick
                    up an envelope marked Doris at
                    the front desk.  And dress sexy.


    225   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          BACK ON HELEN as she reacts to that.

                              HELEN
                    What?

                              VOICE
                    Get going!
                         (CLICK)

                              HELEN
                         (thinking for a second,
                          then--)
                    Uh... well, okay then.  You sound
                    terrible.  I'll run out right
                    now.  Just call the prescription
                    in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no
                    problem.  Bye.

          Harry smirks, listening to her lie.  She's good.  The smirk
          drops as she turns.

                              HELEN
                    Allison is sick in bed.  I have
                    to go over there, honey.

                              HARRY
                    Sure, hon.

          She walks unhurriedly out of the room.  Behind her back, Harry
          is grinning.  The second Helen is out of his sight line, she
          runs up the stairs.  Harry waits a moment then picks up the
          phone.


    226   INT. OMEGA SECTOR/ ELECTRONIC LAB -- NIGHT

          Gib is in a corner of the electronics lab, in an area dedicated
          to DIGITAL AUDIO PROCESSING.  The phone in his briefcase rings.
          Gib answers.

                              GIB
                    You've reached a new low with
                    this one.  I can't believe you're
                    crazy enough to use the room at
                    the Marquis.

                              HARRY
                    Why not?  You think I can afford
                    a suite like that on my salary?
                    Is Jean-Claude done yet?                               *

          Gib looks over at a SOUND RECORDING BOOTH nearby.  In it a FAT   *
          FRENCH AGENT, JEAN-CLAUDE is doing voice recording from a hand-  *
          written page.

                              GIB
                    Not quite.


    227   INT. OMEGA SECTOR - INSIDE THE BOOTH - NIGHT

          We hear Jean-Claude record a line on a tiny DAT tape recorder.   *
          He speaks with a cosmopolitan French accent.  Close your eyes    *
          and he's Charles Boyer.

                              JEAN-CLAUDE                                  *
                    No no.  Do it slowly.  Very
                    slowly.


    228   OMITTED                                                          *


    229   INT. HOTEL MARQUIS - NIGHT

          A big luxury hotel downtown, with an opulent lobby.  Helen
          enters, looking different than we have ever seen her.  She has
          been commanded to be sexy, and she is.  Her black slinky dress
          is cut at mid-thigh, showing some good legs we haven't been
          aware of.  She's pulled her hair back and added pearls.  Now
          she looks elegant and hot.  Playing the role.


    230   INT. HOTEL - FRONT DESK - NIGHT

          She goes to the front desk and signals the ASSISTANT MANAGER
          with her eyes.  He comes over to her.

                              HELEN
                    Do you have an envelope for
                    Doris?

          The man nods.  Saying nothing, he reaches under the counter and
          hands her the envelope.  She opens it as she walks across the
          lobby.  In contains a room key, a small bugging device, and a
          phone number.


    231   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

          TIGHT ON A PAY PHONE as Helen finishes dialing the number.  She
          scans the lobby as the phone rings--

                              METALLIC VOICE
                    Listen.  You are a prostitute
                    named Michelle.  Go to the room.
                    A man will be there.  He is a
                    suspected arms dealer.

                              HELEN
                    Do I have to... you know-- ?

                              VOICE
                    No.  He has particular tastes.
                    He likes to watch.  You will say
                    his regular girl, Carla, is sick.
                    If he likes you, he will tell you
                    what to do.  You must plant the
                    bug near the telephone, by the
                    bed, before you leave.  If you do
                    not accomplish your mission, the
                    deal is off.


    232   INT. HOTEL/ TENTH FLOOR - NIGHT

          Helen exits an elevator and walks down the long hallway toward
          the suite.  She stops by a mirror and checks her look.  Decides
          she is too uptown.  She pulls the neckline of her dress down so
          it shows more shoulder, then hitches up the hem.  Ditches the
          pearls.  Puts on some red lipstick.

          Now she doesn't look hot and elegant... just hot.  She
          practices a slinky walk, getting into the role.

          Suddenly she remembers her wedding ring.  She pulls on it.  It
          probably hasn't been off in years.  She licks her finger and     *
          twists it off.  Yoww!  She puts it on her right hand and turns   *
          the modest diamond palm-side in .  .  .  Out of site.  Then,     *
          reading the number off the key, she goes to the room and
          unlocks the door.


    233   INT. SUITE - NIGHT

          Helen comes in hesitantly.  The lights are off.  The suite is
          large and richly furnished, with a breathtaking view of the
          city.  It is the room Harry was using, posing as Renquist.  A
          FRENCH-ACCENTED VOICE comes from the next room.

                              VOICE
                    In here.

          She goes into the bedroom.  There is a dark figure sitting in
          a chair, just a silhouette.

                              MAN
                    Step into the light.

          It is a corner room.  The drapes on one side are closed,
          shadowing the man, but open on the other just enough to let in
          a slash of moonlight.  She steps forward into it.

          TIGHT CLOSE UP on the figure.  We can just make out that it is
          Harry, though Helen cannot.  TILT DOWN to show his hand, out of
          sight behind the chair-arm, as he manipulates the pause button
          on the DAT tape deck.

                              HELEN
                    I'm Michelle.  Carla's sick.  She
                    thought you might like me, so --

          Harry goes SSSSHHHH.  Silencing her gently.  He silently clicks
          off the PAUSE button.  The DAT recorder plays.  Charles Boyer,
          deep and hypnotic, speaks from Harry's outline.  Harry
          lipsynchs.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Let me do the talking.  You are                        *
                    very pretty.  You may start by                         *
                    unzipping your dress.

          PAUSE button.  She starts to yank the zipper down.               *

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    No no.  Do it slowly.  Very
                    slowly.

          Helen turns her back to him, and draws the zipper down           *
          languorously, revealing her creamy back.  She is not wearing a   *
          bra.                                                             *

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now slip the dress down...                             *
                    slowly.

          Helen is starting to get into the ritual.  She lets the dress    *
          slip off her shoulders.  It slides down her body to the floor.   *
          She steps out of it, still in high heels.                        *

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now slide the nylons off one by
                    one.

                              HELEN
                         (puzzled)
                    I'm not wearing any.

          Harry winces.  He starts the next line immediately.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    That's good.  Now the panties.                         *

          The ritual continues as she strips slowly (this will be
          tastefully done).  She conceals the bugging device in her hand
          as she sets her clothes on the bed near the phone.  Helen is
          still concentrating on her mission.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now turn, cheri, in the
                    moonlight.  Let your body flow
                    like water.

          She turns.  Her skin is beautiful in the silvery light.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now dance for me.  Go on.

          Helen has no idea what to do, but she improvises quite well.
          The scrutiny of the shadowed man, who is fully clothed, and her
          raw vulnerability are a quiveringly powerful erotic
          combination.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Let your hands be a lover's hands
                    on your own skin as you move.
                    Yes, that's it.

          TIGHT ON Harry's eyes as he studies her.  His game, meant to
          give her a dangerous fantasy, is actually turning him on
          mightily.  He is amazed to see her playing the role, getting
          into it.  This is not the Helen is thought he knew for sixteen
          years.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Now, lie on the bed and close
                    your eyes.

          She does.  Harry rises and goes to her, bringing the tape deck.

                              HARRY (TAPE)
                    Keep them closed.  Do not open
                    them.

          He sits on the bed, next to her, but without touching her.  He
          strokes her hair, lovingly.  Then runs his fingertips over her
          eyes, down her cheeks.  To her it feels delicate and delicious.
          Part of her is enjoying this a lot.  But Helen is torn between
          wanting to flee and knowing that nothing the man has done so
          far is enough to cause her to abort her mission.

                              HELEN
                    I thought you only liked to
                    watch.

          Harry goes SSSHHH.  It's all he can do.  He bends over her and
          brings his lips slowly down to her.  He touches them to hers so
          slowly that she barely knows he is kissing her.  Then he takes
          her in a passionate kiss.

          And she grabs the lamp on the bedside table and SMASHES IT OVER
          HIS HEAD.  Harry flies off onto the floor, groaning and
          semiconscious.

          Helen flips on the light and grabs her clothes, starting to
          dress rapidly.  She still doesn't recognize Harry, who is face
          down.  He groans and starts to rise.  She kicks him in the ribs
          and finishes putting her dress on.  She sticks the bug under
          the night table and grabs her shoes.  Mission accomplished,
          motherfuckers.

          Harry grabs her ankle.  She raises one shoe to kosh him again,
          and sees who it is.  Freezeframe.  Total shock.  She can't even
          form the question.

                              HELEN
                    Harry-- ?!


    234   INT. SUITE DOOR - NIGHT

          CRASH!!  The door lock is shattered by tremendous force and
          THREE MEN burst into the room.  We may recognize them as
          workers from Juno's shop.  They are wielding pistols and are
          clearly part of Malik's terrorist brigade.

          Harry is still groggy, and he doesn't want to start anything
          with Helen there, and risk her getting shot.  He acquiesces as
          they pull him to his feet.

                              HELEN
                    He's got nothing to do with this.
                    It's me you want, right?

                              HARRY
                         (to lead TERRORIST)
                    Let the hooker go.  She's not
                    important.

                              HELEN
                    Harry, be quiet.  Let me handle
                    this.

                              LEAD TERRORIST
                    Shutup, both of you.

          During this exchange, the thugs have handcuffed Harry's hands
          behind his back.  The leader gestures to one of the men to
          bring Helen along.  Helen and Harry are dragged roughly out of
          the room with pistol-muzzles stuck in their ribs.


    235   INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

          The door from the corridor bangs open and the thugs hustle
          Harry and Helen down the fire-escape stairs.

                              HELEN
                    Listen, you don't need him, he's
                    nothing.  He's a sales rep for a
                    computer company, really--

          The thug leader cuffs her across the head to shut her up.

                              HELEN
                    That was unnecessary.


    236   INT. HOTEL BASEMENT - NIGHT                                      *

          A stairwell door opens and the terrorists rush Harry and Helen   *
          through the basement labyrinth.                                  *

                              HELEN
                    What were you doing there?

                              HARRY
                    You wouldn't believe me.

          A pistol muzzle is jammed hard behind Helen's ear.

                              TERRORIST LEADER
                    Talk again, I kill you.

          They are hustled across a loading dock to a RENTAL VAN waiting   *
          with the door open.  A fourth terrorist slides the van door      *
          shut after they get in and gets in behind the wheel.  The van    *
          takes off.

                                                      CUT TO:              *

    237   OMITTED                                                          *


    238   EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          The rental van pulls up to a G-3 JET warming up outside a
          private hanger.  The van doors open and the hostages are
          brought out.  Harry sees a long black LIMO pulling up behind
          the van.  The driver, an enormous man names AKBAR, hurries to
          open the passenger door.  A slender pair of ankles emerge,
          followed by the rest of Juno Skinner, looking devastatingly
          beautiful but now quite sinister.

          To Helen it is like a living James Bond film, with the jet, the
          limo, the terrorists, and now an exotic femme fatale, dressed
          to kill, approaching them.

                              JUNO
                         (with a wry smile)
                    Hello, Harry.

                              HARRY
                    Juno.  I wish I could say it's a
                    pleasure to see you again.

                              HELEN
                    You know her?

          Juno signals with her eyes and the terrorists march the
          prisoners toward the plane.

                              JUNO
                    Who's your little friend?

                              HELEN
                    I'm Helen Tasker.  Harry's my
                    husband.  And you are?

                              JUNO
                         (to Harry)
                    So now it's Tasker?  Not
                    Renquist?


    239   INT. G-3 JET - NIGHT

          They enter the luxurious passenger cabin of the plane.  Helen
          has never seen anything like this.

                              HELEN
                    Look, Harry's not part of this.
                    He's just a sales rep.

                              JUNO
                    No, my dear, he is a federal
                    agent.  He killed two of my
                    colleagues the other night.

                              HELEN
                    No, you don't understand, we've
                    been married for 15 years--

                              HARRY
                    Look, Juno, this is just some
                    whacko hooker I met in the bar.

          AKBAR and the other terrorists push Helen and Harry into seats
          and strap them in.

                              HELEN
                    Harry, what's the matter with
                    you?  Tell them the truth.  We're
                    married, we have a daughter--

                              HARRY
                         (looking at Helen
                          contemptuously)
                    I don't know what this crazy
                    bitch is on.  You should just cut
                    her loose, so we can get down to
                    business.

                              HELEN
                    Oh yeah?  Oh yeah?  Then where
                    did I get this?

          Helen grabs the locket, dangling on a chain around her neck,
          and opens it to show Juno.

          THE PICTURE IN THE LOCKET -- Harry and Helen together, smiling.

          Harry roles his eyes.  Great, Helen.  A FLIGHT HOSTESS walks up
          carrying a tray.  Juno smiles graciously at Helen.

                              JUNO
                    Something before take-off?

          The hostess whips a PNEUMATIC INJECTOR off the tray and zaps
          Helen in the shoulder.

                              HELEN
                    Oooowww!!  That hurt.  You biii--

          She slumps.  Juno looks at Harry.

                              JUNO
                    She was telling the truth, wasn't
                    she Harry?  She really doesn't
                    know.  Interesting.

          Juno nods and the hostess zaps Harry.  He slides into
          unconsciousness as the plane engines begin to SCREAM.


    240   EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT

          The G-3 lifts into the night sky, turning south.


    241   EXT. PIER - NIGHT

          A small FREIGHTER is tied up to a half-crumbling pier.  Next to
          the pier is a dilapidated corrugated-metal warehouse building,
          two stories high.  There are floodlights on the dock but beyond
          is black night, with the ghostly shapes of mangroves and palms.
          It is an abandoned facility on what appears to be a tiny island
          in the Caribbean.

          There is a lot of activity.  Three U-RENT TRUCKS are parked by
          the warehouse, as well as some other vehicles.  About thirty
          men, clearly CRIMSON JIHAD TERRORISTS are busy at various
          activities.  Many of them carry AK47 assault rifles.

          MALIK is supervizing them as they finish unloading a tarp-
          covered object about 15 feet high from the ship.  A rusting
          gantry crane trundles it into the warehouse.  Malik looks up as
          an AEROSPATIALE HELICOPTER thunders toward them over the black
          Caribbean water.

          The helicopter lands and Juno steps down from the front door.
          The sliding door is opened and Akbar and the others pull a
          groggy Harry and Helen out of the aircraft.  They are covered
          by hoods.

          Malik walks up to them and pulls their hoods off.  Harry takes
          in his surroundings and looks back into the eyes of Malik.
          Lethal energy flows between them.

                              MALIK
                    Who is this woman?

                              JUNO
                    His wife.

                              MALIK
                         (seeing the
                          possibilities)
                    His wife?  Good.  Bring them.


    242   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          Malik leads the entourage into the warehouse, where brilliant
          floodlights illuminate--

          THREE HUGE STONE FIGURES, lined up in the middle of the space.
          The tarp is removes from the object they just unloaded,
          revealing a FOURTH STATUE.  The figures are cracked and
          obscured by centuries, but they are unmistakably warriors
          mounted on horseback.  The legs and arms are missing on some,
          but the massive heads and necks remain.

                              JUNO
                    Incredible, aren't they?  Warrior
                    figures from the Persian Empire
                    of Darius the First, around 500
                    BC.  I call them "The Four
                    Horsemen".

          She approaches the nearest figure, caressing its flank.  A man
          with a jackhammer steps up to her.

                              JUNO
                    They're absolutely priceless.

          She shrugs and nods to the man with the jackhammer.  He blasts
          right into the body of one of the Horseman, destroying it.
          Stone fragments fall away, revealing a cavity cut with great
          precision inside the figure.

          Inside is a BRIGHT METAL CONTAINER.  Four terrorists pull it
          out and set it on the ground.  It is six feet long and coffin-
          like.  Malik steps up to it, his eyes glistening.  A hush has
          fallen over the group.

                              MALIK
                    Open it.

          The latches are released and the lid lifted.  Inside is
          machined metal object, roughly conical, about five feet long.
          Malik signals to Harry to step closer and look.

                              MALIK
                    Do you know what this is?

                              HARRY
                    Can you give me a clue?  It could
                    be a water heater for all I know.

          Malik grabs Helen, jerking her roughly forward.  He whips out
          a knife and inserts the point under Helen's jaw, forcing her
          head back and drawing blood.

                              MALIK
                    Do you know why you have been
                    brought here?

                              HELEN
                    N-no.

                              MALIK
                    So that this man can verify to
                    the world that Crimson Jihad is
                    now a nuclear power.

                              HELEN
                    How can Harry do that?  He's a
                    salesman for chrissakes.

                              MALIK
                    If we were wrong about him...
                    then the last thing you see will
                    be your blood spraying in his
                    face.

          Harry steps forward, his face grim.

                              HARRY
                    This is a Soviet MIRV-Six, from
                    an SS-22N launch vehicle.  The
                    warhead contains 14.5 kilos of
                    enriched uranium, with a
                    plutonium trigger.  The nominal
                    yield is 10 kilotons.
                         (in Arabic, subtitled)                            *
                    Release her and I'll cooperate.

          Malik lowers the knife from her jaw.  He turns away from her
          like she has ceased to exist and yells at the terrorists to
          remove the other weapons.  Jackhammers tear into the stone
          figures.

          Helen is just staring at Harry, her mouth open.  He turns to
          her, not knowing what to say.  He shrugs sheepishly.

                              HARRY
                    What can I say?  I'm a spy.

          She just looks at him for a long time.  She moves closer,
          staring and staring, letting it sink in.  Then she hauls off
          and slugs him right in the jaw so hard is almost knocks him
          down.

                              HELEN
                    You bastard!!  You lying son of
                    a bitch!!

          Terrorists grabs her and restrain her.  She starts to cry.

                              HARRY
                    I'm sorry, honey.

                              HELEN
                    Don't call me honey!  You don't
                    ever get to call me honey again.
                    You understand?!  You pig!

          Juno looks at them both and laughs.  She offers Helen a tissue.

                              JUNO
                    Here you go, dear.

          NEARBY, Akbar is going through the contents of Helen's handbag
          and Harry's wallet.  He rips open the bottom stitching and
          pulls out the geo-positioning transmitter.

                              AKBAR
                    Abu!  Look at this!                                    *

          Malik looks at the tracker and then smashes it to the floor.
          Helen looks at the crushed transmitter.  She stares at Harry
          with dawning realization.

                              HELEN
                    You bugged me?!!

          Juno cracks up at this.


    243   INT. CITATION JET - NIGHT

          The jet has become a mobile tactical-command center, with Gib,   *
          Faisil, and several other agents working out of portable         *
          equipment cases.  Faisil looks up from a computer screen         *
          suddenly.

                              FAISIL                                       *

          Gib goes up to the cockpit.  They are on approach and the
          lights of Miami fill the front window.

    244   INT. WAREHOUSE - NO NAME KEY - NIGHT

          TIGHT ON BLACK AND WHITE VIEWFINDER IMAGE of the terrorists'
          handycam.  Harry is speaking directly into the camera,
          finishing up his message.

                              HARRY
                    ...and I can verify that they
                    have the arming box and all                            *
                    equipment necessary to detonate
                    the four warheads.  This is
                    absolutely the real thing,
                    gentlemen.

          The camera swings off Harry to Malik, standing before the rest
          of the Jihad warriors, who are assembled behind the four bombs.

                              MALIK
                    You have killed our women and                          *
                    children, bombed our cities from
                    afar like cowards, and dare to
                    call us terrorists--

          Over the image of Malik, a LOW-BATTERY warning begins to flash.

          CUT TO SCENE, as Malik speaks into the camera, which is head by
          one of his men.  The CAMERAMAN is sweating, wondering if he
          should interrupt.  He gulps nervously as Malik drones on.

                              MALIK
                    -- But now the Oppressed have                          *
                    been given a mighty sword, to                          *

                    forces out of the Persian Gulf
                    area, immediately and forever,
                    Crimson Jihad will rain fire on
                    one major US city each week until
                    these demands are met...

          BACK TO VIEWFINDER IMAGE.  BATTERY warning flashing faster.

                              MALIK
                    ... First one weapon will be
                    detonated on this uninhabited
                    island as a demonstration of

                    willingness to be humanitarian.
                    However, if there demands are not--

          In a burst of static the image GOES BLACK.

          The cameraman nervously lowers the camera, ashen faced.
          Malik's eyes are black with murder.

                              CAMERAMAN
                    Battery, Abu.

                              MALIK
                    Get another one, you moron!


    245   INT. BUILDING - NIGHT

          A filthy, crumbling cinderblock building (near the warehouse).
          A few bare light bulbs with bugs zipping around then, and no
          glass in the windows.  Harry and Helen are brought in by two
          TERRORIST GUARDS.  Juno follows then into the bleak room.
          Guards shackle them to steel chairs with handcuffs.

          A MAN enters the room carrying a small suitcase.  He has skull-
          like features.  He opens the suitcase and Harry has a good view
          of the contents:  medical instruments, needle-probes, drills,
          Dremel tools with saw blades.

                              JUNO
                    This is Samir.  See if you can
                    guess his specialty.

                              HARRY
                    Oral hygiene?

                              JUNO
                    Not exactly.

                              HELEN
                         (scared)
                    What's going on, Harry?

                              JUNO
                    Samir is just going to ask Harry
                    a few questions.  See, we're not
                    even sure which agency Harry
                    works for.  Now, Samir is
                    absolutely first class, but on
                    the other hand we have Harry,
                    here, who has managed to lie
                    convincingly to the woman he
                    loves for 15 years.  So it will
                    be interesting to see how long he
                    can resist.

                              SAMIR
                         (holding up a syringe)
                    This will help.

          Samir injects Harry in the arm with the syringe.

                              HARRY
                    You know, you should swab that
                    with alcohol.  I might get an
                    infection.

                              SAMIR                                        *
                    I'll return when this has taken                        *
                    effect.  Then we'll talk.                              *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    I'm looking forward to it.                             *

          Samir exits.                                                     *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    Why are you helping these raving
                    psychotics.

                              JUNO
                    Because they're very well-funded
                    raving psychotics, and I'm
                    getting a lot of money.

          She kneels down in front of Harry, stroking his leg.

                              JUNO
                    You think I care about their                           *
                    cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.                         *
                    See, America is on top now .  .                        *
                    .  but so was Rome, once.  All                         *
                    civilizations crumble.  One
                    nation succeeding over another.
                    What does it mean in the long
                    run?  The only important thing is
                    to live well.  And...  living                          *
                    well takes money.                                      *

                              HARRY
                    You're damaged goods, lady.

          Harry's words are beginning to be slightly slurred.  The drugs
          are taking effect.

                              JUNO
                         (indicating Helen)
                    Did you tell her about us, Harry?

                              HARRY
                    There is no us, you psychotic
                    bitch.

                              JUNO
                    Sure.  Say that now.

          Juno puts her arms around him and kisses him passionately.  She
          breaks, looking at Helen to savor the effect.  Helen is
          trembling with rage.

                              JUNO
                    Thanks for everything, Harry.  It
                    was good while it lasted.

          Juno crosses to the guard and takes a hand-grenade off his
          belt.  Then she goes to Helen and places it between her knees.
          She pushes Helen's knees together to hold the spoon against the
          grenade then pulls the pin.

                              JUNO
                    Now just keep your knees
                    together, and you'll be fine.

                              HELEN
                    Something you obviously have a
                    hard time doing!

                              JUNO
                    Hold that thought.

          Juno leaves.  Harry looks dopily at Helen.

                              HARRY
                    There was nothing.  I swear.

          Helen doesn't believe him, and why should she.  She looks up     *
          from staring at the grenade, to see that Harry's head has
          slumped forward.

                              HELEN
                    What did he give you?

                              HARRY
                         (groggy)
                    Sodium amytal, maybe some other
                    truth agent.

                              HELEN
                    It makes you tell the truth?

                              HARRY
                    Yes.

                              HELEN
                    Is it working yet?

                              HARRY
                    Ask me a question I would
                    normally lie to.

                              HELEN
                    Are we going to die?

                              HARRY
                    Yup.                                                   *

                              HELEN                                        *
                    I'd say it's working.

                              HARRY                                        *
                    They'll either torture us to
                    death, shoot us in the head, or
                    leave us until the bomb goes off.

                              HELEN                                        *
                    Okay, okay.  I get it.  How long                       *
                    have you been a spy, Harry?

                              HARRY
                    17 years.

                              HELEN
                    My God.  Have you had to...  have
                    sex with other women in the line
                    of duty?

                              HARRY
                    I don't take those assignments.

                              HELEN
                    What about Juno?

                              HARRY
                    She's really a fox, isn't she?

                              HELEN
                    Did you pork her Harry?

                              HARRY
                    No.
                         (pause)
                    But I wanted to.

                              HELEN
                         (crying)
                    Are you a total lying,
                    scumsucking pig Harry?

                              HARRY
                    Looks that way.


    246   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          ON MALIK as he pokes through Harry and Helen's stuff on the
          table.  He picks up Helen's wallet and opens it.  ECU WALLET -
          a picture of Harry, Helen and Dana.  Malik stares at it a
          moment.  Then motions to one of his men.


    267   INT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT

          Samir lifts Harry's head and sees that he is pretty shitfaced.

                              SAMIR
                    Is there anything you would like
                    to tell me before we start?

                              HARRY
                    Yes.  I'm going to kill you
                    pretty soon.

                              SAMIR
                         (calmly preparing his
                          instruments)
                    I see.  How exactly?

                              SAMIR
                    Well, I thought I'd break your
                    neck, then use you as a human
                    shield, then kill the guard with
                    that knife there on your table
                    and take his gun.

          Samir approaches Harry with a long steel needle probe.

                              SAMIR
                         (humoring Harry)
                    And what makes you think you can
                    do all that?

                              HARRY
                    Because I picked the lock on
                    these handcuffs...

          He holds them up to show Samir.  Then he explodes out of the
          chair-- Breaks the torturer's neck-- Spins him between himself
          and the guard-- Who then hesitates to fire-- Giving Harry the
          split second he needs to grab the knife from the table and
          throw it into the guard's eye, killing him instantly.

          Helen is flat blown away.  Wow.  It only took a few seconds for
          Harry to reverse the situation.  Her Harry!  He picks up the
          guard's 9mm pistol and staggers over to her.

                              HARRY
                    Don't move.

          He kneels down in front of her.  Gently he slips his hands
          between her thighs, getting a grip on the grenade, then sliding
          his fingers slowly over the spoon to hold it securely.

          He stops moving, suddenly.  She realizes with a sudden jolt of
          terror that he has frozen.

                              HELEN
                    What is it?

                              HARRY
                         (staring transfixed)
                    God, you have great legs.

                              HELEN
                    Harry... snap out of it!

          She sees how shitfaced he is.  He holds the grenade up, gripped
          safely so the spoon can't fly off.

                              HARRY
                    Go it, baby.


    248   EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

          Harry and Helen emerge from the building, creeping through the
          shadows.  She stops him for a second.  Gets very close to him,
          whispering, crouched in the shadows.

                              HELEN
                    Tell me something before this
                    stuff wears off and you start
                    lying again.

                              HARRY
                    What?

                              HELEN
                    Do you still love me?

                              HARRY
                    Yes.

                              HELEN
                    As much as you used to?

                              HARRY
                    No.
                         (she deflates)
                    Much more.

          She looks into his eyes, and knows he is telling the truth.

                              HELEN                                        *
                         (grinning)                                        *
                    It wore off.

          At that moment, they hear yelling from the cinder-block
          building.

                              HARRY
                    They found the bodies.  Come on--


    249   EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT

          Harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of
          the mangrove swamp.  A LIGHT HITS THEM.  TWO TERRORISTS,
          running around the corner, open fire with AK47s just as Harry
          and Helen reach a cluster of palm trees.  The trunks explode     *
          with bullet hits as they run through the darkness.               *

          As the two terrorists move through the trees, Harry lunges from  *
          the shadows and grabs one from behind.  He wrests his rifle      *
          away and swings it at the other, knocking his AK down.  The      *
          first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him, but Harry
          grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner.
          Then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two-
          hand neck-breaker-- SNAP.

          Two more run around the corner of a building.  Harry stomps his  *
          foot down on one of the AKs, which is lying across a log.  It    *
          flips into the air and he catches it in firing position .  .     *
          .  and takes them out with two well-aimed bursts.  Helen comes   *
          out of the shadows staring at Harry in amazement.  His shirt is
          ripped, he is scratched and bleeding, holding an assault rifle   *
          expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal.             *

                              HELEN
                    I married Rambo.                                       *

          He grabs her and kisses her passionately.

                              HARRY
                    Let's go.

    254   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          LOOKING DOWN FROM A CATWALK on the activity below the four
          horsemen statues and several utility trucks almost fill the
          floorspace.  A rental truck is being loaded with conventional
          weapons, including machine guns and several HAND-LAUNCHED
          STINGER MISSILES.  One of the nukes has been lowered into a pit
          cut in the concrete floor.  Malik and most of the terrorists
          are gathered around it.

          A GUARD, F.G.  on the catwalk, watches intently from the
          railing.  So intently that he doesn't head Harry sneak up on
          him.  SNAP.  Harry catches the guard's MAC-10 machine pistol
          before it can hit the floor.  He and Helen crouch behind a
          steel pillar, watching the proceedings below.  Helen keeps
          glancing at the dead guard, killed so effortlessly a moment
          before by her husband.  It is all surreal.

          BELOW, MALIK is shouting in his native language.  He pulls a
          chain from around his neck and holds up a METAL ARMING KEY.
          Then jumps down into the pit and inserts it into the warhead's
          arming computer.  Harry is listening intently, translating for
          Helen.

                              HARRY
                    In ninety minutes a pillar of                          *
                    holy fire will rise at this place                      *
                    as a sign to out enemies.                              *
                         (Malik theatrically
                          turns the arming key)
                    It is done...

          Malik jumps out of the pit.  He signals and terrorists pour
          concrete into the pit, covering the bomb.  He begins ranting
          again.

                              HARRY
                    Now no man can stop us.  We are
                    set on our course.  No force can
                    stop us...
                         (as libbing)
                    ... we're cool, we're badass,
                    blah blah.


    255   INT. WAREHOUSE - DOWN BELOW - NIGHT

          Malik raises his fist and chants some Crimson Jihad slogans.
          The terrorists echo and chant and then cheer, firing their guns
          in the air.  Harry pulls Helen back as ricochets clatter all
          over the inside of the metal building.

          Malik shouts something and all the terrorists go back to work
          at double time.  They are loading warheads Two and Three onto
          trucks (one per truck) and the last, number Four, is being
          wheeled out on a cart to the Aerospatiale outside.


    256   INT. WAREHOUSE - ON CATWALK - NIGHT

                              HELEN
                    If we're on an island, why are
                    they using trucks?

                              HARRY
                    We must be in the Florida Keys .                       *
                    .  .  the Overseas Highway                             *
                    connects the islands to the
                    mainland.

                              HELEN                                        *
                    So there's no border, no customs.                      *
                    They can just drive anywhere they                      *
                    want .  .  .  there's nothing to                       *
                    stop them .  .  .

                              HARRY
                    Just us.

                              HELEN
                    What are you going to do?

                              HARRY
                         (shrugs, like: what do
                          you think?)
                    Go down there and kill everybody,
                    I guess.

          He hands her the MAC-10.  She holds it clumsily.

                              HELEN
                    Oh shit.

                              HARRY
                    Wait here.  If you have to use
                    this, use it.  Don't choke.
                    Okay?

          She nods gamely and Harry starts down the steel stairs to the
          floor below.


    257   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

          ON HARRY, reaching the floor.  He slips behind some packing
          crates.  Then swings into action-- He hurls the grenade as hard
          as he can, down to the other end of the building.  KABOOM!!  He
          uses the distraction to move forward.  But it goes wrong almost
          right away...  A TERRORIST comes around a corner behind him,
          shouts-- Harry dives for cover as the guy fires, but-- He trips
          on a pipe and goes sprawling-- Losing the AK47, which slides
          under some equipment and-- Seven terrorists run toward him,
          with guns raised.

                              HARRY
                         (to Helen)
                    SHOOT!!


    258   INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT

          HELEN fires a burst at the terrorists, actually hitting one!
          But-- The recoil knocks her back, into a metal column, and the
          gun

          FLIES OUT OF HER HANDS.
          It falls to the metal steps and hits-- Going off.  B-B-BLAM!
          The burst kills two more terrorists, and-- The Mac-10
          cartwheels and hits further down.  ANOTHER BURST.  Another
          terrorist is splattered.

          It spins and hits another step-- ANOTHER RANDOM BURST
          MIRACULOUSLY KILLS THE LAST TWO TERRORISTS!!

          She has inadvertently saved her husband.  Harry looks up from
          behind cover-- to see all seven dead.  Now it's his turn to be
          amazed.  He signals to her to run... get off the exposed
          catwalk.  She makes it through the door to the outside stairs
          as bullets start hitting the steel walls behind her.


    259   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT

          A TERRORIST with a knife runs at the unarmed Harry.  Harry
          snatches up a jack-hammer and BRAT-TAT-TAT-- Drives it into the
          guy's chest.  Then he-- Grabs an AK from one of the fallen
          terrorists and opens fire.  Malik shouts to the drivers of the
          trucks to get going.  The other terrorists return fire at Harry--
          Who sprints from cover to cover, reaching a side door-- Where
          he rakes one of the passing trucks with a burst-- But
          terrorists behind him in the building have a clear shot and
          rounds hit the wall next to him as he-- Dives through the door--


    260   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          --landing outside.  He takes cover behind an aircraft REFUELING
          TRUCK.  Not a good place.  He is pinned down by automatic
          weapons fire.  He looks around for Helen, who is--


    261   EXT. WAREHOUSE - BEHIND A FORKLIFT - NIGHT

          50 yards away.  She is unarmed and unable to help.


    262   EXT. WAREHOUSE - BEHIND A REFUELING TRUCK - NIGHT

          HARRY cranks up the pump on the refueling truck and grabs the
          nozzle of the hose.  He opens the flow and-- A stream of JET-
          FUEL blasts out of the nozzle and-- Harry fires his AK right
          across the nozzle-- The muzzle-blast ignites the av-gas and he
          has a flame thrower with a 70 foot reach.

          Harry, lit demonically by the inferno, paints the whole area,
          setting vehicles afire, and scattering the terrorists.


    263   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          Through the flames and smoke he sees one of the men hand Malik
          a LAW rocket.  Malik snaps it to his shoulder, preparing to
          fire.


    264   EXT. DOCK - NIGHT

          Harry runs toward the edge of the dock thirty feet away as--
          MALIK fires.  The rocket shoots toward the truck and-- Harry
          leaps toward the dark water as-- KABOOOM!  Behind him the gas
          truck EXPLODES IN A HUGE FIREBALL.


    265   EXT. UNDERWATER - OFF THE DOCK - NIGHT

          ANGLE LOOKING UP, UNDERWATER, AS HARRY HITS THE WATER AND
          dives down.  An instant later a sheet of fire sweeps across the
          surface above him.  Harry kicks hard, trying to swim beyond the
          inferno above him so he can surface.


    266   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON HELEN, watching the burning wreckage of the gas truck.

                              HELEN
                    Oh my God.  Harry.

          A PISTOL ENTERS FRAME.  Its muzzle taps the back of her head.
          She gasps and turns to see-- JUNO, holding the weapon expertly.

                              JUNO
                    My condolences to the window.                          *

          Juno grabs her and yanks her to her feet.  Helen SLAPS JUNO      *
          HARD.  Juno has a slash across her cheek.  Blood trickles down.  *
          She grabs Helen's hand and viciously turns it, seeing the        *
          wedding ring turned inward, the diamond on the palm-side.  Her   *
          face darkens with fury and she points the gun at Helen's face,   *
          preparing to kill her .  .  .                                    *

          And Malik's hand grabs her wrist, stopping her.                  *

                              MALIK                                        *
                    Not now.  We may need a hostage.                       *

          Juno grabs her and twists her around, pushing her toward the     *
          limo nearby.                                                     *

                              JUNO
                    Let's go, Suzy Homemaker.


    267   EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

          Harry is still swimming.  He reaches the edge of the fire and
          surfaces, gasping for breath.  Treading water he scans the
          dock.


    268   EXT. WATER OF THE DOCK - HARRY'S POV - NIGHT

          Amid the fire and smoke, he sees Juno walking Helen at gun
          point toward a LIMO.


    269   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

          TRACKING WITH JUNO, approaching the car.  Malik passes, jumping  *
          into the Aerospatiale with his few remaining men.  The fourth    *
          bomb is clearly visible as the sliding door is closed.  The      *
          copter pulls pitch, fanning the flames of the inferno below as   *
          it arcs away.

          AKBAR, the 300 pound terrorist/chauffeur opens the door and      *
          Juno gets into the limo with Helen.  Akbar scrunches into the
          front seat and starts the car.


    270   EXT. RAMP TO HIGHWAY - PREDAWN

          There is just enough light to see some geography.  The island
          is very tiny.  Running right over it and to the horizon in both
          directions is the OVERSEAS HIGHWAY.  The terrorists' trucks
          rumble up an on-ramp past a sign that says MIAMI - 110.  The
          limo is the last member of the convoy.  The Aerospatiale passes
          overhead, hugging the deck, headed for Miami at 150 knots.


    271   EXT. DOCK/ WAREHOUSE - DAWN

          It looks like the aftermath of a battle... burning wreckage,
          black smoke, bodies.  Not a living soul around.  The smoke
          swirls as two big BELL 206 HELICOPTERS settle on the middle of
          the dock.  GIB jumps out of the nearest with an AR-15, scanning
          the wreckage.  Several of his men, and a couple of DEA agents,
          spread out.  Gib breaks into a grin as he sees--

          HARRY, materializing out of the swirling smoke.  Dripping wet,
          clothes ripped and bloody.  But okay.

                              GIB
                    I thought this look like your
                    work.

                              HARRY
                    Let's go.  I'll brief you in the
                    air.

                              GIB
                    You're welcome.


    272   INT. BELL 206 - DAY

          Gib and Harry are working out of brief-case mobile com-units.
          Several Omega agents with headsets are reading maps, giving
          commands, coordinating the evacuation, mobilizing their own
          forces.  The energy is controlled but very high, everybody
          talking at once.  This is the day they all have trained for.
          It is impressive to watch.

                              GIB
                    --you tell the son of bitch this
                    is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat,
                    a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need
                    a patch of the White House ASAP.
                    That's right--

                              HARRY
                         (overlapping)
                    ... the Coast Guard has to clear
                    them back to a twenty mile
                    radius.  Anybody that can't make
                    the minimum safe distance we need
                    an airlift on, immediately--

          Gib whips around to Harry, lowering his headset mike.

                              GIB
                    I can get 3 Marine Corps Harriers
                    here in about 12 minutes.
                    They're on maneuvers out of Boca
                    Chica.

                              HARRY
                         (checking his watch)
                    Get 'em.  I'll brief them on the
                    way in.


    273   EXT. OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY

          TRAFFIC on the two causeways is almost non-existent this early
          in the morning.  The three rental trucks, followed by the limo
          about a mile back, are almost the only vehicles.


    274   INT. LIMO - DAY

          Juno has a 9mm pistol aimed at Helen.  She opens the sunroof,
          letting in the morning air and light.  Then pours herself a
          Scotch from the bar.

                              JUNO
                    Like one?

                              HELEN
                         (eyes like steel)
                    Fuck you.


    275   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          HARRY AND GIB are both talking a mile a minute, coordinating
          the evacuation of the highway and the surrounding area.

                              GIB
                    ... well get the Highway Patrol
                    to go through the streets and
                    tell everybody on their damn
                    loudspeakers.  Just the basics...
                    get away from windows, don't look
                    at it... yeah--

                              HARRY
                    Here they come.

          Gib looks out the window in time to see--

          THREE hunch-winged P.S.T.O.L.  HARRIER jets pass them at 600
          knots.

                              HARRY
                         (to the pilots)
                    Roger, Mike Three Five, you are
                    cleared to engage.  Be advised,
                    your targets have Stingers and
                    light machine guns.


    276   INT. COCKPIT OF LEAD HARRIER - DAY

          The pilot, like all jet pilots, seems icy calm.

                              PILOT
                    Copy that, Bright Boy command.
                         (to his wingman)
                    Tally ho.


    277   EXT. OVERSEAS HIGHWAY - DAY

          The terrorists see the Harriers approaching on a low attack
          run, and scramble to get out their Stingers.

          The Harriers open fire with cannons and rocket pods on the
          trucks below.  The 20mm cannons rip the ocean on either side of
          the causeway into plumes of spray.


    278   EXT. HIGHWAY - ON TRUCK - DAY

          One of the Bomb trucks is hit.  It explodes and flies off the    *
          bridge into the water.  The terrorists on one of the other
          trucks fire a Stinger missile.


    279   EXT. ABOVE HIGHWAY - ON HARRIER - DAY

          It arrows up, blowing one wing off the lead Harrier.  The pilot
          ejects as the plane cartwheels into the sea and explodes.


    280   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          Harry sees the battle far ahead... the exploding jet.

                              HARRY
                         (to the pilots)
                    Recommend you use your Mavericks                       *
                    to take out the bridge.                                *

                              PILOT (OVER)
                    They won't set off those nukes
                    will they?

                              HARRY
                    Negative, Mike Three Five.
                    That's a negative.
                         (low, to Gib)
                    Probably not.


    281   EXT. HIGHWAY/ OCEAN - DAY

          The two remaining Harriers make an attack run, launching four    *
          Maverick missiles at the bridge.                                 *


    282   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          The missiles hit the support trestles ahead of the trucks and    *
          .  .  .  K-BOOOOM!!  A whole section of the concrete span        *
          collapses into the water.


    283   EXT. HIGHWAY - TRUCKS - DAY

          The first truck is consumed in the blast.  The last truck        *
          slides to the edge of the gap and stops.                         *


    284   INT. / EXT. LIMO - DAY

          Juno is trying to see what's going on ahead.  All they can see
          is smoke and explosions.  Akbar is speaking heatedly (in
          Arabic) into a walky talky and getting no answer.

          Helen uses this moment of distraction to lunge forward,
          grabbing the gun.  Juno fires wildly as they struggle for
          control of the weapon.  The sound is deafening in the tiny
          space.  The second shot catches Akbar behind the ear, and he
          slumps forward.  His foot mashes down on the accelerator pedal
          and the car surges faster.


    285   EXT. HIGHWAY/ BATTLE SITE - DAY

          The third Harrier fires its 2.75 Rockets and blows the           *
          remaining truck into tinfoil.  Battle over.  Two bombs down.


    286   INT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          The columns of smoke from the battle are still a couple miles
          ahead of the copter.

                              HARRY
                    Good shooting, Mike Three Five.
                    I need you to stay on station.
                         (to the copter pilot)                             *
                    Okay.  You see that limo?


    287   INT./ EXT. LIMO - HIGHWAY - DAY                                  *

          THE LIMO tracks lazily back and forth across the lanes from one
          guardrail to the other, throwing sheets of sparks where it
          hits.  In is funneling along the causeway, unslowed, like an out-
          of-control-train.


    288   INT. LIMO - DAY

          INSIDE, Helen knocks Juno's hands against the edge of the open
          sunroof and the pistol goes flying out.

                              HELEN
                    You... bitch!!

          Helen is raging, grabbing Juno's head and pounding it against
          anything hard she can find inside the car.  Suddenly she stops,
          looking out the front window.  Juno turns too, off her look, to
          see-- ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.  The causeway is blown away
          about a quarter mile ahead.

                              JUNO
                    Shit!

          Juno climbs through the window into the front seat, tugging on
          the dead driver.  The heavyset Akbar is like a bag of cement.
          Helen look up through the sunroof and sees--


    289   EXT. ABOVE LIMO - DAY

          THE BELL 206 COPTER, descending rapidly.  Harry is climbing out
          onto the skids.  He hooks on arm and leg over the skid and
          hangs down as low as he can.  HELEN stands up in the opening
          and waves her arms.


    290   INT. / EXT. BELL COPTER/ LIMO - DAY

          Gib is yelling at the DEA pilot, who's not thrilled with this
          idea.

                              GIB
                    Get lower, goddamnit!  Right now!

          Harry strains downward with one hand.  Helen reaches up toward
          him.  The car screeches along the guard-rail, slamming against
          it, throwing her from side to side in the sunroof.  Their
          fingers touch, then separate.  She looks-- the limo is almost
          on the precipice.


    291   INT. LIMO - DAY

          INSIDE THE CAR, Juno is desperately pulling on the inert
          driver.  He slumps over on her, pinning her.  She looks over
          the dash as the shattered edge of the causeway rushes toward
          them--


    292   EXT. LIMO - DAY

          HARRY'S HAND grabs Helen's.  He pulls her out of the car just
          as the limo clears the edge.  She is jerked through the
          sunroof, screaming.  The car falls away, arcing gracefully to
          the ocean below.  It hits with an enormous explosion of water.


    293   INT. / EXT. BELL 206 COPTER - DAY

          HARRY PULLS HELEN up onto the skid with him, getting her
          stable.  She is gasping, holding on for dear life.  She looks
          down at the ocean, the burning wreckage on the bridge, the
          whole unbelievable panorama.

          Then she looks at Harry and-- Grins.  She's alive!  And so is
          he.  And not only that, this is the biggest rush of her life.
          Harry grins back.  Surprised and pleased that she is more of a
          soul-mate than he ever knew.

                                                      CUT TO:


    294   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          ANGLE ON A HARRIER, landing in full-hover on the causeway.  The
          shriek of the jet engine is enormous.  It bounces down onto its
          wheels like a big inscect.  The other remaining Harrier is
          already down, behind it.


    295   EXT. BELL 206 - DAY

          TRACKING past burning wreckage to Harry's Bell 206 just
          settling on the highway.  B.G.  the other DEA Bell 206 is
          landing with the Harrier pilot who ejected hanging in a sling.
          Harry jumps out of the open door, followed by Helen and Gib.     *
          Harry looks at his watch.                                        *

                              HARRY
                    Any minute now.

                              GIB
                         (with a megaphone/ to
                          everybody)
                    It's show time.  Don't look at                         *
                    the flash.  Do not look at the
                    flash.

                              HARRY                                        *
                         (to Helen)                                        *
                    We're safe here.                                       *


    296   EXT. CAUSEWAY - DAY

          Helen and Harry move away from the agents.  They are safe and
          together.  They look at each other, and there is nothing to
          say.  Harry removes her wedding band from the wrong hand and     *
          slips it back onto its rightful finger.                          *

          He leans forward to kiss her.  She reaches for him.  Their lips  *
          meet.


    297   EXT. CAUSEWAY - HARRIERS IN BACKGROUND - DAY

          And they are locked together in that position when the sky
          lights up behind them.  Talk about fireworks.  Harry covers her  *
          eyes and they stay in the kiss.                                  *

          They are in no danger, but the effect is stunning.  The classic  *
          mushroom cloud appears at the horizon.  Helen watches, awed,
          the most glorious and terrifying sight of our age.

                              HELEN                                        *
                    That was some kiss.                                    *

          The two young Harrier pilots stand nearby, watching the
          mushroom disperse.  Gib is with the other Omega agents, his
          finger pressed in his ear, listening to his headset.  He waves
          to Harry to come to him.

          Harry detaches from Helen and walks over to him.  Helen watches
          him go... back to work.  She glances over at the two Harrier
          pilots.

                              HELEN
                         (to the pilots)
                    That's my husband.

          HARRY goes into the huddle with Gib and the others.

                              GIB
                    Malik's copter landed twenty
                    minutes ago in Miami.  He's on
                    the top of a high-rise downtown.
                    SWAT's on the scene, and I got
                    the cops sealing off the area.                         *
                    He renezvous'd there with about                        *
                    a dozen more faction members.                          *
                    They're barricaded on the                              *
                    twentieth floor.
                         (he gets very serious)                            *
                    Harry, they have a hostage.  It's                      *
                    Dana.                                                  *

                              HARRY                                        *
                    My Dana!?

                              GIB
                    They must have grabbed her during
                    the night... we didn't know.
                    Sorry, Harry, I--


    298   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          But Harry is already moving.  He sprints toward the nearest
          Harrier, witch is idling nearby.  Gib runs after him.

                              GIB
                    Harry!  We'll get her out!  We                         *
                    have a man inside already .  .                         *
                    .  Harry!!  Aw, shit... here we
                    go.

          Harry walks up to the young pilot...

                              HARRY
                    I need to borrow this thing for
                    a few minutes.

          He pushes past the pilot before the guy can react.

                              PILOT
                    Excuse me .  .  .  sir?!                               *

                              GIB                                          *
                    Force Comm cleared you to give us                      *
                    total cooperation, right?                              *

                              PILOT                                        *
                    Yessir, but .  .  .                                    *

                              GIB                                          *
                    That's coming right from the                           *
                    President, Captain.                                    *

                              PILOT                                        *
                    Yessir.  Uh .  .  .  sir?  You're                      *
                    going to have to sign for the                          *
                    aircraft.                                              *

                              GIB                                          *
                    I'll sign for it.  You got a pen?                      *
                         (one of the agents                                *
                          pulls out a pen)                                 *
                    Here, he'll sign for it.                               *

          Harry is in the cockpit by now.  Gib climbs up.                  *

                              GIB
                    I'd like to remind you that it
                    has been ten years since you were
                    actually in one of these.

                              HARRY
                    If I break it they can take it
                    out of my pay.


    299   INT. HARRIER - DAY

          Harry doesn't have a G-suit or a helmet of anything.  He just
          has his walky on his belt.

          INSIDE THE CRAMPED COCKPIT, Harry looks around for the lever
          which vectors the thrust.  Finds it, and sets it to 90 degrees
          (vertical).  He bangs the canopy closed and brings the throttle
          up to FULL.

                              GIB
                         (to pilot)
                    It'll be fine.  He's got hundreds
                    of hours in Harriers.  Joint-ops,
                    cross-training and all that.

                              AGENT
                    Harry can fly anything.

          The big plane wobbles off the ground like a drunken bumble-bee.

                              GIB
                    He's a little rusty.  It's like
                    riding a bicycle .  .  .  you
                    never forget.  Uh .  .  .  I'd
                    seek shelter!

          It drifts sideways and everybody runs to get out of the way.
          At about six feet above the ground it slides sideways, clips
          the top of a cop car and knocks off the light bar.  It lifts
          unsteadily straight into the sky.  It turns around 180.

                              GIB
                    He's got it.

                              HARRY
                    Sorry.

          Harry pushes the vector lever forward and the thrust-nozzles
          turn, accelerating the plane forward.


    300   EXT. CAUSEWAY - DAY

          Gib is standing, watching Harry go.  He never believes this
          guy.  Harry's voice comes over the walky...

                              HARRY
                    Tell Helen what's going on.  Tell
                    her I love her.  And ask the
                    pilot where the button for the
                    20mm cannon is-- never mind.  I
                    found it.

          The plane disappears toward Miami.


    301   EXT. HIGH RISE - MIAMI - DAY

          AN AERIAL SHOT, circling the building.  It is an unfinished
          building in the high rise district.  The Aerospatiale sits on
          the roof, its rotor turning slowly.  The street below is jammed
          with cars.  Honking horns echo up the glass canyons.


    302   EXT. STREET - DAY

          ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL as cops use bullhorns and bad attitudes to
          clear the street around the building, setting up a perimeter
          two blocks away.


    303   INT. HIGH RISE - DAY

          INSIDE THE HIGH RISE the terrorists have barricaded themselves
          on the twentieth floor.  There are 12 TERRORISTS, all with
          automatic weapons.  Occasionally one of them will fire a burst
          down a stairwell with an AK-47.  Miami-Dade SWAT team members
          are deployed in the stairwell but are keeping their distance.


    304   INT. HIGH RISE - ON THE 21ST FLOOR - DAY

          Malik is sequestered with the bomb.  It sits on the floor,
          still in its shipping case.  Dana stands nearby, looking
          scares.  She is not ties up.  Where can she go?

          She watches Malik go to the warhead and insert his arming key.
          He has a TV set up on some crates, and we see that his video-
          tapes demands are running on CNN.  Harry's face fills the
          screen, verifying the the nuclear weapons as a real threat.  He
          is identified at the bottom of the screen as HARRY TASKER,
          ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION.  Dana stares at her father's face on
          the national news.  It's like a bad dream.  She has been crying
          but she is fairly composed now.

                              DANA
                    I have to go to the bathroom.

          The terrorists ignore her.  A terrified ACTION NEWS REPORTER
          and his CAMERAMAN, under guard by TWO TERRORISTS, are hastily
          setting up to shoot Malik.
                              CAMERAMAN
                    Tape is rolling.

                              MALIK
                    This is a communique from Crimson
                    Jihad.  You have heard from your
                    own expert.  You have seen the
                    Holy fire with your own eyes.  Do
                    not force us to destroy this
                    city.  And do not try to use
                    force against us.  I can trigger
                    this bomb instantly.  All I have
                    to do is turn that key...
                         (he points fiercely at
                          the bomb)
                    ... and five million of your
                    people will die.

          The reporter glances down, nervously.

                              REPORTER
                    What key?

                              MALIK
                         (pointing like the
                          guy's blind)
                    That key right there!

          Malik looks down.  The key is gone.

                              MALIK
                         (to his men)
                    Someone has stolen the key!

          He turns, looking around wildly.  Malik then sees Dana running
          for the stairwell to the roof.  He pulls a pistol and shoots at
          her, but hits the wall as she bangs through the door.  He runs
          after her.


    305   EXT. BUILDING / ROOF - DAY

          ON THE ROOF, Malik bursts through the stairwell door.  His TWO
          MEN have followed him.  Malik stops suddenly when he sees--
          Dana standing at the edge of the roof.  She is holding the
          ARMING KEY by its chain.  Dangling it over the edge.  He
          signals to his men not to fire.

                              DANA
                         (terrified, but
                          thinking)
                    You shoot me, this'll fall.

          Malik advances slowly, his eyes glistening ferally.  She backs
          up a step with each of his, moving along the edge of the roof.
          Malik keeps his pistol aimed at her chest.

                              DANA
                    Don't come any closer.  I'll drop
                    it!  I swear to God.

                              MALIK
                    If you drop it, I will have no
                    reason not to kill you.

          He advances, calling her bluff.  She backs away from him along
          the edge.

                              MALIK
                    Come on, child.  Give me the key.
                         (smiling)
                    Don't you want to live?  I give
                    you my word.

                              DANA
                    No way you whacko.

          She reaches the corner of the building.  Her back touches
          something.  it is the boom of a small crane, used for lifting
          building supplies.  Careful to keep the key dangling over open
          space, Dana climbs up on the lattice-work boom and moves out
          beyond the edge of the building, never taking her eyes off
          Malik.  She is hyperventilating, terrified, but thinking
          clearly.

          Malik steps up on the crane, crawling out after her.  He knows
          she will not drop the key as long as he has the gun.  It is a
          game which will end when she reaches the end of the boom.  Dana
          puts the key between her teeth so she can hang on better.  It
          is windy and the boom is swinging.


    306   INT. 20TH FLOOR - DAY

          The Crimson Jihad warriors hear a thunderous, shrieking roar
          and look toward the window.


    307   EXT. HIGH RISE - DAY

          RISING INTO VIEW, LIKE A GARGOYLE FROM HELL, IS THE HARRIER.
          It fills the windows completely, hovering only a few feet
          outside.  The terrorists raise their AK-47s to fire just as
          Harry hits the 20mm nose-cannon.


    308   INT. / EXT. HIGH RISE - 20TH FLOOR - DAY

          Glass explodes into glittering mist, and terrorists explodes
          into bloody spray as Harry pivots the plane and the cannon
          sweeps the floor clear from side to side.  The Crimson Jihad is
          vaporized.


    309   EXT. ROOF - CRANE BOOM - DAY

          Malik hears the thunder of the jet and the firing, but from
          where he is he can't see what's going on.  He focuses on the
          key.  He must have that key.


    310   EXT. ROOF - NEAR HELICOPTER - DAY

          Malik's TWO REMAINING MEN run to the helicopter, gesticulating
          to the pilot to get ready to take off.  The pilot revs the
          turbine and the rotor whirls faster.  The two men jump in,
          picking up M-60 machine guns.


    311   EXT. ROOF - CRANE BOOM - DAY

          MALIK IS STILL ADVANCING out the crane boom.  Dana slips as she
          backs up, toppling off the boom.  She is hanging now by her
          hands over a 20 story drop.

          Malik is almost to her.  He needs a hand free to grab her.  He
          sets his gun down on the girder.  He grabs for her wrist.


    312   EXT. ROOF - OVERLOOKING EDGE - DAY

          ANGLE LOOKING DOWN.  Malik, Dana, the street far below.  With
          an unbelievable roar the Harrier sweeps in beneath Dana,
          FILLING FRAME.


    313   EXT. CRANE BOOM / OVER EDGE - DAY

          Harry has the canopy up.  Malik sees Harry, ten feet below.
          His eyes narrow with an all-consuming rage.  He glances at the
          pistol on the beam.  Back at the girl, the key in her teeth--
          So close.

          Harry maneuvers the cockpit directly under Dana.

                              HARRY
                         (shouting)
                    Let go baby!  I've got you!
                    Daddy's got you!


    314   EXT. ROOF / HARRIER - DAY

          Malik lunges for her wrist.  She screams and lets go-- Dana
          drops and hits the windshield of the hovering jet-- Harry grabs
          her with his left hand, right hand still on the stick-- He
          holds her until she can get a grip.  She is lying across the
          nose of the plane.  Harry starts to bank away and--


    315   EXT. CRANE BOOM - DAY

          Malik shrieks in rage.  He grabs his 9mm pistol and leaps off
          the crane--


    316   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          Onto the back of the plane.  He starts crawling toward the
          cockpit.  Dana screams and Harry looks back, but just then--


    317   EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          The Aerospatiale swings around the building right in front of
          them-- The door-gunner OPENS FIRE.


    318   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          Harry banks hard, taking the hits under the wing.  He pivots
          and slides sideways around the building, playing tag with the
          copter.

          He can't do anything radical enough to dislodge Malik without
          tossing off his own daughter.


    319   EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          The helicopter appears around the corner, guns blazing in the
          doors.  Harry pivots the plane and FIRES THE NOSE CANNON.  The
          helicopter is riddled.  It tilts and plummets, auto-rotating
          out of control.


    320   EXT. BUILDING - ANGLE AT STREETLEVEL - DAY

          As the copter hits the ground and explodes.  Fortunately the
          police had created a cleared perimeter.


    321   EXT. HARRIER - DAY

          THE HARRIER dips and slews, half out of control.  Malik is
          taking aim with the pistol, right at Harry's head.  Harry grabs
          his daughter with his left hand, holding her with all his
          strength and he-- Jinks the stick hard, just as-- Malik opens
          fire, but-- The plane tilts wildly and Malik topples, screaming--
          He slides along the wing, and falls over the leading edge--
          Only to catch himself on the only available hand-hold-- The
          last Sidewinder missile.


    322   EXT. HARRIER / SIDEWINDER - DAY

          Harry and Malik lock eyes for one long second.  Then Harry hits
          the FIRING STUD.  The Sidewinder drops away and ignites.
          Carrying Malik out over Miami Beach.  It explodes a mile out to
          sea.


    323   INT. HARRIER - COCKPIT - DAY

          HARRY PULLS DANA into the cockpit, settling her on his lap.

                              HARRY
                    Don't touch the stick, baby.

          She stares at her father in amazement.  He banks away from the
          building, accelerating the jet.  He grins at her.  Raises one
          eyebrow.  Woggles the plane's wings.

                              HARRY
                    Hi, pumpkin.


          ONE YEAR LATER


    324   INT. TASKER HOUSE - NIGHT

          Dinner at home, and everybody's there.  We come in on the end
          of some story that everybody thinks is hysterical.

                              HELEN
                    ... you should have seen your
                    father, standing there all
                    covered with spaghetti sauce.  He
                    looked like such a dope.

                              HARRY
                    I told the guy---
                         (snorts, it's too
                          funny)
                    I told the guy, this isn't even
                    my order.

          Dana is laughing too, a part of it.  They are happy.  They are
          a family.  Dana gets up, her meal half-eaten as usual.

                              DANA
                    I'm done.

          She heads for the front door.

                              HARRY
                    I seem to remember something
                    about a history project that's
                    due tomorrow.

                              DANA
                         ( busted)
                    Dad.  You just think you know
                    everything, don't you?

          Dana trudges off to her room to do her homework.  The phone
          rings.  Helen answers.

                              VOICE
                    Boris and Doris?

                              HELEN
                         (calmly, signalling
                          Harry with her eyes)
                    Go ahead.


    325   INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT

          It is a black tie affair.  Very glitzy.  CAMERA SWOOPS over the
          guests, sipping champagne and dancing.  It is an embassy crowd,
          very international.  HARRY AND HELEN work their way through the
          crowd.  He is in tux, hair slicked back, looking rakish.  She
          is elegant in a low-cut gown and diamond choker.

          Harry scoops two glasses of champagne off a passing tray and
          hands her one.


    326   INT. VAN - NIGHT

          VERY CLOSE ON GIB, hunches in a dark van someplace nearby.  He
          speaks into his headset mike.

                              GIB
                    So, what's the scoop, team?  You
                    see your contact yet?


    327   INT. PARTY - NIGHT

          HELEN AND HARRY smile and nod as if they know people.  Speaking
          very low, Helen answer Gib via SUB-VOCAL transceiver.

                              HELEN
                    Not yet.  But we'll find him.

                              HARRY
                    Dance?

          He whirls her across the floor and the CAMERA PULLS BACK AND UP
          as they dance.

                                                      FADE OUT

                            The END
TRUE ROMANCE
 

 
 

 

 


 True Romance by Quentin Tarantino When you are tired of relationships, try a romance. INT. BAR - NIGHT A smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit. CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But, you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool. CLARENCE In "Jailhouse Rock" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and leaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and he's singing, "Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care". Now, they got him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party, big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too 'cause my life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis. Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette. LUCY I'd fuck Elvis. CLARENCE Really? LUCY When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now. CLARENCE I don't blame you. (they laugh) So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it? Lucy laughs. CLARENCE Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you? LUCY How 'bout me what? CLARENCE How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight? LUCY What are we gonna see? CLARENCE A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter". LUCY Who's Sonny Chiba? CLARENCE He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever. LUCY (not believing this) You wanna take me to a kung fu movie? CLARENCE (holding up three fingers) Three kung fu movies. Lucy takes a drag from her cigarette. LUCY (laughing) I don't think so, not my cup of tea. INT. DINGY HOTEL ROOM - DAY The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots and violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained black. On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of cocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the suitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. "Bewitched" is playing. At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and FLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic bags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't know it listen to him. DREXL Nigger, get outta my face with that bullshit. FLOYD Naw man, I don't be eatin' that shit. DREXL That's bullshit. BIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl and Floyd. Walks through the door carrying hamburgers and french fries in two greasy brown-paper bags. FLOYD Naw man, that's some serious shit. DREXL Nigger, you lie like a big dog. BIG D What the fuck are you talkin' about? DREXL Floyd say he don't be eatin' pussy. BIG D Shit, any nigger say he don't eat pussy is lyin' his ass off. DREXL I heard that. FLOYD Hold on a second, Big D. You sayin' you eat pussy? BIG D Nigger, I eat everything. I eat pussy. I eat the butt. I eat every motherfuckin' thang. DREXL Preach on, Big D. FLOYD Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker. BIG D Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers' dicks. DREXL Heard that. Drexl and Big D bump fists. FLOYD Yeah, that's right, laugh. It's so funny, oh it's so funny. (he takes a hit off of a joint) There used to be a time when sisters didn't know shit about gettin' their pussy licked. Then the sixties came an' they started fuckin' around with white boys. And white boys are freaks for that shit - DREXL - Because it's good! FLOYD Then, after a while sisters use to gettin' their little pussy eat. And because you white boys had to make pigs out of yourselves, you fucked it up for every nigger in the world everywhere. BIG D Drexl. On behalf of me and all the brothers who aren't here, I'd like to express our gratitude - Drexl and Big D bust up. FLOYD Go on pussy-eaters... laugh. You look like you be eatin' pussy. You got pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to do a bunch of fucked-up shit. BIG D So you do eat pussy! FLOYD Naw naw! BIG D You don't like it, but you eat that shit. (to Drexl) He eats it. DREXL Damn skippy. He like it, too. BIG D (mock English accent) Me thinketh he doth protest too much. FLOYD Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up! DREXL Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say? FLOYD I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!" BIG D Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast - DREXL Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do. FLOYD I'd say fuck it! Drexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd sitting all alone. Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching "Bewitched". FLOYD (yelling after them) Ain't no man have to eat pussy! BIG D (not even looking) Take that shit somewhere else. DREXL (marching back) You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it? FLOYD If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy. DREXL With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy, kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger, you'd aim to please. BIG D (glued on TV) I'm hip. DREXL In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D, toss me that shotgun. Without turning away from "Bewitched" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to Drexl. DREXL (to Floyd) All right, check this out. (referring to shotgun) Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you. Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away. Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl. Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room. The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around. Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again. Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops. Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front door he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out. EXT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR - MORNING A big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a backdrop. The song "Little Bitty Tear" is heard a capella. INT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR - MORNING Cliff Worley is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently to the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In between singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a security guard uniform. EXT. TRAILER PARK - MORNING Cliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning. He pulls up to his trailer to see something that stops him short. Cliff's POV Through windshield Clarence and a nice-looking YOUNG WOMAN are watching for him in front of his trailer. CLOSEUP - CLIFF Upon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek. BACK TO: CLIFF'S POV Clarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car. Clarence sticks his face through the driver's side window. CLARENCE Good Morning, Daddy. Long time no see. INT. TRAILER HOME - MORNING All three enter the trailer home. CLIFF Excuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if I'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected to see this morning. Clarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room. CLARENCE Yeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin' on thirst, you got anything to drink? He moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator. CLIFF I think there's a Seven-Up in there. CLARENCE (rumaging around the fridge) Anything stronger? (pause) Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you? CLIFF I can, but I don't. CLARENCE (closing the fridge) That's about all I ever eat. Cliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him. CLIFF (to Girl) I'm sorry... I'm his father. YOUNG GIRL (sticking her hand out) That's OK, I'm his wife. (shaking his hand vigorously) Alabama Worley, pleased to meetcha. She is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's where the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere. Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit magnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama. CLARENCE Oh yeah, we got married. (referring to the magnets) You still have these. (to Alabama) This isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one. I never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a sport and go get us some beer. I want some beer. (to Cliff) Do you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here. He hands her some money and his car keys. CLARENCE Go to the liquor store - (to Cliff) Where is there a liquor store around here? CLIFF Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th. CLARENCE (to Alabama) Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too? ALABAMA I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs. CLARENCE Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good. (to Cliff) What do you think would taste good? CLIFF I'm really not very - CLARENCE You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt. (to Cliff) Where's a good chicken place around here? CLIFF I really don't know. CLARENCE You don't know the chicken places around where you live? (to Alabama) Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is. He gives her some more money. CLARENCE This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie. ALABAMA Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy. She opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts. CLARENCE Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what? CLIFF She seems very nice. CLARENCE Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk - CLIFF Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married? CLARENCE Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help. BLACK TITLE CARD: "HOLLYWOOD" INT. OUTSIDE OF CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICER - DAY FOUR YOUNG ACTORS are sitting on a couch with sheets of paper in their hands silently mouthing lines. One of the actors is DICK RITCHIE. The casting director, MARY LOUISE RAVENCROFT, steps into the waiting room, clip board in hand. RAVENCROFT Dick Ritchie? Dick pops up from the pack. DICK I'm me... I mean, that's me. RAVENCROFT Step inside. INT. CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY She sits behind a large desk. Her name-plate rests on the desktop. Several posters advertising "The Return of T.J. Hooker" hang on the wall. Dick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands. RAVENCROFT Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's hanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off. (she picks a up a copy of the script) Whenever you're ready. DICK (reading and miming driving) Where'd you come from? RAVENCROFT (reading from the script lifelessly) I don't know. He just appeared as magic. DICK (reading from script) Well, don't just sit there, shoot him. She puts her script down, and smiles at him. RAVENCROFT That was very good. DICK Thank you. RAVENCROFT If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that? DICK Sure. No problem. RAVENCROFT Could we try it now? DICK Absolutely. Dick picks up the script and begins, but this time with a Brooklyn accent. DICK Where'd he come from? RAVENCROFT (monotone, as before) I don't know. He just appeared as magic. DICK Well, don't just sit there, shoot him. Ravencroft puts her script down. RAVENCROFT Well, Mr. Ritchie, I'm impressed. You're a very fine actor. Dick smiles. INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY Cliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to come to grips with what Clarence has told him. CLARENCE Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free. CLIFF You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this - (raising his voice) - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head! Cliff pauses and collects himself. CLIFF What do you want from me? CLARENCE What? CLIFF Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money? CLARENCE Do you still have friends on the force? CLIFF Yes, I still have friends on the force. CLARENCE Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on. (pause) Daddy? CLIFF What makes you think I could do that? CLARENCE You were a cop. CLIFF What makes you think I would do that? CLARENCE I'm your son. CLIFF You got it all worked out, don't you? CLARENCE Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems. Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag. ALABAMA The forager's back. CLARENCE Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it. ALABAMA I didn't get any chicken. CLARENCE How come? ALABAMA It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open. INT. TRAILER HOME - BEDROOM - DAY Cliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks. The living room od the trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are horsing around. They giggle and cut up throughout the scene. As Cliff talks, all the noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line. He's talking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force. We see both inside the conversation. CLIFF It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey. WILSON What about him? CLIFF Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale. WILSON Are you still working security for Foster & Langley? CLIFF Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it? WILSON McTeague. CLIFF I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out? WILSON I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place? CLIFF You and Robin moved? WILSON Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got myself a new place - mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place. I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla. CUT TO: EXT. TRAILER HOME - DAY Clarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang. Alabama's amusing herself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background. CLIFF They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related. CLARENCE Do tell. Why drug related? CLIFF Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that. CLARENCE No shit? CLIFF Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you? CLARENCE Nope. CLIFF If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should. CLARENCE Who is he? CLIFF Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake. CLARENCE That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me? CLIFF Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it. Clarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it. CLARENCE Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me. CLIFF I got some money I can give you - CLARENCE Keep it. CLIFF Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple. CLARENCE We do make a cute couple, don't we? CLIFF Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around. (pause) I love you son. They hug each other, Clarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand. CLARENCE This is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but you can get a hold of me through him. Clarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her. CLARENCE Bama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye, Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff and gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's bubbling like a Fresca. ALABAMA Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon. CLARENCE (mock anger) What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that? ALABAMA Oh, hush up. The two get into the Mustang. CLARENCE (to Cliff) We'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood. Clarence starts the engine. The convertible roof opens as they talk. CLIFF Bama, you take care of that one for me. Keep him out of trouble. ALABAMA Don't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin' this fella on a short leash. Clarence, slowly, starts driving away. CLARENCE (to Cliff) As the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends we've made... and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time when we will all be together again. Clarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air. As the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips. CLIFF The-son-of-a-bitch was right... she does taste like a peach. INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat and clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf. A framed picture of a ballet dancer's feet hangs on the wall. The phone rings, Dick answers. DICK Hi, Dick here. INT. HOTEL SUITE - LAS VEGAS - SUNSET Top floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge picture window overlooking the neon-filled strip and the flaming red and orange sunset sky. Clarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand. CLARENCE (big bopper voice) Heeeellllloooo baaaabbbbbyyyy!!! Note: We intercut both sides of the conversation. DICK (unsure) Clarence? CLARENCE You got it. DICK It's great to hear from you. CLARENCE Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly. DICK You comin' to L.A.? When? CLARENCE Tomorrow. DICK What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit? Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama, wearing only a long T-shirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him. CLARENCE Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me. DICK Get the fuck outta here! CLARENCE I'm a married man. DICK Get the fuck outta here! CLARENCE Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half? Before Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone. ALABAMA Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley. DICK Hello, Alabama. ALABAMA I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too. Clarence start dictating to her what to say. CLARENCE Tell him we gotta go. ALABAMA Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it. DICK What? CLARENCE Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow. ALABAMA He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow. DICK Wait a minute - CLARENCE Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there. ALABAMA Don't eat anything. DICK Alabama, could you tell Clar - CLARENCE Ask him if he got the letter. ALABAMA Did you get the letter? DICK What letter? ALABAMA (to Clarence) What letter? CLARENCE The letter I sent. ALABAMA (to Dick) The letter he sent. DICK Clarence sent a letter? CLARENCE Has he gotten his mail today? ALABAMA Gotten your mail yet? DICK Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV. ALABAMA (to Clarence) Yes. CLARENCE Has he looked through it yet? ALABAMA (to Dick) Ya looked through it? DICK Not yet. ALABAMA (to Clarence) Nope. CLARENCE Tell him to look through it. ALABAMA (to Dick) Get it. DICK Let me speak to Clarence. ALABAMA (to Clarence) He wants to speak with you. CLARENCE No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over. ALABAMA (to Dick) He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over. DICK Money problems? CLARENCE Now tell him goodbye. ALABAMA Bye-bye. CLARENCE Now hang up. She hangs up the phone. INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY Dick hears the click on the other end. DICK Hello, hello, Clarence? Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama... hello? Extremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone. He goes over to the TV and picks up the day's mail. He goes through it. BILL: Southern California Gas Company. BILL: Group W. BILL: Fossenkemp Photography. BILL: Columbia Record and Tape Club. LETTER: It's obviously from Clarence. Addressed to Dick. Dick opens it. EXT. TRAILER - DAY A lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in front of it in the shape of a planet. A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly less kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a fast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer. INT. TRAILER - DAY He steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to his temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder. GUN CARRIER (DARIO) Welcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party. Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men, standing: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy), and Tooth-pick Vic (a fireplug pitbull type). Sitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid mob leader Blue Lou Boyle. Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair. COCCOTTI (to Frankie) Tell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what. In Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits. Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff. Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his hand, but he has yet to touch a drop. COCCOTTI Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley? CLIFF I give up. Who are you? COCCOTTI I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard od us before. Am I correct? CLIFF I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle. COCCOTTI I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and, at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine. (taking out a pack of Chesterfields) Want a Chesterfield? CLIFF No. COCCOTTI (as he lights up) I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a choice. CLIFF Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence - Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with his fist. COCCOTTI Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that pain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any kind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors. They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in front of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son? Cliff's defeated. CLIFF I've seen him. COCCOTTI Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead. CLIFF What are you talkin' about? COCCOTTI I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is, left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the commode filled in all the blanks. CLIFF I don't believe you. COCCOTTI That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that I believe you. Where did they go? CLIFF On their honeymoon. COCCOTTI I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they go? CLIFF They didn't tell me. Coccotti looks at him. CLIFF Now, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years. Yesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could borrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a check. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me God. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never thought to ask. Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil, quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal on the wound. Cliff screams. Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield. Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in the car. Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm in agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand. COCCOTTI Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from growin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has seventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen. And if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to hell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna show me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know where they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away from. The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart. He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes. CLIFF Could I have one of those Chesterfields now? COCCOTTI Sure. Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke. CLIFF Got a match? Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter. CLIFF Oh, don't bother. I got one. (he lights the cigarette) So you're a Sicilian, huh? COCCOTTI (intensly) Uh-huh. CLIFF You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers. All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what he's hearing. COCCOTTI Come again? CLIFF It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'? Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic, grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets through Cliff's head. He pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon, and turns to his men. COCCOTTI I haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity in fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me where that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this fucked-up family for good. Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was all about. Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer. When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic banana magnet that says: "Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and address)". LENNY Boss, get ready to get happy. TITLE CARD: "CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A." INT. DICK'S APARTMENT- MORNING Dick's asleep in a recliner. He's wearing his clothes from the night before. His room-mate FLOYD is lying on the sofa watching TV. The sound of our hands knocking on his door wakes Dick up. He shakes the bats out of his belfry, opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles standing in his doorway. Clarence and Alabama immediately start singing "Hello My Baby" like the frog in the old Chuck Jones cartoon. CLARENCE/ALABAMA Hello my baby, Hello my honey, Hello my ragtime gal - DICK Hi guys. Alabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a quick kiss. After she breaks, Clarence does the same. Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick and into his apartment. CLARENCE Wow. Neat place. INT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND - DAY The Pink's employees work like skilled Benihana chefs as they assemble the ultimate masterpiece hot-dog. EXT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND - PATIO - DAY Clarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor table chowing down on chili dogs. Alabama is in the middle of a story. ALABAMA ... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go. CLARENCE And here we are. DICK That's a pretty amazing story. CLARENCE Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here? DICK Just like in Detroit, only skinnier. CLARENCE You goin' out? DICK Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class. CLARENCE Good for you. DICK What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day. ALABAMA You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"? DICK Knock wood. He knocks the table and then looks at it. DICK ... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me. CLARENCE Did you meet Captain Kirk? DICK You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope. ALABAMA (finishing her hot-dog) That was so good I am gonna have another. DICK You can't have just one. Alabama leaves to get another hot-dog. Clarence never takes his eyes off her. DICK How much of that letter was on the up and up? CLARENCE Every word of it. Dick sees where Clarence's attention is. DICK You're really in love, aren't you? CLARENCE For the very first time in my life. (pause) Do you know what that's like? Clarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer. DICK (regretfully) No, I don't (he looks at Alabama) How did you two meet? Clarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his Hebrew cream soda. CLARENCE Do you remember The Lyric? INT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT Sonny Chiba, as "Streetfighter" Terry Surki, drives into a group of guys, fists and feet flying and whips ass on the silver screen. Clarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of him, nibbling on popcorn, eyes big as sourcers, and a big smile on his face. EXT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT A cab pulls up to the outside of The Lyric. The marquee carries the names of the triple feature: "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter" and "Sister Streetfighter". Alabama steps out of the taxi cab and walks up to the box office. A box office girl reading comic looks at her. ALABAMA One please. BOX OFFICE GIRL Ninety-nine cents. ALABAMA Which one is on now? BOX OFFICE GIRL "Return of the Streetfighter". It's been on about forty-five minutes. INT. THE LYRIC THEATER - LOBBY - NIGHT Alabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the concession stand. A young usher takes care of her. ALABAMA Can I have a medium popcorn? A super-large Mr. Pibb, and a box of Goobers. INT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT It's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-comers. Alabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food. She makes a quick scan of the theater. Not many people are there. She makes a beeline for the front whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks the row of seats just behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it. Clarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him. He turns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious. When Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine bottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence. ALABAMA Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK? CLARENCE Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt. ALABAMA I'm the clumsiest person in the world. CLARENCE (picking popcorn out of his hair) It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen. ALABAMA (picking popcorn out of his hair) What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick. Alabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie. Clarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into the movie. They both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama leans forward and taps Clarence on the shoulder. ALABAMA Excuse me... I hate to bother you again. Would you mind too terribly filling me in on what I missed? Jumping on this opportunity. CLARENCE Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba. ALABAMA The oriental. CLARENCE The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him. ALABAMA Want some Goobers? CLARENCE Thanks a lot. ALABAMA I thought Sonny was the good guy. CLARENCE He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up. They both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses. TIME CUT: On the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies lie all around him. THE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen. The theater light go up. Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence. They're both applauding. ALABAMA Great movie. Action-packed! CLARENCE Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass? ALABAMA Sonny kicks ass. CLARENCE You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R. ALABAMA If that was the R, I'd love to see the X. CLARENCE My name is Clarence, and what is yours? ALABAMA Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya. CLARENCE Is that your real name? Really? ALABAMA That's my real name, really. I got proof. See. She shows Clarence her driver's license. CLARENCE Well, cut my legs off and call me Shorty. That's a pretty original moniker there, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie. (announcer voice) She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier! Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge! EXT. THE LYRIC THEATER - NIGHT Clarence and Alabama are outside the theater. With the marquee lit up in the background they both perform unskilled martial arts moves. Clarence and Alabama break up laughing. CLARENCE Where's your car? I'll walk you to it. ALABAMA I took a cab. CLARENCE You took a cab to see three kung fu movies? ALABAMA Sure. Why not? CLARENCE Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart. ALABAMA What time is it? CLARENCE 'Bout twelve. ALABAMA I suppose you gotta get up early, huh? CLARENCE No. Not particularly. (pause) How come? ALABAMA Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie? CLARENCE I love to get pie after a movie. ALABAMA Would you like to get some pie? CLARENCE I'd love some pie. INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT Clarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's. It's about 12:40 a.m. Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke. Alabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab. CLARENCE Well, enough about the King. How about you? ALABAMA How 'bout me what? CLARENCE Tell me about yourself. ALABAMA There's nothing to tell. CLARENCE C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady? ALABAMA What do you want to know? CLARENCE Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me? Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence. ALABAMA Ask me them again. One by one. CLARENCE What do you do? ALABAMA I don't remember. CLARENCE Where are you from. ALABAMA Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet. CLARENCE What's your favorite color? ALABAMA I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black. CLARENCE What's your favorite movie star? ALABAMA Burt Reynolds. CLARENCE Would you like a bite of my pie? ALABAMA Yes, I would. Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off. CLARENCE Like it? ALABAMA Very much. Now, where were we? CLARENCE What kinda music do you like? ALABAMA Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel". CLARENCE What are your turn-ons? ALABAMA Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie. CLARENCE Turn-offs? ALABAMA I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians. CLARENCE Do you have a fella? She looks at Clarence and smiles. ALABAMA I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later. CLARENCE What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? ALABAMA Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out. CLARENCE And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me? ALABAMA Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you. Clarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until it makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul. A smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin. ALABAMA Aren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy? (eats her last piece of pie) Where to next? INT. COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT It's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a comic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-cool. ALABAMA Wow. What a swell place to work. CLARENCE Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music. ALABAMA How long have you worked here? CLARENCE Almost four years. ALABAMA That's a long time. CLARENCE I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day. ALABAMA Do you get paid a lot? CLARENCE That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like? ALABAMA You bet. How much is that worth? Clarence gets a box off the shelf. CLARENCE Four hundred bucks. ALABAMA I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books. CLARENCE Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here. She holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman. ALABAMA What's that? CLARENCE That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine. He pulls a plastic-cased "Spiderman" comic form the box. CLARENCE "Spiderman", number one. The one that started it all. Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama. ALABAMA God, Spiderman looks different. CLARENCE He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time. He pulls out another comic. CLARENCE "Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos". One of the coolest series known to man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about four bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap. (he opens one up) Just look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look at this one. We see the "Sgt. Fury" panels. CLARENCE Nick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on a chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a ship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain and the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. Isn't that cool? She's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze. CLARENCE Alabama, I'd like you to have this. Clarence hands her the "Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos" comic book that he loves so much. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis, anything you can imagine. The two walk through the door. ALABAMA What a cool room! She runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed. Later. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album. Clarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders. ALABAMA Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then? CLARENCE Five. She turns the page. ALABAMA Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis. CLARENCE I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up. LATER - LIVING ROOM Clarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's "Piece of My Heart". CLARENCE You know when you sat behind me? ALABAMA At the movies? CLARENCE Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her. ALABAMA What would make you think that? CLARENCE I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid. ALABAMA You're not stupid. Just wrong. They move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the song. ALABAMA I love Janis. CLARENCE You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died. ALABAMA She OD'd, didn't she? CLARENCE Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took. ALABAMA You mean she got a bad batch? CLARENCE That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire. ALABAMA So he really loved her? CLARENCE Uh-huh. They kiss. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY It's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks around, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a robe and investigates. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY Alabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair crying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself. CLARENCE What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do? ALABAMA You didn't do nothing. CLARENCE Did you hurt yourself? (he takes her foot) Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack? ALABAMA Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there. CLARENCE What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off. ALABAMA I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl. Pause. CLARENCE You're a whore? ALABAMA I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know. (pause) I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place. CLARENCE "Heroes For Sale"? ALABAMA Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you. CLARENCE Who? ALABAMA I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day. CLARENCE That dazzling imagination. ALABAMA It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself." CLARENCE Who and what is a Drexl? ALABAMA My pimp. CLARENCE You have a pimp? ALABAMA Uh-huh. CLARENCE A real live pimp? ALABAMA Uh-huh. CLARENCE Is he black? ALABAMA He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying. CLARENCE Is he nice? ALABAMA Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day. CLARENCE What did he do to Arlene? ALABAMA Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary. CLARENCE This motherfucker sounds charming! Clarence is on his feet, furious. CLARENCE Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place? ALABAMA At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date. CLARENCE Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me? ALABAMA What? CLARENCE Will you be my wife? When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks. ALABAMA Yes. CLARENCE (a little surprised) You will? ALABAMA You better not be fucking teasing me. CLARENCE You better not be fuckin' teasin' me. They seal it with a kiss. LATER - THAT NIGHT CLOSEUP - Alabama's wedding ring. The newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV. The movie they're watching is "The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine". Alabama watches the screen, but every so often she looks down to admre the ring on her hand. CLARENCE Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"? ALABAMA I don't believe so. CLARENCE Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer. We hear, off screen, the TV Announcer say: TV ANNOUNCER (off) We'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in... "The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine", tonight's eight o'clock movie, after these important messages... Clarence looks at the TV. He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his. We see commercials playing. He turns in her direction. She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring. He smiles and turns back to the TV. More commercials. Dolly close on Clarence's face FLASH ON: Alabama, right after he proposed. ALABAMA You better not be fucking teasing me. FLASH ON: In a cute, all-night wedding chapel. Clarence dressed in a rented tuxedo and Alabama in a rented white wedding gown. ALABAMA I do. CLARENCE Thank you. FLASH ON: Clarence and Alabama, dressed in tux and gown, doing a lover's waltz on a ballroom dance floor. FLASH ON: Clarence and Alabama in a taxi cab. CLARENCE Hello, Mrs. Worley. ALABAMA How do you do, Mr. Worley? CLARENCE Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley. ALABAMA Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today? CLARENCE Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley. ALABAMA Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley? Moving on top of her. CLARENCE Not for me. He starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat. She resists. ALABAMA (playfully) No no no no no no no no no... CLARENCE (playfully) Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes... FLASH ON: A big mean-looking black man in pimp's clothes. PIMP Bitch, you better git yo ass back on the street an' git me my money. Pimp on street corner with his arm around Alabama, giving her a sales pitch to a potential customer. PIMP I'm tellin' you, my man, this bitch is fine. This girl's a freak! You can fuck 'er in the ass, fuck 'er in the mouth. Rough stuff, too. She's a freak for it. Jus' try not to fuck 'er up for life. FLASH ON: Pimp beating Alabama. PIMP You holdin' out on me, girl? Bitch, you never learn! FLASH ON: Alabama passionately kissing the uninterested pimp. PIMP Hang it up, momma. I got no time for this bullshit. BACK TO: TV showing kung fu film. BACK TO: Clarence's face. There's definitely something different about his eyes. Clarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom. Alabama's startled by his sudden movement. ALABAMA (yelling after him) Where you goin', honey? CLARENCE (off) I just gotta get somethin'. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT Clarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep polluting his mind. Then, he hears a familiar voice. FAMILIAR VOICE (off) Well? Can you live with it? Clarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley. Clarence isn't surprised to see him. CLARENCE What? ELVIS Can you live with it? CLARENCE Live with what? ELVIS With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted? CLARENCE Yeah. ELVIS You wanna get unhaunted? CLARENCE Yeah. ELVIS Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs. CLARENCE I can't believe what you're tellin' me. ELVIS I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do. CLARENCE You'd really do that? ELVIS He don't got no right to live. CLARENCE Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life. ELVIS I don't blame you. CLARENCE If I thought I could get away with it - ELVIS Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it. Clarence looks at Elvis. ELVIS Clarence, I like ya. Always have, always will. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT CLOSEUP - A snub-nosed .38, which Clarence loads and sticks down his heavy athletic sock. INT. CALRENCE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Clarence returns. CLARENCE Sweetheart, write down your former address. ALABAMA What? CLARENCE Write down Drexl's address. ALABAMA Why? CLARENCE So I can go over there and pick up your things. ALABAMA (really scared) No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there. He kneels down before her and holds her hand. CLARENCE Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it? ALABAMA You don't know him - CLARENCE You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address. TITLE CARD: "CASS QUARTER, HEART OF DETROIT" EXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET - NIGHT It's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his red Mustang. He's right smack dab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime. He checks the pulse on his neck; it's beating like a race horse. To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis Presley gyration. CLARENCE (in Elvis voice) Yeah... Yeah... He makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building. INT. DARK BUILDING - NIGHT He's inside. His heart's really racing now. He has the TV guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand. He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey. Clarence knock on the door. A Young Black Man, about twenty years old, answers the door. He has really big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey. YOUNG BLACK MAN You want somethin'? CLARENCE Drexl? YOUNG BLACK MAN Naw, man, I'm Marty. Watcha want? CLARENCE I gotta talk to Drexl. MARTY Well, what the fuck you wanna tell him? CLARENCE It's about Alabama. A figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett T-shirt. It's our friend, Drexl Spivey. DREXL Where the fuck is that bitch? CLARENCE She's with me. DREXL Who the fuck are you? CLARENCE I'm her husband. DREXL Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in. INT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Drexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation they were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway. This is not the confrontation Clarence expected. He trails in behind Drexl and Marty. DREXL (to Marty) What was I sayin'? MARTY Rock whores. DREXL You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips. Drexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence. DREXL (to Clarence) You know what I'm talkin' about. Drexl gestures to one of the three stoned Hookers lounging about the apartment. DREXL (to Marty) These bitches over here ain't shit. You stomp them bitches to death to get the kind of pussy I'm talkin' about. Drexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-out boxes of Chinese food. A black exploitation movie is playing on TV. DREXL Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up. MARTY Pussy love pink rocks. This is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he expected Drexl to be like. He positions himself in front of the food table, demanding Drexl's attention. DREXL (eating with chopsticks, to Clarence) Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know. CLARENCE No thanks. DREXL No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to myself, "This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my Chinese, watch my TV." See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out, and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties. Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table. CLARENCE I'm not eatin' 'cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' 'cause I'm not stayin'. I'm not lookin' at the movie 'cause I saw it seven years ago. It's "The Mack" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by Bobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama Releasing Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In that envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener pastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter. I don't like to dicker. I never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's in that envelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much. Not one penny more, not one penny more. You could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full alert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl. Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty. DREXL It's empty. Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, "That's right, asshole." Silence. DREXL Oooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we got here? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be? Mr. Majestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't got no hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand - Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at Clarence, catching him of guard. Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting him in a tight choke hold. Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus. We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys. All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs. Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence. Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face. Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about it. DREXL Ya wanna fuck with me? (hits Clarence) Ya wanna fuck with me? (hits Clarence) I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit! He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists. Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs his nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and starts twisting. Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of his head. Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's thumb. Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and busting his nose. Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets up on his knees. Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight. Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of LPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to his feet. Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls. Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes. Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails. Marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt. DREXL (to Marty) You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he? MARTY Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright. Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting. DREXL (to Clarence) You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin' smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be crazy. (to Marty) I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty. (laughing) He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it? MARTY (laughing) Naw, man, it ain't white boy day. DREXL (to Clarence) Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day. CLARENCE (hurting) Wannabee nigger... DREXL Fuck you! My mother was Apache. Drexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up. Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket. Clarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down. Drexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license. DREXL Well, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost like a nigger name. (to Clarence) Hey, dummy. He puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up. DREXL Before you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I just chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're some macho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you are, Clarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th street, apartment 48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same address. Marty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here. He hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket. DREXL (to Marty) I'll keep lover boy here entertained. (to Clarence) You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's done it before. But I want you as a audience. (hollering to Marty) Marty, what the fuck are you doin'? MARTY (off) I'm tryin' to find my jacket. DREXL Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there lately. While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock and pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's standing over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger and blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face. Drexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground. MARTY (off) What's happening? Marty steps into the room. Clarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest. Two of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other Hooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to be terrified. Drexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his balls and his dick. Clarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker. CLARENCE Get a bag and put Alabama's thing in it! She doesn't move. CLARENCE You wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it! The Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the bed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence. Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like a pillbug. CLOSEUP - Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand. Clarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest. CLARENCE (to Drexl) Open you eyes, laughing boy. He doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick. CLARENCE Open your eyes! He does. It's now Drexl's POV from the floor. CLARENCE You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you? He fires. CLOSEUP - The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us. When it reaches us, the screen goes awash in red. INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The front swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama jumps off the couch and runs toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out: CLARENCE I killed him. She stops short. CLARENCE I've got some food in the car, I'll be right back. Clarence leaves. Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet. Alabama sits on the couch. Clarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food. He heaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down. CLARENCE Help yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one of everythin'. He stops and looks at here. CLARENCE I am so hungry. He starts eating french fries and hamburgers. ALABAMA (in a daze) Was it him or you? CLARENCE Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did. ALABAMA Is this a joke? CLARENCE No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good. Alabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring her. CLARENCE Come on, Bama, eat something. You'll feel better. She continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her. Finally he spins on her, yelling: CLARENCE Why are you crying? He's not worth one of your tears. Would you rather it had been me? Do you love him? (no answer) Do you love him? (no answer) Do you love him? She looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out. ALABAMA I think what you did was... CLARENCE What? ALABAMA I think what you did... CLARENCE What? ALABAMA ... was so romantic. Clarence is completely taken back. They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss. Their kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal. CLARENCE I gotta get outta these clothes. He picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them. ALABAMA (comically) Clean clothes. There is a god, Clarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop. ALABAMA Clarence. Those aren't my clothes. CUT TO: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - DAY We see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign. Pan to the parking lot where Clarence's empty red Mustang is parked. INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CALRENCE'S ROOM - DAY CLOSEUP - Dick's jaw drops. His hand reaches out of shot. CLOSEUP - The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is full of cocaine! Clarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine. Alabama's watching the cable TV. DICK Holy Mary, Mother of God. ALABAMA This is great, we got cable. CLARENCE (to Alabama) Bama, you got your blade? Keeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife with a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the corkscrew and opens the wine. He pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a little one for himself. He hands it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks. DICK This shit can't be real. CLARENCE It'll get ya high. He tosses the knife. CLARENCE Do you want some wine, sweetheart? ALABAMA Nope. I'm not really a wine gal. Using the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He jumps back. DICK It's fuckin' real! (to Clarence) It's fuckin' real! CLARENCE I certainly hope so. DICK You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man! CLARENCE I know. DICK Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got? CLARENCE Tell me. DICK I don't know! A fuckin' lot! He downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass. DICK This is Drexl's coke? CLARENCE Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers? DICK Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine. Dick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills up. CLARENCE But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set. DICK Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time - CLARENCE No way! The whole enchilada in one shot. DICK Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be? CLARENCE I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be? DICK It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you. CLARENCE Is he big league? DICK He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it. CLARENCE What'd'ya tell 'em? DICK Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't. CLARENCE What's this acting class guy's name? DICK Elliot. CLARENCE Elliot what? DICK Elliot Blitzer. CLARENCE OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff. DICK Where? CLARENCE (to Alabama) The zoo. CLARENCE (to Dick) The zoo. (pause) What are you waiting for? DICK Would you just shut up a minute and let me think? CLARENCE What's to think about? DICK Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy. CLARENCE Two guys. DICK Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit. CLARENCE Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'. Dick rests his head in his hands. CLARENCE Look, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need you to rise to the occasion. So, drink some more wine. Get used to the idea, and get your friend to the phone. EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - DAY CLOSEUP - A black panther, the four-legged kind, paces back and forth. Clarence, Alabama, Dick and Elliot Blitzer are walking through the zoo. One look at Elliot and you can see what type of actor he is, a real GQ, blow-dry boy. As they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal crackers and Alabama is blowing soap bubbles. ELLIOT So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading - CLARENCE Want an animal cracker? ELLIOT Yeah, OK. He takes one. CLARENCE Leave the gorillas. ELLIOT - that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars - CLARENCE Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime. DICK (trying to chill him out) Clarence... ELLIOT Where did you get it? CLARENCE I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street. ELLIOT (forcing a laugh) Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from? CLARENCE Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste - ELLIOT (turning to Dick) Look, Dick, I don't - CLARENCE (laughing) No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department. ELLIOT What department? CLARENCE What do you think, eightball? ELLIOT The police department? CLARENCE Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust. ELLIOT He trusts you? CLARENCE We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'. ELLIOT Sure. I didn't hear anything. Elliot is more than satisfied. Clarence makes a comical face at Dick when Elliot's not looking. Dick is wearing I-don't-believe-this-guy expresion. Alabama is forever blowing bubbles. CUT TO: EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - SNACK BAR - DAY We're in the snack bar area of the zoo. Alabama, Dick, and Elliot are sitting around a plastic outdoor table. Clarence is pacing around the table as he talks. Alabama is still blowing bubbles. CLARENCE (to Elliot) Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream? Elliot hasn't the slightest idea what that is supposed to mean. ELLIOT What? CLARENCE Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream? ELLIOT (with conviction) No. No, you don't. CLARENCE Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me? DICK Clarence... CLARENCE (to Dick) Let me handle this. ELLIOT Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe. CLARENCE Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts. Elliot has been silenced. He nods his head in agreement. INT. PORSCHE - MOVING - MULHOLLAND DRIVE - DAY Movie producer, Lee Donowitz, is driving his Porsche through the winding Hollywood hills, just enjoying being rich and powerful. His cellular car phone rings, he answers. LEE Hello. (pause) Elliot, it's Sunday. Why am I talkin' to you on Sunday? I don't see enough of you during the week I gotta talk to you on Sunday? Why is it you always call me when I'm on the windiest street in L.A.? BACK TO: ELLIOT Elliot is on the zoo payphone. Clarence is next to him. Dick is next to Clarence. Alabama is next to Dick, blowing bubbles. ELLIOT (on phone) I'm with that party you wanted me to get together with. Do you know what I'm talking about, Lee? BACK TO: LEE Store-fronts whiz by in the background. LEE Why the hell are you calling my phone to talk about that? BACK TO: ELLIOT ELLIOT Well, he'd here right now, and he insists on talking to you. BACK TO: LEE In the 7th street tunnel. Lee's voice echoes. LEE Are you outta your fuckin' mind? BACK TO: ELLIOT ELLIOT You said if I didn't get you on the - Clarence takes the receiverout of Elliot's hand. CLARENCE (into phone) Hello, Lee, it's Clarence. At last we meet. EXT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY Virgil's knocking on Dick's door. Floyd (Dick's room-mate) answers. VIRGIL Hello, is Dick Ritchie here? FLOYD Naw, he ain't home right now. VIRGIL Do you live here? FLOYD Yeah, I live here. VIRGIL Sorta room-mates? FLOYD Exactly room-mates. VIRGIL Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here? FLOYD Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn. VIRGIL How do you know? You been there? FLOYD No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember. VIRGIL You're right. It is. EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO - PAYPHONE - DAY Clarence is still on the phone with Lee. CLARENCE Lee, the reason I'm talkin' with you is I want to open "Doctor Zhivago" in L.A. And I want you to distribute it. BACK TO: LEE Stopped in the traffic on Sunset Boulevard. LEE I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie. BACK TO: CLARENCE The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot. BACK TO: LEE He's still on Sunset Boulevard, the traffic's moving better now. LEE I'm not sayin' I'm not interested. But being a distributer's not what I'm all about. I'm a film producer, I'm on this world to make good movies. Nothing more. Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end helps me on many levels. Traffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The background whizzes past him. LEE (continuing) But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk. BACK TO: CLARENCE CLARENCE Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine. BACK TO: LEE Speeding down a benchside road. LEE Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration? BACK TO: CLARENCE I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire. Pause. Clarence hands the phone to Elliot. CLARENCE (to Elliot) He wants to talk ya. ELLIOT (into phone) Mr. Donowitz? (pause) I told you, through Dick. (pause) He's in my acting class. (pause) About a year. (pause) Yeah, he's good. (pause) They grew up together. (pause) Sure thing. Elliot hangs up the phone. ELLIOT He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there. (pointing to Clarence) He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag. CLARENCE No problems on both counts. He offers Elliot the animal crackers. CLARENCE Have a cookie. Elliot takes one. ELLIOT Thanks. He puts it in the mouth. CLARENCE That wasn't a gorilla, was it? EXT. HOLIDAY INN - DAY The red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the hotel. Alabama hops out. Clarence stays in. ALABAMA You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK? CLARENCE Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up. ALABAMA I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles. CLARENCE You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner. ALABAMA I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms. They kiss. CLARENCE We now return to "Bullit" already in progress. He slams the Mustang in reverse and peels out of the hotel. Alabama walks her little walk from the parking lot to the pool area. Somebody whistles at her, she turns to them. ALABAMA Thank you. She gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens the door. INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CALRENCE'S ROOM - DAY She steps in only to find Virgil sitting on a chair placed in front of the door with a sawed-off shotgun aimed right at her. VIRGIL (calmly) Step inside and shut the door. She doesn't move, she's frozen. Virgil leans forward. VIRGIL (calmly) Lady. I'm gonna shoot you in the face. She does exactly as he says. Virgil rises, still aiming the sawed-off. VIRGIL Step away from the door, move into the bathroom. She does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then steps closer to her. VIRGIL OK, Alabama, where's our coke, where's Clarence, and when's he coming back. ALABAMA I think you got the wrong room, my name is Sadie. I don't have any Coke, but there's a Pepsi machine downstairs. I don't know any Clarence, but maybe my husband does. You might have heard of him, he plays football. Al Lylezado. He'll be home any minute, you can ask him. Virgil can't help but smile. VIRGIL You're cute. Virgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which catches Alabama square in the face, lifting her off the ground and dropping her flat on her back. INT. MOVING RED MUSTANG - DAY Clarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat, singing to himself. CLARENCE (singing) "Land of stardust, land of glamour, Vistavision and Cinema, Everything about it is a must, To get to Hollywood, or bust..." INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY Alabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste of the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil standing there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again to the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life. VIRGIL Hurts, don't it? It better. Took me a long time to kick like that. I'm third-degree blackbelt, you know? At home I got trophies. Tournaments I was in. Kicked all kinds of ass. I got great technique. You ain't hurt that bad. Get on your feet, Fruitloop. Alabama wobbily complies. VIRGIL Where's our coke? Where's Clarence? And when he's comin' back? Alabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to die, because this man is going to kill her. ALABAMA Go take a flying fuck and a rolling donut. Virgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach. The air is sucked out of her lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours gasping for air that's just not there. Virgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one up with a Zippo lighter. He takes a long, deep drag. VIRGIL Whatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get used to it. INT. HAMBURGER STAND - DAY Clarence walks through the door of some mom and pop fast-food restaurant. CLARENCE Woah! Smells like hamburgers in here! What's the biggest, fattest hamburger you guys got? The Iranian Guy at the counter says: IRANIAN GUY That would be Steve's double chili cheeseburger. CLARENCE Well, I want two of them bad boys. Two large orders of chili fries. Two large Diet Cokes. (looking at a menu at the wall) And I'll tell you what, why don't you give me a combination burrito as well. INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY Alabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room. She braces herself against the wall. She is very punchy. Virgil steps in front of her. VIRGIL You think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you? Dream on, cunt. You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool. And your pretty face is gonna turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my fuckin' coke? She doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her head slams into the left side of the wall. VIRGIL Where's Clarence?! Nothing. He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side. Her legs start to give way. He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her lightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him. VIRGIL When's Clarence getting back? She can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the middle finger. Virgil can't help but smile. VIRGIL You gotta lot of heart, kid. He gives her a spinning roadhouse kick to the head that sends her to the floor. INT. HAMBURGER STAND - DAY CLOSEUP - Burgers sizzling on a griddle, Chili and cheese is put on them. Clarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER reading a copy of "Newsweek" with Elvis on the cover. CLARENCE That's a great issue. The Customer lowers his magazine a little bit. CUSTOMER Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one. CLARENCE Have you read the story on Elvis? CUSTOMER No. Not yet. CLARENCE You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong. CUSTOMER That good, huh? He takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the Elvis article. CLARENCE It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps. CUSTOMER I can see what you mean. CLARENCE Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick. Clarence and the Customer laugh. INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - CLARENCE'S ROOM - DAY Alabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's crawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the cocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary. VIRGIL Now the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're the Boston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles Whitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you green money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the bitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to hoe. Now, the second one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to hoe. You still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around. Then you completely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's gotten to the point now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change. He's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the bed, and the black suitcase is right there. Alabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the black case and almost goes snow blind. VIRGIL Well, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great. One less thing I gotta worry about. Virgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse. She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her. VIRGIL OK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth - Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands. Mr. Karate-man smiles. VIRGIL Kid, you got a lotta heart. He moves toward her. Alabama's hands are shaking. VIRGIL Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a free swing. Now, I only do that for people I like. He moves close. Alabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open. Buttons fly everywhere. VIRGIL Go ahead, girl, take a stab at it. (giggling) You don't have anything to lose. CLOSEUP - Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose. Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many women all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into "I'll take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do" seething hatred. Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot. CLOSEUP - VIRGIL'S FACE Talk about bloodcurling yells. Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running down his face. While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster, so it doesn't kill him. Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot. VIRGIL OK, no more Mr. Nice-guy. Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the nose, breaking it. Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to it, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back, sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door. Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama. Alabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but not one of them has ever laughed before he did it. VIRGIL What's so fuckin' funny?!! ALABAMA (laughing) You look so ridiculous. She laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom. VIRGIL Laugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you laughing now? Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and squeezes it out in her hand. Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair. Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his eyes. VIRGIL Oh Jesus! She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face. VIRGIL Oh Mary, help me! The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a Tasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming toward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks her into the toilet. He recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the toilet tank. Virgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama brings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet lid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink. The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground. Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net hairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame, which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face. He fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending water spraying. Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama down, and runs out of the bathroom. Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off laying on the ground. He crawls toward it. Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45 automatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room. He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it. Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-running-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him. He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room. Alabama snatches the shotgun. Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact. The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second hits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest. Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun. Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been functioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi. ALABAMA Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace; where there is hatred, let me sow love; where there is injury, pardon; where there is doubt, faith; where there is despair, hope; where there is darkness, light; and where there is sadness, joy. O Divine Master, grant that I may not so much seek to be consoled as to console; to be understood as to understand; to be loved as to love; for it is in giving that we receive, it is pardoning that we are pardoned, and it is in dying that we are born to eternal life. Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn, only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun. CLARENCE Honey? She continues. He puts his gun away. CLARENCE Sweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute, She continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She lies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms. Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his shoulder. CUT TO: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - DAY Everybody is outside their rooms watching as Clarence walks through the pool area with his bundle. Sirens can be heard. EXT. MOVING RED MUSTANG - DAY Clarence is driving like mad. Alabama's passed out in the passenger seat. She's muttering to herself. Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the other strokes Alabama's hair. CLARENCE Sleep baby. Don't dream. Don't worry. Just sleep. You deserve better than this. I'm so sorry. Sleep my angel. Sleep peacefully. EXT. MOTEL 6 - NIGHT A new motel. Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside. INT. MOTEL 6 - CLARENCE'S ROOM - NIGHT Alabama, with a fat lip and a black and blue face, is asleep in bed. INT. NOWHERE Clarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly to the camera. He's in a headshot. CLARENCE I feel so horrible about what she went through. That fucker really beat the shit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt that the way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that much. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'. But, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured with words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to - that's a test of oneself. That's a true romance. I swear to God, I'll cut off my hands and gouge out my eyes before I'll every let anything happen to that lady again. CUT TO: EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT A wonderful, gracefully flowing shot of the Hollywood Hills. Off in the distance we hear the roar of a car engine. EXT. MULLHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT Vaaarrroooooommmm!!! A silver Porsche is driving hells bells, taking quick corners, pushing it to the edge. INT. MOVING PORSCHE - NIGHT Elliot Blitzer is the driver, standing on it. A blond, glitzy Coke Whore is sitting next to him. They're having a ball. Then they're seeing a red and blue light flashing in the rear-view window. It's the cops. ELLIOT Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this! (he pulls over) Kandi, you gotta help me. KANDI What can I do? He pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence gave him earlier. ELLIOT You gotta hold this for me. KANDI You must be high. Uh-huh. No way. ELLIOT (frantically) Just put it in your purse. KANDI I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse. ELLIOT They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything. KANDI No way, JosÈ. ELLIOT Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra. KANDI I'm not wearing a bra. ELLIOT (pleading) Put it in your pants. KANDI No. ELLIOT You're the one who wanted to drive fast. KANDI Read my lips. She mouths the word "no". ELLIOT After all I've done for you, you fuckin' whore!! She goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine instead. It rips open. Cocaine completely covers his blue suit. At that moment Elliot turns to face a flashing beam. Tears fill his eyes. INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY Elliot is sitting in a chair at the table. Two young, good-looking, casually dressed, Starsky and Hutch-type POLICE DETECTIVES are questioning him. They're known in the department as Nicholson and Dimes. The dark-haired one is Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky Dimes. NICHOLSON Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine - DIMES Not a tiny little vial - NICHOLSON But a fuckin' baggie. DIMES No don't sit here and feed us some shit. NICHOLSON You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time - DIMES You're no longer an extra - NICHOLSON Or a bit player - DIMES Or a supporting actor - NICHOLSON You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience - DIMES But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on - NICHOLSON And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman. DIMES 'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore - NICHOLSON That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions. Elliot starts crying. Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks and smile. Mission accomplished. INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN KRINKLE'S OFFICE - DAY CAPTAIN BUFFORD KRINKLE is sitting behind his desk, where he spends about seventy-five percent of his day. He's you standard rough, gruff, no-nonsense, by-the-book-type police captain. KRINKLE Nicholson! Dimes! Het in here! The two casually dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in, both shouting at once. DIMES Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts cryin', and then it was all over - NICHOLSON Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion - KRINKLE Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened, what's going on, and what are you talking about? DIMES Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him. NICHOLSON Nicholson and I. DIMES Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him. NICHOLSON Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid. DIMES So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it. CUT TO: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY Detroit. Very fancy restaurant. Four wise-guy Hoods, one older, the other three, youngsters, are seated at the table with Mr. Coccotti. COCCOTTI - And so, tomorrow morning comes, and no Virgil. I check with Nick Cardella, who Virgil was supposed to leave my narcotics with, he never shows. Now, children, somebody is stickin' a red-hot poker up my asshole and what I don't know is whose hand's on the handle. YOUNG WISE-GUY #1 (FRANKIE) You think Virgil started gettin' big ideas? COCCOTTI It's possible. Anybody can be carried away with delusions of grandeur. But after that incident in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil. YOUNG WISE-GUY #2 (DARIO) What happened? OLD WISE-GUY(LENNY) Virgil got picked up in a warehouse shakedown. He got five years, he served three. COCCOTTI Anybody who clams up and does hid time, I don't care how I feel about him personally, he's OK. BACK TO: KRINKLE'S OFFICE NICHOLSON It seems a cop from some department, we don't know where, stole a half a million dollars of coke from the property cage and he's been sittin' on it for a year and a half. Now the cops got this weirdo - DIMES Suspect's words - NICHOLSON To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz. DIMES He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag". KRINKLE That Vietnam movie? DIMES Uh-huh. KRINKLE That was a good fuckin' movie. DIMES Sure was. KRINKLE Do you believe him? DIMES I believe he believes him. NICHOLSON He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him. DIMES This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire. KRINKLE He'll wear a wire? DIMES We talked him into it. KRINKLE Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this. DIMES Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust. NICHOLSON Cocaine. Dirty cops. Hollywood. This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way. And we found it, so we want the fuckin' collar. BACK TO: INT. RESTAURANT - DAY YOUNG WISE-GUY #3 (MARVIN) Maybe Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's. Cardella turns Virgil's switch off, and Cardella decides to open up his own fruit stand. LENNY Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti. (to Marvin) Do you know Nick Cardella? MARVIN No. LENNY Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk? MARVIN I didn't mean - LENNY Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy. COCCOTTI Children, we're digressing. Another possibility is that rat-fuck whore and her wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil. Knowing Virgil, I find that hard to believe. But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot. So you see, children, I got a lot of questions and no answers. Find out who this wing-and-a-prayer artist is and take him off at the neck. TITLE CARD: "THE BIG DAY" EXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY - SUNRISE Clarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just off of Imperial Highway. As luck would have it, somebody has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of the road. Clarence and Alabama sit on the sofa, sharing a Jumbo Java, and enjoying the sunrise and wonderful view of the LAX Airport runways, where planes are taking off and landing. A plane takes off, and they stop and watch. CLARENCE Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports. ALABAMA Really? CLARENCE With a vengeance, I hated them. ALABAMA How come? CLARENCE I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't. ALABAMA What? CLARENCE Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun. Another plane takes off. CLARENCE But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant. ALABAMA You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch. CLARENCE I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove? ALABAMA Cancoon. CLARENCE Why Cancoon? ALABAMA It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think? CLARENCE But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing. They kiss. CLARENCE Don't you worry 'bout anything. It's all gonna work out for us. We deserve it. INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY Dick, Clarence and Alabama are just getting ready to leave for the drug deal. Floyd lays on the couch watching TV. Alabama's wearing dark glasses because of the black eye she has. CLARENCE (to Floyd) You sure that's how you get to the Beverly Wilshire? FLOYD I've partied there twice. Yeah, I'm sure. DICK Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass. (to Clarence) Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby. CLARENCE I'm just makin' sure we got everything. (pointing to Alabama) You got yours? She holds up the suitcase. The phone rings. The three pile out the door. Floyd picks up the phone. FLOYD Hello? He puts his hand over the receiver. FLOYD Dick, it's for you. You here? DICK No. I left. He starts to close the door then opens it again. DICK I'll take it. (he takes the receiver) Hello. (pause) Hi, Catherine, I was just walkin' out the - (pause) Really? (pause) I don't believe it. (pause) She really said that? (pause) I'll be by first thing. (pause) No, thank you for sending me out. (pause) Bye-bye. He hangs up and looks to Clarence. DICK (stunned) I got the part on "T.J. Hooker". CLARENCE No shit? Dick, that's great! Clarence and Alabama are jumping around. Floyd even smiles. DICK (still stunned) They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning. CLARENCE Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late. Dick looks at Clarence. He doesn't want to go. DICK Clarence. CLARENCE Yeah? DICK Um, nothing, let's go? They exit. EXT. LAX AIRPORT - HOTEL - DAY We see the airport and move in closer on a hotel on a landscape. INT. LAX AIRPORT - HOTEL ROOM - DAY Lenny can be seen putting a shotgun together. He is sitting on a bed. Dario enters the frame with his own shotgun. He goes over to Lenny and gives him some shells. Marvin walks through the frame cocking his own shotgun. The bathroom door opens behind Lenny and Frankie walks out twirling a couple of .45 automatics in his hands. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COP S' HOTEL ROOM - DAY Nicholson and Dimes and FOUR DETECTIVES from internal affairs are in a room on the same floor as Donowitz. They have just put a wire on Elliot. DIMES OK, say something. ELLIOT (talking loud into the wire) Hello! Hello! Hello! How now brown cow! NICHOLSON Just talk regular. ELLIOT (normal tone) "But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief -" DIMES Are you gettin' this shit? DETECTIVE BY TAPE MACHINE Clear as a bell. Nicholson, Dime, and the head IA Officer, Wurlitzer, huddle by Elliot. DIMES Now, remember, we'll be monitoring just down the hall. ELLIOT And if there's any sign of trouble you'll come in. NICHOLSON Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail. DIMES We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine. NICHOLSON So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke. WURLITZER And this fellow Clarence? ELLIOT Yeah, Clarence. WURLITZER You gotta get him name the police officer behind all this. ELLIOT I'll try. DIMES You do more than try. NICHOLSON You do. DIMES Hope you're a good actor, Elliot. INT. MOVING RED MUSTANG - DAY Clarence, Dick and Alabama en route. DICK You got that playing basketball? ALABAMA Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face. They stop at a red light. Clarence looks at Alabama. CLARENCE Red light means love, baby. He and Alabama start kissing. INT. MOVING CADILLAC - DAY Marvin, Frankie, Lenny and Dario in a rented Caddy. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE PARKING LOT - DAY Clarence, Alabama, and Dick get out of the red Mustang. Dick takes the suitcase. CLARENCE I'll take that. Now, remember, both of you, let me do the talking. Clarence takes out his .38. Dick reacts. They walk and talk. DICK What the fuck did you bring that for. CLARENCE In case. DICK In case of what? CLARENCE In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say? DICK Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp - CLARENCE I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it. Pause. Clarence stops walking. CLARENCE Hold it, guys. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty scared. What say we forget the whole thing. Dick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved. DICK Do you really mean it? CLARENCE No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama? ALABAMA I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence. CLARENCE It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside. DICK Now's a helluva time to play "what if". CLARENCE This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught. ALABAMA It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey. CLARENCE That rhymes. He kisses her. DICK Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here. CLARENCE Yeah, let's just get outta here. The three walk back to the car. Clarence gets behind the wheel. The other two climb in. Clarence hops back out. CLARENCE I'm sorry guys, I gotta do it. As petrified as I am, I just can't walk away. I'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life if I don't go in there. Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop, he's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high. And I'm just the man who can get him there. So what say we throw caution to the wind and let the chips fall where they may. Clarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel. Dick and Alabama exchange looks and follow. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LOBBY - DAY Elliot's walking around the lobby. He's very nervous, so he's singing to himself. ELLIOT (singing) There's a man who leads a life of danger, To everyone he meets he stays a stranger. Be careful what you say, you'll give yourself away... INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - COPS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY Nicholson, Dimes, Wurlitzer, and the three other Detectives surround the tape machine. Coming from the machine: ELLIOT'S VOICE (off) ... odds are you won't live to see tomorrow, secret agent man, secret agent man.... Nicholson looks at Dimes. DIMES Why, all of the sudden, have I got a bad feeling? BACK TO: LOBBY Clarence enters the lobby alone, he's carrying the suitcase. He spots Elliot and goes in his direction. Elliot sees Clarence approaching him. He says to himself, quietly: ELLIOT Elliot, your motivation is to stay out of jail. Clarence walks up to Elliot, they shake hands. ELLIOT Where's everybody else? CLARENCE They'll be along. Alabama and Dick enter the lobby, they join up with Clarence and Elliot. ELLIOT Hi, Dick. DICK How you doin', Elliot? CLARENCE Well, I guess it's about that time. ELLIOT I guess so. Follow me. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY The four of them are riding in the elevator. As luck would have it, they have the car to themselves. Rinky-drink elevator Muzak is playing. They are all silent. CLARENCE Elliot. ELLIOT Yeah? CLARENCE Get on your knees. Not sure he heard him right. ELLIOT What? Clarence hits the stop button on the elevator panel and whips out his .38. CLARENCE I said get on your fuckin' knees. Elliot does it immediately. Dick and Alabama react. CLARENCE Shut up, both of you, I know what I'm doin'. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM Pandemonium. DIMES He knows. NICHOLSON How the fuck could he know? DIMES He saw the wire. NICHOLSON How's he supposed to see the wire? DIMES He knows something's up. BACK TO: ELEVATOR Clarence puts the .38 against Elliot's forehead. CLARENCE You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you? No answer. CLARENCE Don't you? ELLIOT (petrified) No. CLARENCE (yelling) Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it! BACK TO: COPS' ROOM NICHOLSON We gotta get him outta there. DIMES Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator. BACK TO: ELEVATOR CLARENCE Say it, goddamn it! ELLIOT You are the dumbest person in the world. CLARENCE Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am. ELLIOT No. No you're not. CLARENCE What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face. BACK TO: COPS NICHOLSON He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on. DIMES This guy's gonna kill him. BACK TO: ELEVATOR CLARENCE Stand up. Elliot does. The .38 is still pressed against his forehead. CLARENCE Like Nick Carter used to say: I I'm wrong, I'll apologize. I want you to tell me what's waiting for us up there. Something's amiss. I can feel it. If anything out of the ordinary goes down, believe this, you're gonna be the first one shot. Trust me, I am AIDS, you fuck with me, you die. Now quit making me mad and tell me why I'm so fucking nervous. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM DIMES He's bluffin', I knew it. He doesn't know shit. NICHOLSON Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself. DIMES You're an actor, so act, motherfucker. BACK TO: ELEVATOR Elliot still hasn't answered. CLARENCE OK. With the .38 up against Elliot's head Clarence puts his palm over the top of the gun to shield himself from the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what he's gonna do. Elliot, tears running down, starts talking for the benefit of the people at the other end of the wire. He sounds like a little boy. ELLIOT I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. I wish somebody would just come and get me 'cause I don't like this. This is not what I thought it would be. And I wish somebody would just take me away. Just take me away Come and get me. 'Cause I don't like this anymore. I can't take this. I'm sorry but I just can't. So, if somebody would just come to my rescue, everything would be alright. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM Nicholson and Dimes shake their hands, They have a "well, that's that" expression an their faces. BACK TO: ELEVATOR Clarence puts down the gun and hugs Elliot. CLARENCE Sorry, Elliot. Nothing personal. I just hadda make sure you're all right. I'm sure. I really apologize for scaring you so bad, but believe me, I'm just as scared as you. Friends? Elliot, in a state of shock, takes Clarence's hand. Dick and Alabama are relieved. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM Nicholson and Dimes listen open-mouthed, not believing what they're hearing. INT. DICK'S APARTMENT - DAY Floyd still lying on the couch watching TV. He hasn't moved since we last saw him. There is a knock from the door. FLOYD (not turning away from TV) It's open. The front door flies open and the four Wise-guys rapidly enter the room. The door slams shut. All have their sawed-offs drawn and pointing at Floyd. FLOYD Yes. LENNY Are you Dick Ritchie? FLOYD No. LENNY Do you know a Clarence Worley? FLOYD Yes. LENNY Do you know where we can find him? FLOYD He's at the Beverly Wilshire. LENNY Where's that? FLOYD Well, you go down Beechwood... INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY The door opens and reveals an extremely muscular guy with an Uzi strapped to his shoulder standing in the doorway, his name is Monty. MONTY Hi, Elliot. Are these your friends? ELLIOT You could say that. Everybody, this is Monty. MONTY C'mon in. Lee's in the can. He'll be out in a quick. They all move into the room, it is very luxurious. Another incredibly muscular GUY, Boris, is sitting on the sofa, he too has an Uzi. Monty begins patting everybody down. MONTY Sorry, nothin personal. He starts to search Clarence. Clarence back away. CLARENCE No need to search me, daredevil. All you'll find is a .38 calibre. Boris gets up from the couch. BORIS What compelled you to bring that along? CLARENCE The same thing that compelled you, Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire weaponry to a business meeting. BORIS I'll take that. CLARENCE You'll have to. The toilet flushes in the bathroom. The door swings open and Lee Donowitz emerges. LEE They're here. Who's who? ELLIOT Lee, this is my friend Dick, and these are his friends, Clarence and Alabama. BORIS (pointing at Clarence) This guy's packin'. LEE Really? CLARENCE Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table. LEE I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody. They all sit around a fancy glass table except for Boris, who's getting the coffee, and Monty, who's standing behind Lee's chair. CLARENCE Oh, Mr. Donowitz - LEE Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee. CLARENCE OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever. LEE Thank you very much, Clarence. CLARENCE You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit. LEE I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage. CLARENCE Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books. Boris starts placing clear-glass coffee cups in front of everybody and fills everybody's cup from a fancy coffee pot that he handles like an expert. LEE Clarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more than I do, but I wouldn't count on it. Clarence is on a roll and he knows it. CLARENCE They ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films. And do you know what films are? They're for people who don't like movies. "Mad Max", that's a movie. "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", that's a movie. "Rio Bravo", that's a movie. "Rumble Fish", that's a fuckin' movie. And, "Coming Home in a Body Bag", that's a movie. It was the first movie with balls to win a lot of Oscars since the "The Deer Hunter". BACK TO: COPS' ROOM They're all listening to this. DIMES What's this guy doin'? Makin' a drug deal or gettin' a job on the "New Yorker"? BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM CLARENCE My uncle Roger and uncle Cliff, both of which were in Nam, saw "Coming Home in a Body Bag" and thought it was the most accurate Vietnam film they'd ever seen. LEE You know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit wars says that, it makes the whole project worthwhile. Clarence, my friend, and I call you my friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you have for me. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM DIMES Thank God. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM Clarence puts the suitcase on the table. CLARENCE Lee, when you see this you're gonna shit. BACK TO: LOBBY The four Wise-guys are at the desk. LENNY (quietly to the others) What was the Jew-boy's name? MARVIN Donowitz, he said. FRONT-DESK GUY How can I help you, Gentlemen? LENNY Yeah, we're from Warner Bros. What room is Mr. Donowitz in? BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM Lee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it. CLARENCE Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more. LEE Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee. CLARENCE Me too, Boris. Boris fills both of their cups. They both, calm as a lake, take cream and sugar. All eyes are on them. Lee uses light cream and sugar, he begins stirring this cup. Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar. LEE (stirring loudly) You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar? CLARENCE I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up. Both are cool as cucumbers. LEE I have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage, this is quality. Can Boris make anybody a sandwich? I got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canters in there. ALABAMA No thank you. DICK No. But thanks. CLARENCE No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick. LEE Where'd you go? CLARENCE A Norms in Van Nuys. LEE Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys. Lee continues looking at the merchandise. Alabama writes something in her napkin with a pencil. She slides the napkin over to Clarence. It says: "You're so cool" with a tiny heart drawn on the bottom of it. Clarence takes the pencil and draws an arrow through the heart. She takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket. Lee looks up. LEE OK, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect. But, whenever I'm offered a deal that's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie. Convince me you're on the level. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM DIMES If he don't bite, we ain't got shit except posession. NICHOLSON Convince him. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM CLARENCE Well, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with professionals. I'm not a professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take that, and I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a helluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug dealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all of the time. Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and you're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker. I like you, and I'm still scared. I'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street, only to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a million dollars, but I can't get the million dollars for it. But, you can. So, I'll sell it to you for a couple a hundred thousand. You go to make a million. It's all found money to me anyway. Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred thousand is the world. LEE Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop. CLARENCE Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'. (to Elliot) Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit. (to Lee) He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it. LEE Why does he trust you? CLARENCE We grew up together. LEE If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it? CLARENCE I bullshitted him. Lee starts laughing. LEE That's wild. This fucking guy's a madman. I love it. Monty, go in the other room and get the money. Clarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks. DIMES & NICHOLSON Bingo! BACK TO: ELEVATOR The four Wise-guys are coming up. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM LEE (pointing to Alabama) What's your part in this? ALABAMA I'm his wife. LEE (referring to Dick) How 'bout you? DICK I know Elliot. LEE And Elliot knows me. Tell me, Clarence, what department does you friend work in? Dick and Alabama panic. CLARENCE (without missing a beat) Carson County Sheriffs. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM The internal affairs officers high five. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM Monty brings in a briefcase of money and puts it down on the table. LEE Wanna count your money? CLARENCE Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room. BACK TO: COPS' ROOM They all stand. DIMES OK, boys. Let's go get 'em. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - DAY Clarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door. As soon as it's shut he starts doing the twist. He can't believe he's pulled it off. He goes to the toilet and starts taking a piss. He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink. ELVIS Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool. CLARENCE I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face. ELVIS All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee. CLARENCE Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body. ELVIS Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to". CLARENCE That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM Everything's just as it was. Sudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with guns drawn. DIMES & NICHOLSON Police! Freeze, you're all under arrest! Everybody at the table stands up. Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis. DIMES You two! Put the guns on the floor and back away. MONTY Fuck you! All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away. LEE Monty, what are you talking about? So what they say. DIMES This is your last warning! Drop those fuckin' guns! BORIS This is your last warning! We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it! Now get on the floor! DICK What the fuck am I doing here? LEE Boris! Everybody's gonna get killed! They're cops! MONTY So they're cops. Who gives a shit? BORIS Lee, something I never told you about me. I don't like cops. NICHOLSON OK, let's everybody calm down and get nice. Nobody has to die. We don't want it, and you don't want it. LEE We don't want it. The four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie, who has two .45 automatics, one in each hand. Half of the cops spin around. WURLITZER Freeze! LENNY Who are you guys? WURLITZER Police. DARIO (to Lenny) Do we get any extra if we have to kill cops? BACK TO: BATHROOM Clarence and Elvis. CLARENCE How do you think I'm doin' with Lee? ELVIS Are you kiddin'? He loves you. CLARENCE You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you? ELVIS You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass. CLARENCE I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag". ELVIS That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that. Elvis fixes Clarence's collar. ELVIS I like ya, Clarence. Always have. BACK TO: LEE'S ROOM This is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one. Gangsters on one end with shotguns. Bodyguards with machine guns on the other. And cops with handguns in the middle. Dick's ready to pass out. Alabama's so scared she pees on herself. For Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it. ELLIOT Officer Dimes? Officer Dimes. Dimes looks at Elliot. ELLIOT This has nothing to do with me anymore. Can I just leave and you guys just settle it by yourselves? DIMES Elliot, shut the fuck up and stay put! LEE (to Elliot) How did you know his name? How the fuck did he know your name? Why, you fuckin' little piece of shit! ELLIOT Lee, understand, I didn't want to - DIMES Shut the fuck up! LEE Well, I hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty years 'cause your career is over as of now! You might as weel burn your SAG card! To think I treated you as a son! And you stabbed me in the heart! Lee can't control his anger any more. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and flings hot coffee into Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees, Instinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice. Alabama screams. Boris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets. DIMES (screaming) Cody!!! Nicholson flies backwards. Marvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks back and forth then on the floor. Clarence opens the bathroom door. Dimes hits the ground firing. A shot catches Clarence in the forehead. Alabama screams. Dario fires his sawed-off. It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the bathroom sink, smashing the mirror. It might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either hits the ground or runs for cover. Dimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground. Boris dives into the kitchen area. Monty tips the table over. Marvin dives behind the sofa. Dario runs out of the door and down the hall. With bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything. Two IA Officers are shot right away. Frankie takes an Uzi hit. He goes down firing both automatics. Elliot gets it from both sides. Alabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the bathroom. Clarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching. He moves and falls off. Alabama continues crawling. Marvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires. The shotgun blast hits the glass table and Monty. Monty stands up screaming. The Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty. As Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over the apartment. EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY Cop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel. BACK TO: GUNFIGHT Alabama crawling. The suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick. Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air. Marvin comes from behind the sofa and fires. The suitcase is hit in mid-air. White powder goes everywhere. The room is enveloped in cocaine. Dick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door. An IA Officer goes after him. Lenny makes a break for it. Wurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin. Alabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence. ALABAMA Sweety? Clarence's face is awash with blood. CLARENCE I... I can't see you... I've got blood in my eyes... He dies. Alabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - HALLWAY - DAY Dario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police. He fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ANOTHER HALLWAY The hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast. Dick comes around the corner, running as if on fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the same corner. IA OFFICER (aiming gun) Freeze! Dick does. DICK I'm unarmed! IA OFFICER Put your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch! He does. Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer, sending him to the wall. DICK Oh shit. He starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the corner and runs down the hall. Dick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box. Lenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aimes his sawed-off. DICK Look, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm sorry. Two elevator doors on either side of them open. Lenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says: LENNY Lotsa luck. Lenny dives into one elevator car. Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors close. BACK TO: HOTEL ROOM The Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each other down. Wurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned down in the kitchen. In the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get his heart started. It's not working. She slaps him hard in the face a couple of times. ALABAMA Wake up, goddamn it! Dimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the grip of a dead Wise-guy. Boris peeks around the wall to fire. Dimes lets loose with a blast. A scream is heard. BORIS (off) I'm shot! Stop! DIMES Throw out your gun, asshole! The Uzi's tossed out. Dimes goes to where Wurlitzer is. DIMES (to Marvin) OK, black jacket! It's two against one now! Toss the gun and lie face down on the floor or die like all you friends. The shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa. INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - ELEVATOR - DAY Dick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this. The doors open on the fourth floor. He runs out into the hallway. HALLWAY He starts trying the room doors for an open one. DICK Oh, God, if you just get me outta this I swear to God I'll never fuck up again. Please, just let me get to "T.J. Hooker" on Monday. STEWARDESS'S ROOM - DAY Dick steps in. Three gorgeous girls are doing a killer aerobics workout to a video on TV. The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't hear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed. LEE'S ROOM Boris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live. He's lying on the kitchen floor. Dimes stands over him. He has the sawed-off in his hand. DIMES Don't even give me an excuse, motherfucker. Dimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none. Wurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch. Dimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying over him. Dimes walks over to Wurlitzer. DIMES Everything's under control here. WURLITZER Sorry about Nicholson. DIMES Me too. WURLITZER I'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside. DIMES You do that. Wurlitzer exits. Dimes grabs the phone. LOBBY Shotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby. A Cop yells out. COP You! Stop! Lenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it. Other cops rush forward. Lenny grabs a woman standing by. LENNY Get back or I'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come! LEE'S ROOM Dimes on the phone talking with the department. Boris is still moving on the floor. Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back. Alabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket. She reaches in and pulls out his .38. She wipes her eyes. She holds the gun in her hand and remembers Clarence saying: CLARENCE (off) She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist, and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier! Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge! Alabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand. Marvin turns his head toward her. She shoots him twice. Dimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun. She fires. He's hit in the head and flung to the floor. She sees Boris on the kitchen floor. ALABAMA Bye-bye, Boris. Good luck. BORIS You too, cutie. She starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money. She takes it and walks out the door. HALLWAY The elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out. Alabama comes around the corner. WURLITZER Hey, you! Alabama shoots him three times in the belly. She steps into the elevator, the doors close. LOBBY Alabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out. In the background, cops are all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage. LENNY I wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to take me to Kilimanjaro and... and a million bucks! (pause) Small bills! EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - PARKING LOT - DAY Alabama puts the briefcase in the trunk. She gets into the Mustang and drives away. INT. MUSTANG - MOVING - DAY Alabama's driving fast down the freeway. The DJ on the radio is trying to be funny. She's muttering to herself. ALABAMA I could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked away. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred percent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad. I should laugh 'cause you don't deserve any better. I could get another guy like that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. Asshole. You're a asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted it all, didn't ya? Didn't ya? Well watcha got now? You ain't got the money. You ain't got me. You ain't even got your body anymore. You got nothin'. Nada. Zip. Goose egg. Nil. Donut. The song "Little Arrows" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks down and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues. She wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on the dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth. She pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view mirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens on the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads it: "You're so cool". She tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She looks around for, and finally finds, the "Sgt. Fury" comic book Clarence bought her. And with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away from the Mustang forever.

          FADE IN:
          
          
          1 EXT. RAIN FOREST, OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK, WASHINGTON - DAWN 
          
          Moss-draped. Shadow-drenched. Tortured tree trunks twist 
          upward, reaching for rare sunlight. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          I'd never given much thought to how I would die..
          
          Suddenly, every creature in the forest is deadly silent. Neither 
          bird, beast nor insect make a noise. A predator is near. 
          
          Then, in the distance, hear a tiny SNICK - a twig snapping. 
          Abruptly, we're on the move. Fast.
          
          
          UNKNOWN POV - MOVING
          
          Trees start whipping past us at a dizzying speed, branches 
          are dodged with preternatural agility. And we're speeding
          up, chasing something. It's exhilarating. Terrifying. 
          Finally, up ahead, we get the first glimpse of our prey -
          -
          
          
          A DEER
          
          
          -- running for its life as it darts through this maze of 
          a forest. It sprints forward, but we gain on it. Beyond the deer, 
          SEE the forest's edge ahead, white sunlight glowing against the
          trees. The buck races for the light. We're just behind it, 
          about to emerge from the shadowy darkness -
          -
          
          
          The deer LEAPS into the light in a high arc, hovering (suddenly 
          SLOW MOTION) against the WHITE GLARE of the sun... then BAM! 
          
          
          The deer abruptly plummets out of frame at an unnatural angle, 
          leaving the WHITE GLARE to fill the screen. HOLD ON WHITENESS 
          -
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          
          
          But dying in the place of someone I
          love seems like a good way to go..
          . 
          
          
          -- Then into the WHITENESS steps the face of -
          
          
          2 ISABELLA SWAN, 172
          
          
          Eyes closed against the sunlight, absorbing its rays. Long, 
          dark hair frames alabaster skin. She's a vulnerable,
          introverted, imperfect beauty.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          
          ... So I can't bring myself to 
          regret the decision that brought me 
          here to die... 
          
          
          The background comes into focus as we realize we're now in -
          
          
          2.
          EXT. SCOTTSDALE, AZ - DAY
          
          
          Bella stands at the end of a cul-de-sac on the desert's edge.
          The sun blazes behind her -- she bends down and carefully 
          scoops a tiny BARREL CACTUS into a clay pot. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          
          ... The decision to leave home.
          
          She stares at the cactus in a state of reverie, until 
          
          
          BLONDE #1 (O.S.)
          Bye, Bella!
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - McMansion ACROSS THE STREET 
          
          
          Three tanned, athletic, blonde GIRLS hop into a convertible 
          Mercedes. Their flawless, bought-and-paid for beauty contrasts 
          with Bella's pale naturalness. They wave.
          
          
          BLONDE #
          Good luck at your new school! 
          
          
          They ADLIB superficial good wishes, "Don't forget to write;"
          
          "We'll miss you." Bella waves back, sweetly, but 
          halfheartedly as she steps off the curb.
          
          
          BELLA
          Have a good..
          
          --and trips. When she rights herself, they're already gone.
          
          
          BELLA
          ... life. 
          
          
          Clearly, not close friends. Bella's grown-up demeanor and
          innate intelligence become apparent as -
          -
          
          
          BELLA'S MOTHER, RENE, mid 30's --exits their house --it's
          low rent for this ritzy neighborhood. Rene is eclectic, 
          scattered, anxious, more best friend than parent. She 
          thrusts a cell phone at Bella. 
          
          
          RENE
          It won't work again, baby. 
          
          
          BELLA
          You put it on hold. 
          
          
          RENE
          I did? 
          
          
          BELLA
          Look. You also called Mexico.
          
          
          Rene pushes her playfully, they laugh.
          
          
          
          3.
          RENE
          I'll figure it out. You gotta be able 
          to reach me and Phil on the road - 
          I 
          love saying that - on the road.
          
          
          BELLA
          Very romantic.
          
          
          PHIL, 31, good looking with an athlete's body, exits the
          house, carrying Bella's three suitcases with ease. 
          
          
          PHIL
          If you call crappy motels, backwater 
          towns and ballpark hot dogs romantic.
          
          
          He puts his Phoenix Desert Dogs baseball hat on Rene's head with 
          a
          kiss. Phil's love of Rene reassures Bella. Phil heads to the old
          station wagon to load the luggage, while Rene slips her arm 
          through Bella's, clinging to her as they walk to car.
          
          
          RENE
          Now, you know if you change your 
          mind, I'll race back here from 
          wherever the game is. 
          
          
          But Rene's strained expression tells us what a great 
          sacrifice that would be. Bella forces a smile.
          
          
          BELLA
          I won't change my mind, mom.
          
          
          RENE
          You might. You've always hated Forks. 
          
          
          BELLA
          It's not about Forks, it's about 
          Dad. I mean, two weeks a year, we 
          barely know each other. 
          
          
          (off Rene's still worried 
          look)
          Mom, I want to go. I'll be fine.
          
          
          But as Rene hugs Bella, we see the truth on BELLA'S FACE 
          dread, doubt, regret. Off Bella, struggling to keep her 
          facade up as she climbs into the back seat of the car..

          The McMansions get smaller as we SWEEP OVER the scorched

          cloud..

          Slowly, the clouds start getting more numerous, thicker, darker..

          until we're completely immersed in them... the sun disappearing.
          Finally, we EMERGE from the clouds to find below

          5 EXT. WASHINGTON STATE - OLYMPIC PENINSULA (AERIAL SHOT)- DAY5
          
          
          Nothing but deep, dark, green forests for miles. SWEEP DOWN, 
          finding the eerily dramatic Lake Crescent. Over it all hangs 
          the mist from the ever-present cloudy grey sky. Everything 
          is wet and green and drenched in shade..

          THE PASSENGER SIDE WINDOW 
          
          
          Bella looks out, taking in her gloomy new surroundings..

          6 INT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY - WAITING AT LIGHT 
          6
          
          
          Bella sits next to her uniformed father, police chief CHARLIE 
          SWAN, 40's. Taciturn, introverted like Bella. Their strained 
          silence contrasts Bella's relationship with her mother. Beat.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Your hair's longer.
          
          
          BELLA
          I cut it since last time I saw you. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Guess it grew out again.
          
          
          She just nods. Silence.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          How's your mom?
          
          
          BELLA
          Good. 
          
          
          More silence. Yikes. They pass a SIGN: The City Of Forks
          Welcomes You - Pop. 3246. Bella sighs.

          7 EXT. FORKS, WASHINGTON - DAY 
          7
          
          
          As the cruiser drives through, Bella takes in this logging town 
          -
          every storefront has a wood carving. The Timber Museum's sign is
          two loggers sawing a stump. The POLICE STATION is a small wooden 
          building across from City Hall..
          . 
          
          
          8 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
          8
          
          
          The cruiser pulls up to the old two-story house. A woodshed full 
          of firewood. There's a small boat in the garage, fishing gear, an
          old buoy. Bella climbs out... home.
          
          
          9 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY 
          9
          
          
          Bella and Charlie carry in her bags. The house isn't stylish
          (the only new thing here is a Flat Screen T.V.), but it's
          comfortable, lived-in. Lots of fishing memorabilia; photos 
          of Charlie fishing with Quileute Indian BILLY BLACK. 
          
          
          Handmade cards to Daddy and photos of Bella. She winces at
          herself, age 7, in a tutu, sitting stubbornly on the ground. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          
          
          I put Grandpa's old desk in your 
          
          
          room. And I cleared some shelves 
          
          
          in the bathroom. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (grimacing)
          That's right. One bathroom.
          
          
          Bella's eye lands on a PHOTO of a much younger Charlie and
          Rene, on vacation, beaming with love. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I'll just put these up in your room 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          I can do it 
          -
          
          
          They both reach for the bags, bumping one another awkwardly. 
          Bella backs off, letting Charlie carry the bags upstairs.
          
          
          10 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - DAY 10
          
          
          An antique rolltop desk sits in a corner. The room is filled with 
          childhood remnants that have seen better days. As she unpacks her 
          CD case, loneliness finally overwhelms her. She sits heavily on 
          the edge of the bed, tears threatening..
          . 
          
          
          Then we hear a HONK outside. Bella runs across the hall and looks 
          out the window to see 
          -
          
          
          11 OUTSIDE - A FADED RED TRUCK, CIRCA 1960 pulls up... 11
          
          
          
          6.
          EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          
          Bella exits to find Charlie greeting the driver, JACOB BLACK, 
          16, Quileute Indian, amiable with long black hair, and hints of 
          childish roundness in his face. The two of them help Jacob's
          father, BILLY BLACK (from the photos), into a wheelchair. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella, you remember Billy Black. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Glad you're finally here. Charlie 
          hasn't shut up about it since you 
          told him you were coming. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Keep exaggerating, I'll wheel you 
          down the hill. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Right after I ram you in the ankles.
          
          
          Billy takes several rolls at Charlie, who dodges. Jacob shakes 
          his head at their two fathers as he shyly approaches Bella.
          
          
          JACOB
          I'm Jacob. We made mud pies 
          together when we were little kids. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Yeah... I think I remember..
          .
          (re: the dads)
          Are they always like this?
          
          
          JACOB
          It's getting worse with old age.
          
          
          Charlie then pats the hood of the truck, addressing Bella 
          -
          
          
          CHARLIE
          So what do you think of your 
          homecoming gift?
          
          
          BELLA
          No way. The truck is for me?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Just bought it off Billy, here. 
          
          
          JACOB
          I rebuilt the engine and -
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          It's perfect!
          
          
          
          7.
          She beams. It's the first genuine smile we've seen on her.
          She rushes to the truck. Jacob eagerly joins her. 
          
          
          JACOB
          Okay, so you gotta double pump the 
          clutch when you shift, but -
          -
          
          
          He hands her the keys as she climbs in.
          
          
          BELLA
          Maybe I can give you a ride to school.
          
          
          JACOB
          I go to school on the reservation.
          
          
          BELLA
          Too bad. Would've been nice to 
          know at least one person. 
          
          
          As she starts up the truck we MATCH CUT

          Loud, belching and turning heads as Bella parks, mortified. All 
          eyes are on her as she climbs out of her truck and steps in 
          a 
          PUDDLE, soaking her sneakers. She slinks toward school, as we

          -- Bella (never without her IPOD) makes her way thru kids who 
          stare openly; a few brave ones say hi. They're all talking 
          about her. This is her hell. 
          -- Bella wanders the walkways looking for room numbers, lost. 
          -- Constant stares at Bella, the outsider..
          .
          SERIES ENDS when a sweet, nerd-cute, motor mouth boy, ERIC, 
          appears in her path. 
          
          
          ERIC
          You're Isabella Swan, the new girl. Hi. 
          I'm Eric. The eyes and ears of this 
          place. Anything you need. Tour guide, 
          lunch date, shoulder to cry on.
          
          
          Bella just looks at him. Is he for real?
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm kind of the suffer in silence type.
          
          
          ERIC
          Good headline for your feature

          Would you mind just pointing me 
          toward Mr. Varner's class?
          
          
          He leads her away, enjoying the attentive stares, as she cringes 
          from them

          INT. GYM - DAY 14
          
          
          The boys' basketball team runs drills on half the basketball
          court. A girls' volleyball game occupies the other half.
          
          
          Bella, in gym clothes, avoids the volleyball like it's
          radioactive. An energetic, athletic team captain, JESSICA, 
          motivates the players.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Block it, Chloe! Yeah! Good attack! 
          
          
          Unfortunately, the volleyball heads toward Bella. She closes 
          her eyes and flails at it, SMACKING it. It flies off court 
          -
          
          
          -- and beans a basketball player in the head. He is MIKE 
          NEWTON, good looking, affable, with blond spiky hair. 
          
          
          MIKE 
          Ow!
          
          
          BELLA
          (hurries to him, 
          
          
          embarrassed)
          Are you alright? I warned them not 
          to make me play.
          
          
          MIKE
          It's only a flesh wound.
          
          
          Mike grins and she smiles, relieved. A BELL RINGS, class over. 
          
          
          MIKE
          You're Isabella, right?

          I'm Mike. Newton.
          
          
          He looks at her a second too long, clearly taken by her -
          -
          Suddenly, Jessica appears, stepping between them. Subtle, 
          but possessive as she nudges Mike.
          
          
          JESSICA
          She's got a great spike, doesn't 
          she? 
          
          
          (to Bella)
          So, you're from Arizona, right? 
          Aren't people supposed to be tan 
          down there?
          
          
          BELLA
          That's why they kicked me out.
          
          
          Mike laughs, and because he does, Jessica does. Bella just 
          feels uncomfortable with the attention..

          FOLLOW Bella, Mike and Jessica as they carry their trays to 
          a 
          table. Eric appears, and squishes into a seat next to Bella. 
          
          
          ERIC
          Mike, you met my home girl Bella. 
          
          
          MIKE
          Your home girl?
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
           (to Bella)
          It's first grade all over again, 
          and you're the shiny new toy.
          
          
          Bella smiles awkwardly. Suddenly, a FLASHBULB blinds Bella. 
          She looks up at the photographer, ANGELA, Jessica's sweet, 
          low key, insecure friend.

          teen drinking. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Sorry. There's always eating disorders, 
          or Speedo padding on the swim team

          .

          They swing open as four of the most astounding people Bella's
          ever seen enter (IN SLOW MOTION): THE CULLENS. Two guys, two 
          girls, all chalky pale, purplish shadows under their eyes..
          . 
          and all devastatingly beautiful. 
          
          
          They move through the room with effortless grace, and take a seat 
          at a table furthest from Bella's. Bella leans over to Jessica and
          Angela.

          kids. They all moved down here 
          from Alaska two years ago. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          They kinda keep to themselves.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Because they're all together. 
          Like, together together. The 
          blonde girl, Rosalie, and the big 
          dark-haired guy, Emmett..
          .
          
          
          ON ROSALIE, 18, long blonde hair, model beautiful, knows it. 
          Alongside her is EMMETT, 17, big, brawny, like a weight 
          lifter, but a playful glint in his eye. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          ... they're a thing. I'm not even
          sure that's legal.
          
          
          
          11.
          ANGELA
          Jess, they're not actually related. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          But they live together. And the 
          little dark haired girl, Alice, 
          she's really weird..
          . 
          
          
          ON ALICE, 17, pixie-like, rail thin, light on her feet with short, 
          black hair going in every direction. She hovers over, JASPER, 18, 
          honey-blond hair, tall, lean, slightly tortured.
          
          
          JESSICA
          ... she's with Jasper, the blonde 
          who looks like he's in pain. 
          I 
          mean, Dr. Cullen's like this foster 
          dad slash match maker. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          Maybe he'll adopt me.
          
          
          Bella laughs, liking her... then sees the last Cullen to enter 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD, 17. Lanky, with untidy, bronze colored hair. He seems 
          inwardly turned, mysterious. More boyish than the others. But 
          the most striking of all. Bella can't take her eyes off him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Who's he?
          
          
          JESSICA
          That's Edward Cullen.
          
          
          Suddenly, Edward looks over, as if he heard Jessica from 
          across the room. His eyes meet Bella's. But he seems..
          . 
          confused. Bella quickly looks away. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          He's totally gorgeous, obviously. 
          But apparently, no one here is good 
          enough for him. Like I care. 
          
          
          (she obviously does)
          Anyway, don't waste your time. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I wasn't planning on it.
          
          
          But Bella can't help but peek at Edward again. He's staring
          at her outright now, with a slightly frustrated expression 
          that unnerves Bella. She hides behind her hair.
          
          
          16 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY 16
          
          
          A room of black-topped lab tables. Two to a table. Bella 
          and Mike enter. 
          
          
          
          12.
          Mike takes his seat and points her toward MR. MOLINA, 
          Birkenstocked, enthusiastic science teacher at the head of 
          the class. As Bella moves to the teacher with her class 
          slip, she notes 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD -- his back to her, sitting at a front table. But as 
          she passes Edward's table..
          .
          
          
          SLOW MOTION -- the breeze she creates when she passes lifts 
          a 
          piece of paper next to Edward. We're still on his back as he
          inhales --then abruptly stiffens. He grabs onto the edge of 
          the table, crumbling it slightly. No one notices. 
          
          
          Mr. Molina takes Bella's class slip. 
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          Welcome, Ms. Swan. Follow along as 
          best you can till you get caught 
          up. 
          
          
          Mr. Molina gestures to the only empty seat... next to Edward. 
          But as Bella approaches, she's taken aback when 
          -
          
          
          ON EDWARD'S FACE -he slowly looks up at her, his eyes coal
          black with repulsion, fury. If looks could literally kill..
          .
          
          
          Bella knocks someone's book bag off their chair. Replaces it,
          mumbling an apology. Then slinks reluctantly into her seat. 
          Edward jerks away from her to the extreme edge of his chair. 
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          
          
          (to the class, animated)
          
          
          Today we'll be observing the behavior 
          
          
          of planaria, a.k.a flatworms.
          
          
          As Mr. Molina distributes two petri dishes per table 
          -
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          We're going to cut them in half, 
          then watch them regenerate into two 
          separate worms..
          . 
          
          
          Bella glances at Edward who averts his face, holding a hand over 
          his nose as if he smells something horrible. 
          
          
          Bella, shrinking, subtly sniffs the air, smells nothing. 
          Then she sniffs her hair. It's fine. She's perplexed. Mr.
          Molina hands Edward two petri dishes.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          ... Yes, folks, zombie worms! They 
          just won't die.
          
          
          Edward takes a dish, then slides the second one across the 
          table to Bella as if she had Ebola. She takes her dish, and 
          makes a dark curtain of her hair between them. 
          
          
          
          13.
          She can see EDWARD'S HANDS under the table. Clenched into
          fists. Off Bella, utterly baffled, and deeply insecure..
          .
          
          
          17 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY 17
          
          
          -- as the BELL RINGS, Edward bolts out the door. Other kids 
          and Bella exit a moment later. Bella looks down the hall; 
          he's gone. 
          
          
          18 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY 18
          
          
          Bella enters, but nearly turns and leaves when she sees 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD sweet-talking the enchanted female ADMINISTRATOR, 
          40's. He doesn't see Bella enter.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          There must be something open sixth 
          
          
          period. Physics? Biochem?
          
          
          ADMINISTRATOR
          
          
          No, every class is full. I'm 
          
          
          afraid you'll have to stay in 
          
          
          biology. I'm so sorry. 
          
          
          Bella blanches. The Administrator sees her and gestures for 
          her to wait a minute. 
          
          
          But Edward suddenly straightens as if sensing Bella. He slowly 
          turns to glare at her with piercing, hate-filled eyes. She backs 
          to the wall, hugging herself, suddenly chilled... with fear. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          (to the Administrator)
          I'll just... endure it. 
          
          
          He strides out the door. Off Bella..
          . 
          
          
          19 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 19
          
          
          Edward climbs into a shiny new silver Volvo with the Cullens,
          while Bella, upset, hurries to her truck. The many eyes still 
          watching her add insult to injury. ... Finally, she reaches 
          -
          
          
          20 INT. BELLA'S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) 20
          
          
          -- and closes the door. Her eyes well... but she fights it, 
          getting mad. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Jerk.
          
          
          As she tries to start the car, choking the engine, we begin to 
          hear a MAN'S RAGGED, FRIGHTENED BREATH 
          -
          
          
          SMASH TO:

          21 ECU ON A SECURITY GUARD - IN THE DARKNESS 21
          
          
          Extremely tight on his terrified FACE, sweat dripping, breathing 
          in short gasps, trying desperately not to make a sound. INCLUDE

          22 INT. GRISHAM MILL - LATE AFTERNOON 22
          
          
          --He's crouched in a dark corner. But then he sees a SHADOW
          move blindingly fast past him. He jerks around, then another 
          SHADOW flies past, too fast to follow. He BOLTS!
          
          
          He runs up a flight of stairs, harsh lights from the exterior of 
          the mill striating him. He moves as fast as humanly possible 
          -
          
          
          UNKNOWN POV - ON THE SECURITY GUARD FROM SEVERAL FLOORS BELOW
          
          
          UNKNOWN POV charges after him at an INHUMAN SPEED through this 
          maze of pillars and walkways. We dodge skull-crushing beams, 
          LEAP from one floor up to the next, up ladders, scaffolding, 
          beams, up, and up, getting closer and closer to 
          -
          
          
          THE SECURITY GUARD
          
          
          -- who desperately runs for his life, looking over his shoulder 
          with terror. UNKNOWN POV is closing in on him, but then he 
          BOLTS out a door 
          -
          
          
          23 EXT. GRISHAM MILL (CONTINUOUS) - LATE AFTERNOON 23
          
          
          -- The guard BURSTS OUT onto a stair landing, but loses his 
          footing and TRIPS, breaking through the rail and pitching 
          over the side, into the air 
          -
          
          
          -- and stops, hovering mid-air, a yard from the landing. 
          A 
          HAND grips his shirt, then YANKS him out of the air and out 
          of frame with incredible strength. His guttural SCREAM is 
          choked short as BLOOD SPRAYS THE LANDING..

          24 INT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON 24
          
          
          ON A TOP SIRLOIN STEAK as it is set in front of Charlie. He 
          shares a table with Bella. INCLUDE the waitress, CORA, 30's.
          She beams at Bella as she sets a plate of cod in front of her.
          
          
          Several LOGGERS at the counter offer Bella welcoming smiles. She 
          shrinks in her seat at the attention. Charlie's oblivious.
          
          
          CORA
          
          
          Can't get over how grown up you 
          
          
          are. And so gorgeous. 
          
          
          Bella glances at Charlie, who keeps his eyes on his steak. 
          A 
          bearded, hippy logger, WAYLON FORGE, 50, appears behind Cora, 
          leaning over her shoulder to Bella 
          -

          Member me, honey? I was Santa one year.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Waylon, she hasn't had a Christmas 
          here since she was four.
          
          
          WAYLON
          Bet I made an impression, though. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You always do. 
          
          
          CORA
          Let the girl eat her cod, Waylon. 
          
          
          (to Bella)
          When you're done, I'll bring your 
          favorite - berry cobbler. Remember? 
          Your dad still has it. Every Thursday.
          
          
          BELLA
          (doesn't remember at
          all)
          That'd be great, thank you.
          
          
          Cora shoos Waylon away. Left alone now, Charlie and Bella 
          both reach for the salt, knock hands. Charlie goes for the 
          ketchup instead. Silence as they eat. 
          
          
          A burst of LAUGHTER from a nearby happy FAMILY only serves to 
          emphasize their discomfort. Bella tries to bridge the gap.
          
          
          BELLA
          So... you eat here every night?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Easier than washing dishes.
          
          
          BELLA
          I can cook.
          
          
          He looks up, as if confused by the concept.
          
          
          BELLA
          I do the cooking at home - in Phoenix. 
          Mom's not great in the kitchen.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I remember..
          . 
          
          
          They both laugh -- recalling an especially bad dinner. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          How was school? Meet anyone?

          BELLA
          A few people... Do you know the 
          Cullen family?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          (looks up sharply)
          Are people talking about them again?
          
          
          BELLA
          No... well, a little.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Just cause they're newcomers. We're 
          lucky to have a surgeon like Dr. 
          Cullen at our podunk hospital. Lucky 
          his wife wanted to live in a small 
          town. Lucky his kids aren't like 
          a 
          lot of the hell-raisers around here.
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Okay.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I just don't like narrow
          mindedness. 
          
          
          And he returns to his food. Silence.

          ran away. Screaming. I literally 
          repel technology now.
          
          
          
          17.
          Bella smiles, missing her mom. Rene feeds the phone 
          quarters. 
          
          
          RENE
          
          
          Now, tell me more about your 
          
          
          school, baby. What are the kids 
          
          
          like? Are there any cute guys? 
          
          
          Are they being nice to you?
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (a beat, lying)
          
          
          They've all been really..
          . 
          
          
          welcoming.
          
          
          PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE, getting mad all over again as..

          ON BELLA, sitting atop a table, an open book in her lap. But her 
          eyes are on the arriving kids, and the parking lot as they pull 
          in. She's waiting for Edward.
          
          
          Jessica, Angela, Mike and Eric kick around a soccerball 
          nearby. They wave Bella to join them but she smiles, 
          declining... and returns to watching for Edward. Her face 
          tells us she's ready for a confrontation. 
          
          
          28 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - SAME DAY 28
          
          
          Bella strides in... but stops, surprised to find her lab 
          table empty. Off Bella, frustrated..

          29 INT. CAFETERIA - DIFFERENT DAY 29
          
          
          Bella sits with Jessica and Angela who watch a YouTube video 
          on their phone. Bella gives it a cursory look, but is 
          focused on the Cullen table --only four of them. Edward's
          seat is empty..
          . 
          
          
          30 INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - DIFFERENT DAY 30
          
          
          Bella washes her hands, then looks up at the mirror, startled to 
          find Rosalie and Alice behind her. They study Bella, Rosalie 
          with chillingly cold eyes, Alice with curiosity. Bella, uneasy, 
          hurries out.
          
          
          31 EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - DIFFERENT DAY 31
          
          
          Bella exits with Angela, Mike, Jessica and Eric, becoming a part 
          of this circle. 
          
          
          
          18.
          She now only glances at Rosalie's car, a red M3 BMW, as it drives
          past, noting, again, four Cullens, no Edward. Bella returns to 
          her friends, finally forgetting about him..

          SERIES OF SCENES ENDS as we go to 
          -
          32 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 32
          It's neater, rearranged more attractively. Clearly, Bella's
          given it her touch. She sweeps through, folding Charlie's
          fleece jacket, straightening up. She grabs her book bag 
          -
          BELLA
          Dad, I'm heading out.
          33 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - MORNING 33
          ON BELLA'S FACE as she opens the door and stops, dismay
          filling her. It's pouring down rain --the yard is full of
          puddles, some frozen. Bella shivers, wraps her coat tight.
          BELLA
          Great. 
          WHIP PAN to the driveway as Charlie pulls in -driving her 
          truck. 
          BELLA
          Dad, I can drive myself to school.
          
          
          As she walks down the steps, she doesn't realize, something's 
          watching her -
          -
          UNKNOWN POV - FROM THE TREES 
          --tracking Bella's every move as she slips and falls on 
          a
          
          
          patch of ice -
          -
          BACK ON BELLA - fallen on her ass. Charlie climbs out of the 
          truck, helps her up. 
          CHARLIE
          You okay, Bells?
          BELLA
          Ice doesn't help the uncoordinated.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          That's why I got you new tires. 
          She looks over at the truck -- yep, four new tires.
          CHARLIE
          
          
          The other ones were nearly bald. 
          
          
          
          19.
          BELLA
          You got me new tires. No one's 
          ever done that before.
          
          
          Charlie looks at her, confused.
          
          
          BELLA
          I mean... nothing.
          
          
          He clearly doesn't get it as heads toward his Cruiser.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I'll be late for dinner. I'm heading 
          down to Mason County. A security guard 
          at the Grisham Mill got killed by some 
          kind of animal..
          .
          
          
          UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND CHARLIE, as he speaks..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          An animal?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You're not in Phoenix any more, 
          honey. They've been hunting it for 
          a week with no luck. Thought I'd 
          lend a hand.
          
          
          BELLA
          Be careful.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Always am.
          
          
          BACK ON BELLA..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA
          And thank you. For the tires.
          
          
          He sees emotion in her eyes. Doesn't understand it, but nods,
          heads inside. Bella looks at the tires again, oddly moved..
          .

          35 INT. BIOLOGY CLASS/HALLWAY - DAY 35
          
          
          Rain beats on the roof as Eric walks Bella into class. She 
          brushes water off her coat as he chats her up.
          
          
          ERIC
          ... and yeah, prom committee is 
          a 
          chick thing, but I gotta cover it 
          for the paper anyway, and they need 
          a guy to help choose the music -
          -
          So I need your play list 
          -
          
          
          
          20.
          Bella is about to respond when Mike comes up behind her.
          
          
          MIKE
          Come on, Arizona. Give it up for 
          the rain.
          
          
          And he shakes his wet baseball cap onto Bella's head.
          
          
          BELLA
          Terrific. 
          
          
          She heads toward her seat, brushing off her hair. But she 
          freezes when she sees --Edward. 
          
          
          Bella straightens, girding herself. Then strides to the 
          table, and confidently drops her books down, ready to address 
          him. But he looks up at her 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          Hello.
          
          
          Bella stops. Stunned. He is direct, precise, as if every 
          word is an effort for him. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I didn't have a chance to introduce 
          myself last week. My name is 
          Edward Cullen. 
          
          
          She's too shocked that he's talking to her to answer.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (prompting)
          ... You're Bella.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm... yes. 
          
          
          Feeling like an idiot, she quickly sits. He abruptly moves to 
          the extreme edge of his seat. She's even more baffled now.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          
          
          (to the class)
          Onion root tip cells! That's 
          what's on your slides. Separate 
          and label them into the phases of 
          mitosis. The first partners to get 
          it right, win... the golden onion! 
          
          
          He excitedly holds up a spray painted onion. Everyone just 
          looks at him. He's disappointed by their apathy.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          Come on, people. Tick tock.
          
          
          
          21.
          Everyone sets to work. Edward pushes the microscope to 
          Bella, keeping his distance, his voice controlled.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Ladies first. 
          
          
          She grabs the microscope defensively and snaps the first slide 
          in, adjusting the lens. She's curt as she addresses him.
          
          
          BELLA
          You've been gone.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Out of town. For personal reasons.
          
          
          She glances at him but he just leans far away, his face 
          tight. She looks back into the microscope.
          
          
          BELLA
          Prophase. 
          
          
          She begins to remove the slide. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          May I look?
          
          
          She slides him the microscope. He glances through the lens.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Prophase.
          
          
          BELLA
          (muttering)
          Like I said.
          
          
          He writes it on the worksheet. Then he takes a breath, as if 
          trying calm himself, and turns to her with enormous effort.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Enjoying the rain?
          
          
          BELLA
          Seriously? You're asking me about the 
          weather?
          
          
          EDWARD
          It appears.
          
          
          BELLA
          No. I don't like the cold. Or the 
          wet. Or the gray. Or parkas. Or 
          turtle necks. 
          
          
          Is that a smile playing on his lips? For the first time, he 
          seems more intrigued than agonized. He studies her. She still 
          can't tell if he despises her or not. It's infuriating.
          
          
          
          22.
          BELLA
          
          
          What?
          
          
          He shakes his head and turns to the microscope, switching out 
          
          
          the slides. She looks at him. And keeps looking..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - ECU ON EDWARD'S FACE
          
          
          His cheekbones, his lips. So perfect, like a sculpture..
          .
          EDWARD
          
          
          Anaphase. 
          She snaps out of it. Covers with a dry look. 
          BELLA 
          May I? 
          
          (she looks through the 
          lens)
          Anaphase.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Like I said.
          
          
          She glances at him, and this time sees a smirk. She simply 
          holds out her hand for another slide.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (handing her the slide)
          If you hate cold and rain, why move to 
          the wettest place in the continental U.S.
          
          
          BELLA
          It's complicated.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I think I can keep up.
          
          
          He actually seems interested. She looks into the microscope as 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          My mother remarried. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Very complex. So you don't like him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Phil is fine. Young for her, but 
          nice enough.
          
          
          (re: the slide)
          Interphase.
          
          
          CUT ON THE SCHOOL BELL:
          
          
          
          23.
          36 INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 36
          
          
          Bella exits holding the golden onion, and practically runs 
          into Edward, who's directly in front of her. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          Why didn't you stay with your mom 
          
          
          and stepdad?
          
          
          He waits for her answer, studying her, as if trying to decipher 
          her. She's drawn in by his attention, oddly compelled.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Alright, Phil's a minor league 
          
          
          baseball player, so he travels 
          a 
          
          
          lot. My mother stayed home with me 
          
          
          but it made her unhappy. So 
          I 
          
          
          decided to spend time with my 
          
          
          father.
          
          
          EDWARD
          But now you're unhappy. 
          
          
          BELLA
          No... I -- I just..
          .
          
          
          Bella turns away -- embarrassed, vulnerable. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          I'm just trying to figure you out. 
          
          
          You're very hard to read.
          
          
          He's clearly trying to read her now... their eyes meet again.
          But now she looks more closely at him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Did you get contacts? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... no.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Your eyes were black before, now 
          
          
          they're this golden brown or 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's just the fluorescents.
          
          
          He abruptly turns and walks away. As he does, Bella notes -
          -
          HIS HANDS clenched into tight fists. Off Bella, utterly 
          bewildered, both intrigued and frustrated.
          
          
          37 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 37
          
          
          The rain has stopped, but the parking lot is full of water 
          and patches of black ice. 
          
          
          
          24.
          Shivering, Bella heads for her truck, carrying the onion, 
          carefully navigating the icy puddles. As she reaches her 
          truck, she looks across the lot 
          
          
          EDWARD stands by his silver Volvo with his siblings, about to 
          climb in. A moment as their eyes meet... then he looks toward the 
          sound of a high pitched SCREECH, that quickly grows LOUDER..
          . 
          
          
          Bella turns to see a VAN -- skidding on the ice, careening out of 
          control, heading directly for her. TIME suddenly fractures, 
          compressing to stillness, then exploding in bursts of speed as 
          -
          
          
          -- THE FACES OF THE STUDENTS - in shock, seeing what's coming.
          --THE VAN DRIVER'S FACE -TYLER, desperately trying to gain
          control, then shielding his face.
          -- EDWARD'S FACE - looking at Bella with horror..
          . 
          
          
          THE VAN is about to hit Bella's truck, with her standing in 
          between, when suddenly, something knocks Bella down, pinning 
          her to the ground. She looks up - Edward is on top of her. 
          
          
          The world around them FREEZES -- in this fraction of 
          a 
          second, their proximity is overwhelming, electrifying. He 
          breathes in her scent, she takes in his flawless face..
          .
          
          
          Abruptly, we BLAST BACK TO SPEED as several things happen so 
          quickly, we, and Bella, are unsure what's going on:
          
          
          -- THE VAN SMASHES into the back of Bella's truck 
          -
          -- Then SPINS around, once again careening toward her and 
          Edward, then suddenly 
          -
          --EDWARD'S HANDS are creating a deep dent in the side of the
          van's body as it shudders to a stop, a foot from Bella. 
          -- Edward literally pushes the van away.
          
          
          Then silence. A long beat, void of any sound, as Bella looks at 
          Edward, trying to absorb what just happened. Edward's fear for
          her is still alive on his face. She starts to speak but..
          .
          
          
          THE SCREAMING begins, yelling, calls for help. People leap to 
          Tyler's aid, run to Bella and Edward. Bella SEES the onion on the
          ground, smashed as she would have been. As everyone sweeps in, 
          Edward moves into the b.g. Mike and Eric run to Bella 
          -
          
          
          MIKE ERIC
          
          
          Are you okay!? Are you What happened!? Did anyone 
          
          
          hurt?! see what happened?
          !
          
          
          Amid the chaos, Bella sees EDWARD'S SIBLINGS looking at
          Edward. But they show no hint of concern for his safety. 
          Instead, they look at him with disapproval... and fury. 
          
          
          38 INT. HOSPITAL - TREATMENT AREA - DAY 38
          
          
          The double doors BURST open as Charlie runs in, face white 
          with terror. He spots 
          -
          
          
          
          25.
          BELLA - sitting on a gurney, the E.R. DOCTOR looking into her 
          eyes with a pen light. On the next gurney over, Tyler, the 
          van's driver, lies with a mild head wound. Charlie rushes up.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bells. Are you alright?
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm fine, dad. Calm down.
          
          
          TYLER
          I'm so sorry, Bella. I tried to stop.
          
          
          BELLA
          It's okay, Tyler.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          It sure as hell is not okay.
          
          
          BELLA
          Dad, it's not his fault-
          
          
          CHARLIE 
          (stern, cutting her off)
          We nearly lost you.
          
          
          BELLA
          But you didn't.
          
          
          He'd hug her, if that was who he, or who she was. Instead,
          he glares at Tyler.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You can kiss your license goodbye.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN (O.S.
          )
          I heard the Chief's daughter was here.
          
          
          They look up as DR. CARLISLE CULLEN, mid 30's, approaches, blond,
          movie star handsome. His face is kind, but pale, tired. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Good. Dr. Cullen. 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (to E.R. Doctor)
          I've got this one, Jackie.
          
          
          The E.R. Doctor hands Dr. Cullen the chart, exits. Dr. Cullen 
          reviews her chart, then feels the back of her head as..
          .
          
          
          
          26.
          DR. CULLEN
          You have a nice knot growing back 
          there, but your x-rays show no 
          indication of concussion. 
          
          
          TYLER
          I'm so sorry, Bella. I'm really 
          -
          
          
          Charlie abruptly pulls the curtain between them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          It would have been a lot worse if Edward 
          hadn't knocked me out of the way.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Edward? Your boy?
          
          
          Dr. Cullen quickly looks back at the chart. Bella's 
          intuition flickers, sensing he knows something. She presses.
          
          
          BELLA
          It was amazing he got to me so 
          fast. He was nowhere near me.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (smiles)
          As long as you're safe. 
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - RECEPTION - DAY 39
          
          
          Charlie and Bella exit the treatment area.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I just have to sign some paperwork. 
          You better call your mom.
          
          
          BELLA
          You told her?! She's probably freaking.
          
          
          He shrugs and hurries off. Bella shakes her head, pulls out her 
          cell phone. Is about to dial, but then sees down the hall..
          .
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - EDWARD, ROSALIE, AND DR. CULLEN
          
          
          Rosalie is clearly furious at Edward who stands his ground. 
          Dr. Cullen plays intermediary. 
          
          
          ROSALIE
          This isn't just about you, it's about 
          all of us -
          -
          
          
          Dr. Cullen sees Bella and stops Rosalie 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Let's take this in my office.
          
          
          
          27.
          Rosalie glares at Edward as she goes off with Dr. Cullen. Edward 
          adopts a nonchalant air as Bella approaches, determined.
          
          
          BELLA
          Can I talk to you for a moment?
          (off his nod)
          How did you get over to me so quickly? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I was standing right next to you.
          
          
          BELLA
          You were next to your car, across 
          the lot.
          
          
          He steps closer to her. His expression turns icy hard. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          No, I wasn't.
          
          
          She won't be bullied. Steps closer to him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Yes. You were. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're confused. You hit your head. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I know what I saw.
          
          
          EDWARD
          And what, exactly, was that?
          
          
          BELLA
          You stopped that van. You pushed
          it away.
          
          
          EDWARD
          No one will believe that. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I wasn't planning to tell anyone. 
          
          
          This registers with Edward. They're inches from each other,
          the tension thick. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I just want to know the truth.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Can't you just thank me and get 
          over it?
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Thank you.
          
          
          
          28.
          A long beat as they look at each other, angry, defensive... and 
          without a doubt, attracted. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're not going to let it go, are you?
          
          
          BELLA
          No.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (turns, walks away)
          Then I hope you enjoy disappointment.
          
          
          BELLA
          Why did you even bother?
          
          
          He stops, a beat. Looks back at her, unexpectedly vulnerable. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... I don't know.
          
          
          And he keeps walking. Off Bella, confused, frustratingly 
          attracted, and absolutely determined to find out the truth.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          That was the first night I dreamed 
          of Edward Cullen..
          .
          
          
          40 DREAM SEQUENCE - UNDERWATER 40
          
          
          Bella swims, white skin aglow, hair floating weightlessly, 
          sensually... suddenly, something BLASTS past her. She spins. 
          It's gone. Something BLASTS behind her. She spins again -
          to find herself face to face with 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD ... Bella reaches for him, but he abruptly springs 
          backward, just out of reach. 
          
          
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          41 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON BELLA - NIGHT 41
          
          
          -as she bolts up awake. In that split second, in the darkness, 
          she SEES Edward, watching her. She SNAPS on the light -- the 
          room is empty. Was she dreaming? 
          42 EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY 42
          
          
          Bella stands in the exact spot of the accident. Behind her 
          on the lawn, several CLASSES congregate, gathering for 
          a 
          field trip. Mr. Molina is in charge.
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          Make sure I get your permission slips.
          
          
          
          29.
          PUSH IN ON BELLA'S FACE staring at the skid marks on the
          pavement..
          .
          
          
          FLASH POP TO THE VAN REELING RIGHT FOR HER 
          -
          
          
          FLASH POP TO EDWARD'S HANDS STOPPING THE VAN 
          -
          
          
          FLASH POP TO EDWARD ON TOP OF HER, THE PROXIMITY, ELECTRICITY 
          -
          
          
          BACK ON BELLA, blushing at the memory. Then she SEES Edward 
          arrive with Alice and Jasper. She watches him, barely noticing as 
          Mike trots up to her -
          -
          
          
          MIKE 
          (ala Dr. Frankenstein)
          Look! You're moving. You're ALIVE!
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Yeah, false alarm..
          .
          
          
          MIKE
          Actually, I'm glad you're not dead 
          cause - well, that would suck, plus 
          I 
          wanted to ask you - even though it's, 
          like, a month away..
          .
          
          
          But Bella's distracted by Edward. Mike's VOICE DIPS as..
          .
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - ACROSS THE LAWN
          
          
          Edward, head down, is in quiet conference with Jasper and Alice. 
          Abruptly, he looks up, as if listening to her and Mike, though 
          he's too far away to hear. Bella quickly refocuses on Mike.
          
          
          MIKE
          So what do you think?
          (off her blank look)
          You want to go? To prom. With me.
          
          
          BELLA
          (realizing, horrified)
          Prom. As in dance. I, uh - have to go 
          
          
          -somewhere. To Jacksonville. Yeah.
          MIKE
          You can't go another weekend? 
          
          
          BELLA
          Non-refundable ticket. Maybe you 
          should ask Jessica. 
          
          
          Mike follows Bella's eyes way across the lawn to Jessica.
          She smiles at them -- Suddenly Edward crosses in front of 
          Jessica. He seems to be smirking..
          .
          
          
          
          30.
          43 INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE GREENHOUSE - FIELD TRIP - DAY 43
          
          
          Mr. Molina and a Tour Guide lead several dozen kids through 
          the greenhouse. Bella keeps an eye on Edward who's up ahead
          with Alice and Jasper. Mr. Molina demonstrates the compost 
          machine as the students mess around. 
          
          
          MR. MOLINA
          ...c'mon, Eric, stuff that compost 
          down deep... that's it..

          (the machine gurgles and spins)
          ... now Tyler, take a big steaming 
          cup of compost tea. This is 
          recycling at its most basic level -
          -
          hey, don't drink that!
          
          
          When Bella sees Edward pause by an ancient staghorn fern, 
          alone, she takes a breath for courage and strides up to him. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Hello, Edward.
          
          
          He glances at her, merely nodding. We notice his FISTS clench, 
          and unclench. Bella looks at him, appalled by his rudeness.
          
          
          BELLA
          Really?
          
          
          No response. She turns, starts to walk away. 
          
          
          EDWARD 
          What's in Jacksonville?
          
          
          She turns back to him.
          
          
          BELLA
          How did you know about that? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You didn't answer my question.
          
          
          BELLA
          You haven't answered any of mine. 
          You won't even say hello.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Hello.
          
          
          BELLA
          And how did you stop that van?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Adrenaline rush. Very common. 
          Google it. 
          
          
          
          31.

          (not buying it)
          Floridians. That's what's in 
          Jacksonville.
          
          
          She turns to storm off but she stumbles over the irrigation 
          hose. Edward steadies her, catching her scent -- still so 
          powerful... He clenches his jaw.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It helps if you actually watch
          where you put your feet.
          
          
          Insulted, she keeps moving. He keeps pace, serious now. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I know I've been rude, but it's for 
          the best.
          
          
          She just looks at him like he's crazy. He walks away as
          Jessica suddenly rushes up.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Guess who just asked me to prom!
          
          
          Bella smiles.
          
          
          JESSICA
          I totally thought Mike was going to 
          ask you, Bella. Is it gonna be 
          weird? 
          
          
          BELLA
          No way. Zero weirdness. You guys 
          are great together.
          
          
          JESSICA
          I know, right?
          
          
          Giddy, Jessica rushes to catch up with Angela. Bella heads 
          out the door that leads to 
          -
          
          
          EXT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE GREENHOUSE - THE BUSES (CONTINUOUS)44
          
          
          --where everyone's looking at the COMPOST WORM BOX, grossing
          each other out with the slimy creatures. As Bella backs away, 
          Edward steps up.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Bella, it would be better if we 
          weren't friends. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (wounded)
          Too bad you didn't figure that out 
          earlier.

          32.
          BELLA (cont'd)
          You could have let the van crush me 
          and saved yourself all this regret.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (snapping, angry)
          You think I regret saving you?
          
          
          BELLA
          I know you do.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (furious)
          You don't know anything.
          
          
          His harshness stings her. Suddenly, Alice appears at 
          Edward's side. She eyes Bella with curiosity.
          
          
          ALICE
          The bus is leaving.
          (to Bella)
          Hi. Will you be riding with us?
          
          
          EDWARD
          No. Our bus is full.
          
          
          He purposefully walks Alice away. But he glances back at 
          Bella with, is that... remorse? She doesn't see it.
          
          
          INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING 45
          
          
          Bella enters, throws down her book bag and coat, still angry. 
          She starts upstairs but Charlie enters from the kitchen.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Your mother called. Again.
          
          
          BELLA
          Your fault, for telling her about 
          the accident.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          She always did know how to worry. 
          
          
          (hint of sadness)
          But... she's changed, too. She 
          seems happy. Phil sounds all 
          right.
          
          
          BELLA
          He is.
          
          
          She continues upstairs, glancing at her parents' WEDDING PHOTO.
          Off Bella's FACE, we MATCH CUT -

          -- as she pushes through the doors. She glances over at the 
          CULLEN TABLE, Edward with his siblings. He doesn't look at her.
          Anger and determination set in again as Bella joins Eric, 
          Jessica, Mike and Angela. She drops her book bag on a seat 
          -
          
          
          ERIC
          La Push, baby. You in?
          
          
          BELLA
          Should I know what that means?
          
          
          MIKE
          La Push beach, down on the Quileute 
          rez. We're all going after school. 
          Big swell coming in. 
          
          
          ERIC
          And I don't just surf the internet.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Eric, you stood up once. On a foam 
          board.
          
          
          ANGELA
          There's whale watching, too. Come with.

          La Push, baby.

          I'll go if you stop saying that. 
          
          
          47 THE SALAD BAR STATION - MINUTES LATER 47
          
          
          Bella artfully designs an architectural salad. As she 
          reaches for an APPLE, Edward is suddenly next to her 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD 
          (charmed)
          Edible art..
          .
          
          
          Startled, she fumbles and drops the apple -- Edward catches 
          it with his foot, hackeysack style, then bounces it back into 
          his hand, the red of the apple, stark against his pale skin. 
          He presents it to her with small smile.
          
          
          BELLA
          Thanks... but your mood swings are 
          giving me whiplash.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I said it would be better if we weren't 
          friends, not that I didn't want to be. 
          
          
          
          34.
          BELLA
          What does that even mean?
          
          
          EDWARD
          It means if you were smart, you'd 
          avoid me.
          
          
          Edward inadvertently glances at his four inhumanly beautiful 
          siblings, who wait for him, expectantly, at their table. 
          
          
          She notes her own, very human friends monitoring this 
          conversation from their table. Mike glowers jealously.
          
          
          BELLA
          So let's say, for argument's sake, 
          that I'm not smart. Would you talk 
          to me? Tell me the truth? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Probably not. I'd rather hear your 
          theories.
          
          
          BELLA
          Okay... how bout radioactive 
          spiders? Kryptonite?
          
          
          EDWARD
          (levels his gaze, 
          
          
          challenging)
          You're talking about superheroes. 
          What if I'm not a hero? What if 
          I'm a bad guy?
          
          
          BELLA
          (beat, looking closer at him)
          No. I don't believe that. You're 
          not bad. You can be a jerk, but 
          it's like this... mask. To keep 
          people away. 
          
          
          He's taken aback by her honesty, her insight, drawn in by her..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Look, why don't we just - hang out. 
          Like... come to the beach with us. 
          It'll be fun - sand fleas, wind burn, 
          salt water stinging your eyes..
          .
          
          
          EDWARD
          (small smile, considering 
          it)
          Which beach?
          
          
          BELLA
          La Push. 
          
          
          
          35.
          His smile lessens almost imperceptibly. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Is something wrong with that beach?
          
          
          Edward glances over at Mike - the two exchange cold looks.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's just a little crowded.
          
          
          Off Bella, as Edward walks away..

          It's freezing, but Mike, Tyler, Jessica and others suit up
          for a surf. Eric hangs with them. Bella wanders by the 
          driftwood with Angela, who takes photographs. 
          
          
          ANGELA
          I keep thinking Eric's going to ask me 
          to prom, then he just... doesn't.
          
          
          BELLA
          You could ask him. 
          (off Angela's flustered 
          
          
          look)
          Take control. You're a strong 
          independent woman.
          
          
          ANGELA
          I am?
          
          
          JACOB (O.S.
          )
          Bella!
          
          
          She looks up to see three Quileute boys approaching the group; 
          Jacob Black, and SAM and EMBRY. Bella smiles at Jacob. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Guys, this is Jacob. Are you 
          stalking me?
          
          
          JACOB
          You're on my rez, remember? You 
          surfing?
          
          
          BELLA
          Definitely not. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          (teasing)
          Keep her company. Her date bailed. 
          
          
          ERIC
          What date?
          
          
          
          36.
          JESSICA
          She invited Edward. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (embarrassed)
          To be polite.
          
          
          ANGELA
          I think it's nice she invited him. 
          No one ever does.
          
          
          MIKE
          Because Cullen's a freak.
          
          
          SAM
          You got that right.
          
          
          BELLA
          You know them?
          
          
          SAM
          (sharply)
          The Cullens don't come here.
          
          
          Jacob shoots Sam a look, shakes his head. Bella registers this. 
          A beat, then she casually pulls Jacob aside 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          You want to go look at tide pools?
          
          
          She offers an awkwardly flirtatious smile. He grins, 
          infatuated. As they head toward the water..

          Bella and Jacob wander near the water, looking out to sea for 
          whales. The surfers are out on the waves. She nudges him, 
          continuing her attempt at flirtation..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          So, what did your friend mean about 
          the Cullens not coming here?
          
          
          JACOB
          Oops. Caught that, huh? 
          
          
          He moves closer to her, lowering his voice for mock-secrecy. 
          
          
          JACOB
          I'm not supposed to say anything.
          
          
          Bella gives him her best alluring smile.
          
          
          BELLA
          I can keep a secret..

          JACOB
          
          
           (laughing) 
          It's just an old scary story. Did 
          you know the Quileutes are 
          supposedly descended from wolves?
          
          
          BELLA
          Like fur, fangs ... doggy breath?
          
          
          Jacob chuckles. Bella smiles and prompts him to continue..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          So the legend about the Cullens is..
          .
          
          
          JACOB
          Well, they're supposedly descended

           (in a spooky voice)
          
          
          enemy clan. ... But they 
          claimed to be different, so we made 
          a treaty with them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Didn't they just move here?
          
          
          JACOB
          Or just moved back.
          
          
          BELLA
          Riiiight. So what was this treaty?
          
          
          JACOB
          
          
           (whispering)
          If they promised to stay off Quileute 
          lands, we wouldn't expose what they 
          really were to the pale-faces..
          . 
          
          
          Jacob pauses dramatically --Bella shivers. 
          
          
          GIRL (O.S)
          AAAAAAAAGH!!!!!!
          !
          
          
          Bella JUMPS at the bloodcurdling scream, as Angela runs past, 
          chased by Eric waving a dead crustacean. Jacob smirks and 
          starts back to the group.
          
          
          BELLA
          Wait... what were they really? 
          
          
          JACOB 
          (laughing)
          It's just a story, Bella.
          
          
          Off Bella, with more unanswered questions..

          38.
          50 EXT. SHACK COMMUNITY ON THE RIVER - LATE AFTERNOON 50
          
          
          A collection of haphazard shacks and boat docks, connected by 
          wood plank sidewalks. FIND Waylon Forge (the hippy logger 
          who used to play Santa Claus) scraping paint off his boat, 
          swigging a pint as he listens to his prehistoric Walkman. 
          
          
          His old DOG lies next to him as the sounds of the forest and 
          river chirp and buzz. Waylon sings along to his Walkman..
          . 
          
          
          Suddenly, the sounds of nature abruptly SILENCE themselves. The 
          dog raises his head, starts to GROWL. Waylon doesn't notice.
          
          
          STAY ON WAYLON, singing, working... until he looks up and 
          realizes the dog's gone.
          
          
          WAYLON
          Jerry?
          
          
          Waylon pulls off the headphones. WHISTLES. No dog. Waylon 
          walks up a walkway... then sees a DOG LEG, sticking out from 
          under a bush. 
          
          
          WAYLON
          Come on, Jerry, you old mutt..
          .
          
          
          He pulls at the leg. It's detached. He reels back, stumbling 
          onto his boat, frantically untying the line and pushing out 
          -
          
          
          ON THE WATER - Waylon floats, breath short, listening acutely. 
          
          
          WAYLON'S POV -ON THE WOODS lining the river. Ominous
          darkness. A NOISE. He jerks around. Nothing. Then 
          suddenly, his boat ROCKS violently; he spins 
          -
          
          
          A MAN - now stands on the bow. JAMES, 30, pale white. 
          A 
          vampire. But his eyes, unlike the Cullens, are a deep, 
          sinister BURGUNDY, and absolutely lethal. His catlike 
          movements are always on the edge of a crouch.
          
          
          WAYLON
          H-how did you do that?
          
          
          JAMES
          Always the same inane questions..
          .
          
          
          Waylon turns but a woman LEAPS onto the bow --it's VICTORIA,
          26, chaotic red hair filled with leaves from the woods. 
          Terrified, Waylon spins around to see LAURENT, 28, glossy 
          black hair, olive skin, lounging on his boat seat. All three 
          Nomads wear frayed clothes, and all three are bare foot.
          
          
          JAMES
          What do you want?
          
          
          
          
          39.
          VICTORIA
          Why are you doing this?
           
          
          
          LAURENT
          (sighs, slight French 
          accent)
          ... James, must we?
          
          
          JAMES
          The question should be, will it hurt?
          
          
          
          Victoria grins sadistically. Then with lightening fast 
          speed, the three of them VIOLENTLY LUNGE 
          -
          
          
          SMASH TO BLACK:
          
          
          51 FADE IN ON EDWARD'S FACE AGAINST BLACKNESS 51
          
          
          SNAPSHOTS of his eyes, his cheekbones, his lips..
          .
          
          
          52 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON HER FACE - MORNING 52
          
          
          As she sits in front of her computer, lost in thought. She 
          shakes herself out of it and types into her search engine 
          Quileute legends, Olympic Peninsula. An AD pops up,
          Thunderbird & Whale Book Store, Port Angeles. Bella,
          intrigued, clicks on it..
          . 
          
          
          53 EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - SUNNY DAY 53
          
          
          The sun has come out and so has the skin. Kids are in shorts 
          though it's still barely sixty degrees. Everyone eats lunch 
          outdoors. Bella searches the crowd for Edward.
          
          
          JESSICA (O.S.
          )
          He's not here.
          
          
          She looks down to find Jessica sitting on the grass.
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
          Whenever the weather's nice, the 
          
          
          Cullens disappear. 
          
          
          BELLA
          They just... ditch?
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
          No, Dr. and Mrs. Cullen yank em 
          
          
          out for hiking and camping and 
          
          
          stuff. I tried the idea out on my 
          
          
          parents. Not even close. 
          
          
          Bella registers this as Angela suddenly jumps on them.
          
          
          
          40.
          ANGELA
          I'm going to the prom with Eric! 
          I 
          just asked him, I took control! 
          
          
          (hugs Bella)
          Are you sure you have to go out of town?
          
          
          BELLA
          It's a family thing.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Oh my God, we need to hit the 
          stores in Port Angeles before the 
          dresses get cleaned out. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Port Angeles?..
          . 
          (a plan forming in her 
          mind)
          Can I go with you guys? 
          
          
          ANGELA
          Thank God. We need your opinion.
          
          
          Off Bella, that's not really what she had in mind..
          .
          
          
          54 INT. BOUTIQUE, PORT ANGELES -ON BELLA'S FACE- AFTERNOON 54
          
          
          -- antsy, distracted, as Jessica and Angela try on dresses. 
          Bella pulls a Mapquest print-out from her purse -- it reads, 
          Thunderbird and Whale Book Store. Jessica flounces out of
          the changing room, posing provocatively.
          
          
          JESSICA
          I think this halter makes my boobs 
          look big. What do you think, 
          Bella?
          
          
          Outside the window, a group of rowdy FRAT BOYS head toward 
          a 
          bar. Two of them stare at Jessica in her low-cut dress. 
          Embarrassed, she turns back to Bella. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          Bella?
          
          
          BELLA
          (absently)
          It looks great. 
          
          
          JESSICA
          You said that about the last five 
          dresses.
          
          
          ANGELA 
          (empathetic)
          You're not very good at this, are you?
          
          
          
          41.
          BELLA
          
          
          Maybe I should just go check out the 
          
          
          book store and meet you at the 
          
          
          restaurant later.
          
          
          ANGELA
          You sure?
          
          
          Bella nods, heads out. Jessica's looks in the mirror again.
          
          
          JESSICA
          
          
          She was right about this halter, 
          
          
          though. It does look great.

          Bella exits, thumbing through a BOOK she just bought. She 
          heads down the sidewalk, but then hears FOOTSTEPS behind her. 
          She turns, doesn't see anyone. She puts the book in her
          shoulder bag and continues.
          
          
          UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA -someone's following her. She looks 
          around, changing course to cut across a parking lot. Unknown 
          POV gets closer... and closer, until she reaches 
          -
          
          
          58 EXT. WAREHOUSE AT END OF PARKING LOT - NIGHT 58
          
          
          Isolated. Bella, breath short, scared, turns around just as -
          -
          TWO MEN emerge from the shadows, not vampires, but the Frat 
          Boys, really wasted now. 
          
          
          FRAT BOY #
          1
          Wanna beer?
          
          
          She looks to her left; the other TWO GUYS are there. She's
          cornered. She takes her purse from around her shoulder.
          
          
          BELLA
          Look, just take my bag.
          
          
          FRAT BOY #
          2
          We don't want your bag.
          
          
          She takes a defensive stance and wraps the strap around her 
          wrist to use her purse as a mace. They chortle derisively. 
          But when Frat Boy #1 comes near, she swings it, hits him in 
          the groin. The BOOK in her bag doubles him over. The other 
          three laugh, and start to close in. But suddenly 
          -
          
          

          HEADLIGHTS blind them. A silver Volvo screeches up. The 
          Frat Boys dive out of the way. The passenger-side door 
          opens. It's Edward. She's too stunned to even move.
          
          
          
          42.
          EDWARD
          Get in.
          
          
          She finally does. But Frat Boy #2 jumps into the game and 
          rushes Edward's side of the car 
          -
          
          
          Edward SCREECHES to a halt and is out of the car and facing 
          Frat Boy #2 so fast, neither the Frat Boys, nor Bella, see it. 
          Nor does Bella see Edward's GLARE, so chilling, so animalistic
          in its fury that Frat Boy #2, scared, instinctively backs off. 
          As Edward climbs back into the car, Bella just stares at him.
          
          
          59 INT. EDWARD'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT 59
          
          
          Bella continues to stare. She sees that he's seething with anger,
          hands gripping the steering wheel, jaw clenched.
          
          
          BELLA
          What -- no, how did you find -- 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD
          (through gritted teeth)
          I should go back and rip their heads off.
          
          
          BELLA
          No. Bad idea. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You don't know the vile, repulsive 
          things they were thinking.
          
          
          BELLA
          And you do?
          
          
          EDWARD
          (covering)
          Not hard to guess.

          Jessica and Angela exit the restaurant as Bella approaches.
          
          
          ANGELA
          Where were you!? We left you a message.
          
          
          JESSICA
          We waited, but we were starving 
          -
          
          
          Then they see Edward behind her, climbing out of his car. 
          They freeze, agog. He's composed now, making an effort to be
          charming. And they are charmed.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Sorry I kept Bella from dinner. We 
          ran into each other and got talking. 
          
          
          
          43.
          JESSICA
          I - we - understand. We were 
          just... leaving, so 
          -
          
          
          The two girls start to go. Bella is forced to go with them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Okay, well. Thank you.
          
          
          She starts to follow the girls. Edward is torn, then abruptly 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (abruptly)
          Maybe I should make sure Bella gets 
          something to eat.
          
          
          (off Bella's surprised 
          
          
          look)
          ... If you'd like. Then I could 
          drive you back myself.
          
          
          ANGELA
          That's so... thoughtful.
          
          
          JESSICA
          Really thoughtful.
          
          
          BELLA
          (debates, then decides)
          I could eat.
          
          
          As he guides her off, the two girls share a look, and 
          a 
          noiseless scream of excitement. 
          
          
          EXT. WATERFALL RESTAURANT - DINING PATIO - NIGHT 61
          
          
          Bella and Edward sit on the deck. A dramatic waterfall 
          shimmers behind them.
          
          
          A waitress places a steaming plate of mesquite roasted salmon 
          in front of Bella and nothing in front of Edward. She exits.
          
          
          BELLA
          You're not eating?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm on a special diet.
          
          
          BELLA
          Like South Beach?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Not exactly.
          
          
          She looks at him curiously as she takes a bite.
          
          
          
          44.
          BELLA
          So how bout some answers?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Yes, no. To get to the other side, 
          and 1 point 772453851.
          
          
          BELLA
          I didn't ask for the square root of pi.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You knew that?
          
          
          BELLA
          How did you know where I was? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I didn't.
          
          
          She shakes her head, frustrated, and turns to go inside -
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          (stops her, sincerely)
          Don't go.
          
          
          He seems torn by some internal dilemma. Then finally..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Were you following me?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I feel very protective of you. 
          
          
          BELLA
          So that's a yes?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Yes, I followed you. I tried to 
          keep my distance...until you needed 
          help.
          
          
          BELLA
          (putting everything together)
          You said before... That you heard 
          what those guys were thinking..
          . 
          Can you... read minds?
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (shrugs)
          I'm thinking of getting a nine-
          hundred number.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (trying to grasp)
          Alright, so you read minds... What am 
          I thinking? Wait -- okay now, go.
          
          
          
          45.
          EDWARD
          I have no idea. I can read every 
          mind in there, except yours. 
          
          
          (points at people 
          inside)
          Work, sex, money, sex, sex, boyfriend 
          -
          (points at Bella)
          Nothing. It's quite frustrating. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Why, what's wrong with me?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I tell you I read minds and you think 
          there's something wrong with you?
          
          
          He smiles, charmed by her. But his smile fades, that torn 
          look returns. He holds onto the rail, looking out. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What is it?
          
          
          EDWARD
          I... don't have the strength to 
          stay away from you anymore. 
          
          
          She's surprised. And thrilled.
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward, you don't have to.
          
          
          He's drawn in by her encouraging gaze... but he closes his
          eyes a beat, and turns back to the water.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (almost to himself)
          This is wrong. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're cold. We should go.
          
          
          He walks away before she can ask any more questions..
          .
          
          
          62 EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 62
          
          
          Edward's Volvo speeds along the two lane highway.
          
          
          63 INT. EDWARD'S VOLVO - NIGHT 63
          
          
          Bella glances at Edward, might ask him more questions but he seems 
          to be wrestling with his own thoughts. Finally..
          . 
          
          
          
          46.
          BELLA
          I think I'm warm enough now. 
          
          
          She reaches for the heater dial, he does as well -- their 
          hands TOUCH. And hold a moment too long. An electric 
          current connecting them.
          
          
          BELLA
          Your hand, it's still freezing cold.
          
          
          He pulls his hand away, but she keeps looking at it... then 
          her attention shifts outside to FLASHING POLICE LIGHTS. As 
          they drive past the FORKS POLICE STATION, a sheriff's car
          pulls away. Charlie's cruiser is parked out front. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (concerned)
          Dad's here late. Something must 
          have happened.
          
          
          EXT./INT. FORKS - POLICE STATION (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 64
          
          
          The Volvo pulls up. Bella and Edward climb out. Edward then 
          sees a second car next to the cruiser. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          That's my father's car. What's he -- 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD AND BELLA'S POV: INSIDE THE DARKENED POLICE STATION
          
          
          In a pool of light, a distressed Charlie and Dr. Cullen study 
          photographs and evidence. As they wrap up their discussion, 
          Dr. Cullen puts a sympathetic hand on Charlie's shoulder,
          then exits the police station looking grim. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Carlisle. What happened?
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Waylon Forge was found in the woods 
          out near his place. I just 
          examined the body.
          
          
          Edward darkens. Bella is horrified.
          
          
          BELLA
          He died? How? 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Animal attack. 
          
          
          BELLA
          The same kind that killed the security 
          guard down in Mason?
          
          
          Edward and Dr. Cullen trade a look, subtle, but Bella catches it.
          
          
          
          47.
          DR. CULLEN
          Most likely.
          
          
          BELLA
          So it's getting closer to town.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Waylon lived all the way down on 
          Queets River. 75 miles south.
          
          
          BELLA
          But that's 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (with a kind, reassuring 
          
          
          smile)
          Bella, you should go inside. 
          Waylon was your father's friend.
          
          
          She goes to the door, but looks back to see them conferring 
          quietly, gravely. Clearly, there's more to this.
          
          
          65 INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 65
          
          
          Bella enters to find a distressed Charlie studying evidence, 
          photos, maps --trying to make sense of Waylon's death.
          Deputies come and go in the background. Bella approaches 
          Charlie. He looks up.
          
          
          BELLA
          Dad, I'm sorry about Waylon.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Known him going on thirty years. 
          
          
          He's obviously torn up. Bella isn't quite sure what to do.
          And so puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. A beat..
          . 
          
          
          Then Charlie squeezes her hand. It's the first physical
          affection we've seen between them. And it threatens to evoke
          even more emotion in Charlie. So he tamps it down, and rises, 
          then projects a confident manner. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          We'll get to the bottom of this, Bella. 
          But in the meantime..
          .
          
          
          As an ambulance pulls up outside, he opens a drawer, finds 
          out a cannister of PEPPER SPRAY. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          ... I want you to have this.
          
          
          BELLA
          That's probably not a good 
          -
          
          
          
          48.
          CHARLIE
          It'll give me some peace of mind. 
          
          
          She sees he needs this, and allows him to put it into her 
          purse. 
          
          
          As Charlie goes to get his coat, Bella steps outside to SEE 
          -
          
          
          A66 EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - BELLA'S POV A66
          
          
          Two Attendants hoist a metal gurney into an ambulance. On it, 
          Waylon's dead, white, bloody bare FEET peek out from under 
          a
          sheet, resting at a disturbingly unnatural angle. Off Bella, 
          chilled..

          -- as she turns on the LIGHT. She hears a SNAP! outside the 
          window. She rises, digs into her purse for the PEPPER SPRAY 
          Charlie gave her, and goes to the window. She looks out -
          -
          all she sees is the wind blowing hard. But she's rattled.
          
          
          She closes the curtains, then reaches for the BOOK she bought 
          earlier. She thumbs through, laying the pepper spray within 
          reach. 
          
          
          INSERT THE BOOK, QUILEUTE FOLK STORIES AND ART.
          
          
          
          As she leafs through we see PHOTOS of ancient, carved MASKS. 
          Comical, menacing, haunting... then she stops on a photo of 
          a 
          white mask with black eyes and a row of sharp teeth. THE 
          INSCRIPTION reads, The Cold One.
          
          
          
          Bella quickly goes to her computer and Googles Cold One  -
          several beer ads appear. Frustrated, she closes the pop-ups, 
          revealing a link to: The Cold One: Apotamkin -

          Several PICTURES begin loading: the seductive Apotamkin with his 
          ice-blue skin, devouring his victims in tapestries, engravings, 
          paintings. Creatures beautiful and horrific. Craven, skeletal 
          demons attacking villages; perfectly sculpted predators, luring 
          innocent maidens... it's all murder, blood, sexuality.
          
          
          THEN SEVERAL WORDS LEAP OUT in quick succession:

          the intensity on her face. He stops. 
          
          
          She walks to him, eyes meeting his... her look says, we have 
          to talk... and she continues directly past him, into the dark 
          forest that borders the school. 
          
          
          He watches her disappear in the trees, then takes a step to 
          follow. Jasper moves in front of him, Rosalie grabs his arm. 
          ROSALIE
          Edward, don't go.
          But Alice gently removes Rosalie's hand from his arm.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY 68
          Bella stands amid the trees, waiting. Then the SOUNDS OF THE 
          FOREST abruptly drop out. A predator is near. Edward 
          appears behind her. She doesn't turn around. A beat.
          
          
          
          50.
          BELLA
          You're impossibly fast. And strong. 
          Your skin is pale-white, ice-cold. 
          Your eyes change color. And 
          sometimes you speak like... you're 
          from a different time. 
          
          
          (turns to face him now)
          You never eat food, or drink, or 
          come out in the sunlight. And you 
          said no to the beach trip only after 
          you heard where it was. Because of 
          the treaty. 
          
          
          This last registers with him. She steps closer to him.
          
          
          BELLA
          How old are you?

          Seventeen.

          A long beat as we begin to CIRCLE THEM. He sees he can't hide
          anymore. Honesty is an enormous risk, but he has to take it.
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... A while.
          
          
          She inhales. She knew, but it's still shocking. We CIRCLE
          THEM FASTER 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          I know what the Cold Ones are. 
          What you are. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Say it. Out loud. Say it.
          
          
          All sound suddenly DROPS OUT. We hear only her whisper..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Vampire
          
          
          They seem to hover in momentary stasis, him utterly exposed, her 
          reality utterly rocked. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Are you afraid?
          
          
          BELLA
          No. 
          
          
          
          51.
          EDWARD
          
          
          (angry)
          Then ask me the most basic 
          question: what do we eat?
          
          
          BELLA
          You won't hurt me. You're different.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You think you know me?
          
          
          He glares at her. She holds her ground. Suddenly, he takes 
          her by the hand. Starts walking. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Where are we going?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Up the mountain. Out of the cloud 
          bank. You need to see what 
          I 
          really am. What I look like in the 
          harsh light of the sun. 
          
          
          BELLA
          No! The sunlight will kill you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Myth. You need to see the truth.
          
          
          He pulls her but she stumbles. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Slow down.
          
          
          Suddenly, he's right next to her.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Are you afraid? 
          
          
          BELLA
          No.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Then come with me. Someplace where 
          no one can protect you. Where 
          I 
          could do what I've wanted to do from 
          the first moment I met you. 
          
          
          Their proximity is intense, riveting both of them. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm not afraid.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          You should be.
          
          
          
          52.
          He abruptly and effortlessly scoops her up into his arms. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Hold on.
          
          
          Then he flings her onto his back... and starts running.
          
          
          69 EXT. FOREST - RUNNING - DAY 69
          
          
          As in the opening sequence, Edward races through the forest, dark 
          trunks STROBING past as he picks up speed, faster and faster. 
          Bella clings to his back as it seems he'll collide with the trees, 
          but he avoids them with supernatural grace. It's frightening, 
          nauseating, intoxicating. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Are you afraid!
          ?
          
          
          BELLA
          No!
          
          
          But she clings tighter. Terrified. They climb in altitude. 
          Higher and higher, above the fog layer. Finally, up ahead 
          -
          
          
          THE FOREST'S EDGE fast approaches, a clearing is beyond. The
          sunlight glows white hot beyond the trees... they're about to 
          emerge from the shadowy darkness... but suddenly-
          
          
          Bella finds herself sitting on the ground, against a tree. 
          All is silent. She's dizzy, tries to regain her equilibrium. 
          Then she realizes she's alone. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward? Where are you?
          
          
          She rises, then steps just beyond the fringe of the ferns into 
          -
          
          
          70 EXT. A MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 70
          
          
          A perfect circle of swaying grass, wildflowers and buttery 
          sunlight. HEAR a stream nearby. Bella looks around and finally 
          sees 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD, his shirt open, standing nearby in the shade of some 
          trees. He watches her cautiously. She takes a step toward 
          him, but he holds up a hand. She waits. Finally, he takes 
          a 
          deep breath, and steps out of the shade 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          This is why we don't show ourselves 
          
          
          in sunlight..
          . 
          
          
          As the sun hits him... EDWARD'S SKIN literally sparkles as if 
          embedded with thousands of tiny diamonds. He is magnificent, 
          shimmering, like a statue carved from glittering crystal. He 
          moves toward her. 
          
          
          
          53.
          EDWARD
          This is what I am.
          
          
          He nears, clearly expecting her to recoil, but..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA
          You're... beautiful..
          .
          
          
          He realizes that she's in awe. She reaches to touch him, but 
          he immediately backs into the shadows, his skin normal again. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (appalled)
          Beautiful? I'm a killer, Bella. 
          This is the skin of a killer. 
          
          
          His arm juts into A SHAFT OF LIGHT, sparkling again.
          
          
          BELLA
          I don't believe that.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Because you believe the lie. The 
          camouflage. I'm the world's most 
          dangerous predator. Everything 
          about me invites you in - my voice, 
          my face, even my smell. As if 
          I 
          need any of that..
          .
          
          
          He's suddenly BEHIND her --then IN FRONT of her --then by 
          a
          tree, DARTING so fast, we only see where he lands 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          As if you could outrun me. As if 
          you could fight me off.
          
          
          He abruptly rips off a LARGE TREE LIMB, then THROWS it against 
          a 
          tree trunk with explosive force. 
          
          
          Bella flinches, but holds her ground, unshakable. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm designed to kill.
          
          
          BELLA
          I don't care.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I've killed people.
          
          
          BELLA
          It doesn't matter.
          
          
          
          54.
          EDWARD
          I wanted to kill you. I've never
          wanted a human's blood so much in 
          my life. I'm dangerous to you.
          
          
          BELLA
          I trust you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Don't.
          
          
          BELLA
          I trust you, Edward. I'm here.
          
          
          She takes his hand. He reels at the warmth of her touch. 
          She leans in, drawn to him, unaware that her THROAT is 
          nearing his lips... then suddenly he's gone.
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward?
          
          
          She looks over to FIND he's on the other side of the meadow, 
          catching his breath.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You... took me by surprise. 
          (collecting himself)
          I don't know how to... do this.
          
          
          He moves back toward her. Slowly. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Me, and my family, we're different 
          from others of our kind. We're not 
          nomadic, we have a permanent home. 
          We only hunt animals. We've 
          learned to control our thirst..
          . 
          
          
          (shaking his head)
          But you - your scent, it's like 
          a 
          drug to me... my own personal brand 
          of heroin. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (realizing)
          Oh... I thought you hated me when we met.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I did. For making me want you so badly. 
          I'm still not sure I can control myself.
          
          
          He reaches her again.
          
          
          BELLA
          I know you can.
          
          
          
          55.
          He's utterly vulnerable as he looks at her, searching her
          face for clues.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I wish I could understand this 
          thing you see in me. You look at 
          me with those eyes..
          . 
          
          
          (frustrated)
          I can't read your mind. Tell me 
          what you're thinking.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm afraid.
          
          
          Stricken, he sinks gracefully to his knees in the grass.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (devastated)
          Good. 
          
          
          She sinks down in front of him.
          
          
          BELLA
          Not of that. I'm afraid... you'll 
          disappear. That I'll lose you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (amazed, elated)
          You don't know how long I've looked 
          for you.
          
          
          They share a smile. Then he reaches toward her neck, 
          pausing..
          .
          
          
          EDWARD
          Be very still.
          
          
          She does so. Exercising great control, he places his hand on 
          her throat... it's so exposed, so vulnerable. The rush
          between them is overwhelming. But Bella doesn't move.
          
          
          He brushes his hand up her cheek. Then lowers it to her 
          heart... Clouds float past the sun..
          .
          
          
          They're both overwhelmed, taking each other in.
          
          
          EDWARD
          And so the lion fell for the lamb.
          
          
          BELLA
          Stupid lamb.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Sick masochistic lion.
          
          
          
          56.
          CRANE UP on the two of them, laying together, as close as 
          they dare... his hand to her heart..
          .
          
          
          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          71 INT. BELLA'S ROOM - MORNING 71
          
          
          CLOSE ON BELLA'S FACE. Still in bed. Thinking.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          About three things I was absolutely 
          positive. One, Edward was 
          a 
          vampire. 
          
          
          She rises, goes to the mirror. Looks at herself, worry 
          knitting her brow.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          Two, there was a part of him that 
          thirsted for my blood. And three..
          .
          
          
          As she moves past her window, something catches her eye, causing 
          her to BANG into her desk. She looks back out..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY
          
          
          Edward leans against his car, looking up at her with a small 
          smile. She beams at the sight of him. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          ... I was falling, unconditionally 
          and irrevocably, in love with him.

          73 EXT. OLYMPIC RAINFOREST - DAY (ANOTHER DAY) 73
          
          
          Edward helps Bella balance-walk across an enormous fallen pine 
          tree in the moss-covered forest. 
          
          
          BELLA
          How long have you been like this?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Since nineteen-eighteen. That's 
          when Carlisle found me. 
          
          
          She takes that in, it's a lot. But it stokes her curiosity.
          
          
          BELLA
          Where'd he find you?
          
          
          EDWARD
          In a hospital, dying of Spanish 
          influenza. My parents had already died. 
          
          
          
          57.
          FLASHBACK to CHICAGO HOSPITAL, 1918 - NIGHT
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          What was it like?
          
          
          EDWARD (V.O.
          )
          The word excruciating comes to 
          mind. But what Carlisle did was 
          much harder... not many of us have 
          the restraint to do that. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          Didn't he just... bite?
          
          
          EDWARD
          Not just. Our bite contains venom. 
          And once we taste blood, a sort of..
          . 
          frenzy begins. It's almost 
          impossible to stop. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          But Carlisle did. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          First with me, then with his wife, 
          Esme. He found her in a hospital, 
          as well. The others followed.
          
          
          BACK to PRESENT DAY
          
          
          BELLA 
          Does someone have to be dying to 
          become like you?..
          .
          
          
          Their CONVERSATION CONTINUES as we go to 
          -
          
          
          74 EXT. RIVER'S EDGE - DAY (ANOTHER DAY) 74
          
          
          They walk along a stunning coastline -- rugged black rocks, 
          covered in bright green moss.
          
          
          EDWARD
          ... No, that's just Carlisle. He 
          would never do... this, to someone 
          who had another choice. 
          
          
          BELLA
          So Carlisle's the reason why you 
          hunt animals, instead of people. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Not the only reason.
          
          
          He stops, looks down at her, serious, with emotion..
          .
          
          
          
          58.
          EDWARD
          I don't want to be a monster.
          
          
          She nods. Understands. He smiles.
          
          
          EDWARD
          We call ourselves vegetarians, by 
          the way... For our kind, hunting 
          animals is like living on tofu. It 
          keeps you strong but isn't very 
          satisfying. 
          
          
          Then abruptly, he whips past Bella. She turns to see him standing 
          on a large rock in the river.
          
          
          BELLA
          Show off.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's not that impressive, really. 
          Anyone in my family can do this.
          
          
          BELLA
          Can they all read minds, too? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          No, that's unique to me. But Alice can 
          see the future. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (fishing)
          Really? Bet she saw me coming 
          a 
          mile away.
          
          
          She notes his change of mood as he slows, darkening.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Her visions are very subjective. 
          The future can change.
          
          
          He cuts off her questions by returning to shore, and 
          continuing their walk..
          .
          
          
          75 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT (ANOTHER DAY) 75
          
          
          Water sprays from a hose as Bella and Edward wash her truck. 
          A boom box PLAYS. He perches on top of the roof. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Come to my house tomorrow. 
          
          
          Bella looks up, aiming the hose badly - water ricochets off 
          the cab and sprays in her face. He jumps down from the roof.
          
          
          BELLA
          Your house? With your family?
          
          
          
          59.
          He wipes down the dented front fender, then reaches under it 
          and, with his bare hands, easily pops a large DENT out of the 
          truck's body. She's too flustered to register it.
          
          
          BELLA 
          But... what if they don't like me?
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (laughing heartily)
          You're worried, not because you'll 
          be in a houseful of vampires, but 
          because you think they won't 
          approve of you? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm glad I amuse you.
          
          
          But then his laughter dies, as he hears something. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What is it?
          
          
          EDWARD
          A complication.
          
          
          ... as a BLACK CAR comes into view, and pulls up. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'll pick you up tomorrow.
          
          
          He heads to his car, eying the passengers in 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD'S POV - INT. BLACK CAR
          
          
          Jacob, with his father, Billy, who's expression is intense.
          Anxious. SLOW MOTION as Edward locks eyes with Billy. Jacob 
          looks questioningly at his father.
          
          
          Bella watches Edward drive away, perturbed by the exchange. She 
          forces a smile and goes to greet the visitors. Jacob sets up 
          Billy's wheelchair and Billy climbs into it as 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          Come to visit your truck?
          
          
          JACOB
          Looks good. You got that dent out. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Actually, we came to visit your 
          flat screen. First Mariners game 
          of the season. Plus Jacob here 
          kept bugging me to see you again.
          
          
          
          60.
          JACOB
          (mortified)
          Great, Dad. Thanks. 
          
          
          Jacob shoots his father an irritated look, just as the POLICE 
          CRUISER pulls up. Charlie climbs out, holding two six-packs. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Pale Ale.
          
          
          BILLY
          (holds up a brown paper 
          BAG)
          Harry Clearwater's homemade fish fry.
          
          
          Charlie smiles, pleased. He clicks on the game as they all head 
          inside 
          -
          
          
          BILLY
          Any luck with the Waylon case?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          
          
          (darkening)
          Found a footprint out at the crime 
          scene today. A bare, human footprint. 
          
          
          Billy seems disturbed but not surprised. Bella is horrified.
          
          
          BELLA
          A person did that?
          
          
          JACOB
          A crazy person, walking around 
          barefoot this time of year.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Spread the word out at the rez, will 
          ya? Keep the kids out of the woods. 
          
          
          BILLY
          Will do. 
          (directed at Bella)
          Don't want no one else getting hurt.
          
          
          Bella looks away from Billy, unnerved.

          78 DREAM SEQUENCE - UNDERWATER 78
          
          
          Bella floats near Edward, only their hands touching, but 
          their bodies are nearing, so close, so sensual..
          . 
          
          
          
          61.
          Suddenly, EDWARD IS YANKED DOWNWARD! Something has him, 
          pulling him down..
          . 
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          79 
          INT. BELLA'S ROOM - ON BELLA - MORNING 79
          -- as her eyes pop open... and relief sweeps over her as she 
          realizes it was just a dream. But it haunts her..
          .
          
          
          80 
          EXT. OLYMPIC PENINSULA - ROAD - DAY 80
          
          
          AERIAL SHOT of the forest as we sweep over its lush green 
          expanse, to FIND Edward's Volvo speeding along, very fast. 
          The Volvo finally turns off the paved highway and onto a long 
          
          
          serpentine dirt road. FOLLOW THE CAR until, finally, it 
          reaches a small meadow, in the center of which sits 
          -
          
          
          81 
          EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - DAY 81
          A timeless graceful house. The Volvo pulls up and Bella 
          climbs out, surprised.
          
          
          BELLA
          It's... wonderful.
          EDWARD
          You expected turrets, dungeons and moats? 
          BELLA
          No... not moats.
          He takes her hand. She girds herself. They head inside.
          
          
          82 
          INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 82
          Edward guides Bella into the large, bright house. Walls of glass 
          look out on the river. Everything's open and white. Historical
          objects are tastefully placed throughout. 
          
          
          HEAR Verdi's La Traviata: Libiamo ne' lieti calici coming from
          another room. Bella is enraptured.
          BELLA
          It's so light and open. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Thanks to tinted windows... It's the one 
          place we never have to hide.
          
          
          We then notice CLANGING coming from the kitchen. Edward 
          shakes his head.
          EDWARD
          I told them not to do this.
          
          
          
          62.
          83 INT. CULLEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 83
          
          
          Verdi's opera BLASTS Bella and Edward who enter to find the
          kitchen in full swing. Dr. Cullen, Emmett, Rosalie, and ESME 
          prepare elaborate platters of Italian pastas and antipasti. 
          
          
          Esme rolls out a pizza dough and fans tomatoes around it in an 
          instant. Rosalie stirs a pot, disinterested. 
          
          
          Esme sees Bella and stops, emanating maternal warmth. Her 
          heart-shaped face and billows of hair are reminiscent of the 
          silent-movie era. 
          
          
          ESME
          
          
          Bella. We're making Italiano for 
          
          
          you. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          This is Esme, my mother for all 
          
          
          intents and purposes. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Bon giorno?
          
          
          ESME
          Molto bene! 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          
          
          You've given us an excuse to use 
          
          
          the kitchen for the first time. 
          
          
          Hit pause..
          .
          
          
          PAN across brand new Williams-Sonoma cookware boxes to the 
          corner --they're watching an ITALIAN COOKING SHOW on a TV.
          Emmett hits the DVD remote control. 
          
          
          ESME
          I hope you're hungry.
          
          
          BELLA
          Oh, absolutely 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          She already ate.
          
          
          Bella shoots him a look, but something SHATTERS. Rosalie has 
          thrown down a bowl and now strides out 
          -
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Perfect.
          
          
          
          63.
          84 INT. LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - DAY 84
          
          
          -- Bella exits behind Rosalie, trying to explain. The 
          other's follow -
          
          BELLA
          I just assumed -- because you don't 
          eat, you know..
          .
          
          
          ESME
          Of course. That was very considerate 
          of you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (re: Rosalie)
          Ignore her. I do.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Yes, let's keep pretending this 
          isn't dangerous for all of us. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I would never, ever tell anyone.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (reassuring)
          She knows that. 
          
          
          EMMETT
          The problem is, you two have gone 
          public now, so..
          .
          
          
          ESME
          
          
          Emmett.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          No, she should know.
          
          
          (to Bella)
          The entire family will be 
          implicated if this ends badly. 
          
          
          BELLA
          ... Badly?
          
          
          This hangs in the air, uncomfortably. Edward can't look at her.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (realizing)
          Oh. Badly. Like, where I become 
          a 
          meal.
          
          
          Emmett chokes back laughter. Edward grins. Wraps his arm 
          around Bella. Even Esme has to chuckle.
          
          
          Rosalie, exasperated, heads back into the kitchen. Emmett 
          shrugs, goes after her.
          
          
          
          64.
          ALICE (O.S.
          )
          Hi, Bella!
          
          
          ON THE BALCONY Alice leaps over the rail, holding a bouquet 
          of wildflowers. Jasper follows her. She bounces forward to 
          kiss Bella's cheek and hands Bella the wildflowers. 
          
          
          ALICE
          
          
          I'm Alice. You do smell good. 
          EDWARD 
          Alice. 
          ALICE 
          
          It's alright, Bella and I are going 
          to be great friends. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (extending her hand)
          And you're Jasper, right?
          
          
          JASPER
          Pleasure to meet you.
          
          
          But he shies away from her hand. 
          
          
          ALICE
          (gently encouraging)
          You won't hurt her, Jasper.
          
          
          He isn't so sure. Edward takes Bella's hand instead.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'll give you a tour of the house. 
          
          
          ALICE
          (with meaning)
          I'll see you soon.
          
          
          Edward shoots Alice a look, which Bella catches before he guides 
          her up the stairs. As they ascend, Bella takes in the eclectic 
          ART PIECES from around the world, Ethiopian crosses, Dresden 
          China, Asian scrolls. They reach 
          -
          
          
          THE LANDING - to FIND a wall of dozens of artistically arrayed 
          silk squares with tassels. Bella looks closer. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Graduation caps?
          
          
          EDWARD
          A private joke. We matriculate a lot.
          
          
          BELLA
          What a nightmare, repeating high school. 
          
          
          
          65.
          EDWARD
          True, but the younger we start out in 
          a 
          new place, the longer we can stay there.
          
          
          She shivers at the thought of it, as they continue on..

          EDWARD
          ... and this is my room.
          
          
          Bella enters to find a wall of glass doors open to a deck, with 
          the river beyond. The rest is floor to ceiling CD's, vinyl, 
          8
          track tapes, etc., with a sophisticated I-pod/stereo set up. 
          
          
          BELLA
          So you're obsessed with music. But..
          .
          (looking around)
          No bed?
          
          
          EDWARD
          No sleep.
          
          
          BELLA
          Ever?
          
          
          EDWARD
          No nightmares, no drool, no 
          snoring.
          
          
          She considers this, as she runs a hand along a wall of CD's,
          studying the titles.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Do you have any favorites?
          
          
          BELLA
          Depends. Alternative? Jazz? 
          Sixties, seventies..
          .
          
          
          EDWARD
          Ooh, she knows her music. Alright, 
          nineties. Eighteen-nineties. Classical.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'd have to say... Debussy.
          
          
          He looks at her, surprised, smiles. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          My favorite, too. 
          
          
          Off their connection, he pulls out a CD and puts it on. 
          A 
          solo piano version of CLAIR DE LUNE begins to play.
          
          
          
          66.
          He moves to her, taking her hand, then he starts to turn her 
          in a pirouette, dancing with her - but she breaks off and 
          backs away.
          
          
          BELLA
          No dancing.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Ever? 
          
          
          BELLA
          No tripping, no falling, no derision. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          (mischievously)
          I can always make you.
          
          
          BELLA
          You don't scare me.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You really shouldn't have said that.
          
          
          He grins, a low GROWLING SOUNDS in the back of his throat. 
          She laughs and backs out the door, onto 
          -

          -- Bella backs up to the rail. Edward appears in the 
          doorway, shifting into a half-crouch, about to pounce. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Don't you dare -
          
          Suddenly, she's airborne as he tackles her and they FLY OFF THE 
          DECK... then she finds herself 
          -
          
          
          IN A TREE - in his arms. When she realizes where she is, she 
          laughs, delighted. It's infectious, he laughs heartily, too..

          Esme and Dr. Cullen look out the window. Edward's LAUGHTER
          filters inside to them; Esme, in turn, smiles.
          
          
          ESME
          She's brought him to life.

          Esme turns to Dr. Cullen, gentle but absolutely firm.

          Carlisle. Bella is what he wants. 
          
          
          It will work out. Somehow. 
          
          
          Dr. Cullen smiles at her with love, then takes her hand as 
          they look back out the window..

          Trust me?
          
          
          BELLA
          In theory. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Then close your eyes.
          
          
          She does, warily. He grips her more firmly, then LEAPS them to 
          another tree like a flying squirrel! Then, again, to the TOP of 
          another tree. He easily gets a foothold, while holding Bella. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Open.
          
          
          She does... to the most astonishing bird's eye VIEW of the
          valley, river, and the mountains beyond. CAMERA whirls around 
          them allowing us a 360 degree view of their surroundings. Off 
          Bella's intoxicated face..

          Bella hurries toward the entrance, trying to keep the joy on her 
          face in check... with minimal success. Outside the door, she 
          passes Mike, hanging out with several of his basketball TEAMMATES.
          
          
          MIKE
          Yo, Arizona. So. You and Cullen.
          
          
          She shrugs, non-committal, but can't entirely hide a smile,
          as she hurries inside to Charlie's table and slides in.
          
          
          BELLA
          Sorry I'm late. Biology project. 
          
          
          Cora sets a top sirloin steak in front of Charlie, and plate 
          of seafood in front of Bella.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Ordered you the seafood combo.
          
          
          BELLA
          Order one for yourself next time. 
          You should cut back on the steak.

          today?
          
          
          Charlie's aware of the LOGGERS at the counter listening, too.
          He frames his answer carefully to keep everyone calm.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          The suspect's moving east. Kitsap 
          County Sheriff is taking over from 
          here. They're putting extra guys on.
          
          
          CORA
          Hope they catch him fast.
          
          
          She moves off, with a measure of relief. Charlie and Bella 
          pass each other the salt, butter for bread, etc., with an 
          easy rhythm now.

          She turns to see Mike and the guys horsing around outside, 
          straws in their noses, making faces at her. She smiles.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          It's okay you wanna join them. I'm 
          just gonna turn in early anyway.

          He's just a friend.

          BELLA
          We're not really going to talk 
          about boys, are we?
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Just... you should be around people. 
          I leave you alone too much.

          it becomes permanent. You'd like 
          Jacksonville, baby.

          (small smile)
          Maybe..
          .
          
          
          RENE
          Tell me everything! Jock? Indie? Bet 
          he's smart. Is he smart?
          
          
          BELLA
          (trying to avoid lies)
          Well... he is kind of a history buff.
          
          
          -- this as she turns to find 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD LYING ON HER BED, smiling. She nearly drops the phone.
          
          
          BELLA
          I, uh... have to go.
          
          
          RENE
          No way, we gotta talk boys. Are 
          you being safe?
          
          
          Edward shoots her a look, he heard that. She's mortified.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'll call you later, Mom. 
          
          
          STAY ON BELLA who hangs up.
          
          
          BELLA
          How did you get in here?
          
          
          EDWARD
          The window. As always.
          
          
          BELLA
          You've been here before?
          
          
          EDWARD
          What else is there to do at night? 
          
          
          
          72.
          She pushes him. He grabs her hand and playfully pulls her 
          onto the bed, wrestling as 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          You're a peeping Tom! Perv!
          
          
          EDWARD
          Shh! The Chief will hear you!
          
          
          But the electricity of their physical contact quickly overwhelms 
          them, their laughter quieting. He studies her face.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I just... like watching over you. 
          
          
          He raises his fingers to her lips, sending a thrill up her spine.
          
          
          EDWARD
          There's something I'd like to try. 
          
          
          She nods, bedazzled by him. He takes her face in his hands, 
          hesitates to test himself, then he softly kisses her..
          . 
          
          
          What neither of them is prepared for is her response. Her 
          breath comes in a wild GASP. Her fingers knot in his hair, 
          clutching him to her. Lips part as she breathes his scent..
          .
          
          
          Then his hands gently, but forcefully push her face back. She 
          opens her eyes to see that his eyes are wild, his jaw clenched. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (mortified)
          Oh... I'm... oh.
          
          
          He relaxes slightly, looking at her blushing face.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm stronger than I thought. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Wish I could say the same. I'm so 
          embarrassed.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Don't be. But we have to be careful.
          (serious)
          I can never lose control with you. Ever. 
          
          
          She nods, then carefully lies on his chest. He wraps his arms 
          around her. Off the two of them..
          .
          
          
          93 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 93
          
          
          Bella enters to find Charlie cleaning a rifle. He starts to 
          say hello but she just blurts out -
          -
          
          
          
          73.
          BELLA
          I have a date with Edward Cullen.
          
          
          He suddenly looks like he's having an aneurysm. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          He's too old for you.
          
          
          BELLA
          We're both juniors. I thought you 
          liked the Cullens. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          And I thought you weren't interested in 
          any of the boys in town. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward doesn't live in town. And 
          it's in the early stage and -
          -
          whatever, he's outside right now.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Now? He's out there?
          
          
          BELLA
          He wants to meet you. Officially. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Good.
          
          
          He cocks the rifle in mock-seriousness.
          
          
          BELLA
          Be nice, okay? He's... important.
          
          
          Charlie gives his daughter a reassuring nod... then she opens 
          the door to REVEAL Edward in a parka and gloves. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Chief Swan. I wanted to formally 
          introduce myself. I'm Edward.
          
          
          Edward extends his hand. Charlie takes it, but grunts 
          a 
          hello, resisting him.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I won't keep Bella out late 
          tonight. We're just going to go 
          play baseball with my family.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella's going to play baseball?
          
          
          Bella's equally surprised, but hides it.
          
          
          
          74.
          EDWARD
          Yes, sir, that's the plan.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Well. More power to you, I guess.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (looks him in the eyes)
          She'll be safe with me, sir, I promise.
          
          
           As Edward exits... Charlie holds Bella back.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          (sotto)
          You got that pepper spray?
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Dad.
          
          
          94 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 94
          
          
          Edward and Bella climb into a massive JEEP parked in the drive.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (amused)
          Your father thinks you should go to 
          an all-girl's school.
          
          
          BELLA
          No fair, reading Charlie's mind. 
          
          
          As they climb in the Jeep, Bella notices a baseball bat 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          And since when do vampires like baseball? 
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's the American pastime. Plus, 
          there's a thunderstorm coming. It's the 
          only time we can play. You'll see why.
          
          
          95 EXT. CLEARING IN WOODS - TWILIGHT 95
          
          
          Storm clouds gather in the sky as Bella and Edward pull up in 
          the Jeep. She takes in a rough baseball diamond, set into an 
          enormous field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. 
          
          
          Esme and Emmett come to greet Bella. 
          
          
          ESME
          Good thing you're here. We need 
          a 
          umpire. 
          
          
          EMMETT
          (big crooked grin)
          She thinks we cheat.
          
          
          
          75.
          ESME
          I know you cheat. Call em as you 
          see em, Bella.
          
          
          WHIP PAN to Alice on the Pitcher's Mound.
          
          
          ALICE
          It's time.
          
          
          -- Just as a deep RUMBLE of thunder shakes the forest.
          
          
          BEGIN MONTAGE - THE GAME
          
          
          And it's extraordinary. Bella stays by Esme who plays 
          catcher. Alice pitches with lightning-fast speed. Edward 
          and Emmett take positions in the outfield. 
          
          
          -- ROSALIE SMASHES the ball with the aluminum bat. It CRACKS 
          like thunder -- and is followed directly by real THUNDER. 
          
          
          BELLA
          (to Esme)
          Now I get why you need the thunder.
          
          
          The ball SHOOTS like a meteor deep into the forest, rocketing 
          through the trees. Edward disappears after it.
          
          
          BELLA
          That has to be a home run.
          
          
          ESME
          Edward's very fast.
          
          
          Rosalie darts around the bases, almost a blur -- Edward races out 
          of the forest with the ball and WHIPS it to home plate. WHAP! 
          Esme catches it a millisecond before Rosalie slides in.
          
          
          BELLA
          Yer out?
          
          
          Esme nods... Amazed, Bella watches as DR. CULLEN hits a line 
          drive. Edward and Emmett race for the catch, DIVING 15 feet 
          and COLLIDING with such might that it sounds like enormous 
          boulders falling. They miss the ball -- Dr. Cullen is safe! 
          
          
          JASPER WHACKS the next pitch -- deep into the forest. But 
          before Edward can chase it, Alice suddenly GASPS. 
          
          
          ALICE
          Stop! I didn't see them..
          . 
          
          
          They all stop. Edward is immediately at Bella's side. The 
          family instantly gathers at home plate. 
          
          
          ALICE
          They're traveling so quickly 
          -
          
          
          
          76.
          ROSALIE
          You said they left the county -
          -
          
          
          ALICE
          They did, but then they heard us..
          .
          (looking at Edward)
          And changed their minds.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (to Bella)
          Put your hair down 
          -
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Like that'll help. I could smell 
          her from across the field. 
          
          
          Edward ignores Rosalie as he arranges Bella's hair.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I shouldn't have brought you here. 
          I'm so sorry.
          
          
          She'd ask why, but suddenly, they all turn as one toward -
          
          THE EDGE OF THE FOREST
          
          
          There's a faint rustle... then James, Victoria and Laurent
          emerge. As they near, Bella SEES their bare feet, then the 
          deep BURGUNDY of their eyes. Laurent holds up the baseball. 
          
          
          LAURENT
          I believe this belongs to you.
          
          
          He tosses the ball (his casual toss is still blindingly fast) 
          to Dr. Cullen who easily catches it and smiles politely.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Thank you.
          
          
          LAURENT
          Could you use three more players?
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Of course.
          
          
          LAURENT
          I'm Laurent. This is Victoria. 
          And James.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Would you like to bat first?
          
          
          Laurent picks up a bat. The Cullens take the field. Dr. 
          Cullen is catcher, Edward is on first, with Bella behind him, 
          near the Jeep.
          
          
          
          77.
          Bella sees that Edward's eyes are locked onto James. Laurent
          is at bat first.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          I'm afraid your hunting activities have 
          caused something of a mess for us. 
          
          
          LAURENT
          Our apologies. We didn't realize 
          the territory had been claimed. 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Yes, we maintain a permanent 
          residence.
          
          
          The three newcomers exchange a look of surprise.
          
          
          LAURENT
          Really? Well, we won't be a problem 
          any more.
          
          
          VICTORIA
          The humans were tracking us, but we 
          led them East-
          
          
          Jasper pitches the ball -- Laurent SLAMS it -- but Alice is 
          up a tree is a flash and the ball slams into Alice's hand
          with a THWAP. Laurent is pissed, but James smiles ever so 
          slightly, delighted at the discovery of worthy opponents.
          
          
          James is up next and he POWER-SLAMS IT with AMAZING FORCE..
          .
          
          
          He runs past first, past Edward, past Bella..
          .
          
          
          CLOSE ON BELLA -- IN SLOW MOTION as the wind from the ball 
          ruffles her hair, carrying her scent, which floats to 
          -
          
          
          JAMES -- who suddenly SCREECHES to a halt. His head WHIPS 
          around at her and he lurches into a crouch, his nostrils 
          flaring, excitedly, eyes locked on Bella.
          
          
          JAMES
          You brought a snack.
          
          
          EDWARD springs in front of Bella, baring his teeth. A truly 
          menacing, feral SNARL rips from his throat. James GROWLS back.
          
          
          OVERHEAD SHOT: in a flash, the Cullens rush into position 
          behind Edward -- Laurent and Victoria line up behind James. 
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          The girl is with us.
          
          
          
          78.
          LAURENT
          (trying to defuse 
          situation)
          We won't harm her.
          
          
          EMMETT
          (hungry for battle)
          Just try it.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          I think it best if you leave.
          
          
          LAURENT
          Yes, I can see the game is over. 
          We'll go now. James?
          
          
          But James' eyes don't leave Edward's. Laurent puts a hand on
          James' shoulder, and finally, James backs into the woods with
          his cohorts, disappearing. Once they're gone, Esme 
          immediately gathers up the bats-
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Get Bella out of here. We'll follow 
          them. 
          
          
          Dr. Cullen, Jasper and a resentful Rosalie race off after the 
          three vampires. Edward scoops Bella up as we 
          -
          
          
          SMASH TO:
          
          
          EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - ON THE JEEP - LATE TWILIGHT 96
          
          
          Edward whips Bella into the Jeep and straps her in -
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          James is a tracker. I saw his mind. 
          The hunt is his obsession, and my 
          reaction set him off -
          -
          
          
          -- The tires spin as Edward WHIPS the jeep around 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          -- We're a large clan of strong fighters 
          all protecting one vulnerable human. 
          
          
          (dark with disgust)
          I just made this his most exciting 
          game ever.
          
          
          Bella blanches with the dawning realization of what she has just 
          wrought up on them all as..
          .
          
          
          THE JEEP CAREENS DOWN THE DIRT MOUNTAIN ROAD
          
          
          A jolting, death defying ride, SPLASHING through creeks, until 
          they reach 
          -
          
          
          
          79.
          97 EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 97
          
          
          THE JEEP speeds wildly down the road.
          
          
          EDWARD
          The first place he'll go is your 
          house. He'll track your scent 
          there.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (horrified)
          What?!? Charlie's there. He's in 
          danger because of me. Because of 
          us!
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (calmly)
          Then we'll lead the tracker away 
          from him. Somehow.
          
          
          He angrily WHIPS around a bend, MUD FLYING 
          -
          
          
          98 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 98
          
          
          Charlie watches a baseball game on T.V. as the door suddenly 
          BURSTS open to reveal Bella, crying, and Edward, devastated-
          
          
          BELLA
          I said, leave me alone! 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Bella, don't do this. Just think 
          about it, please 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          Get out! It's over.
          
          
          She SLAMS the door. Charlie has risen, baffled, concerned.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella? What happened? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I have to get out of this place. 
          Out of Forks. I'm leaving. Now.
          
          
          Bella runs upstairs. Charlie hurries after her 
          -
          
          
          99 INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 99
          
          
          Bella slams the door behind her. REVEAL Edward's already there,
          pulling things from her drawers and shoving them into a duffle 
          faster than humanly possible. Bella leans against the door. 
          
          
          
          80.
          BELLA
          (a pained whisper)
          I can't hurt him.
          
          
          Edward gives her a look, you have to. There's a KNOCK.
          
          
          INTERCUT Charlie on the other side. It's agony for both of them.
          
          
          CHARLIE 
          Bells. Did he hurt you?
          
          
          BELLA
          No, Dad. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Then what? Did he break up with you? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I broke up with him. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          I thought you liked him?
          
          
          BELLA
          That's why I have to leave. I don't 
          want this. I want to go home.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (whispering)
          I'll be in the truck.
          
          
          And he disappears out the window. Bella gathers strength to 
          continue her performance. She opens the door to reveal Charlie. 
          He follows as she carries her duffle and truck keys into 
          -
          
          
          100 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - STAIRS (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT 100
          
          
          Bella charges down the stairs -- Charlie follows.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Your mother's not even in Phoenix. 
          
          
          BELLA
          She'll come home. I'll call her 
          from the road.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          You can't drive home now. I'll take 
          you to the airport in the morning.
          
          
          BELLA
          I want to drive. I need time to 
          think. I'll pull into a motel in 
          a 
          few hours. I promise.
          
          
          She heads down the stairs. Charlie follows..
          . 
          
          
          
          81.
          101 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE -LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) -NIGHT 101
          
          
          Bella reaches the ground floor with Charlie on her heels. 
          She's almost to the door but Charlie blocks her. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          
          
          Bells, I know I'm not around much, 
          
          
          but I can change that. We can do 
          
          
          more things together.
          
          
          She takes a breath, hating herself for what she's about to say..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Like watch more baseball on the flat 
          
          
          screen? Or go to the Coffee Shop? 
          
          
          Same people, same steak, same berry 
          
          
          cobbler every night? That's you, 
          
          
          Dad. Not me.
          
          
          This hits Charlie hard. She can barely stand it, heads down 
          the stairs, as he takes a second to recover..
          .
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Bella... I just got you back.
          
          
          Which breaks Bella's heart... and forces her to deliver the
          final blow.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          And if I don't get out now, I'm 
          
          
          going get stuck here like mom did.
          
          
          Charlie is stunned, wounded. She takes advantage of his 
          shock, pushing past him out the door. 
          
          
          102 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 102
          
          
          Bella exits, heads to her truck. Fresh tears spring to her 
          eyes. 
          
          
          ANGLE ON THE WOODS 
          
          
          Trees, branches... and a pair of DEADLY EYES. James. He watches 
          from a distance as Bella pulls out. The truck moves off... and 
          so does James, leaving Charlie alone with his pain, staring out 
          the window.
          
          
          103 INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT 103
          
          
          Bella drives, wiping tears away. Suddenly Edward is outside 
          the car, near Bella's window. 
          
          
          
          82.
          EDWARD
          He'll forgive you.
          (off Bella's startled look)
          Slide over..
          .
          
          
          Bella slides over to the passenger side as Edward opens the 
          door, sliding in, and takes the wheel. Bella slumps.
          
          
          BELLA
          His face... I said the same words 
          my mother used when she left him. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          It was the only way he'd let you go. 
          
          
          Edward FLOORS it.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Your father's safe now, Bella. The 
          tracker is following us 
          -
          
          
          Suddenly, BOOM! - a dark figure LEAPS onto the bed of the 
          truck. Bella SCREAMS. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's alright. It's just Emmett. 
          Alice is in the car behind us. 
          
          
          She catches her breath. It kills him to see her so frightened. 
          She looks out the window as they drive through town..
          . 
          
          
          104 BELLA'S POV - EXT. FORKS COFFEE SHOP (CONT) - NIGHT 104
          
          
          The small, insulated town passes by in SLOW MOTION... INSIDE we 
          SEE Mike, Jessica, Eric and Angela laughing, flirting, innocent, 
          hopeful..
          .
          
          
          105 EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT 105
          
          
          Edward, Emmett and Alice rush Bella from the truck to the 
          house... but freeze when the door opens and Laurent exits. They 
          immediately take defensive positions but Dr. Cullen appears.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          He came to warn us. About James.
          
          
          They back down slightly. Laurent address Dr. Cullen.
          
          
          LAURENT
          I've grown tired of his games. But 
          he's got unparalleled senses. 
          Absolutely lethal. I've never seen 
          anything like him in three hundred 
          years ... And the woman, Victoria, 
          will back him. Don't underestimate 
          her.
          
          
          
          83.
          Dr. Cullen nods thanks. Laurent looks at Edward, apologetic. 
          
          
          LAURENT
          I'm truly sorry for what's been 
          unleashed here.
          
          
          And he moves off, disappearing into the woods..
          .
          
          
          106 INT. CULLEN HOUSE - FOUR CAR GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          
          The side door BURSTS OPEN as Edward and the Cullens enter, 
          followed by Bella. The lights flip on to reveal a pristine 
          garage; the Volvo, the red BMW, a black Mercedes sedan, an SUV. 
          
          
          Everyone but Rosalie springs into action, opening cupboards for 
          supplies - cell phones, extra batteries, maps, portable GPS units, 
          changes of clothes, cans of gasoline, etc. As they load up the 
          vehicles 
          -
          
          
          JASPER
          I've had to fight our kind before. 
          We're hard to kill.
          
          
          EDWARD
          But not impossible. We'll tear him up 
          
          
          EMMETT
          
          
          (with bloodlust)
          We'll rip him apart with our hands, 
          then burn the pieces 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          I don't relish killing another creature. 
          Even a sadistic one like James.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          If he doesn't get to one of us 
          first.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (horrified)
          This is insane. You can't put yourselves 
          in danger like this - for me.
          
          
          ROSALIE
          Too late.
          
          
          Edward shoots Rosalie a look, but he grabs two sets of keys 
          off a hook, throwing one set, lightning fast, to Dr. Cullen 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'll run Bella south, while you lead 
          the tracker away 
          -
          
          
          
          84.
          DR. CULLEN
          No, Edward -- the tracker thinks 
          you won't leave Bella. He'll 
          follow you.
          
          
          ALICE
          I'll go with Bella. Jasper and 
          I 
          will drive her south.
          
          
          (facing him)
          I'll keep her safe, Edward.
          
          
          Edward agonizes. Frustrated. Alice steps forward.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (studies her, torn)
          Can you keep your thoughts to yourself?
          
          
          She nods. An unspoken agreement. Edward finally surrenders 
          his keys to Alice. Then he opens one of Bella's suitcases,
          pulling out clothes, tossing them to 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          Esme, Rosalie, put these on so the 
          tracker will pick up Bella's scent. 
          
          
          ROSALIE
          
          
          (dropping the clothes)
          Why should I? What is she to me? Just 
          a danger you've inflicted on us 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          
          
          (spinning on her)
          Rosalie. Bella is with Edward. She's 
          a part of this family now. And we 
          protect our family. 
          
          
          She glowers, but picks up the clothes. Dr. Cullen hits the door 
          opener and the massive METAL DOORS roll open. Dr. Cullen 
          squeezes Edward's shoulder before he and Esme climb into the
          SUV. Everyone finishes loading up, climbing in cars 
          -
          
          
          Amid this, Edward and Bella take a moment together.
          
          
          BELLA
          If any of you get hurt because of me 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          We won't, there are five of us, two of 
          them. When it's done, I'll come get you. 
          
          
          He pulls her closer, looking into her eyes. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're my life now.
          
          
          
          85.
          They drink each other in, possibly for the last time... as the SUV 
          PEELS out, WIPING THE FRAME

          Jasper drives, Alice in the passenger seat. Bella is in the 
          back, her eyes red from crying. She talks on her cell phone 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Mom, it's me again. You must have 
          
          
          let your phone die. Anyway, I'm 
          
          
          not in Forks anymore but I'm okay. 
          
          
          I'll explain when you call.
          
          
          She hangs up, then faces back out the window, watching the green, 
          misty Olympic Peninsula speed past. Off Bella's face -
          
          A SERIES OF DISSOLVES THROUGHOUT THE DAY, THEN THE NIGHT 
          
          
          -- show us the landscape as it changes from dark green 
          forests to stretches of grassy hillsides, to drier, browner 
          surroundings, until night falls and headlights lights flash 
          by us. Finally, we land in..

          TREES BLOW PAST US at a blinding speed as we track Edward, 
          Rosalie, and Emmett who dart in and out of frame, blasting through 
          the misty woods, Edward, the fastest, in the lead.
          
          
          Edward stops, trying to read his enemy's thoughts. Rosalie 
          tears a tiny swatch of her shirt, leaves it on a FLOWERING 
          MAPLE TREE. And then they're gone.

          Esme and Dr. Cullen crouch atop a hill, looking down at the 
          river. In the distance, below, they SEE 
          -
          
          
          THEIR POV - ON THE LAKE - VICTORIA jogs into view. She then looks 
          in their direction. Once Dr. Cullen and Esme are assured she has 
          their scent, they continue over the hill's crest.

          James blasts past the FLOWERING MAPLE -- then stops, backtracks to 
          the tree, finds the tiny swatch of fabric. He starts off again..
          . 
          but stops, smells the fabric. Something's not right. He runs
          back in the opposite direction... Uh oh..
          .
          
          
          SMASH TO:

          ON BELLA'S FACE: her eyes pop open. She's lying atop a bed, 
          fully clothed. She rises, reorienting.
          
          
          116 INT. SCOTTSDALE HOTEL - LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 116
          
          
          The blinds are pulled. Alice and Jasper stare blankly at 
          a 
          
          
          T.V. set. Several plates of food crowd a table. Alice looks 
          up as Bella enters, looking at her cell phone. 
          BELLA
          I wish he'd call.
          
          
          ALICE
          You should eat.
          
          
          But Bella ignores the food. She sits heavily.
          
          
          BELLA
          They could get hurt. It's not 
          worth it.
          
          
          JASPER
          (insistent)
          Yes. It is. 
          
          
          She's taken aback. It's the first time he's engaged with her.
          
          
          JASPER
          Edward's changed since he found 
          you. And none of us want to look 
          into his eyes for the next hundred 
          years if he loses you. 
          
          
          (he looks forward again)
          It's worth it.
          
          
          Suddenly, Alice REELS. Jasper goes to her, Bella follows.
          
          
          JASPER
          What do you see?
          
          
          ALICE
          (with deep worry)
          The tracker. He just changed course..
          .
          
          
          Jasper quickly sets a pad of paper and pencil in front of her. 
          
          
          
          87.
          JASPER
          Where will it take him, Alice?
          
          
          PUSH IN ON ALICE'S FACE as we-
          
          
          FLASH POP TO - JAMES
          
          
          A disorienting vision of him standing in a room full of..
          .
          
          
          ALICE
          Mirrors. It's a room of mirrors.
          
          
          Alice begins to draw at HYPER SPEED, closing her eyes, trying 
          to see it clearly.
          
          
          BELLA
          How do the visions work? Edward 
          said they weren't always certain. 
          
          
          JASPER
          She sees the course people are on, 
          while they're on it. If they change 
          their minds, the visions change. 
          
          
          Bella looks over Alice's shoulder to see the drawing.
          
          
          BELLA
          So the course James is on now will 
          lead him to... a ballet studio?
          
          
          ALICE
          (looks up at her)
          You've been here?
          
          
          BELLA
          No. I don't know. I used to take 
          ballet lessons as a kid. The 
          school had an arch like that.
          
          
          JASPER
          Was your school here in Phoenix? 
          
          
          BELLA
          Yeah, around the corner from my house. 
          But I haven't been there in ten years.
          
          
          JASPER
          Do you have any reason to go now?
          
          
          BELLA
          No. Hell, no. I hated the place.
          
          
          Alice and Jasper share a look, trying to figure this out. 
          Suddenly, Bella JUMPS as her cell phone RINGS. She picks it 
          up. Sees the caller I.D. and exhales relief. She answers..

          EDWARD
          I'm coming to get you. 
          (hates having to say 
          
          
          this)
          We lost the tracker. The woman is 
          still in the area. Rosalie and 
          Esme are protecting your father.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          (sinking)
          This is my fault. You warned me, 
          but I didn't think. I just..

          EDWARD
          Bella, we're in too deep. We can't 
          change how we feel..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          No... we can't.
          (then)
          When will you get here?
          
          
          EDWARD
          In a couple hours. Then you and 
          I 
          will go somewhere. Together. The 
          others will keep hunting.
          
          
          (then, determined)
          Bella, I swear to you, I'll do whatever 
          it takes to make you safe again. 
          
          
          Off Bella, her eyes welling..

          INSERT CALLER I.D. -It reads HOME. Bella answers -

          Calm down, Mom. Everything is fine, 
          okay? I'll explain every 
          -

          JAMES (O.S.

          JAMES
          I was prepared to wait for you. 
          But then Mom came home after she 
          received a very worried call from 
          your Dad. It all worked out quite 
          well.
          
          
          Bella's eyes are wild with fear.
          
          
          JAMES
          I must say, Forks High School doesn't 
          protect its students' privacy very 
          well. It was just too easy for 
          Victoria to find your previous address.

          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Leave my mother out of this.
          
          
          JAMES
          You're protective of her. That's 
          nice. You can still save her. But 
          you'll need to get away from your 
          friends. Can you do that? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I... don't think so.
          
          
          
          90.
          JAMES
          If your mother's life depends on it? 
          
          
          Bella is terrified, but there's no choice here. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Where should I meet you?
          
          
          James grins as he fingers a PHOTO of Bella that's attached to
          the refrigerator with a magnet. It's the same photo Charlie
          has of her, age 7, in a tutu, sitting on the floor. 
          
          
          JAMES
          The old ballet studio around the 
          corner. And I'll know if you bring 
          anyone along. Poor mommy would pay 
          the price for that mistake.
          
          
          (sniffs the air)
          She smells like you. Delicious.
          
          
          STAY ON BELLA as she hangs up, panicked. She starts flinging 
          open drawers, searching for a weapon - a pen, a sewing kit. 
          Useless. Then she remembers..
          .
          
          
          Her purse. She dumps out the contents, and FINDS the pepper 
          spray Charlie gave her. She clings to it, her only protection 
          now.

          Bella walks through the lobby, scanning for Jasper and Alice. 
          She spots them outside under the porte cacher, loading the 
          Mercedes, deep in a heated discussion. She slips out the 
          opposite door, rushes toward a Taxi and jumps in, closes the 
          door. The DRIVER is an elderly woman with a hacking COUGH. 
          
          
          BELLA

          8th and Palo Verde, please.
          
          
          The taxi pulls out. Bella watches the hotel disappear. Off

          Once again, we see the polished malls, the manicured cactus 
          gardens. All empty for the night. 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          
          
          But dying in the place of someone 
          I 
          
          
          love seems like a good way to go..

          131 EXT. MIMI'S SCHOOL OF DANCE - NIGHT 131
          
          
          Bella climbs out of the taxi. It pulls away, leaving her on the 
          curb facing the deserted building. Bella twirls her mother's
          ring around her finger, then reaches for the pepper spray.
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          
          
          I can't bring myself to regret the 
          
          
          decisions that brought me face to 
          
          
          face with death... they also 
          
          
          brought me to Edward.
          
          
          She slips the pepper spray into her jeans pocket. She wraps 
          her purse strap around her wrist. She takes a breath, 
          approaches the school. Peers in the windows. The blinds are 
          drawn. But from inside, we HEAR a faint sound..
          .
          
          
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          Bella? Bella? 
          
          
          It's time. Bella goes to the front door. It's unlocked.
          
          
          132 OMITTED 132
          
          
          133 INT. MIMI'S SCHOOL OF DANCE - STUDIO - NIGHT 133
          
          
          Bella cautiously enters this grand, empty room of mirrors. 
          A 
          ballet bar wraps around the walls -
          -
          
          
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          Bella, where are you? 
          
          
          Bella whirls, trying to find its source. She follows the sound to 
          a cleaning supply CLOSET. She throws open the door to FIND 
          -
          
          
          A T.V. - ON SCREEN A VIDEO PLAYS - Bella, age 7, hides in the 
          very closet the T.V. is in now. Little Bella looks up at us. 
          
          
          
          92.
          RENE (O.S.
          )
          Don't you want to dance, baby? 
          
          
          Little Bella shakes her head stubbornly. The frame jiggles 
          as Rene hands someone the camera. Rene, ten years younger, 
          appears on screen and kneels next to Bella.
          
          
          BELLA
          Everyone makes fun of me.
          
          
          RENE
          But you're a wonderful dancer.
          
          
          BELLA
          Mom, I suck. 
          
          
          LAUGHTER behind Bella. She spins, trying to locate James in 
          the mirrors. 
          
          
          JAMES
          That's my favorite part. Stubborn 
          child, weren't you?
          
          
          Bella's face flushes with rage... and relief. 
          
          
          BELLA
          She's not here.
          
          
          JAMES
          Sorry. But you really made it too easy.
          
          
          Visible in the mirror, he sighs, disappointed. Then he steps 
          up next to her and points a VIDEO CAMERA at Bella. 
          
          
          JAMES
          So to make things more entertaining, 
          I'm going to make a little film of our 
          time together. Borrowed this from 
          your house. Hope you don't mind. 
          
          
          (turns it on)
          And... action!
          
          
          Bella FLINGS her purse at him, and runs for the door.
          
          
          JAMES
          Excellent! An escape attempt.
          
          
          Suddenly, he's right behind her. She freezes. 
          
          
          JAMES
          It'll break Edward's little heart.
          
          
          He smells her hair. Touches her throat. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Edward has nothing to do with this.
          
          
          
          93.
          JAMES
          He will. His rage will make for 
          more interesting sport than his 
          feeble attempt to protect you.
          
          
          He's having too much fun to notice --the peppers spray in
          her hand. She spins around and sprays him. 
          
          
          Then she runs, as James REELS back briefly. But he leaps 
          over her and lands RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER. 
          
          
          Amused, he flings her across the floor like a bowling ball. 
          She SMASHES hard into a mirrored column. James captures it 
          on film. 
          
          
          JAMES
          Beautiful! Very visually dynamic. 
          I chose my stage well.
          
          
          He advances toward her.
          
          
          JAMES
          Still stubborn, aren't you? Is that 
          what makes you special? Because 
          frankly, I don't see it. 
          
          
          He inhales as if he can taste her already 
          -
          
          
          JAMES
          Too bad he didn't have the strength 
          to turn you. Instead, he kept you 
          this fragile little human. It's 
          cruel, really. 
          
          
          James flips on the camera, but the lens is coated with pepper 
          spray. He tries to wipe it off.
          
          
          JAMES
          Well done! You've succeeded in 
          annoying me.
          
          
          He STOMPS on her shin! HEAR her tibia SNAP! Bella SCREAMS in 
          agony. 
          
          
          JAMES
          Tell Edward how much it hurts. 
          
          
          Abruptly, the camera is in her face 
          -
          
          
          JAMES
          Tell him to avenge you.
          
          
          BELLA
          No! Edward, don't..
          . 
          
          
          
          94.
          James inhales as her blood pools. He leans in, hungry. Bella, 
          half-conscious, watches him turn the camera on his own face 
          -
          
          
          VIDEO CAMERA'S POV - ECU ON JAMES' FACE
          
          
          JAMES
          Cut! The end.
          
          
          Suddenly -- JAMES IS KNOCKED OUT OF FRAME! 
          
          
          He rises to find himself face to face with Edward. James 
          CHARGES Edward, forcing him up against a column. 
          
          
          JAMES
          You're alone... because you're 
          faster than the others. But not 
          stronger.
          
          
          James SMASHES Edward's face into the mirror until it cracks.
          
          
          EDWARD
          I'm strong enough to kill you.
          
          
          Edward FLINGS James backwards -- SMASHING through 
          a 
          freestanding mirror -- into the doorway. He scoops Bella up 
          and leaps toward the balcony exit door -- when suddenly he 
          and Bella are JERKED downward.
          
          
          James YANKS Edward violently onto the floor -- KNOCKING Bella 
          out of his arms -- as James FLINGS Edward up into the top 
          window -- EMBEDDING him in the casement and bricks. 
          
          
          James crouches beside Bella. He grabs her HAND 
          -
          
          
          Looking directly at Edward with a sinister grin -- he SINKS 
          HIS TEETH into Bella's hand! She SCREAMS in agony. 
          
          
          Edward's rage ERUPTS -- he climbs out of the window casement 
          and SUICIDE-DIVE-BOMBS James, savagely PLOWING him through 
          the floorboards.
          
          
          ON BELLA -- as the venom travels through her veins. 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - dark figures twist and fight, in and out of 
          focus. 
          
          
          Her eyes suddenly POP OPEN to see the EXPLOSIVE RAW REALITY 
          of James KICKING Edward, delivering death blows when -
          -
          
          
          Suddenly Edward's hand SHOOTS UP and GRABS James' ankle.
          Edward ROARS up to his feet and SWINGS James around like 
          a 
          baseball bat, SMASHING him into mirror after mirror. 
          
          
          James is battered, beaten. Bella moans -- and the sound of 
          her pain slices through Edward. In an animalistic fury, 
          Edward BITES OFF a piece of James' flesh ..
          .
          
          
          
          95.
          WHIP PAN from Bella's horrified face to DR. CULLEN --now
          standing beside Edward, placing a hand on his son's shoulder.
          
          
          Edward turns to see his father -- and EMMETT, JASPER, and 
          ALICE, dropping down from the balcony.
          
          
          Edward's expression changes --he realizes he's gone too far.
          He backs off as his siblings crouch into attack mode and 
          LUNGE at James like a pack of animals.
          
          
          Dr. Cullen rushes to the injured Bella who SCREAMS again in 
          pain. Edward dashes toward her -
          -
          
          
          BELLA'S POV -ON THE THREE CULLEN SIBLINGS, going in and out
          of focus... it almost looks like a tribal dance as they rip 
          out the floorboards and build a fire ... it's like a funeral
          pyre as they rip James apart, throwing limbs into the fire..
          . 
          
          
          BACK ON BELLA -- as Edward reaches her side. Dr. Cullen works 
          fast to assess her wounds, focusing on a massive bleed from her 
          leg. But clearly her hand hurts the most. She writhes in pain. 
          
          
          INTERCUT BELLA'S DISORIENTED POV WITH THE CHAOTIC REALITY:
          
          
          Dr. Cullen applies pressure to the gash on her thigh -
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Her femoral artery's been severed. 
          She's losing too much blood 
          -
          
          
          BELLA
          It's on fire! My hand!
          
          
          EDWARD
          Venom -
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          
          
           (working on Bella)
          
          
          You have to make a choice. Either 
          
          
          let the change happen 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          No!
          
          
          BELLA'S POV -ALICE appears behind Edward, fuzzy, indistinct.
          
          
          ALICE
          It's going to happen. I've seen it 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          It doesn't have to be that way.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Alice, find me a tourniquet. 
          A 
          rag, a shirt.
          
          
          
          96.
          Alice holds her nose and avoids the blood as she rips the 
          sleeve off her blouse and kneels to aid Dr. Cullen. 
          
          
          BELLA
          It's burning!
          
          
          EDWARD
          What's the other choice? You said 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          (to Alice)
          Tighter, above the knee 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          Carlisle.
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          You can try to suck the venom out. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          I -- won't be able to stop 
          -
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Find the will to stop. But choose, 
          she only has minutes left.
          
          
          Edward looks down at Bella, thrashing in pain. Finally, 
          Edward takes her hand. She tries to pull it away.
          
          
          EDWARD
          It's alright, Bella. I'll make it 
          go away. 
          
          
          He looks at her - then starts to suck the venom from her 
          hand. They never take their eyes off one another, the 
          connection palpable, intense..
          . 
          
          
          CLOSE ON BELLA'S EYES -wild with pain. But subsiding..
          .
          
          
          CLOSE ON EDWARD'S EYES -the frenzy has begun. He sucks
          harder. Hungrily. Anguished, he wants to stop but can't. 
          Dr. Cullen's voice sounds miles away..
          .
          
          
          DR. CULLEN
          Stop. Her blood is clean, you're 
          killing her.
          
          
          -- but the bloodlust is too strong. He is killing her. Bella 
          looks at him, forgivingly, as she begins to lose consciousness..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA'S POV -ON EDWARD -growing blurry... he disappears
          into the blinding light. It's as if she's underwater, like
          her dreams..
          . 
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.
          )
          Death is peaceful. Easy.
          
          
          
          97.
          Bella starts to float away... we're losing her..
          .
          Suddenly from the darkness, Edward reaches out a hand..
          .
          A brilliant light flares..
          .
          
          
          134 BELLA'S FACE APPEARS IN THE WHITENESS
          Eyes closed. But they slowly open. She squints at the light. 
          BELLA
          Life... is harder..
          . 
          An oxygen tube rests under her nose. She reaches for it, 
          confused. A hand stops her as her surroundings come into focus.

          Bella lies in a hospital bed. Bandaged, leg in a cast. In bad 
          
          
          shape. Rene hovers over her, tears in her eyes. On the dresser, 

          SEE get well cards and a PHOTO MONTAGE of her friends from Forks.
          BELLA
          Edward? Where's -
          RENE
          He's asleep.
          She nods across the room to a chair in which Edward sleeps.
          
          
          
          RENE
          He never leaves. And your dad's 
          down in the cafeteria. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What... happened?
          
          
          RENE
          Baby, you fell down two flights of 
          stairs and through a window. 
          
          
          Bella is drawing a blank, confused. Rene jogs her memory 
          -
          RENE
          Edward came here to convince you to 
          come back to Forks. His father 
          brought him down. You went to their 
          hotel but you tripped on the stairs. 
          A moment... then Bella realizes it's a cover story. She nods.
          BELLA
          Sounds like me.
          
          
          
          98.
          Rene's cell phone BEEPS. She opens it. Reads a text, starts
          typing in a reply.
          
          
          RENE
          It's Phil. He's worried about you.
          
          
          BELLA
          Mom, you're... texting.
          
          
          RENE
          
          
           (smiling)
          I told him to stay in Florida. The 
          Suns signed him! 
          
          
          BELLA
          That's great mom.
          
          
          RENE
          Jacksonville is always sunny and 
          you'll have your own bathroom..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          Mom, wait. I want to live in 
          Forks. I have Dad..
          . 
          
          
          (re: the get well cards)
          ... and friends..
          .
          
          
          RENE
          (re: Edward)
          And he's there. 
          
          
          Bella shrugs, conceding the truth.
          
          
          RENE
          Charlie doesn't like him. Blames 
          him for your leaving. 
          
          
          BELLA
          What do you think?
          
          
          RENE
          
          
          (lowering her voice)
          I think that boy is in love with 
          you.
          
          
          Bella smiles. Rene grins. Bella glances at Edward.
          
          
          BELLA
          Um, Mom, would you mind getting Dad? 
          I 
          want to talk to him. Apologize.
          
          
          RENE
          I'm sure he doesn't care about 
          that, Baby. But Ill go get him.
          
          
          
          99.
          Rene kisses Bella's forehead. Exits. Bella watches her go.
          The door shutting behind her. Bella turns back to find 
          Edward standing next to her with deep concern. Her eyes 
          well. He kisses her forehead soothingly. 
          
          
          BELLA
          Is James - did you -- 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD
          We took care of him. And the 
          woman, Victoria, she ran off.
          
          
          She closes her eyes with relief, then looks at him. 
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm alive because of you.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (darkens)
          You're in here because of me. 
          
          
          Her wounds cause him pain. He strokes her face.
          
          
          EDWARD
          The worst of it... was thinking 
          I 
          couldn't stop -
          
          BELLA
          But you did. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Bella, you should go to Jacksonville. 
          Where I can't hurt you anymore..
          .
          
          
          BELLA
          What? No! I want to be with you! 
          I 
          don't want 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (sitting next to her)
          Sssh. It's alright. I'm not going 
          anywhere. I'm right here..
          .
          
          
          He wraps an arm around her. As she curls up in his arms..
          . 
          
          
          DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          135 EXT. FORKS, WASHINGTON - LATE AFTERNOON 135
          
          
          An AERIAL SWEEP over the lush green forests. We're back in
          the misty, damp beauty of the Pacific Northwest..
          .
          
          
          
          100.
          136 EXT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEAUTIFUL LATE AFTERNOON 136
          
          
          At a picnic table, Charlie cleans a fish with a big knife. 
          Edward waits awkwardly near his Volvo, dressed in an elegant 
          suit. But even calm Edward is unnerved by Charlie's glare. The
          front door opens and they look up to see 
          -
          
          
          BELLA --framed in the doorway in a stunning long dress. Edward 
          is enchanted. Bella descends the steps with difficulty, due to 
          her LEG CAST. Charlie edges out Edward to help her down. 
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Alice lent me the dress. It was the 
          
          
          only thing that would fit over my 
          
          
          cast. Is it too... 
          ?
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          You're perfect... I'll take good 
          
          
          care of her, Chief. 
          
          
          CHARLIE
          Heard that before. 
          
          
          Edward moves to open the car door. Charlie holds Bella back.
          
          
          CHARLIE 
          (sotto)
          I put new pepper spray in your bag.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          Dad.
          
          
          CHARLIE
          ... and... you look beautiful.
          
          
          Father and daughter share a smile..
          .
          
          
          137 EXT./INT. MANSION, VIEW POINT INN - TWILIGHT 137
          
          
          Edward's Volvo pulls up to this lovely inn. He helps Bella
          out of the car, and begins to guide her through the dining 
          room. Mr. Molina and other teachers are there. We may 
          notice the back of a Redhead, mingling with the chaperones.
          
          
          BELLA
          
          
          I can't believe you're making me do 
          
          
          this.
          
          
          He just grins. Edward guides her around a corner to..
          .
          
          
          138 EXT. MANSION BACKYARD (CONTINUOUS) - TWILIGHT 138
          
          
          THE PROM - Monte Carlo style. Gaming tables and roulette 
          wheels. Guys in tuxes and girls in gowns gamble for prizes, 
          dance and socialize. 
          
          
          
          101.
          BELLA
          You really are trying to kill me.
          
          
          EDWARD
          Prom is an important rite of 
          passage. I don't want you to miss 
          anything. 
          
          
          She can't be mad at him, just shakes her head affectionately.
          They continue into the prom. Several heads turn. Bella sees 
          -
          
          
          THE DANCE FLOOR, where a gap has formed. In the middle, two 
          couples whirl gracefully. It's Alice and Jasper, Rosalie and 
          Emmett, looking absolutely stunning. 
          
          
          Rosalie glances over; indifference has replaced fury. But 
          Alice waves brightly. Bella returns it with a smile as we 
          hear a crossfade into the next track-
          
          
          BELLA'S POV -- THE DJ BOOTH 
          -
          
          
          It's Eric at the turntables, making the room bounce! Next to
          him, Angela wears the headphones, flipping through a stack of 
          vinyl. They nod at Bella -- she shoots them a smile when -
          -
          
          
          A FLASHBULB gets her attention 
          -
          
          
          BELLA'S POV - PHOTOGRAPHER'S STATION
          
          
          Mike and Jessica stand in front of an Aston Martin cut-out. 
          Bella catches their eye -- Mike does his best James Bond 
          impersonation. Jessica poses like Pussy Galore.
          
          
          Edward smirks, then turns to Bella 
          -
          
          
          EDWARD
          Shall we? 
          
          
          BELLA
          (laughs, then realizes)
          You're serious.
          
          
          He doesn't wait for an answer, more or less CARRIES her to
          the DANCE FLOOR -- then places her feet atop his own... and 
          starts to move. She actually begins to enjoy it.
          
          
          EDWARD
          See? You're dancing.
          
          
          BELLA
          At prom.
          
          
          As they dance, she feels his grace, his strength. Becomes 
          thoughtful. Finally, she looks at him.
          
          
          
          102.
          BELLA
          Edward... why did you save me?
          (off his questioning look)
          If you'd let the venom spread, 
          I could've been like you by now.
          
          
          EDWARD
          
          
          (stops, horrified)
          You don't know what you're saying. 
          You don't want this.
          
          
          BELLA
          I want you. Always.
          
          
          EDWARD
          (angry)
          I won't end your life for you. 
          
          
          He keeps dancing, slowly, hoping his was the last word.
          
          
          BELLA
          I'm dying anyway. Every minute, 
          I get closer, older 
          
          EDWARD
          That's how it's supposed to happen. 
          
          BELLA
          Not the way Alice saw it. 
          (off his sharp look)
          I heard her. She saw me like you. 
          
          EDWARD
          Her visions change, Bella. 
          
          BELLA
          Based on what someone decides. And 
          I've decided.
          
          
          He looks at her, angry. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          Is that what you dream about? 
          Becoming a monster? 
          
          
          BELLA
          I dream about being with you forever. 
          
          
          EDWARD
          You really want this?
          
          
          BELLA
          Yes.
          
          
          He lowers his lips to her neck. One bite is all it would take. 
          
          
          
          103.
          EDWARD
          You're ready right now?
          
          
          BELLA
          Yes.
          
          
          His lips hover over her skin, a long beat... then he presses his 
          lips to her throat. Not a bite. A kiss. He looks at her.
          
          
          EDWARD
          You're going to have a long and 
          happy life with me. Isn't that 
          enough?
          
          
          She looks at him... and finally smiles.
          
          
          BELLA
          For now.
          
          
          They WHIRL around, gliding on his grace, never looking away from 
          one another, as we CRANE UP on them, in each other's arms..
          .
          
          
          BELLA (V.O.)
          No one will surrender tonight. But 
          I won't give in. I know what I want.
          
          
          CONTINUE UP AND BACK on the dance floor. We realize ..
          
          ... someone's watching it, looking down from the window of 
          a second floor hotel room in the Inn. The MUSIC wafting up in 
          echoes. PULL BACK to REVEAL..
          
          VICTORIA, turning from the window. She's stylishly dressed
          now, but seething -- a low, sinister SNARL in the back of her 
          throat. PUSH IN FAST ON HER FACE, AND INTO HER BURGUNDY EYES 
          filled with vengeance as we 
          -
          
          
          SMASH TO BLACK.

A FULL MOON FILLS THE FRAME -- Luminous, tinged with gold.      
Slowly, a penumbral shadow begins to spread across the          
moon's surface, darkening it from left to right...

... until the moon is enveloped in shadow; a new moon...        
which disappears into the darkness.                             

OVER BLACK - A RUFFLED TULIP appears, isolated against the      
blackness.

reveal we're now in --                                          

EXT. FOREST - ECU ON THE TULIP - DAY                            

It's surrounded by the dark, lush, greenery of the forest       
floor.                                                          

                            BELLA (V.O.)
                "... Which, as they kiss, consume..."           

SUDDENLY A FOOT SLAMS DOWN next to the tulip, nearly            
crushing it. As the foot immediately lifts off again, it        
grazes the tulip, knocking its petals off --                    

ON THE RUNNING PAIR OF FEET                                     
They abruptly change direction. Race on. INCLUDE BELLA          
SWAN, desperately searching the woods -- SHORT, SURREAL CUTS    
of her frenetic quest --

                           BELLA
                Edward!

Ahead, through the darkness of the thick forest, she SEES       
SUNLIGHT; a clearing. She hurtles toward it --

EXT. MEADOW - DAY

                           BELLA
                Edward!

                                                             2.



-- as Bella bursts into the sunlight. It's the meadow where        
Edward revealed his skin in the sun. But he's not here now.        
Instead, Bella SEES --

ACROSS THE MEADOW -- AN OLD WOMAN, white hair framing her
withered face. Bella's eyes widen with surprise as she
recognizes --

                           BELLA
              ... Gran?

GRAN looks as surprised as Bella. Bella smiles and waves,
as does Gran. Bella starts toward her but --

                           EDWARD (O.S.)
              Bella...
She spins to the voice behind her to SEE --

EDWARD emerge from the forest, his alabaster skin in sharp         
contrast to the shadows. She beams at him, relieved, in
love... until he moves to edge of the shade, inches from
sun's rays --                                                      

                          BELLA
              Stop - she'll see!

But Edward just smiles and steps into the sunlight.                
Sunbeams SHATTER off his skin like a thousand rainbow              
shards, as if he were made of diamonds. An awesome sight.

JUMP CUT TO: Edward now inches from Bella, still glistening,
entrancing her. She wraps an arm around his waist, then
arranges her face into a calm expression. They turn to --          

Gran, whose expression is calm, too. Gran's arm is
extended, as if she also holds someone.
JUMP CUT TO: Bella and Edward, only feet from Gran now.
Bella's about to present Edward, but then SEES that --

Gran mimics Bella's movement exactly. With growing horror,
Bella reaches out to Gran... and touches glass!                    

PULL BACK TO FIND Gran is now surrounded by a GILDED FRAME.        
It's a MIRROR, mounted on a wall with wallpaper reflecting a       
surreal dreamlike version of the forest behind Bella.              

                           BELLA
              Oh my God.

-- as she realizes that's not Gran; it's Bella, sixty-five         
years older.

                                                            3.


Bella spins to her perfect, eternally 17-year-old Edward.
He takes her now WRINKLED, age-spotted hand. Kisses it.

Then he leans in very close to her 83-YEAR-OLD FACE and           
whispers into her ear --                                          

                          EDWARD
              Happy birthday.

                                                  SMASH TO:       

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

ON BELLA - her eyes snap open. She lies atop her bed. A
book, "ROMEO AND JULIET," lays open on her chest. Bella
sits up, the dream still weighing on her...
INCLUDE HER ROOM, cluttered with pictures of Edward, of the       
Cullens; memorabilia of all things Edward. A KNOCK on the
door. CHIEF CHARLIE SWAN enters carrying two gifts, one
wrapped, one not.

                          CHARLIE
              Happy birthday, Bells.

                          BELLA
              Dad, we agreed, no gifts.

                          CHARLIE
              At least mine's not wrapped.

He hands it to her. It's a digital camera.   Bella's
pleased, despite herself.

                          BELLA
              Okay, this is actually kind of great.
              Thanks, Dad.

                          CHARLIE
                   (re: wrapped gift)
              Goes with this one from your mom. We
              coordinated - well, she coordinated
              me.

Bella opens the wrapped gift to reveal a SCRAPBOOK.

                          CHARLIE
              To put your pictures in, record your
              senior year -- man, senior year.
              How'd you get so old so fast?

                          BELLA
              Not that old.

                                                           4.



                          CHARLIE
              I don't know. Is that a wrinkle?

Bella races to the mirror, searches her face.

                          CHARLIE
              I was kidding.

                          BELLA
              So not funny, Dad.

EXT. FORKS HIGHWAY - DAY

An AERIAL VIEW of this lush, green, overcast landscape; the
rainy world that is Forks. FIND Bella's old truck as it
lumbers down the two-lane highway...
                          BELLA (V.O.)
              It was just a dream... but also my
              worst nightmare.                                   

EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY

Bella climbs out of her truck, shouldering her book bag.
She looks around the parking lot, seeking Edward --              

                          MIKE (O.S.)
              Wherefore art thou, Bella?

She turns as MIKE, ERIC, ANGELA and JESSICA approach.

                          MIKE
              You finish the Shakespeare assignment?

                          JESSICA
              He means will you finish his
              assignment?
                          MIKE
              No, I don't -- okay I do.

                          BELLA
              I can help you with it -- but first --
                   (pulling out her camera)
              I need a picture. My mom's expecting
              a scrapbook full of memories.

                          ANGELA
                   (holds up her own camera)
              I take `em, I don't pose for `em.

                          BELLA
              You do today.                                      

                                                          5.



She pushes Angela to the others; they arrange themselves --     

                          JESSICA
              You'll photoshop my nose if it looks              
              big, right?                                       

                          ERIC
              Don't worry, I'm in the picture; no
              one will be looking at you guys.

Jessica scoffs, Angela points her camera at Bella; Mike and
Eric joust -- Bella aims --                                     

FULL FRAME - THE CAMERA'S DIGITAL SCREEN                        

It FREEZES on them, fun, delightfully carefree... but when      
the camera lowers, their playfulness has dissipated as they     
see someone behind Bella. She turns to see --                   

EDWARD climbing out of his silver Volvo.

                         MIKE                                   
                   (dry)                                        
              Oh good. Cullen's here.                           

                            JESSICA                             
                      (drier)                                   
              Yay.                                              

The friends, uncomfortable, move off --

                          ERIC                                  
              Check ya later.

-- But Bella doesn't register their tone. She's transfixed      
by Edward who approaches, eyes never leaving hers. He           
reaches her, washing away all her concerns --
                          EDWARD
              Happy birthday.

-- except that one.    Her face falls.

                          BELLA
              Don't remind me.

                          EDWARD                                
              Your birth is definitely a day to                 
              celebrate.                                        

                            BELLA                               
              Not for me.                                       

                                                          6.



                          EDWARD                                
              Eighteen is a little early to be                  
              worrying about your age.

                          BELLA
              It's one year older than you.

                          EDWARD
              Bella, I'm ninety.

                          BELLA
              True. Maybe I should be creeped out               
              that I'm dating such an old guy.                  

                          EDWARD                                
                   (smiles, amused)                             
              Yes, it's the age that's creepy, not              
              the fact that you're dating a vampire.            

Then he kisses her, tenderly, adoringly. She kisses him         
back... despite their restraint, the passion mounts... until
he pulls away. As always, both are left wanting more.
Edward nods toward the school building --                       

                          EDWARD                                
              Class.                                            

                           BELLA                                
              Right.   Class.                                   

Catching their breath, they start toward school... but          
Edward stops, hearing something in his mind. Irritated.         

                          EDWARD                                
              Someone wants you.

                          JACOB (O.S.)
              Bella!
JACOB BLACK, 16, jogs up, carrying a used car part, long,
black ponytail wagging. He looks 18 due to his tall,
muscular body, but the gregarious Jacob is a little klutzy,     
still catching up to his growth spurt. He nods to Edward,
who moves off to the side but eyes them.

                          BELLA
              God, Jacob, what are they feeding you
              on that rez, steroids? You're huge.

                          JACOB
              Wouldn't seem so drastic if you came
              around more.

                                                            7.



                          BELLA
              I will, soon. But isn't your school,
              like, ten miles that way?

                          JACOB
                   (re: car part)
              Just here buying this for the Rabbit.
              I'm almost done with the rebuild.
              Gotta come take a ride when it's done.              
                   (as if remembering)
              Oh, and hey, happy birthday. Your dad
              told my dad. So...

He pulls from his coat a small woven DREAMCATCHER, feathers       
dangling from it. He hands it to her.
                          JACOB
              I saw it the other day and thought of
              you - it catches bad dreams.

                          BELLA
              This, I need. It's great.

                          EDWARD
              The bell's about to ring.

The bell RINGS. Jacob gives Edward an amiable smile, with         
just a hint of snark.                                             

                          JACOB                                   
              Ooh, look at you, all psychic.                      

                          EDWARD                                  
              I don't have that particular gift.                  
              But I can read a watch. I'm clever                  
              that way.                                           

They share a tight smile.   Bella intercedes, squeezing           
Jacob's arm.                                                      

                          BELLA
              Bye, Jake, and thank you.

Edward guides her away.   As they walk off --                     

                          EDWARD
              How come Jacob Black gets to give you
              a gift and I don't?

                          BELLA
              He's just a friend.

                                                          8.



                          EDWARD
              "Friends" don't spend two weeks
              looking for the perfect dreamcatcher.

                          BELLA
              Stop reading his mind if he bothers
              you so much.

                          EDWARD
              Little hard to tune out.

She just laughs, but Edward looks back at Jacob with
resentment. Jacob holds his gaze.

INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY
Edward and Bella enter the double doors -- suddenly a small,
wrapped gift appears in Bella's face. ALICE presents it.

                         ALICE
              Happy --

                         BELLA
              Shh!

-- Alice whispers in her ear as she hugs Bella --

                          ALICE
              -- birthday.

Over Alice's shoulder, Bella sees JASPER, keeping his
distance. He offers her a pleasant nod. She tries to hide       
Alice's present, hoping no one noticed --

                          BELLA
              Alice, didn't I say no gifts?                     

                          ALICE
              You did. I didn't. I've already seen
              you open it and guess what? You love
              it.

                          BELLA
              You had a vision about my birthday.

                          ALICE
              And about the green dress you'll be
              wearing to your party tonight. Great
              color on you.

                          BELLA                                 
              ... My party?                                     

                                                           9.



                             ALICE                               
              Please?     It'll be fun.                          

                          BELLA                                  
                   (beat, confused)                              
              I... guess I can deal --                           

                         ALICE                                   
                   (hurriedly)                                   
              -- Great! See ya at seven!                         

Alice hugs her again and races off before she can change her     
mind. Which is when Bella realizes --                            

                          BELLA                                  
              Wait, Jasper, no fair with the mood                
              control.                                           

He offers an apologetic bow before Alice drags him away.         

                            EDWARD                               
              Vampires.    You can't trust them.                 

                                                     CUT TO:

CLOSE ON A T.V. MONITOR - Zeffirelli's `68 "Romeo and
Juliet" plays. The suicide scene.

                          ROMEO
              Arms, take your last embrace, and
              lips, O you, the doors of breath, seal
              with a righteous kiss...

PULL BACK TO INCLUDE --

INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

The room is dark as we PAN OVER the class, some students
entertained, some moved, Mike trying not to fall asleep.
The teacher, MR. BERTY, mouths every word --

                          ROMEO
              Here's to my love!
                   (drinks)
              O true apothecary!    Thy drugs are quick.

FIND Edward and Bella in the back of the room, desks pushed
together, whisper-talking.

                          BELLA                                  
              I hate being... celebrated.                        

                                                            10.



                          EDWARD                                   
              Come on, the last real birthday any of               
              us had was Emmett's - I think Bing
              Crosby was on top of the charts.
                   (then)                                          
              You'll be helping us feel normal for a               
              night.                                               

Bella sits back, knowing she's trapped.    He kisses her hand.     

                          EDWARD                                   
              There are worse tragedies than a                     
              birthday. Look at Romeo. He's                        
              responsible for his wife's death. Who                
              could live with that?                                
                   (looks at the screen)                           
              ... Though I do envy him one thing.                  

                          BELLA
                   (blanches slightly)
              Juliet's alright... if you like that
              obviously beautiful sort of thing.

                          EDWARD
              Not the girl - the suicide.
                   (off her look)                                  
              Nearly impossible for my kind. But
              humans, a little poison, dagger to the
              heart. There are so many options.                    

                          BELLA
                   (appalled)
              Why would you even think about that?

He turns her wrist over, runs his hand over the horseshoe          
shaped SCAR on her forearm.                                        

                          EDWARD
                   (shrugs)                                        
              I considered it. Once.      When James               
              had you trapped.                                     

FLASHPOP TO "Twilight" - In the ballet studio, JAMES grabs         
Bella's arm and BITES --                                           

BACK ON EDWARD - pained.                                           

                          EDWARD
              I didn't know if I'd find you in time.
              If I'd gotten you killed --

                          BELLA
              It wouldn't have been your fault --

                                                         11.



                          EDWARD
              Either way, I had a plan.                          

                            BELLA                                
              What plan?                                         

                          EDWARD                                 
              There are... ways for us. At least                 
              one way. I would have gone to Italy,               
              provoked the Volturi...                            

                            BELLA                                
              The who?                                           

                          MR. BERTY                              
              Is there something you'd like to share             
              with the class, Edward?                            

                          EDWARD                                 
                   (politely)                                    
              Certainly not. But I apologize for                 
              being a distraction. Perhaps you                   
              should rewind to act five, scene one,              
              line twenty-eight eighty-nine --                   
                   (reciting)                                    
              "If you had the strength of twenty men             
              it would dispatch you straight."                   

Mr. Berty just looks at him, then moves off, intimidated --      

                          MR. BERTY                              
              Eyes on the screen, people.                        

Bella is too concerned to be amused.                             

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT                                        

Lights glow from inside the beautiful house.                     
                          EDWARD (O.S.)                          
              The Volturi are a very old, very                   
              powerful family...

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

ON AN 18TH CENTURY OIL PAINTING, depicting Grecian figures in
swirling robes writhing among pillars and balconies. In a
high balcony, FOUR CALM FIGURES look down upon the bacchanal;
two black haired, one snowy white, one golden haired...

                          EDWARD (O.S.)
              The closest thing my world has to
              royalty...

                                                           12.



INCLUDE -- Edward and Bella (now wearing a green dress).
She studies the painting - the largest on a wall crowded
with pictures. The other walls are towering bookshelves.

                          EDWARD
              Francesco Solimena painted this; he
              often depicted the Volturi as Gods.

Bella examines the golden haired "God."

                          BELLA
              Is that... Carlisle?                                

                          EDWARD
              Yes. He lived with them for a few                   
              decades. He describes them as very                  
              refined - for killers.

PUSH IN ON THE PAINTING, THE FOURSOME

Their features begin to fill in, become real - THEY COME TO
LIFE in the painting, turning to leave the balcony through
an archway. We FOLLOW THEM into --

INT. A CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL - DAY

It's centuries old, its marble cracked and weathered. The         
open oculus in the domed ceiling is the only source of            
light. The room is empty but for three large wooden chairs        
and half a dozen VAMPIRES in elegant 18th century attire.

                          EDWARD (V.O.)                           
              The Volturi are also what you might                 
              call enforcers.                                     

                         BELLA (V.O.)                             
              Of what?                                            
                          EDWARD (V.O.)                           
              The only rule they have: to keep                    
              secret the existence of our kind.                   

Two of the Volturi, MARCUS and CAIUS, take their seats,           
Carlisle stands beside them. ARO moves to the center of the       
room where we REVEAL --                                           

A ROGUE VAMPIRE is on his knees. He looks feral compared to       
the others, and terrified. Aro puts his hands on either           
side of the Rogue's face. Compassion?                             

                                                           13.



                          EDWARD (V.O.)
              We don't make spectacles of ourselves,
              or kill conspicuously, unless we want               
              to die.

Aro then slowly, dispassionately, RIPS THE ROGUE'S HEAD OFF.      
Two Volturi Guards (FELIX and DEMETRI) appear on either           
side, holding him down as Aro easily detaches the head and        
tosses it aside. Aro calmly sits as the others tear the           
Rogue limb from limb. Carlisle has to look away...                

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - CARLISLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

-- as Bella spins on Edward --

                          BELLA
              Don't even -- talk about that. You                  
              can't let anyone hurt you. The                      
              Volturi or anyone else.                             

                          EDWARD                                  
                   (sees she's worried)                           
              Who else would hurt me?                             

                          BELLA                                   
              You said there were more dangerous                  
              things out there than you. And I know
              you have at least one enemy --

OFF BELLA'S FACE - FLASHPOPS:

-- ON ALL THREE EVIL VAMPIRES, James, VICTORIA, the dread-        
locked LAURENT (from "Twilight")

-- CLOSE ON VICTORIA - fire-red hair, burgundy red eyes,
feral, vicious grin (from "Twilight")

                          BELLA (O.S.)
              You said she'd come after you for
              killing her mate.

BACK ON BELLA AND EDWARD

                          EDWARD
              Victoria? Yes, some day. But Alice                  
              will see her coming. And she won't win.

Bella looks up at him, pained.

                          BELLA
              I hate that I can't protect you.

He laughs, amused.   She's decidedly not.                         

                                                            14.



                           BELLA
               That was me being serious.

                           EDWARD
                    (kissing her face)
               I know. But you do protect me...                    
                    (kisses her nose)
               From boredom...                                     
                    (kisses her lips)
               And loneliness...                                   
                    (in between kisses)
               You give me a reason to stay... un-                 
               dead. But it's... my job; to protect                
               you...                                              

-- but he stops, smiles, hearing something in his mind --
                           EDWARD
               ... from everyone but my sister.

-- as the door bursts open and Alice dances in.

                           ALICE
               It's time it's time it's time!

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR LANDING - NIGHT

Alice tugs Bella and Edward to the top of the landing, then        
skips down the stairs. They look down into --

THE LIVING ROOM - Hundreds of pink candles and rose-filled
crystal bowls. ROSALIE, ESME, EMMETT, Carlisle, Jasper and
Alice look up at her, all of them stunningly beautiful.

Bella would love to disappear, but Edward leads her down to --

THE LIVING ROOM -- where Esme and Carlisle hug Bella warmly.
                           CARLISLE
               Sorry about all this.   We tried to
               rein Alice in.

                           ESME
               Like that's even possible.   Happy
               birthday, Bella.

FLASH!   Alice has snapped a picture of Bella with them.

                    (re: camera)
               Found it in your bag.   Mind?

Emmett moves to Edward's side.   Nudges him.

                                                              15.



                          EMMETT
              Dating an older woman.    Hot.

Bella caught that.    Edward elbows him sharply to shut up.

                           EMMETT
              What?

Rosalie steps up.    Shoves a silver package at Bella.

                          ROSALIE
              It's a necklace. Alice picked it out.

She walks away, bored. Bella has to smile.     She sees Jasper
across the room. They wave to each other.
                          ALICE
                   (aims the camera)
              Show me the love!

Edward pulls Bella into an embrace, they look deeply into
one another's eyes. FLASH!

                          ALICE
              For your scrapbook.    Now open your
              presents!

Alice drags Bella over to a table piled with elaborately             
wrapped gifts, a huge cake and a tall stack of china plates.

                          BELLA
              Alice, I'm the only one who even eats
              cake. That thing could feed fifty.

                          ALICE
              Hope you're hungry.    Here, this one's
              from Emmett.
The others crowd around... Jasper somewhat away. Bella, no
fan of being the center of attention, opens the gift to find
an empty car-radio box.

                          BELLA
              Um... thanks?

                          EMMETT
              Already installed it in your truck.

                          EDWARD
              Finally, a decent sound system in that
              piece of --

                                                            16.



                          BELLA
              No hating on the truck.     Thank you,               
              Emmett.

                           ALICE
              Open mine.

Alice hands her a box.   Bella starts to open it, but --

                          BELLA
              Ouch - paper cut.

CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGER - A single drop of deep red blood
appears.

Bella thinks little of it, but then HEARS a disturbing,            
grisly SNARL -- she looks up just as --                            

BELLA'S POV - JASPER lunges toward her!    Teeth bared, eyes       
beyond reason --                                                   

-- Edward FLINGS Bella behind his own body, causing her to
CRASH into the table, plates shattering as --

-- Jasper SLAMS into Edward; sounds like boulders colliding.

-- Edward pushes him, hard; Jasper SAILS backward, hitting         
the wall. But he RICOCHETS off it and comes back at Bella.         

-- Emmett and Carlisle TACKLE Jasper from the side, dragging       
him to the ground -- Alice helps hold him down --                  

                          ALICE
                   (soothingly)
              Jaz... shhh --

... But she stops, her head suddenly jerking toward Bella.
Then everybody's eyes snap toward Bella as they catch the
overwhelming scent --

ON BELLA - lying amid the shards of broken china. She looks
at her arm, seeing now - it's been slashed by plate shards;
bright red blood pulses out of her, pooling. She looks up --

BELLA'S POV - THE CULLENS (SLOW MOTION)

All of them now, including Edward (but not Carlisle) stare
down at her, at her blood, with fevered eyes. Six suddenly
ravenous vampires...

SLOW MOTION ABRUPTLY ENDS as -- Carlisle jumps to Bella's
side. Edward, though white as a bone, snaps out of it and
stands between her and the others.

                                                           17.



                          CARLISLE
              Emmett, get Jasper out of here.                     
                   (no response)
              Emmett.

Emmett reins himself in, elbows Rosalie. They drag the
snarling Jasper out. Esme holds her nose, politely exits
with the others. Alice looks at Bella, apologetic --              

                          ALICE                                   
              I'm sorry, I... can't...                            

She slips out the door.   Edward's still on guard as Carlisle     
examines Bella's arm.

                          CARLISLE
              I'll have to stitch this up.

                          EDWARD
              I'll carry her to the kitchen.

He moves to pick her up, but his eyes dart to the blood.

                          CARLISLE
              I'll take care of her, Edward.
                   (Edward doesn't move)
              Check on Jasper. Go.                                

Edward looks from him to Bella. Then steps back, allowing
Carlisle to lift Bella and carry her to the kitchen. But
just before the kitchen door closes, Bella sees Edward's
agonized face. He turns away, unable to meet her eyes...

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                               

Bella sits in a chair opposite Carlisle who mops up her           
blood as he removes glass shards from her arm. He drops one       
into a bowl; PLINK. She tries not to look at the blood.           
                          BELLA                                   
              I sure can kill a party.                            

                          CARLISLE                                
              It's not your fault. Jasper hasn't                  
              been away from human blood as long as               
              the rest of us.                                     

                          BELLA                                   
              Seems like you're the only one it                   
              doesn't effect.                                     

                          CARLISLE                                
              Centuries of practice.                              

                                                         18.



                          BELLA                                 
              Did you ever think of... living                   
              differently?                                      

                            CARLISLE                            
              I enjoy   my work too much. Helping               
              people,   saving lives. I'm hoping                
              there's   a point to my existence, even           
              if I am   damned.                                 

                            BELLA                               
              Damned?    You're not damned.                     

                          CARLISLE                              
              Then you and I agree. But Edward                  
              doesn't believe there's an afterlife              
              for our kind.                                     
                   (looking at her)                             
              He thinks we've lost our souls.                   

                          BELLA                                 
                   (realizing)                                  
              That's why he won't... He thinks he'd             
              be damning me.                                    

                          CARLISLE (CONT'D)                     
              If you believed as he did, would you              
              risk it?                                          

Off Bella, no, not ever...                                      

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT                                      

A large red bow hangs from the new stereo in the dashboard.     
Edward drives in silence. Bella studies him. Finally --         

                          BELLA                                 
              Say something.                                    
                          EDWARD                                
              What do you want me to say?                       

                          BELLA                                 
              That I'm a klutz. That I should have              
              been more careful --                              

                          EDWARD                                
              You got a paper cut. Normal people                
              get paper cuts. And a normal                      
              boyfriend wouldn't have flung you into            
              a stack of plates. A normal boyfriend             
              wouldn't have had to fight the urge to            
              kill you --                                       

                                                         19.



                           BELLA                                
              Stop.   I don't want normal, I want               
              you.                                              

Edward doesn't respond, just pulls the truck into --            

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE/INT. BELLA'S TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT      

The truck stops.   Beat.                                        

                          BELLA                                 
              You can't protect me from everything -            
              something's going to separate us --               
              accident, illness, old age... as long
              as I'm human...
                          EDWARD
                    (appalled)
              That's your solution?   My ending your            
              life?

                          BELLA
              Your giving me forever.                           

He faces forward again, jaw tight, mind working, tormented.     
She reaches for his hand --                                     

                          BELLA                                 
              Carlisle told me how you feel, about              
              my soul, but I don't believe that --              

-- he subtly moves his hand away from hers.                     

                          EDWARD                                
              You should go in. It's late.                      

He climbs out - instantly he's opening the passenger side       
door for her. She climbs out. He looks down at her face -       
he softens as he takes it in. Puts a hand on her cheek.         

                          BELLA                                 
              I'll leave my window open for you.

                          EDWARD
                   (quietly)                                    
              I won't be coming back.   Not tonight.            

                          BELLA                                 
              Then... can I ask for one thing?   It's           
              still my birthday.                                
                   (off his nod)                                
              Kiss me?                                          

                                                           20.



He lifts her face to his, and kisses her. He begins               
carefully, gently... but it changes, he becomes urgent, with      
an almost painful edge, as if it were goodbye.                    

Abruptly, he pulls away. With a last look, he turns walks         
off into the night. Off Bella...                                  

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ON A PHOTO - as a printer spits it out. It's the pic Alice
took of Bella and Edward's embrace. Bella, troubled, puts
it in her scrapbook, her bandaged finger running over it.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - ENGLISH CLASS - DAY

"Romeo and Juliet" lessons are on the board. Everyone's
scribbling essays. Bella glances at Edward's desk; empty --

FLASHPOP TO -- (previous scene in truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S          
EYES, hard, turning away from her...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY                                

Bella sits with Jessica, Angela, Eric and Mike. They joke,
throw things. Bella's distracted, looking-out for Edward.         

FLASHPOP TO -- (scene in the truck) ECU ON EDWARD'S HAND          
moving away from hers...

BACK ON BELLA'S WORRIED FACE, off which we go to --               

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        

PAN the photos on the wall. INCLUDE EDWARD who studies            
them, his expression grim. He looks down at Bella's               
SCRAPBOOK to SEE the photo of him and Bella. He pulls it          
out, takes a closer look...                                       
EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                          

ON BELLA THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD of her truck as she pulls         
into the driveway. She climbs out, heads toward the house         
but stops, relief washing over her --

                           BELLA
              Edward.   You're here.

He stands by the house. Bella hurries toward him, but slows
when she sees his cold, distant face; an unreadable mask.

                          EDWARD
              Walk with me?

                                                        21.



Edward gently takes her hand. Dread fills her, but she lets
him guide her toward the woods...

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Edward stops by a fallen tree.        Turns to Bella.

                          EDWARD
              We need to leave Forks.                          

                             BELLA                             
              What?   Why?                                     

                          EDWARD
              It's time. Carlisle's supposed to be             
              ten years older than he looks; people
              will start noticing.

                          BELLA
              But... when?

                             EDWARD
              Now.                                             

Bella reels, trying to take this in.       Finally --          

                          BELLA                                
              I'll have to think of something to               
              tell Charlie, but I can be ready --              

                           EDWARD                              
              Not you.   Us.                                   

                          BELLA                                
                   (stunned)
              What? -- no -- Edward, what happened             
              with Jasper - that was nothing.                  
                          EDWARD                               
              Nothing compared to what could happen.           
              You don't belong in my world.                    

                          BELLA
              -- I belong with you --

                          EDWARD
              -- You don't --

                          BELLA
              -- I'm coming --

                          EDWARD
              I don't want you to come!

                                                                22.



Bella is stung, as if slapped.

                          BELLA                                        
              You don't... want me.                                    

                          EDWARD                                       
              No.                                                      

She steps back.   Trying to understand this.                           

                          EDWARD                                       
              I'd like to ask one favor though.                        

                         BELLA                                         
                   (looks up, hopeful)                                 
              Anything.                                                
                          EDWARD                                       
              Don't do anything stupid or reckless --                  
              do you understand?                                       
                   (adding)                                            
              ... for Charlie's sake. Just... take                     
              care of yourself.                                        

                          BELLA                                        
              I... yes... I will.                                      

He softens ever-so-slightly.                                           

                          EDWARD                                       
              Don't worry. You're human. Time                          
              heals all wounds for your kind.
              Particularly if you're not reminded.                     

Desperation wells up in her, overwhelming dignity.                     

                          BELLA                                        
              No, this is - don't do this.     Please.                 
He sees she won't let go easily.    Takes a breath.       His face     
turns cold again.                                                      

                          EDWARD                                       
              Try to understand. Every second with                     
              you is about restraint. You're too                       
              fragile. I'm tired of pretending to                      
              be something I'm not. Reining myself                     
              in so I can be with a human.                             

                          BELLA                                        
              Then take my soul. I don't care!        I                
              don't want it without you --                             

                                                               23.



                          EDWARD                                      
                   (sharply)                                          
              -- You're not good for me, Bella.                       

Bella looks at him.   His hard face.   His resolve.                   

                          EDWARD                                      
              I've let it go on too long.     I'm
              sorry.                                                  

Tears sting Bella's eyes. This can't be happening. He
steps forward... kisses her forehead. She closes her eyes.

                          EDWARD
              I promise, it will be like I never                      
              existed. Goodbye, Bella.                                
And here, for the first time, we SEE how truly agonizing
this really is for Edward. But Bella doesn't see.                     

By the time she opens her eyes - he's gone.    She spins --           

                           BELLA
              -- Wait --

She SEES a LEAF FLITTERING to the ground where he grazed a            
branch; the only indication of his direction. She hurries             
down the path, then runs --                                           

                           BELLA
              Edward?!

-- and she keeps running, going deeper into the woods...

A SERIES OF QUICK, SURREAL SHOTS - TIME LAPSING

Bella runs through the woods, searching, reminiscent of her
opening dream. It gets darker and darker, until we're deep into  
night -- HEAR Bella's sharp desperate BREATHS --                 

BELLA TRIPS. Falls to the damp forest floor.        She looks up,     
the trees spinning around her...                                      

STAY ON BELLA - NIGHT - AS HOURS PASS                                 

She remains on the ground. Curls into a ball.       Darkness          
shrouding her. Devastation paralyzing her.                            

ECU ON HER FACE - numb. HEAR the faint sound of her name              
being called in the distance. A search party. She's too               
wrecked to respond.

Rain begins to pour; she doesn't register it....                      

                                                            24.



SERIES OF SCENES END ON -- BELLA, lying there, dazed. She
begins to HEAR an animal SNUFFLING. It gets closer. It
sounds large. Scary. Then she hears a whisper --

                          EDWARD (O.S.)
              Move, Bella.

She lifts her head, looks for Edward... but SEES something         
else instead --

BELLA'S POV - A DARK SHAPE, huge, black. Nearing. Its EYES
reflect light for a split second; they're inhuman, savage.

Bella, terrified, manages to DRAG herself to a cluster of
trees. She squeezes between them. Breathing hard. She
closes her eyes, trying to disappear...                            
INT. WOODS - LATER NIGHT                                           

Bella's eyes open to find herself FLOATING several feet
above the ground. Trees pass by. She's being carried...

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Half the town is gathered - a tired rescue party that
includes Mike Newton and Jacob Black.

Charlie, beside himself with worry, pores over a map with
BILLY BLACK (in wheelchair) and Quileute HARRY CLEARWATER,
46, (dark braids, stout, protruding belly, kind face).

                          CHARLIE
              I'll call the Cullens again. Her note
              said she and Edward went for a walk.

                          BILLY
              They left town, Charlie.
                          HARRY CLEARWATER
              Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big job
              somewhere else.

Harry puts a reassuring hand on Charlie's shoulder.                

                          HARRY CLEARWATER                         
              We'll find her, Charlie.                             

Charlie is glad for the comfort of his two friends.                

                           JACOB
              Charlie!                                             

Charlie spins to where Jacob points --

                                                          25.



THEIR POV - THE EDGE OF THE WOODS

SAM ULEY, 20, emerges, a tall, strong Quileute Indian with       
cropped hair and a fierce expression. He's carrying Bella.       

                          BILLY
              It's Sam Uley. He found her.

Charlie bolts to her; he's never moved faster in his life.
He wraps his arms around Bella, lifting her from Sam's arms.

                          CHARLIE
              Thank you, Sam. Thank God.

Charlie carries Bella to the house, cradling her. Harry and      
Billy give Sam a nod of praise and gratitude. But Sam backs      
away, avoiding any accolades.

ON JACOB - jogging alongside Charlie, peering at Bella with      
worry. Then Jacob slows, feeling eyes on his back... he          
turns to SEE Sam Uley staring at him. Jacob, uncomfortable,
quickly looks away.

ON CHARLIE CARRYING BELLA up the stairs to the house --          

                          CHARLIE
              What were you thinking, Baby?   Why
              were you out there?

                          BELLA
              He's... gone.                                      

Off her as Charlie carries her inside --                         

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     

OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE BED - Charlie lays Bella down and wraps     
her in blankets...                                               
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES ON BELLA                                   

She's curled in a fetal position in the middle of the bed.       
Then at its foot. Under the blankets. On top of them. In         
various different arrangements. Meanwhile...                     

A BLACK LIQUID begins to flood the floor, slowly swallowing      
everything in the room. It rises up the sides of the bed,        
higher and higher until it breaches the top of the bed and       
begins to engulf Bella. Off her, submerged in blackness...       

                                                           26.



EXT.   BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY - A MONTH LATER

The leaves have turned red and orange.    SEE a FIGURE in the     
upstairs window --                                                

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        

Bella sits in a rocking chair by the window. Her face             
blank. Empty. STAY ON BELLA, unchanging - but THROUGH THE         
WINDOW OUTSIDE, we SEE TIME LAPSING behind her --                 

OCTOBER -- Costumed kids appear in the yard, trick-or-            
treating. DISSOLVE INTO...                                        

NOVEMBER -- NEIGHBORS (BOB MARKS and his WIFE) bring Charlie
a turkey... they glance up at Bella's window with concern...      
WINTER BEGINS -- the trees' branches are now bare...              

DECEMBER -- Charlie drags a Christmas tree toward the house...    
worry has taken its toll on him. But Bella remains                
unchanged...                                                      

                           BELLA (V.O.)                           
               Dear Mom... I'm...
                    (beat)
               ... lost...

PAN the now blank walls of the exceedingly neat room; gone        
are all traces of Edward...

                           BELLA (V.O.)
               Edward took everything with him.
               Including my life. He promised it                  
               would be like he never existed...

... LAND ON the scrapbook which lies open; the photo of
Bella and Edward's embrace at the birthday party - gone.
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY

BELLA AT HER COMPUTER, typing an e-mail to Renee.

                           BELLA (V.O.)
               ... But I need to know he did.

A SERIES OF TABLEAUS, DISSOLVING INTO ONE ANOTHER:

-- INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Bella sits on the couch, blank, as the rain pounds.    Charlie
watches her, concerned.

                                                         27.



                          BELLA (V.O.)
              It's like a huge hole has been punched
              through my chest...

-- INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

In the darkness, Bella is curled up in a ball on her floor.     

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              But the pain is my only reminder that
              he was real... that they all were...

-- INT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

Lunch. Bella sits alone, staring straight ahead. SEE
Jessica, Eric, Angela and Mike, watching her with concern.
Talking about her. She doesn't notice.

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              I miss them. Especially Alice...

EXT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME - DAY

A one-story contemporary home, surrounded by snowy, barren
land and woods. Through a LARGE PICTURE WINDOW we SEE Alice
and Carlisle, arguing inside --

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              But I'm sure it's better for them, not
              having me around...

INT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME (CONTINOUS) - DAY

Alice faces off with Carlisle as the others watch on. Esme
desolate; Emmett blank. He sits next to Rosalie who seems
almost irritated. Jasper isolates himself in a corner.

                           CARLISLE
              No.   We promised Edward.

                          ALICE
              But she won't do well without us. I get           
              flashes of her, but they're unclear --            

                          ROSALIE
              Forget her, let's drag Edward home.               

                          ESME
              He'll come back when he's ready.                  
              After Bella moves on.                             

                                                            28.



                          CARLISLE                                 
              Yes. When she's living her life, safe                
              from danger --                                       

                          JASPER
                   (with self-contempt)
              You mean safe from us.

Alice wraps an arm around Jasper, soothingly.

                          ROSALIE
                   (pointedly to Alice)
              And when will that be?

                          EMMETT
              Can you see him, Alice?                              
They all turn to Alice... a beat. She closes her eyes,             
trying to get a lock on Edward -- PUSH IN ON ALICE as --

                          ALICE
              The only decision he's made...

                                                    SMASH TO:

EXT. SOUTH AMERICA - ANDES (ALICE'S VISION) - DAY                  

(Visuals are jumpy, unclear) START HIGH ON A MOUNTAINTOP in        
the middle of nowhere. SWOOP DOWN to its peak on which we          
find EDWARD. Standing still, face agonized.                        

                          ALICE (O.S.)                             
              ... is to be alone...                                

-- and suddenly, he starts running, like he's trying to            
outrun his memories, faster and faster -- he races toward a        
CLIFF; a RAVINE hundreds of feet below --                          
Edward doesn't slow, just blasts forward faster; then he           
LEAPS off the cliff, FLOATING, but the pain stays with him --      

ON EDWARD'S FEET landing hard on the other side of the             
ravine - as they hit ground we --                                  

                                                SMASH BACK TO:     

CLOSE ON BELLA'S FINGERS

-- as they hit computer keys --

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              Time passes. Every tick that goes
              by... aches...

                                                            29.



INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

INCLUDE BELLA'S COMPUTER SCREEN, as she types...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              Like the pulse of blood behind a bruise...

Bella stops. A beat as she stares at her own words.   Then
she hits "select all" and "delete" --

ON THE COMPUTER - A BLANK DOCUMENT. She types: "Hi Mom,
things are great, grades are up. Hanging with friends.
Stop worrying. I'm fine."

Bella presses "send", and the cheery e-mail disappears.
Bella rises, returns to her rocking chair, staring out             
desolately. PUSH PAST HER OUTSIDE...                               

AN UNKNOWN POV FROM THE WOODS - ON BELLA IN THE WINDOW

-- Someone's watching her, pacing menacingly, hungrily...

                                               DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella exits to find Charlie out by the street, stuffing
trash into the bins. He talks with neighbor, Bob Marks, who
also attends to his trash: two old, beat up motorcycles.           

                          CHARLIE
              It's about time you got rid of those,
              Bob. Seen one too many bikers smeared
              on the highway.

                          BOB
              Save the lecture, Chief. Soon as the
              garbage truck hauls `em off, you and
              my wife can rest easy.
                    (starts off, but stops)
              Oh, hey, what's the word on that bear                
              problem? Folks are saying they're                    
              huge.                                                

                          CHARLIE
                   (distracted)
              That's just... talk...                               

-- as Charlie watches Bella walk to her truck, head down.
Bob sees her, too --

                          BOB
              How you doin' there, Bella?

                                                            30.



Bella, in her own world, doesn't respond.   Bob gives Charlie
an understanding shrug and heads off.

ON BELLA as she opens her truck door.   Suddenly, it gets
slammed shut again by Charlie.

                              CHARLIE
               That's it.

                           BELLA
               That's what?

                           CHARLIE
               You're going to Jacksonville to live
               with your mother.
                              BELLA
               What?   Why?

                           CHARLIE
               I just - don't know what to do any                  
               more. You don't act like someone left               
               you; more like someone died.

She looks away.   That's how it feels to her.

                           BELLA
               I'm not leaving Forks.

                           CHARLIE
               Bells, the bastard's not coming back.

She nods.   Knows this all too well.                               

                           CHARLIE                                 
               It's not normal, this behavior. And                 
               frankly, it's scaring the hell outta
               me, and your mother.                                
                    (gentler)
               Go to Jacksonville, Baby. Make some
               new friends.

                           BELLA
               I like my old friends.

                           CHARLIE
               You never even see them anymore.

                           BELLA
               I do, too. In fact, I'm... um...
               Jessica and I are going to Port
               Angeles tomorrow. Shopping.

                                                          31.



                          CHARLIE
                   (suspicious)
              You hate shopping.

                          BELLA
              That's how good a friend I am.

                         CHARLIE
                   (somewhat appeased)
              Alright. Shopping.

                          BELLA (PRE-LAP)
              Hi Jessica, it's Bella...

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY
Bella drives, talking on her cell (hands-free, of course).

                          BELLA
              ... Yes, Bella Swan. Hey, any chance
              you feel like shopping tomorrow?

EXT. PORT ANGELES - MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT                        

Bella and Jessica exit the theater.   A MARQUEE behind them      
bears the title of a ZOMBIE film.                                

                          BELLA                                  
              I don't get why are there so many                  
              zombie movies.                                     

                          JESSICA                                
              It's, like, a metaphor? For crass                  
              consumerism or something.                          

Bella glances at her.                                            

                          JESSICA                                
              Not that you'd know anything about                 
              consuming. You didn't buy anything                 
              today.                                             

                          BELLA
              I bought something.

                          JESSICA
              Socks don't count. `Course, I was
              surprised you even called.

                          BELLA
              I've been kind of... out of it.

                                                            32.



                          JESSICA
              Kind of? I mean, at first I was
              worried. Then I'm like, okay, she's
              still bumming? It's not like I wasn't
              going through things, too. Like Mike
              deciding he wanted to "just be friends?"
              That was really hard and --

                          MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
              How `bout a ride, girls?

As Bella looks ACROSS THE STREET, time suddenly SLOWS --

BELLA'S POV - A DIVE BAR, "ONE EYED PETE'S" (SLOW MOTION)

-- FOUR ROUGH-LOOKING GUYS loiter out front next to their           
motorcycles. They're in shadow, we can't see their faces.

OFF BELLA WE SMASH TO --

FLASHPOPS: Bella surrounded by FOUR GUYS ("Twilight");
Edward's Volvo skidding to a stop; Edward staring them down --

BACK ON BELLA, a chill going down her spine, FREEZING her as
she stares at the foursome across the street...

Then suddenly -- a pair of lips lean next to her ear --

                          EDWARD (O.S.)
              Move, Bella.

She turns to find Edward standing next to her. Or so it
seems. But he's an illusion; an apparition - which becomes          
clear when --

Jessica steps right into him, dissolving him to nothingness, and
TIME ABRUPTLY SPEEDS UP AGAIN --
                           JESSICA
              Come on.

                          BELLA
              I know them... I think...                             

                          JESSICA
              Can we just go --

Jessica pulls at her arm, but Bella shakes her off.

                          BELLA
              I want to see something.

                                                             33.



Much to Jessica's frustration, Bella begins to cross the
street toward the Guys, frightened but drawn.

                          GUY #1
              Alright, we got a taker.

The apparition of EDWARD REAPPEARS in her path this time.           
She stops.

                          EDWARD
              Turn around, Bella.     This is                       
              dangerous.                                            

But when she steps backward, he fades. Testing her
hallucination, she strides forward again -- Edward's
apparition reappears, strides alongside her --
                             EDWARD
              Stop.   Now.

She's almost smiling as she reaches the Guys, finally able
to see them clearly -- and stops, realizing --

                          BELLA
              ... You're not them.                                  

And with that.... Edward disappears.

                          GUY #1
              We'll be whoever you want, honey.

Guy #2 pulls up right next to her on his motorcycle.

                          GUY #2
              Ready for a thrill ride?

GUY #2 extends his hand to help her onto the bike.     She          
hesitates.                                                          
                             EDWARD (O.S.)                          
              Walk away.     Go.                                    

Edward's apparition appears on the other side of the bike.          
Bella looks at him with determination -- then climbs on to          
the back of the bike --                                             

                          BELLA                                     
              I can break promises, too.                            

                         GUY #2                                     
                   (confused)                                       
              ... Okay.                                             

                                                              34.



                          JESSICA                                    
              Bella!

The bike LURCHES forward, going way too fast. As the wind            
blasts her hair back, she realizes this might have been a            
mistake --                                                           

                          BELLA                                      
              ... Wait                                               

Guy #2 doesn't hear her, guns the engine, going faster --            

BELLA'S POV - DIRECTLY AHEAD                                         

Edward stands in road, directly in their path, more present,         
more clear than ever. The bike's headlight illuminates him,          
racing toward him --                                                 

                          BELLA                                      
              Stop - stop! - STOP!                                   

The bike abruptly pulls up short.                                    

                          GUY #2                                     
              Hey, I didn't force nothing on you.                    

Bella scrambles off, stumbling in the process.    Edward is          
gone.                                                                

The four Guys then REV their bikes and PEEL out.    Bella            
watches them go as Jessica storms up.

                          JESSICA
              What the hell is wrong with you?!

                          BELLA
                   (almost to herself)
              I... saw something.                                    
                           JESSICA                                   
              You.   Are insane. Or suicidal.                        

                          BELLA                                      
                   (trying to figure it out)                         
              The more dangerous... the more real it                 
              was.                                                   

                          JESSICA
              So, what, you're like an adrenaline
              junky now? Go hang-gliding or bungie-
              jumping. Don't be a complete freak.

                                                            35.



An angry Jessica charges off. Bella watches the motorcycles
disappear down the street as --

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              He wasn't real. I knew that. I                       
              didn't care. I needed to see him. If                 
              danger's what it took, that's what I'd               
              find.                                                

Off Bella, determination settling into her face...

EXT. JACOB BLACK'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella pulls up in her truck, a tarp covering something big
in the back. Jacob comes out of the house. A huge grin.
                          JACOB
              Bella!

Bella hops out, Jacob gives her a hug.   Bella's surprised by
his affection, but doesn't mind.

                          JACOB
              `Bout time you came by.

                          BELLA
              I brought you something.

Bella pulls the tarp back, revealing - her neighbor's two
dilapidated, rusting MOTORCYCLES.

                          JACOB
              Scrap metal. You shouldn't have.

                          BELLA
              I rescued them from the dump. They'd
              cost more than they're worth to fix...
              unless one had a mechanic-type friend.
                          JACOB
              Me, being the mechanic-type friend?
                   (off her shrug)
              Since when are you into motorcycles?

                          BELLA
              Recently.

                          JACOB
                   (studying the bikes)
              The parts alone will be pricey.

                          BELLA
              I have a college fund I can dig into.

                                                            36.



                          JACOB
              Charlie's gonna love that.                           

                          BELLA
              Charlie won't know.                                  

                          JACOB
              Wow. Lying to Dad. Blowing through                   
              college money. Repairing dangerous                   
              machines - that I'm guessing you'll
              want to ride?

                          BELLA
              I really get it if you think this is
              stupid and reckless.
                          JACOB
              Oh it's totally stupid and reckless.
                   (leans closer, grins)                           
              When do we start?

Bella face spreads into something we haven't seen in a
while... a wide smile. As they pull the bikes off the
truck, they laugh and joke; it's as though Jacob has brought       
Bella back to life. But --

UNKNOWN POV - ON BELLA AND JACOB FROM A DISTANCE

-- someone's watching as the two of them wheel the bikes           
into the garage. REVERSE on the watcher to discover --

EXT. EDGE OF THE WOODS - SAM ULEY - SAME

Next to Sam stand two others, JARED, 17, and PAUL, 18. All
three have cropped hair, sleeveless shirts, cut-offs. It's
unsettling how they watch Bella and Jacob; the ferocity in
their eyes, the danger.
Sam turns; the others follow his lead. The three slink
soundlessly into the darkness of the woods...

                                                   SMASH TO:

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Two hikers, NATE and TIM, 20's, as they tromp through the
shadowy, mist-laden woods. Tim studies his IPhone GPS --

                          TIM
              We're going the wrong way.

                           NATE
              Who cares?   Enjoy the scenery.

                                                              37.



                           TIM
                    (slapping a mosquito)
               And the West Nile virus.

Tim hears a RUSTLE.    Stops.

                           TIM
               You hear that?

                           NATE
               If I knew you were such a wuss, I'd
               have brought my grandma.

                           TIM
               Could be one of those giant bears.
                           NATE
               There are no giant --

RUSTLE. Nate stops. Then, from the opposite direction,
another RUSTLE. Then another, and another, from behind,
from in front. It's either more than one creature or it's
moving with extraordinary speed. The guys are terrified.

                           TIM
               What the hell is that?!

                           NATE
               I don't know!

The guys, faced away from one another, search the trees.
STAY ON TIM as suddenly, there's an eerie SILENCE. Beat.

                           TIM
               Think it's gone?

No answer.   He turns to find that Nate has vanished.
                            TIM
               Nate?   Nate!?

Nothing... then the RUSTLING starts again.       And intensifies.

Tim BOLTS! CLOSE ON TIM - tearing through the woods, too
scared to feel the branches SMACK him in the face. Breath
ragged, he looks over his shoulder --

TIM'S POV - BEHIND HIM - something gives chase, flattening
foliage and bending thin trees in its path. Tim runs harder --  

TIM'S POV - UP AHEAD THROUGH THE TREES - THE HIGHWAY

A couple cars pass.    Civilization.   Safety.   Tim races for it --

                                                           38.



EXT. HIGHWAY (CONTINUOUS)

Tim bursts from the tree-line, he's almost to the pavement,       
he`s going to escape --                                           

BAM! Something YANKS him out of frame at an unnatural             
angle. His SCREAM is abruptly choked off, leaving nothing         
but a disturbing silence...                                       

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. JACOB'S GARAGE - ANOTHER DAY

Motorcycle parts are spread out on blankets.    Jacob moves
among them excitedly, piecing them together.    Bella watches.
                          BELLA
              If we're going to be working on this
              every day, we should probably include
              some homework. Don't want the Dads to
              think I'm a bad influence on you.

                          JACOB
              You influence me?     Please.

                          BELLA
              I am older than you.

                          JACOB
              Age ain't nothin' but a number.

                          BELLA
              And I convinced you to secretly build
              us two-wheeled death machines.

                          JACOB
                   (sudden mock-horror)
              God, you're right, you're like Satan --
                          QUIL (O.S.)
              Yo, Jake, you in there?

Bella abruptly sits up, starts to pull a tarp over the bikes.

                          JACOB
              It's cool, it's just my boys.

QUIL ATEARA and EMBRY CALL enter, both 16. Quil is short,
stocky and feisty, with short hair. Embry is tall, thin and
laid back, with chin-length black hair.

                          EMBRY
              Hey, Jake --

                                                               39.



They stop when they see Bella.        The two guys share a smile.

                          JACOB
              Hey. This is Bella.         Bella, that's
              Quil and Embry.

                          QUIL
              So the bike building story is true.

                          BELLA
              Taught him everything he knows.

                          QUIL
              What about the part where you're his                    
              girlfriend?                                             
                          BELLA
              Oh, we're just friends.

                              EMBRY                                   
              Ooh.    Burn.

                          JACOB
                   (scrambling)
              I said she's a girl and a friend.

                          QUIL
              Embry, you remember him making that
              distinction?

                              EMBRY
              Nope.

Bella rescues Jacob --

                          BELLA
              So I guess you guys have girlfriends.
                         JACOB
                   (laughs loudly)
              Right. Quil took his cousin to prom.

Embry chuckles, as well.

                          QUIL
              Yeah, that's still a riot. You want
              funny, Black? I'll give you funny.

Quil makes a run at him, he dodges; a playful scuffle ensues.
Embry, amused, saunters over to Bella.

                          EMBRY
              I got five bucks on Quil.

                                                           40.



                           BELLA
              You're on.

The scuffle continues.   Off Bella, enjoying them...

A SERIES OF SCENES...                                             

INT. JACOB'S GARAGE - OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL DAYS             

The bikes begin to take shape, the parts on the blanket thin      
out.                                                              

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              I never forgot my reason for doing                  
              what I was doing...                                 
Jacob clowns for Bella's amusement, pretends to skewer            
himself with a pipe. She laughs.                                  

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              But being with Jacob was a bigger perk              
              than I expected...                                  

He constantly touches her, playful, affectionate. It's            
effortless in contrast to Edward's intense restraint. We          
can see her spirits beginning to lift.                            

EXT. JACOB'S GARAGE - NIGHT                                       

Bella and Jacob exit, make their way across the yard to her       
truck. Bella seems lighter, happier than before.                  

                          JACOB
              Quil keeps asking to come over. I                   
              think he likes you a little too much.               

                          BELLA
              Tell him I'm not into the cougar                    
              thing.

                          JACOB
              What is it with you and age? I mean,                
              that Cullen guy was young, didn't seem              
              to... bother you.                                   

He instantly regrets saying Edward's name as he sees it           
crush her spirits. Off Bella, retreating into herself...          

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              Not even Jacob could keep away the                  
              nightmares...

                                                         41.



EXT. WOODS - NIGHT (NIGHTMARE)

Bella TEARS through the forest, searching desperately. Then
she turns -- finds Edward a few yards away, his face cold.      
She steps toward him -- but he BOLTS backward, suddenly
twenty yards away --

                           BELLA (V.O.)
               ... the terror, the loneliness.

-- he rapidly retreats further until he disappears, leaving
Bella utterly alone, darkness closing in on her...

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Bella SCREAMS in her sleep. The light turns on and Charlie      
hurries to her side, gently shaking her awake.                  

                           CHARLIE                              
               You're alright, Bells.   You're okay.            

Her eyes open, tears streaming down her cheeks. He doesn't      
quite know what to do, so hands her a glass of water from       
her bedside table. She sits up, sips. He pulls the              
dreamcatcher from her bedpost.                                  

                           CHARLIE                              
               This thing's not working very well.              

                           BELLA                                
               It's... not as bad as it was.                    

                           CHARLIE                              
               Yeah right.                                      
                    (beat)                                      
               I know what it's like, you know. When            
               your mom left me. I had a hell of a              
               time. Imagined doing all kinds of                
               crazy things, just to stop the pain.             

She avoids his look.                                            

                           CHARLIE                              
               But hanging out with Jacob seems to              
               help get your mind off... things.                

                           BELLA                                
               He's been keeping me afloat.                     

                           CHARLIE                              
               That's good. He's a good guy.                    

Off Bella...                                                    

                                                          42.



INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY                                         

Bella drives along the La Push cliffs. Jacob rides shotgun.
He studies a grease-blackened motorcycle crankshaft.

                          JACOB
              We got lucky at the dump. You know
              how much a new crankshaft goes for?

                          BELLA
              Sure, I spend all my free time on
              crankshaft-dot-com.

                          JACOB
              I think that's a porn site.
                   (then)                                        
              These bikes are gonna be rolling soon.             
              Where should we ride first?

                          BELLA                                  
              Someplace sunny.                                   

                          JACOB
              Like there's any place sunny around                
              here.                                              

                          BELLA
              I know a place above the cloud line --             

The second she says it, she regrets it -- off her --

FLASHPOP TO - THE MEADOW, Bella lying in the grass with          
Edward ("Twilight"), flowers surrounding them.                   

                          JACOB (O.S.)
              Where is it?

BACK ON BELLA - her face falls.
                          BELLA
              Actually, it's... too hard to get to.              

He brings his easy smile and optimism to the rescue.

                          JACOB
              So we'll find our sunny spot, right?               

She smiles, grateful. Then she looks out the window at the
cliffs... and notices --

                                                          43.



BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE BY THE CLIFF

FOUR MEN stand on the rocky ledge of the cliff (Sam, Jared,
Paul, and a fourth). They wear nothing but cut-off shorts.
They push each other, rough-housing.

                          BELLA
              Isn't that... Sam Uley?

                          JACOB
                   (bitter)                                      
              And his cult.

Suddenly, two of the guys throw a struggling Jared over the
cliff! BELLA SLAMS on the brakes. Jumps out of the truck --
Jacob climbs out after her --
                           BELLA
              Oh my God!   Stop them! --

EXT. LA PUSH CLIFFS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Bella runs toward them.   But Jacob's laughter slows her.

                          JACOB
              They're not really fighting, Bella.                
              They're cliff diving.

                          BELLA
              What, on purpose?

                          JACOB
              Scary as hell, but a total rush.

BELLA'S POV - A DIVER (Paul) takes a running start and           
FLINGS himself into the air, twisting and cartwheeling down.

Bella is intrigued, sees the potential for adrenaline - for      
Edward.                                                          

                          JACOB
              Most of us jump from lower down.

                          BELLA
              Think I could?

                          JACOB
              Man, first motorcycles, now cliff diving?

                          BELLA
              You said it was a rush.

                                                         44.



                          JACOB
              Maybe on a warmer day. And not from
              the top. We'll leave the showing off
              to Sam and his disciples.

There's that bitter edge again.   She looks at him.             

                          BELLA
              You don't like them.

                          JACOB
              They think they run this place.   Acting
              all bad ass, calling themselves
              "protectors."

                          BELLA
              What are they protecting?

                          JACOB
              The tribe, the land, their right to be
              jerks. Embry used to call them hall
              monitors on steroids; now look at him.

Bella looks closer, SEES the fourth guy is Embry, hair now
shorn, thin frame filled out, laid back expression gone. It
pains Jacob to see him.

                          BELLA
              That's Embry? I didn't recognize him.             
              What happened to him?                             

                          JACOB
              He missed some school - then, out of
              nowhere, he's following Sam around.
              Same thing happened with Paul and
              Jared. They weren't even friends, now
              Sam owns them.
                   (beat)                                       
              Sam keeps giving me this look, like               
              he's waiting for me or something; it's            
              kinda freaking me out.                            

                          BELLA
              Maybe you should just avoid them.

                          JACOB
              I try but...                                      

She sees he's unnerved, instinctively hugs him reassuringly.    

                           BELLA
              Hey.   If it gets worse, we'll go to my
              Dad.   Or you can come stay with us.

                                                         45.



                          JACOB
              Thanks.
                   (beat, holding her)
              If this is how you're going to react,
              I'll freak out more often.

Bella realizes she crossed a line and covers, playfully
shoving him. As they head to the truck, Bella looks back --

BELLA'S POV - ON SAM

-- but now he's looking directly at her. Then he turns and
DIVES over the edge, cutting a clean line into the water.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY
Bella carries her tray to an empty table, but looks over at
Mike, Angela, Jessica and Eric. Bella takes a breath, then
casually joins them. They take note, but keep talking.

                          JESSICA
              I'll kill Tyler if he gave me his flu.

                          ANGELA
              It's going around. My sister was so
              sick she couldn't come on our hike
              this weekend... so she didn't see it.

                          ERIC                                  
                   (sotto)                                      
              Ang, maybe you should keep that to                
              yourself --                                       

                          ANGELA                                
              We saw something, Eric.                           

                          ERIC                                  
              I believe you.                                    
                          JESSICA                               
              No he doesn't. He's just trying to                
              get lucky.                                        

                          ERIC                                  
                   (suddenly hopeful)                           
              Is that an option?                                

                          ANGELA                                
                   (ignoring him)                               
              It was jet black and huge; on all                 
              fours it was still taller than a                  
              person. A bear maybe.                             

                                                             46.



                             JESSICA                                
                 Or Big Foot.                                       

                             MIKE                                   
                 Or an alien. Lucky you didn't get                  
                 probed.

                             ANGELA
                      (quietly)                                     
                 ... We saw it.

She's serious.    And a little scared.   Bella see that.            

                             BELLA
                 You're not the only one.
Everyone stares.    Did Bella just speak?

                             BELLA
                 My dad's been getting reports at the
                 sheriff's station. A couple hikers
                 went missing. People are scared.

Now everyone's chilled.

                             MIKE
                 I did hear some guy talking about it
                 at the store.                                      

                             ERIC                                   
                 Last time you clowns doubt my                      
                 girlfriend.                                        

As they continue, Angela mouths "thanks" to Bella. They             
share a smile and join in, Bella becoming part of the group.

                                                        CUT TO:
ECU ON JACOB AND BELLA'S FACES

-- just inches apart.

                             JACOB
                 You look scared.

                            BELLA
                 I'm not.

She's lying. PULL BACK to see she's straddling the now
completed motorcycle. Jacob stands next to her, holding the
bike up. There's an intimacy to their proximity. INCLUDE --

                                                            47.



EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

The bike is aimed down a dirt road.     Jacob runs through the     
instructions:

                          JACOB
               Brake?
                    (she taps it)
               Clutch?
                    (she squeezes it)
               Right. Gas?
                    (she grips it)
               You ready?

Bella nods.   Jacob grins... then KICK-STARTS the bike.
                           JACOB
               Slowly... release the clutch.

She does... the bike moves forward an inch -- Jacob
cautiously steps back. She moves forward another inch --

                             EDWARD (O.S.)
               Stop.

Bella turns to find the apparition of EDWARD standing next
to her. Her hand slips off the clutch, the bike BUCKS and
falls on top of her. Jacob quickly lifts it off her as the         
apparition of Edward disappears.

                            JACOB
               You okay?   Bruises, breaks -- ?                    

                           BELLA
               I'm going again.

                           JACOB
               I'm not sure that's a good --
Bella quickly rises and hops back on.

                           JACOB
               Guess we're going again. Now what are
               you going to do with the clutch?

                             BELLA
               Release it.    Slowly.

Jacob nods. Then kick-starts the bike again. She releases
the clutch and moves forward. Slowly at first -- EDWARD
reappears at her side, glowering.

                                                          48.



She keeps going, a little faster. EDWARD appears on her left     
now; she passes him. He reappears ahead; she passes.

ON BELLA'S FACE as the wind flings her hair back. She
gathers speed... and for a moment, experiences pure freedom,
exhilaration... then she sees Edward standing at the curve
in the road ahead, and realizes --

                          BELLA
                   (yelling to Jacob)
              I don't -- how do I turn!?

                           JACOB
              Bank it!   Bank - hit the brake!

Jacob races toward her. She reaches the turn, doesn't bank,
goes straight... and flies right into a wall of trees.

As she lies on the ground dazed, Jacob hurries up.

                          JACOB
              What, are you training for the X-games?

She looks around for Edward.   He's gone.

                          BELLA
              I want to go again.

                          JACOB
              Forget it. I'm revoking your                       
              motorcycle privileges. Man, look at                
              your head.                                         

Indeed, blood drips down her forehead. He pulls off his          
shirt to mop it up. She shrinks away --                          

                          BELLA                                  
              God, I'm sorry.                                    
                          JACOB                                  
              You're apologizing for bleeding?                   

                          BELLA                                  
              It doesn't... bother you?

                          JACOB
              It's just blood, Bella.

He bends over her, carefully tending her head. She finds
herself looking at him. His dark eyes, his bare chest and        
smooth skin. He glances at her.                                  

                                                            49.



                          JACOB                                    
              What are you staring at?                             

                          BELLA                                    
              Just, you're actually... good looking.               

He's surprised; there's a moment between them.     He smiles.

                          JACOB
              How hard did you hit your head?                      

                          BELLA                                    
                   (realizing)                                     
              Oh I - yeah.                                         

He offers her a hand, helps her up.    She holds onto it,          
alarmed.                                                           

                          BELLA                                    
              Jake, you're hot.                                    

                          JACOB                                    
              Upgraded from good looking?                          

                          BELLA                                    
              No, temperature hot.                                 
                   (feels his forehead)                            
              You're burning up.                                   

                          JACOB                                    
              I feel fine.                                         

He takes her hand from his forehead.   Holds it.   She tries       
to pull it away.                                                   

                           JACOB                                   
              What?   I can't hold your hand?                      
                          BELLA                                    
              It just... means something else to you               
              than it does to me.                                  

                          JACOB                                    
              One, that's my problem. But two... we                
              have fun, you think I'm hot --                       

                          BELLA                                    
              Good looking.                                        

                          JACOB                                    
              I know you like me.                                  

                                                            50.



                          BELLA
              More than anyone.    But... that's all.

                          JACOB
              Because of Cullen?                                   

The name stings her.   He takes both her hands now.                

                          JACOB
              Look, I know what he did to you. I                   
              can see it in your face every time his               
              name comes up. But you need to know -                
              I would never, ever do that to you. I                
              promise I will never hurt you. You                   
              can count on me.                                     
                          BELLA
              I already do. You don't know how                     
              much. You're my best friend but... I                 
              don't think my feelings will change.                 

He takes this in, it's hard. A wave of something sweeps
over him. He sits back. Closes his eyes, takes a breath.

                          BELLA
              I'm sorry. I should've said something                
              right from the start --

                         JACOB
              No. That's not -- I just feel...                     
              weird.

                          BELLA                                    
              I told you, you have a fever.                        
              Probably that flu everyone has.                      

                          JACOB
              It doesn't... feel like flu.    I don't              
              know what it is.                                     

Off Jacob, rattled, and Bella, concerned...                        

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY                     

Bella does homework. Charlie watches a game.     She's on          
edge. Anxious. HEAR A BEEEEP --                                    

                          BELLA (O.S.)                             
              Hey Jake. Just checking to see how                   
              you're doing. And to say I'm sorry,                  
              about, you know... how I feel and...                 
              hope the flu passes fast. Call me.                   

                                                            51.



EXT. FORKS HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - ANOTHER DAY                 

Bella climbs out of her truck, SEES the empty spot where           
Edward used to park. SEES Eric and Angela canoodling.              
Couples everywhere. She puts her head down, hurries to             
class. BEEEEP --                                                   

                          BELLA (O.S.)                             
              Hi Jake. Your dad said you have mono.                
              He won't let me visit but... would you               
              call me?                                             

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                       

Bella paces her room, not wanting to sleep/dream.     She eyes     
the phone, waiting for it to ring. BEEEEP --                       
                           BELLA (O.S.)                            
              Me again.   I just... need to hear your              
              voice...                                             

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Bella's on the phone, leaving yet another message, her             
desperation having reached its peak. In the living room,           
Charlie and Harry check their fishing gear.                        

                           BELLA
              Jacob.   Please. Call me.                            

She hangs up, leans her forehead against the phone.     Charlie    
enters --                                                          

                          CHARLIE
              Harry and I will be back by three --

He stops when he sees her.   Puts a hand on her shoulder.          
                          CHARLIE
              It's mono, Bells.                                    

                          BELLA
              He's too sick to even call?                          

                          CHARLIE
              You just gotta wait it out.                          
                   (then)                                          
              You know, I don't have to go fishing...

                         BELLA
                   (forcing a smile)
              No, go. I'll call Jess or someone.                   

                                                            52.



                           CHARLIE
               Good. But stay here or at Jess's. No                
               hikes or anything. We're issuing a                  
               warning about those bears.                          

Off Bella's nod --                                                 

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY                                               

SERIES OF CUTS - Bella tries to navigate her way to the            
meadow. She refers to a map, a compass.                            

                           BELLA (V.O.)                            
               I was more afraid of the hole in my                 
               chest than I was of bears. Without                  
               Jacob, I needed Edward more than                    
               ever...                                             

Bella tries a trail; it doesn't look familiar.    Backtracks.      
Tries another.                                                     

                           BELLA (V.O.)                            
               ... I needed to know he existed.                    
               There was only one place I might find               
               him, or the feeling of him...                       

FLASHPOP - THE MEADOW - Edward and Bella lie in the grass          
surrounded by flowers, sunlight dappling them. They look           
lovingly into one another's eyes...                                

BACK ON BELLA - the memory and her desperation fuel her.           
Finally, she sees a clearing ahead, hurries toward it --           

EXT. THE MEADOW (CONTINUOUS) - DAY                                 

-- Bella steps into the clearing, hopeful... but her face          
falls. In contrast to the warmth of her memory, the meadow         
is cold, gloomy, cloudy. And no Edward. She closes her             
eyes, trying to force Edward here.                                 

Nothing.   Her eyes open on the empty, overcast meadow.            

Bella sinks to her knees. Tears threatening. But then she
hears a RUSTLING noise. She turns toward it, peers into the
woods.                                                             

Another RUSTLING NOISE comes from another part of the woods.
She spins toward it -- nothing. Then she turns and JUMPS
when she finds --

Vampire LAURENT standing just ten yards away.    Dreadlocks,
chiseled face. Bella can't believe it.                             

                                                         53.



                            BELLA
              Laurent?

                            LAURENT                             
              Bella.                                            

She beams, realizing he's real.                                 

                            BELLA                               
              Laurent!                                          

                          LAURENT
              I must admit, I didn't expect to find
              you here.

                          BELLA
              I live here. But you - I thought you              
              were in Alaska with Carlisle's friend.

                          LAURENT
              Tanya, I was. It was kind of him to
              arrange, given my association with
              James and Victoria, "The Enemy."

                          BELLA
              You tried to help us.                             

Laurent begins to stroll in a slow arc around her, his eyes
assessing her as --

                          LAURENT
              I went to visit the Cullens, but their
              house is empty. I'm surprised they
              left you behind. Weren't you sort of
              a pet of theirs?

Bella's smile falters, fear beginning to dawn on her.           
                          BELLA
              Um... something like that.                        

                          LAURENT
              Do the Cullens visit often?

Suddenly, EDWARD'S apparition appears between them.             

                            EDWARD
              Lie.

                            BELLA
              Absolutely.    All the time.

                                                           54.



                            EDWARD
              Lie better.

                          BELLA
              I'll tell them you stopped by.

Edward fades (throughout, he'll reappear when he speaks,
then fade again). Bella tries to look relaxed.

                          BELLA
              Will they be able to reach you in Alaska?

                          LAURENT
              I don't think so. Tanya's "vegetarian"
              family was pleasant enough. But the
              dietary restrictions were difficult -
              living on nothing but animals.

Suddenly, he's standing inches from her.   She now sees his
EYES. Dark blood-red.

                          LAURENT                                    
                   (conspiratorial)
              Tell me Bella. Do you ever feel                        
              compelled to... cheat?                                 

Bella involuntarily takes a step away from him.

                          LAURENT
              But that's not why I left. I came
              back here as a favor to Victoria.

                          BELLA
              ... You're still friends.

                          LAURENT
                   (shrugs)                                          
              More or less. She asked me to get the                  
              lay of the land with the Cullens.
              Because, well... I'm afraid Victoria                   
              is quite put out with you.

                          BELLA
              That's... too bad.

                          LAURENT
              Yes. She feels it's only fair to kill
              Edward's mate, given he killed hers.
              Eye for an eye, mate for a mate.

And now Bella knows.   Terror overwhelms her.   Edward appears --

                                                          55.



                          EDWARD
              Threaten him.

                          BELLA
              Edward will know who did it.   He'll
              come after both of you.

                          LAURENT
              I don't think he will. After all, how
              much could you mean to him if he left
              you here unprotected?
                   (then)
              Victoria sent me here for information.             
              She won't be happy about my killing                
              you.                                               
                          BELLA
              No, Laurent...

                          LAURENT                                
                   (sincere)                                     
              No, no, no. Don't be upset. I'm                    
              doing you a kindness. Victoria plans               
              on killing you slowly, painfully -
              whereas I'll make it very quick.
                   (inhaling)
              And you smell so... mouth watering.

He faces her, taking in her scent, bloodlust building.   Her
eyes dart around, escape is impossible --

The only thing she SEES is the apparition of Edward, looking
at her with alarm...                                             

                         BELLA                                   
                   (whispering, barely                           
                    audible)                                     
              Edward. I love you.                                
Laurent is milliseconds from biting - then abruptly, his         
expression changes. He sees something in the forest behind       
Bella - and it terrifies him.                                    

                          LAURENT
              I... don't believe it.

He steps back. Bella's confused as she realizes he's no
longer focused on her... she follows his eyes, slowly
turning... to find behind her --

AN ENORMOUS BLACK WOLF skulking out of the darkness of the       
woods. It stalks towards them, a low disturbing GROWL in
its throat, sharp teeth gleaming.

                                                            56.



Bella is trapped between the two killers.    Edward whispers
in her ear --

                           EDWARD
              Don't.   Move.

The wolf slinks closer to Bella, a mere twenty feet from where     
she stands, then --

FOUR MORE WOLVES soundlessly emerge from the trees, flanking
the black wolf. They're the size of small horses, all of
different hues: dark silver, chocolate, ash and russet-            
brown. Their hackles are up, lips curling, bodies crouched,
ready to spring.                                                   

Bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her. The RUSSET-  
BROWN WOLF is the closest and looks directly at her. Laurent    
continues to retreat - then suddenly, almost simultaneously --  

-- Laurent BOLTS across the meadow --                              

-- The wolves SPRING toward Bella -- and leap right over her
in pursuit of Laurent! Their thunderous SNARLS and SNAPS
shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire, surrounding        
him before he reaches the treeline --                              

Laurent SWINGS at the dark silver wolf, SMACKING the wolf          
half-way across the meadow. Another wolf lunges at Laurent -       
he kicks it and it sails into a tree, SPLINTERING it.              

The two wolves recover, lurch back to the pack which closes        
in on Laurent. It's impossible to know who will prevail --         

Bella doesn't stay to find out.     She RACES into the woods --    

EXT. WOODS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY                                      

-- Bella runs franticly, tearing down the hillside,                
tripping, quickly picking herself up -- running, running --        

EXT. WOODS/ROADSIDE - DAY                                          

-- Bella DASHES out of the treeline and to her truck parked        
on the shoulder. She jumps in, PEALS out --                        

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                           

Bella BURSTS in, out of breath. Charlie and Harry
Clearwater are washing their fishing gear. Charlie spins.

                           CHARLIE
              Bella?   What's wrong?

                                                           57.



                          BELLA
              They're not giant bears -- I saw them.
              Up in a meadow --                                   

                          CHARLIE
              Damn it, I told you not to go into the
              woods!

                          HARRY CLEARWATER
              What did you see, Bella?

                           BELLA
              Wolves.   They're wolves, Dad.

We might note, though they don't, that Harry Clearwater
sighs ever-so-slightly.                                           
                          BELLA
              Five of them. The size of - of cars.                
              I swear. They went after -- something -
              - and I ran.

Charlie grabs up the phone; as he dials --

                          CHARLIE
              Harry, can you get some men from the rez?

                           HARRY CLEARWATER
              Sure.   Yeah. I'll just --

Harry seems more concerned than gung-ho as he slips out.

                          CHARLIE
                   (into phone)
              Jerry? Put a hunting party together --
              tranq guns, large caliber shotguns --
              there's something dangerous out there.
                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              Something dangerous. Victoria.                      

Her eyes dart around the house, their vulnerability spinning      
in on her. As Charlie hangs up, goes to his gun cabinet --        

                          BELLA (V.O.)                            
              If she came after me, Charlie would                 
              try to protect me -- and he'd die.                  

                          CHARLIE                                 
              I've gotta go to the station.

                          BELLA                                   
              Good! -- That's good.                               

                                                            58.



                            CHARLIE                                
                You okay here? You want to come with?              

                            BELLA                                  
                Actually, I -- need to see a friend.               

EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE - DAY

Bella knocks.   Then knocks again.    Finally, Billy answers.

                             BELLA
                Hi, Billy.   I know Jacob's sick but --

                            BILLY
                He's out with friends.
                            BELLA
                      (taken aback)
                Oh.

                            BILLY
                I'll let him know you came by.

Billy starts to close the door, but Bella stops him.

                            BELLA
                Wait -- he's got mono, right?    That's
                what you told my dad.

                            BILLY
                     (with compassion)
                You should go on home, Bella.

And he closes the door.      Off Bella --

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - DAY

Bella climbs in, slams the door, pissed. Starts the truck.
Then turns it off. Deciding, she tosses the keys aside and         
sinks down into her seat to wait...

BELLA'S POV - EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE - ON THE WINDOW - LATER

RAIN now pours down. Billy, inside, pulls the curtain back,
looks out at Bella with sympathy. Then closes the curtain.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - ON BELLA - SAME

Bella looks out the passenger window at Billy. Suddenly,
there's a KNOCK at the driver's window. She spins to find --

JACOB standing there. But his face is shockingly different.
His hair is cropped short. No friendly smile.

                                                           59.


No warmth in his eyes. Just a hard, brooding resentment.
Bella is taken aback. She climbs out of the truck to FIND --

EXT. JACOB'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- behind Jacob stand Sam Uley, Jared, Paul and Embry.
They're oblivious to the rain, wear minimal clothes.              

                          BELLA
              You cut your hair.

                          JACOB
              Go away.

Jacob turns away. Sam leads the group toward the house.
Jacob follows. She, and we, note his sure-footed strides;         
his awkward growth spurt disappeared overnight. She grabs         
his arm.

                          BELLA
              What happened to you?

He stops, turns back. The others wait on the porch for him.
They're out of earshot, but won't leave him alone with her.

                          BELLA
                   (lowers her voice)
              I can help.

His face is hard as he shakes his head.   He's not talking.

                          BELLA
              Sam got to you. What did he do?

                          JACOB
              Sam's trying to help me, don't blame him.

                          BELLA
              Then who?
                          JACOB
                   (bitterness seething)
              How `bout those filthy, reeking
              bloodsuckers you love? The Cullens.                 

                          BELLA                                   
                   (thrown)                                       
              I... don't know what you're --                      

                          JACOB                                   
              You know exactly what I'm talking                   
              about.                                              

He's shaking, almost convulsing with anger.    She regroups.      

                                                            60.



                          BELLA                                    
              The Cullens are long gone.    How are                
              they to blame?                                       

                          JACOB                                    
              They started all this by existing.
              Goddamn leeches --

                           SAM                                     
              Jacob.

Jacob glances at Sam, who gives him a look.     Jacob takes a      
breath, trying to calm himself.                                    

                          JACOB
              I can't be friends with you anymore.
                          BELLA
              Jake, I know I hurt you. I should
              have been more up-front but -- I
              needed you, I still do. I don't know                 
              what that means yet, but if you give                 
              me time --                                           

                            JACOB
              Stop.    Don't. It's not you --                      

                          BELLA                                    
              -- "It's not you, it's me?"     God.                 

                           JACOB                                   
              It's true.   I'm not... good.                        

                          BELLA                                    
              You're wrong --                                      

                          JACOB                                    
              It doesn't matter.    This is over --                
                          BELLA
              I can't take losing my best friend, too.             

                          JACOB
              You already have --

                          BELLA
              Don't say that -- you promised --                    

                          JACOB
              Go home, Bella. Don't come back.

He practically runs away, joining the gang who all disappear
inside. Off Bella, standing in the rain...

                                                           61.



INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella enters, dripping wet, too listless to close the door.       
Charlie's face falls when he sees the pain and lifelessness       
returned to her. He grabs a blanket, wraps her in it.             

                          CHARLIE
              Billy called, said you and Jacob had a
              fight. But, hey, you guys will work
              it out, I'm sure of it.

                          BELLA
              I'm... going to change.

Bella heads upstairs.   Charlie sags, helpless.   He moves to     
the open door --                                                  
UNKNOWN POV - EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT             

-- It paces, watching Charlie slowly close the door...            

                                                    SMASH TO:

INT. FOREST - NIGHT

Bella TEARS through the forest again, searching. She turns --
finds Edward, cold, distant. But his face begins to MORPH...      

... and becomes Jacob's. She reaches for him but he BOLTS         
backward, suddenly many yards away.

                          BELLA
              Why!?                                               

He, too, retreats further, disappearing until Bella is alone.

BLACKNESS encroaches, the moonlight becoming a tiny
spotlight on her. She searches the dark - then SEES a pair
of EYES, female, blood-red - coming toward her; HEAR a loud
SCREECHING NOISE --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- Bella tosses herself awake, slowly realizing it was just
a dream. But she HEARS the SCREECHING noise again!                
Fingernails on her window. Bella bolts upright, looks
around for a weapon --

                         JACOB (O.S.)
                   (whisper shouting)
              Bella! Ouch - damn it; open the window.

Bella cautiously moves to her window to find --

                                                              62.



EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Jacob, shirtless, clings to the top of a tree which bends
with his weight. Bella opens the window, whisper-yelling --

                            BELLA
                What the hell are you doing?

                            JACOB
                Get out of the way.

He begins to swing his legs, increasing momentum.       She
realizes what he's about to attempt --

                              BELLA
                No!
He launches himself THROUGH the window with great agility --

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- Jacob lands on the balls of his feet. Bella is stunned.           
He freezes, listening for Charlie. Nothing. A bitter, self-
satisfied grin spreads on his face. It pisses Bella off.             
He takes in her room.                                                

                            JACOB                                    
                I pictured your room more...                         
                cluttered.                                           

                            BELLA                                    
                Why are you here?                                    

                            JACOB
                I had to talk to you.   Alone.

                            BELLA                                    
                To kick me in the gut again? It was                  
                bad before, but you made it so much                  
                worse.                                               

                            JACOB                                    
                I know. And I want to explain.                       
                But... I can't.

                              BELLA
                Then leave.                                          

He stays put.   She tries to push him but he's immoveable.           

                            BELLA                                    
                You're done with me, remember?   Get.                
                Out!                                                 

                                                           63.



                          JACOB                                   
              Bella, I literally can't explain...                 

She becomes aware of her hands on his bare skin and muscular      
chest. The intimacy of their touch. She pulls away.               

                          JACOB                                   
              I broke my promise not to hurt you, I               
              know. But I'm trying to keep it now.                
              I need you to understand... even if                 
              you don't want to see me when you find              
              out --                                              

                          BELLA
              Find what out?                                      
He starts to speak -- but can't.   It's agonizing.   She sees     
he's in pain. Is concerned.                                       

                          BELLA                                   
              What's wrong?                                       

                          JACOB                                   
              I can't do it.                                      

                          BELLA                                   
              Yes, you can. I'll help you. We                     
              can... we can leave. Leave home,                    
              leave Sam.                                          

                           JACOB                                  
              It's not something I can run away                   
              from.                                               
                    (then)                                        
              I would run with you though. If I                   
              could.                                              
                    (beat, realizing)                             
              Wait. Wait, I already -- I told you.                
              You know this -- you can guess.                     

                          BELLA                                   
              I don't want to play games with you --              

                          JACOB                                   
              You have to! I can't tell you, but if               
              you remember - it was that day I ran                
              into you at the beach. I told you a                 
              story -- come on! I told you a                      
              story... about?                                     

                          BELLA                                   
              ... about... "The Cold Ones?" You                   
              said it was a stupid tribal myth.                   

                                                           64.



                         JACOB                                    
                   (pointedly)                                    
              Was it? Are the Cold Ones a myth?                   

She doesn't answer.                                               

                          JACOB                                   
              What else did I say?                                

                          BELLA                                   
              That... the tribe made a treaty with                
              them. They can't come onto your land                
              and... I don't know, I don't remember.              

                            JACOB                                 
              Try, Bella.                                         
                          BELLA
              You have to give me more. Tell me                   
              where to look. Is there something I
              should see -- ?

                          JACOB
              No, that's too dangerous --

                          BELLA
              I'll take the risk.    Jacob, show me.              

He looks at her, doesn't want to but knows it's the only          
way. Beat.                                                        

                          JACOB
              Where was the last place you saw me...              
              the way I used to be?                               

                          BELLA
              The motorcycles - that clearing in the              
              woods.                                              
He nods slowly, then turns to go.    She stops him.               

                          BELLA                                   
              Don't go. There are dangerous things                
              out there; more than you know.                      

He looks at her with a wry smile. Then pulls her into a           
hug. Her cheek against his bare chest. She takes in the           
closeness... then he soundlessly heads out her door. A beat
-- Bella starts pulling on clothes.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Bella drives through the darkness.

                                                           65.



                          BELLA (V.O.)
              If I was going to lose someone else, I              
              needed to know why.

She pulls off the road, and drives into the forest.

EXT. LA PUSH - CLEARING IN THE FOREST - NIGHT

Bella parks. Climbs out of her truck. The moon eerily             
illuminates the clearing. Forest NOISES encroach.

She hears a RUSTLE amid the trees. Spooked, she freezes --        
then SEES JACOB emerge from the trees. A moment as their
eyes meet. Then --

Sam Uley, Paul, Embry and Jared step into the clearing, as        
well, half-clothed, movements almost synchronized. Their          
expressions simultaneously alter into fury when they see
Bella. Paul spins on Jacob.

                          PAUL
              What the hell have you done?!

                          JACOB
              I didn't tell her.   You'd know if I                
              did.                                                

                          PAUL
              She's here, isn't she?

                          SAM
              Bella, there's nothing to see here.
              You should go home.

                          BELLA
              Not until I know what you did to Jacob.

                          PAUL
                   (advancing on Bella)
              What we did?!

Jacob moves in front of Bella protectively, facing Paul.

                          SAM
              Both of you, calm down --

                          JACOB
              Sam, she knows things about the                     
              bloodsuckers. She's been on the                     
              inside. She can help --                             

                          PAUL
              Like a leech lover's gonna help us.

                                                          66.



                          JACOB
              Watch what you call her.

                          EMBRY
              Get a grip, guys --

But Paul and Jacob are so angry, their bodies begin to
shake, nearly convulse. It unnerves Bella --

                          BELLA
              It's alright, Jacob, I'll go --                     

Paul and Jacob are beyond hearing.                                

                          PAUL
              All you care about is her --
                          SAM
                   (commanding)
              Paul, back off.

                          PAUL
               -- and she doesn't give a crap about
              you --

Jacob flashes anger, PUSHES Paul, hard.   Paul FLIES backward.

                          SAM
              Jacob.

Paul rises, outraged, throws his head back in a growl,
vibrating violently --

                          JARED
              Too late.

                          SAM                                     
              Bella, get back!                                    
Paul FALLS FORWARD but halfway to the ground there's a loud
RIPPING noise and Paul explodes in silver-gray fur, becoming
a massive wolf crouched and ready to spring!

Bella, horrified, grabs Jacob's arm, pulling him --               

                          BELLA                                   
              Run, Jacob! --                                      

But he yanks away from her, runs directly at the Paul-wolf --     

                           BELLA                                  
              Jake, no!   Stop -- !                               

                                                              67.



Jacob DIVES headfirst into the air - with another sharp
TEARING sound, shreds of cloth blast into the air, fur
BURSTS from Jacob's skin - he lands on the ground a gigantic
russet-brown wolf, charging the Paul-wolf.                           

Bella reels as the two wolves CRASH into each other,                 
snarling and RAMMING one another. The sound is DEAFENING.
Their teeth flash at each other's throats.

Bella stumbles backward as the fight carries the two wolves          
beyond the clearing and into the woods --

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM, as they fight deeper and deeper into
the darkness... until they disappear. The horrible SOUNDS
of the fight still ECHO --
BACK IN THE CLEARING -- Sam starts after them, kicking off           
his shoes.

                          SAM
              Take Bella to Emily's place.

Sam disappears leaving an eerie quiet.    A long silence...

                          EMBRY
              Guess the wolf's out of the bag.

Off Bella, stunned.

EXT. LA PUSH - EMILY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Bella's truck, driven by Embry, pulls up to a tiny,                  
weathered house with a window box full of marigolds. Jared,          
in the back, jumps out, opens Bella's door. He and Embry             
head toward the house. She doesn't move.                             

                         EMBRY                                       
                   (to Jared)                                        
              Pay up. She didn't puke.                               

Jared, annoyed, hands Embry five bucks.                              

                          EMBRY                                      
              Told you she was tough.     She does run               
              with bloodsuckers.                                     

                          BELLA                                      
              Wait. We should go back, make sure                     
              Jacob's okay.                                          

                          JARED                                      
              I hope Paul gets some teeth in him.                    
              Serve him right.                                       

                                                             68.



                          EMBRY                                     
              No way. Jake's a natural. You see                     
              him phase on the fly? I gotta fiver                   
              says Paul doesn't touch him.                          

                            JARED                                   
              Easy money.    Paul's been at it longer.              

Bella looks at them, appalled.      They realize she's not          
following them.                                                     

                            EMBRY                                   
              Come on in.    We won't bite.                         

                          JARED                                     
              Speak for yourself.                                   
Bella warily climbs out of the car, joins them.     Embry           
pauses at the door --

                          EMBRY
              Oh, hey, about Emily - Sam's fiance -                 
              just try not to stare. It bugs Sam.                   

                          BELLA
              Why would I stare? --

-- But the guys are already entering --

INT. EMILY'S HOUSE (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella hesitantly enters behind Jared and Embry. She sees            
EMILY, 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin.
SEE only one side of Emily's beautiful face, draped by long
black hair.

                          EMILY
              You guys hungry? Like I have to ask...
Emily looks toward them now -- REVEALING the other side of
her face: A scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines
that pull down her eye and twist her mouth.

                            EMILY
              Who's this?                                           

As Jared and Embry beeline for the muffins --

                            JARED
              Bella Swan.    Who else?

                          EMILY
              So you're the vampire girl.

                                                         69.



                          BELLA                                 
              And you're a... you're all...                     

                          EMILY                                 
              Werewolves? I'm just engaged to one.              
              But these animals --                              
                   (slaps Embry's hand)                         
              Save some for your brothers.                      

Bella cautiously approaches the counter, keeping an eye on      
the door for Jacob.                                             

                          EMILY                                 
              Leave it to Jacob to get around Sam's
              gag order.
                          BELLA                                 
              He didn't say anything, or...                     
              couldn't.                                         

                          EMBRY                                 
              That's a wolf thing. Alpha's orders               
              get obeyed whether we want to or not --           

                          JARED                                 
              How `bout you shut up now, Embry?                 

                          EMBRY                                 
              You know Jacob's gonna fill her in.               

                          JARED                                 
              Yeah, I know every stupid thought he              
              has.                                              
                   (to Bella)                                   
              Wanna know what he thinks of you?                 

                          EMILY                                 
              Like you need special powers to know              
              that.                                             

                          EMBRY                                 
                   (to Bella)                                   
              It's another wolf thing. We hear each             
              other's thoughts. Good for hunting.               
              Embarrassing for everything else.                 

Jared leans to Bella, challenging.                              

                          JARED                                 
              Freaking out yet?                                 

                                                         70.



                          BELLA                                 
                   (meets his look)                             
              You're not the first -- mind reader               
              I've met.                                         

                          EMBRY                                 
                   (grins)                                      
              Jake's right. You are good with the               
              weird.                                            

                          BELLA                                 
              But I don't get -- how?   Why? --                 

                          SAM (O.S.)                            
              -- Because there are bad things here.             
She spins - Sam is now standing behind her, the front door      
open behind him.                                                

                          SAM                                   
              And they're getting worse.                        

Bella is chilled. Sam moves past her to Emily - the sight       
of her instantly warms his face.                                

                          SAM
              Hey, Em.

He kisses Emily's scarred face adoringly. Bella has to look     
away. Their utter devotion is a painful reminder of what
she has lost. Fortunately, she's distracted by --

Jacob and Paul's arrival. They laugh and jab one another.
Bella is relieved to find Jacob unscathed. Jared and Embry
crowd them, finding a scar on Paul's arm --

                           EMBRY
              Ha!   Pay up.
As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes       
find Bella's. He nods solemnly to the door; we should talk.     

EXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAWN

The sun is just beginning to rise, reddening the clouds         
overhead. Bella paces by the cliff's edge, trying to come       
to grips with this new reality. Jacob keeps his distance,       
trying to control his anger.                                    

                          BELLA                                 
              You just have to... stop.                         

                                                         71.



                          JACOB                                 
              It's not a life-style choice.   It's in           
              my DNA.                                           

                          BELLA                                 
              Killing is in your DNA?                           

                          JACOB                                 
              Man, I thought maybe you wouldn't be              
              such a hypocrite -- what, I'm not the             
              right kind of monster for you? Can't              
              measure up to your bloodsucking                   
              friends --                                        

                          BELLA                                 
                   (angry as well)                              
              Hey, they manage to survive without               
              hurting innocent people.                          

Jacob stops -- a beat as his anger is replaced by confusion.    

                          JACOB                                 
              Wait - innocent? -- so... you don't               
              care that I morph into a giant dog.               
              Just that I... kill people?                       

                          BELLA                                 
                   (appalled)                                   
              "Just?" Those hikers' lives mean that             
              little to you?                                    

He bursts out laughing.                                         

                         BELLA                                  
                   (repelled, turns to go)                      
              Oh my God.                                        

                          JACOB                                 
              Bella -- Bella wait...                            
                   (he stops her)                               
              We're not killing hikers.   We're                 
              trying to protect them.                           

                           BELLA                                
              From what?                                        

                          JACOB                                 
              The only thing we do kill: Vampires.

                         BELLA
                   (stunned, reels)
              Vampires? Jake, no --

                                                        72.



                          JACOB
                   (steps back, bitter)
              Don't worry, we can't touch your
              precious Cullens - unless they bite
              someone and violate the Treaty --

                          BELLA
              That's not what I -- you can't fight
              vampires. They're too dangerous.

                          JACOB
              Please. We took out that leech with
              the dreads easy enough.

                          BELLA                                
              You... killed Laurent?                           
                          JACOB                                
                   (worried)                                   
              ... He didn't seem like a friend.                

                            BELLA                              
              No, God no.    But... how?                       

                          JACOB
              It's what we do, why we exist. A few             
              "lucky guys" in the tribe have the               
              gene. If a bloodsucker moves to town,
              our DNA kicks in, we reach the right
              age and the fever hits --                        

                         BELLA
                   (realizing)
              "Mono."

                          JACOB
              I wish. Next thing I know, they're
              telling me, this is your life now. That
              future you saw for yourself? Gone.

Desolation fills him.   She sees this.

                          BELLA
              It's bad, huh?

                          JACOB
              I just hate feeling... out of control.
              Like maybe Sam is right; you shouldn't           
              be around me.

                          BELLA
              Like you could get rid of me.

                                                         73.



                          JACOB
              You've seen Emily.                                

That lands with her.   She nods.                                

                          JACOB                                 
              Sam lost it for a split second; Em was            
              standing too close -- he's still messed
              up about it.
                   (beat)                                       
              I don't want to be that kind of
              nightmare.

                          BELLA
              You're not like that. You save                    
              people, right? You saved me from                  
              Laurent.

                          JACOB
              Yeah, didn't mind taking him out. His             
              red-headed girlfriend will be fun,
              too.

Bella stops, chilled to the bone.

                             BELLA
              Victoria.     She's here?

                          JACOB
              We chased her all the way to the
              border the other night. But she won't
              stay gone. Keeps coming back -- if we
              knew what she was after...
                   (sees Bella's face)
              ... What?

                          BELLA
              I know what she wants.      Me.
                                                  SMASH TO:     

EXT. FOREST HIGHWAY - DAY                                       

A MASERATI with Canadian plates blasts down the highway at a    
blinding speed --

INT. MASERATI - SAME

CLOSE ON VICTORIA, easily controlling the steering wheel
with two fingers. She speaks to someone we don't see, her
words laced with longing and fury.

                                                            74.



                          VICTORIA
              James hated cars. He liked being
              close to the ground. But I'd steal                   
              one occasionally, to throw him off the
              scent... See, we played hide and seek
              sometimes. No one can hide like me --                
                   (grins to her passenger)
              -- but no one could seek like James.

INCLUDE her barely conscious passenger, DENISE, 30's, a
pretty bleach-blonde with expensive jewelry. She's just
coming to, a bump on her head where she was knocked out.

                          DENISE
              What -- what are you -- ?
                            VICTORIA
              Some games   lasted months... but we
              always got   hungry for each other.
                   (sly,   to Denise)
              So I'd let   him find me...

Denise now lucid, looks around to SEE --                           

IN THE BACK SEAT her husband, MICHAEL'S BODY, well-dressed
in a turtle neck, 40's, sits upright, his head tilted
forward as if he's resting. Denise reaches for him --

                            DENISE
              Michael?    Oh my God --

                          VICTORIA
              We never could get enough of each
              other...
                   (seething)
              We would have had forever to try.

Denise, scared, shakes Michael's arm --
                           DENISE
              Michael?!

-- which causes Michael's head to roll to the side,
revealing his gouged, blood-soaked neck and his vacant, dead
eyes. Denise starts SCREAMING. Victoria grins.

                          VICTORIA
              James always loved a screamer.

Victoria's hand jets out, grabbing a fistful of Denise's
hair. She yanks Denise over, exposing her neck just as we --

                                                     SMASH TO:

EXT. EMILY'S BACKYARD - DAY                                       

ON JARED --                                                       

                          JARED
              Excellent. If the redhead's after
              Bella, we've got bait.

With stunning speed, Jacob grabs a four-pronged spading fork
from some garden tools, and FLINGS it toward Jared's head -
Jared easily, and amazingly, catches it.

                          JACOB
              She is not bait.

INCLUDE - A picnic table in the middle of this small,             
quaintly landscaped garden. Jacob, Bella, Embry, Paul, Sam,
Jared and Emily are in the midst of a huge breakfast.

                          BELLA
              I should leave town.                                

                          SAM
              Victoria will follow you and make it                
              harder for us to catch her.

                          BELLA                                   
              No one can catch her.   She can escape              
              anything.                                           

                           PAUL                                   
              Ooh.   She has special powers.                      

                          BELLA                                   
              Some of them do.                                    

They all look at her.   She instantly regrets saying it.          
                          JACOB                                   
              Like... what? Bella?                                

                          JARED                                   
              The mind reader you said you knew. He               
              was a suckhead? Can they all do that?               

                          EMBRY                                   
              That would blow.                                    

                          BELLA                                   
              No, I -- shouldn't have - no.                       

                          PAUL                                    
              She's still protecting them.                        

                                                               76.



                           JARED                                      
               I don't know why. It's not like they                   
               stuck around to protect you --                         

                           JACOB                                      
               Guys, back off.                                        

Jacob looks apologetically at Bella.   She shrinks, stung.            

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                            

Jacob walks her to the door.                                          

                           JACOB                                      
               Don't worry, we've got this place                      
               covered. She won't get near you or                     
               Charlie.                                               

Bella nods.   He sees she's blue.                                     

                           JACOB                                      
               Hey, we should do something fun.                       
               Like... cliff diving, right?                           

                           BELLA                                      
               I could use the rush.                                  

                            JACOB                                     
               Soon.   After we catch her.                            

He offers a reassuring look before jogging into the woods.            

EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - NIGHT                                             

Bella tentatively approaches the large, modern glass home.            
She climbs the porch steps, approaches the door...                    

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT
Bella enters to find it perfectly intact, lived-in, warm,             
candles glowing... and the Cullen family enjoying the
evening - Carlisle, Esme, Rosalie, Emmett and Jasper.                 

Bella is overwhelmed with joy at seeing them.                         

                           BELLA                                      
               You're here.                                           

But they ignore her. Won't even look at her.      She starts          
toward them but suddenly --                                           

Edward appears and YANKS Bella away, pulling her to the door          
and pushing her out, slamming it on her --                            

                                                           77.



EXT. CULLEN HOUSE - (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT                          

-- Bella runs to the window, peers in at the family who           
continue to ignore her as they gather around Edward --            

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - MORNING                                       

Bella awakens, tears on her face. She can't take it. Gets         
the hell out of bed, anxious to leave the dream behind. But       
it stays with her...                                              

EXT. EMILY'S HOUSE - DAY                                          

Bella knocks on the door, rain falling around her, wind           
blowing strong. Emily opens the door. Sees her.                   
                           EMILY                                  
              Bella.   Are you okay?                              

                          BELLA                                   
              Yeah, I just... is Jacob here?   He                 
              wasn't at home...                                   

Sam appears behind Emily.                                         

                          SAM                                     
              He's with Jared and Embry, keeping an               
              eye on things. I'm heading out soon.                
              Should I tell him something?                        

-- as Sam wraps an arm around Emily. Their deep love is           
achingly obvious. Off Bella's face --                             

FLASHPOP to Bella and Edward at her birthday party, in a          
similar embrace, as Alice SNAPS their picture --                  

BACK ON BELLA - pained.                                           
                          EMILY                                   
              You want to come in?                                

-- But Bella's already hurrying to her truck, determination       
on her face.

CLOSE ON A RIFLE as it locks and loads. INCLUDE CHARLIE,
who checks it, then notes the position of the SIX MEN in his
hunting party, all wearing rain gear. He SEES Harry at the
end of the line, pausing, looking down.

                          CHARLIE
              You got something, Harry?

                                                           78.



ON HARRY - he looks down at a large WOLF PAW PRINT.

                          HARRY CLEARWATER
              Nope, nothin'.

The hunting party moves forward.   Harry lets them get ahead,
stomps out the paw print.

ON CHARLIE as he passes under a huge tree --

WHIP PAN UP THE TREE to find that HIGH ABOVE, crouching on a
limb, is VICTORIA. She watches Charlie with a vengeful glare.

She noiselessly SWINGS down to a lower branch, getting ready
to pounce on Charlie --
ON HARRY - his eye catches her movement; he looks up, SEES
the back of her red head -- his breath CATCHES --

She HEARS the sound, even through the rain and wind.    Before    
Harry can raise his shotgun --

Victoria's standing next to him, WHIPPING the gun out of his      
hands with superhuman speed. He GASPS, breath stuck in his        
chest. She grins, about to bite -- but suddenly --                

THE RUSSET-BROWN JACOB-WOLF smashes into her, knocking her        
away. She rights herself immediately and takes off --             

THE THREE WOLVES give chase, disappearing. It all happened        
soundlessly, in seconds, unbeknownst to the others...

STAY ON HARRY - he still can't catch his breath, IN SLOW
MOTION he clasps his left arm -- INTERCUT WITH --

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE WOODS - SAME

LIGHTNING FAST CUTS of THE CHASE - the wolves are right on
Victoria's tail, blasting through the forest --

BACK ON CHARLIE - SLOW MOTION - He turns to SEE Harry
clutching his chest. Charlie runs to Harry's side --

SMASH BACK TO VICTORIA escaping at breakneck speed she
bursts out of the trees to --                                     

EXT. THE OCEAN (CONTINUOUS) - SAME

-- Victoria beelines for the choppy water, dives in -- when
she reappears, she's hundreds of yards offshore --

THE WOLVES prowl the beach in frustration as we go --

                                                              79.



BACK ON HARRY - SLOW MOTION - he falls to his knees just as
Charlie reaches him. Off Charlie beginning CPR...

                                                     SMASH TO:

EXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAY

Bella's truck comes to a stop; she climbs out. Ignoring the
wind and rain, she strides to the cliff's edge; looks down --

BELLA'S POV - THE WATER - steely gray.     Rough whitecaps.

                           EDWARD (O.S.)                             
              Step back.                                             

Bella smiles, tears of relief springing to her eyes.    She          
turns to find Edward's apparition at her side.                       

She steps back from the cliff's edge - which causes him to           
disappear.                                                           

That's it. She starts pulling off her shoes and coat,                
adrenaline pumping --                                                

Edward's apparition reappears, but she keeps going --                

                          EDWARD                                     
              Stop this now, Bella.                                  

                          BELLA                                      
              You won't stay with me any other way.                  

She takes a last look at him... then with a running leap --          
FLINGS herself over the edge --                                      

ON BELLA SCREAMING with exhilaration as she plummets down,           
down... then SPLASHES into the water.                                
EXT. ON THE WATER'S SURFACE (CONTINUOUS) - DAY                       

No sign of Bella. A beat. Suddenly, she POPS back up.
Inhales deeply -- and laughs!

                           BELLA
              Yes!

She enjoys a moment of elation and empowerment... then turns
to swim ashore... but her smile falters when she realizes
how strong the current is...

A WAVE crashes over her head. She gasps for breath.     Then         
ANOTHER WAVE hits her. Starts to pull her under...

                                                           80.



UNDER THE WATER - Bella struggles --

ABOVE WATER - she pops up, looks around in a panic, SEES --

BELLA'S POV - IN THE DISTANCE - something orange-ish,
bobbing on the surface of the water --

Bella goes down - then comes up again - THE ORANGE-ISH thing
is suddenly thirty yards closer.

Bella struggles to stay afloat but the current SMASHES her
into a rock, the air goes out of her chest. She sinks.

ANGLE ON THE ORANGE-ISH THING -- IT'S VICTORIA, floating
effortlessly, hungry anticipation on her face. She dips
below the surface, vanishing...
UNDER THE WATER - BELLA SINKS, struggling at first... Edward      
appears in front of her, his eyes full of longing and love.
He reaches to her, she to him, hands almost touching, things
going dark... suddenly A HAND GRABS HER COLLAR --

                                                   SMASH TO:

EXT. BEACH - DAY

CLOSE ON BELLA - barely conscious.

                          JACOB
              Breathe, Bella! C'mon!

Jacob hits her on the back.   She spits up water, coming to.

                           JACOB
              Bella?   Can you hear me?

                          BELLA
              ... Jake?
She focuses, finally SEES Jacob hovering over her, relieved.
Behind him stands Sam.

                          SAM
              She'll be alright.

Sam looks out at the water, scanning it.   Sensing something.

                          JACOB
              What the hell were you thinking?

                          BELLA
              I needed... to see... something.

                                                         81.



                           JACOB
               What? The pearly gates?   If we hadn't
               heard you scream --

                           SAM
               Get her home. I'm heading to the                 
               hospital. I'll meet you there.                   

Jacob nods.   Sam jogs off.

                           JACOB
               Why would you jump? Didn't you notice
               it's like a hurricane out here?

                           BELLA
               I know. It was stupid --                         
                    (realizing)
               -- Sam said hospital - someone's hurt?

                           JACOB
               Harry Clearwater had a heart attack.

                           BELLA
               Oh my God - does my Dad know?

                           JACOB
               He and my dad are both over there.

                           BELLA
               Will Harry be okay?

                           JACOB
               I don't know. Come on. I'll find you
               something dry and drive you home.

As Jacob helps Bella up, we RACK FOCUS out to --

ANGLE ON THE WATER - where Victoria bobs, watching Jacob
guide Bella away... then she disappears below the surface.

INT. BELLA'S TRUCK - NIGHT

Jacob drives. Bella wears a fleece jacket but still
shivers. He pulls her close, wrapping an arm around her --

                           JACOB
               Hundred and eight degrees over here.

She tucks herself into him.

                           BELLA
               Must be nice, never getting cold.

                                                         82.



                           JACOB
               It's a wolf thing.

                           BELLA                                
               It's a Jacob thing.   You're just...             
               warm.                                            

                           JACOB                                
                    (grins)                                     
               Like the sun.                                    

                           BELLA                                
                    (meaning it)                                
               Like the sun.                                    

                           JACOB                                
               Which always comes back.   You can               
               count on me.                                     

She nods.   Awkward silence.   He fills it.                     

                           JACOB                                
               There are other cool things about all            
               this, like -- I heal fast. Wanna see             
               me stab my hand?

                           BELLA
                    (no!)
               Yeah, `cause that would be fun.                  

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE/INT. TRUCK (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

The truck pulls up to the curb. It's pitch black outside.
Jacob's still holding her close as he shuts the engine off.

                           BELLA                                
               So... this wolf thing's not all bad?             
                           JACOB                                
               It's better. Now that you know.                  
               But...                                           

                            BELLA                               
               ... but...                                       

                           JACOB                                
               It just... comes so easily to me.                
               More than the other guys.                        

                           BELLA                                
               That's a good thing, isn't it?                   

                                                         83.



                          JACOB                                  
              Maybe. Or maybe it makes me less...                
              human than the others.
                   (beat, quieter)
              Sometimes I'm scared I might...                    
              disappear, you know? Who I really am.              

Bella faces him, looks directly in his eyes.

                          BELLA
              I won't let that happen.

Their faces are close... and stay close for an intimate
beat. They could kiss, their lips near... but Bella blinks
herself back to reality and pulls away.
                          BELLA
              Thanks for driving - for everything.

-- as she pushes open her door. WIND wafts in -- Jacob
reacts to a repugnant smell outside --

                          JACOB
              Holy crap -- !

He abruptly pulls Bella back into the truck, SLAMS her door
shut and starts the truck.

                          JACOB
              There's a bloodsucker out there.

                          BELLA
              How do you know?

                          JACOB
              I can smell the stink.   I'm getting               
              you out of here.
As Jacob whips the truck around, the HEADLIGHTS ILLUMINATE --

BELLA'S POV - THE DRIVEWAY -- a black Mercedes is parked in
front. Bella spins to the rear window as Jacob floors it --

                           BELLA
              Stop!   It's not Victoria --

                          JACOB
              Forget it --

                          BELLA
              It's Carlisle's car!   They're here.               
              Go back! --

                                                          84.



                          JACOB
              It's a trick --

He's still flooring it -- Bella cracks her door open while
they're moving - he SLAMS on the brakes. She jumps out --

                          JACOB
              Damn it, Bella --

EXT. ROAD (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

Bella hurries up the road toward her house. Jacob's
suddenly standing in front of her, furious --

                           JACOB
              Stop.   You gotta come with me.                    
                           BELLA
              It's okay.   They're my friends --

                          JACOB
              Don't you get it? If a Cullen is back
              here, this is their territory. The Treaty
              says we can only defend our own lands.             

                          BELLA
              -- It's not a war --

                         JACOB
              It is. And you'll only be safe in La
              Push. I can't protect you here anymore.            

                          BELLA
              I don't need you to --

                          JACOB
              -- You're about to cross a line --
                          BELLA
              Only if you draw one.                              

She starts to move past him, but he stops her --                 

                          JACOB                                  
              I'm not letting you do this.                       

                          BELLA                                  
              You don't have a choice.   I don't                 
              belong to you.                                     

Her words are a knife to the heart. She sees that, but           
can't take them back. He hands her the keys.                     

                                                          85.



                          JACOB
              Bye, Bella, I hope you don't die.

She flinches at the stinging remark. He disappears into the
darkness, leaving her alone on the dark road.

She's closer to her house than her truck. She hurries
forward. The NIGHT SOUNDS start to encroach, branches
crackling, bushes rustling. She glances behind her...
nothing but darkness... she faces forward again ---

And runs directly into a VAMPIRE! Bella SCREAMS -- then
realizes IT'S ALICE. Bella is stunned. So is Alice.

                           BELLA
              Alice!
                          ALICE
              You're... alive.

She's clearly confused, but Bella hugs her with tears of joy.

                          BELLA
              Oh my God, Alice.    You're here.

                          ALICE
              I heard voices - I didn't think it was
              you but - you're alive.

                          BELLA
              You keep saying that.

                          ALICE
              I saw you - a vision of you - you
              jumped off a cliff. I knew I'd be too
              late but --                                        
                   (becoming angry)
              Why the hell would you try to kill
              yourself?!

                            BELLA
              I didn't.    I was cliff diving.

                           ALICE
              Why?!

                           BELLA
              Um... fun?

                          ALICE
              That was fun for you.

                                                        86.



                          BELLA
              Until I hit the water.

                          ALICE
              I have never met anyone more prone to
              life-threatening idiocy... and what is
              that hideous wet dog smell?                      

                         BELLA
              Oh. Probably Jacob.      He's kind of a          
              werewolf.

Off Alice's horrified expression.

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
As Bella makes herself hot chocolate, Alice paces.

                          BELLA
              Werewolves are not vicious.

                          ALICE
              Until they lose their tempers.

                          BELLA
              They saved me from Laurent, they're
              protecting me from Victoria --

                          ALICE
                   (shocked)
              Victoria? I didn't see her. I didn't             
              see you get pulled from the water                
              either.                                          

                          BELLA
              It was Jacob who saved me. More than             
              once. I couldn't have made it without            
              him. You have no idea what it was                
              like.

                          ALICE
                   (softening)
              Yes. I do. I knew leaving wouldn't               
              be good for you. I tried to tell
              Edward, but he wouldn't listen.

                          BELLA
                   (hesitantly)
              ... Does he know you're here?

                           ALICE
              No.   He's been... away...

                                                          87.



INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - DAY                   

A dump, empty but for a table and chair. On the table lie        
THE PHOTOS that once lined Bella's walls. Edward stands in       
the center of the room, stock still, staring out at the          
rising sun. His face is as empty and desolate as Bella's         
was after he left.

A CELL PHONE on the table RINGS jarringly. He doesn't move.      
It continues. Finally, he whips the receiver to his ear,
exasperated.

                            EDWARD
                 What?

                             ROSALIE (O.S.)
                 Wow, Edward finally answered the
                 phone. I feel so honored...                     

INTERCUT WITH:

INT. TANYA'S ALASKAN HOME - DAY

Rosalie, on the phone, stands at the picture window --

ROSALIE'S POV - EXT. ALASKAN HOUSE - Emmett, Jasper,
Carlisle and Esme walk away from the house, over the snow to     
the treeline, on their way to hunt. None wear coats.             

                             EDWARD
                 I'm hanging up now...

Rosalie turns away from the window.

                             ROSALIE
                 Wait!... You should come home.                  
                      (no response)
                 Esme's a wreck, Carlisle never smiles.          
                 Even Emmett's depressed. You've
                 really done a number on them.

                             EDWARD                              
                      (pained)                                   
                 I'm sorry. I am. But they wouldn't              
                 be happier with me around. Trust me.            

                             ROSALIE
                 I... I just miss... us.   The family.           

                             EDWARD                              
                 I know. But the further away I am,              
                 the safer Bella will be. She deserves           
                 a shot at a normal life --                      

                                                            88.



                          ROSALIE
              But see, you don't have to worry about               
              that, not anymore --

She stops realizing she may be making a mistake.     But Edward    
caught it, sits up.

                           EDWARD
              Why, Rose?   Did something happen?

                           ROSALIE
              I - uh --

                          EDWARD
              Tell me, Rosalie.
                   (rises, fierce)
              Tell me! --

                          ROSALIE
                   (blurts)
              -- Alice had a vision. She saw Bella -               
              - throw herself off a cliff... She's
              dead, Edward.

Edward reels, uncomprehending.                                     

                          EDWARD                                   
              I... don't believe it.                               

                          ROSALIE                                  
              Alice is there now. Thought she could                
              help with the funeral or something.                  

STAY ON ROSALIE as --                                              

                          ROSALIE                                  
              Come home, Edward. It's time...                      
              Edward...?                                           
She's been disconnected.   Off Rosalie, worried...                 

EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY                                           

Bella walks Charlie to his cruiser. He wears a dark, ill-
fitting funeral suit. At the car, Bella adjusts his tie --

                          CHARLIE
              Thanks for understanding, Bells. They                
              wanted to keep the service small.

                          BELLA
              Don't worry about me.    Are you gonna               
              be okay?

                                                           89.



                          CHARLIE
              Yeah... but Sue, and those kids --
              Leah's only a year older than you.
              And Seth's, what, fourteen...

Emotion threatens. She hugs him. He holds on a little too
tightly for a beat. Then he bucks up, climbs into his car.

                          CHARLIE
              There'll be a reception after. I
              might stay late, see if I can help.

Bella nods, then waves as he drives away. She turns to head
back inside but finds Alice suddenly at her side. She jumps.

                          ALICE
              You're not going?

                          BELLA
              I'm not the most popular person on the
              werewolf rez right now.

                          ALICE
                   (saddened)                                     
              Because you're friends with me.                     

Bella shrugs. Alice hears something, then looks down the          
road -- JACOB'S RABBIT appears in the distance....

                          ALICE
              Huh. Didn't see them coming. Didn't                 
              see him pull you out of the water -                 
              maybe my visions are allergic to dogs.              

                           BELLA
               -- Alice.

                          ALICE
                   (jogging off)
              I'll go do some hunting.

ANGLE ON THE RABBIT -- as it pulls up. Jacob drives, Embry in
the passenger seat. Bella approaches, surprised to find QUIL
in the back; same short hair and hard look as the others.

                          BELLA
              Quil... you, too?                                   

                         QUIL
                   (aggressive)                                   
              Yeah. Me, too.                                      

Jacob climbs out.   Embry takes the driver's seat.

                                                               90.



                           JACOB
              You alone?

                           BELLA
              Yes.   Shouldn't you be at the funeral?

                          JACOB
              Had to talk to you first.
                   (to the guys)
              I'll meet you there. Go on.

They're wary... but pull out.      Jacob follows Bella into --

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jacob enters behind Bella.   She turns to him...
                          BELLA
              Look, Jake, I'm sorry I --

                          JACOB
              This place stinks to hell.

She sees he's shut down, cold.      She shuts down, as well.

                          BELLA
              You're welcome to leave.      In fact --

                          JACOB
              -- How many Cullens are here and how
              long are they staying?

                          BELLA
                   (snapping back)                                    
              Just Alice. And she'll stay as long
              as she wants.

                          JACOB
              Are the rest coming back?

                          BELLA
              Not that I'm aware of.      Anything else?

                           JACOB
              That's it.

                          BELLA
              Better go report to Sam.

Jacob turns, starts to leave. He looks back, sees her anger
turn to hurt. He stops. Beat.

                                                             91.



                           JACOB
               I've done it again. I keep breaking                  
               my promise not to hurt you.                          

                           BELLA
               It doesn't have to be this way.

He moves back to her, looks into her eyes with sadness.

                           JACOB
               Yeah, it does.

                           BELLA
               Am I gonna lose you this time, Jacob?

He can't answer that, but he presses his hand to her cheek.
                           JACOB
               It was easier when we were both human,
               wasn't it?

They look at one another, Jacob's hand still on her face,           
his eyes searching hers.

Slowly, he starts to bend toward her lips. She doesn't pull         
away. She misses him too much, needs him too badly. This            
time, she'll let it happen. A kiss is a centimeter away...          

Suddenly, the shrill RING of the phone makes them both jump.        
Jacob, the closest to it, doesn't move his face, just keeps         
looking into her eyes as he reaches for the phone, answers --       

                           JACOB                                    
               Swan residence.                                      

She smiles.   But he instantly bristles, voice going cold.          

                           JACOB                                    
               He's not here. He's at a funeral...                  

Then the phone goes dead --                                         

INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - RIO DE JANEIRO - SAME                     

-- Edward stares at his phone crazed, enraged, grief-               
stricken -- he HURLS it against the wall, shattering it.            

INT. BELLA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME                             

-- Jacob hangs up the phone.                                        

                           JACOB                                    
               Filthy bloodsucker.                                  

                                                            92.



                          BELLA                                    
              Wait, who was it?                                    

                          JACOB                                    
                   (spitting it out)                               
              Dr. Carlisle Cullen.                                 

                          BELLA                                    
              You should have let me talk to him.                  

                          JACOB                                    
              He didn't ask for you --                             

Suddenly, Jacob's eyes go wild, his body stiffens, starts          
trembling in the way that precedes a wolf-morph.
                          JACOB
              Step away from me, Bella.

Bella turns to see what he's reacting to - Alice. She
stands in doorway looking empty, despairing. Bella                 
immediately hurries to her side.                                   

                          BELLA
              Alice, what's wrong?

                            ALICE
              ... Edward.

                          BELLA
              What about him? What happened?

                          ALICE
              I just saw him in a vision.   He...                  
              thinks you're dead.

                          BELLA                                    
                   (realizing)                                     
              That was him calling, not Carlisle.                  

                          ALICE                                    
              Bella, he's going to Italy... to the                 
              Volturi...

OFF BELLA'S FACE -- FLASHPOPS of the CIRCULAR HALL, the            
THREE VOLTURI - the DISMEMBERING of the rogue vampire --           

                                                    SMASH TO:

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - DAY

The door SLAMS open and Bella races in, shoving clothes into
a bag. Jacob dogs her, protesting.

                                                                 93.



                            JACOB
                Why do you have to go?

                            BELLA
                He won't believe Alice.    He has to see                
                that I'm alive.                                         

                            JACOB
                     (stops her)
                He left you, Bella. He didn't want
                you anymore, remember?

                            BELLA
                But I still love him, and I'm not gonna
                let him kill himself out of guilt.
This wounds him. But she can't stop to soothe him.         She
pulls away and continues packing.

                            JACOB
                What about your dad?

                            BELLA
                I'm eighteen, legally free to go.
                I'll leave a note.                                      

Alice enters.

                            ALICE
                Got the airline tickets.

                            JACOB
                     (squaring off with Alice)
                You Cullens might hunt animals but
                those monsters in Italy don't.                          

                            ALICE
                I'm well aware what the Volturi are.
                            JACOB
                Then why are you taking Bella to them
                like a bottle of wine to a party?

                            ALICE
                Right, she's better off here with
                Victoria stalking her. The one you
                dogs can't seem to catch?

Jacob growls, a shudder ripping through him. Bella
intercedes, stopping him from morphing by grabbing Alice.

                            BELLA
                Let's go.

                                                            94.



EXT. BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY

Alice flies to her car. But Jacob catches Bella's arm, not
hostile. Just pleading.

                          JACOB
              Please, Bella. Stay here.   For                      
              Charlie... for me.

Bella sees the love in his eyes; this could be last time she
ever sees him. She hugs him, then pulls away.

                            BELLA
              Bye, Jacob.

He watches, agonized as she races to the car, climbs in...
INT. THE MERCEDES (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Bella tries to pull on her seat belt but Alice stops her --

                          ALICE
              Maybe Jacob's right.                                 
                   (Bella tries to                                 
                    interrupt)                                     
              No. You need to realize - the Volturi                
              could easily see me as Edward's
              accomplice. And you're a human who
              knows too much and tastes too good.
              They could kill us all.

Bella's response is to yank her seat belt into its clip.           
Alice sees she won't change her mind. She shifts into gear         
and PEELS OUT. Bella looks out the window for Jacob; he's          
not there... she turns toward the woods --                         

BELLA'S POV -- THE TREELINE -- SHREDDED CLOTHING FLIES in the
air as we SEE the HIND LEGS OF A WOLF disappear into the
forest. Off Bella, fighting tears but determined as hell...        

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT                                  

ON EDWARD walking down a seemingly endless corridor.
Finally, he reaches a set of intricately carved double doors
which open for him. He enters --

INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - NIGHT

-- Edward finds himself facing three wooden thrones, on
which sit the ancient Volturi: Aro, Marcus, Caius.                 

Aro wears an expensive, contemporary, black Italian suit,          
long black hair in a loose ponytail to his waist.

                                                          95.


Marcus and Caius eschew modern clothing for rich silk robes,
their long hair loose around them. All three have
translucent, onion-like, white skin.

                          EDWARD
              Have you decided?

                          ARO
              It was an intriguing debate.     We don't
              get many suicidal vampires.

                           CAIUS
              Pathetic.

                          ARO
              I'm afraid your gifts are too valuable
              to destroy. But if you're unhappy
              with your lot, join us. We'd be
              delighted to utilize your skills.

                          EDWARD
              So you won't end this.

                          MARCUS
              Not without cause.

Edward registers this, his face setting. Clearly, he's           
going to give them cause. He strides out. Off Aro...             

                          ARO
              Such a waste.

EXT. FLORENCE AIRPORT, ITALY - MORNING

Bella waits impatiently at the curb as --                        

A YELLOW HARD-TOP PORSCHE with darkly tinted windows
SCREECHES to a halt in front of her. The passenger door          
opens - Alice is behind the wheel, pulling off the chic,         
white, hooded coat she used for protection against the sun.      
As Bella climbs in, buckles up --                                

                          BELLA
              Where'd you get the car?

                          ALICE
              Hope you're not opposed to grand theft
              auto.

                           BELLA
              Not today.

Alice FLOORS it and the Porsche PEELS OUT --

                                                            96.



EXT. TUSCAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

AERIAL VIEW - THE YELLOW PORSCHE screams down a highway,
cutting lanes, weaving through Peugots and Fiats --

INT. PORSCHE - DAY

Bella grips the dashboard as Alice narrowly misses a car.

                          BELLA
              How much time do we have.                            

                          ALICE (O.S.)                             
              He's waiting till noon, when the sun's               
              at its highest...                                    
                                                   SMASH TO:       

EXT. VOLTERRA - PALAZZO DEI PRIORI - DAY (ALICE'S VISION)

It's jumpy, uneven -- EDWARD stands in shadow, his shirt
open, eyes shut. A clock GONGS as he steps into SUNLIGHT --

                          ALICE                                    
              ... He's going to make the Volturi                   
              change their minds.                                  

INT. PORSCHE - SAME                                                

                          BELLA
                   (checking her watch)
              It's almost noon now.

                          ALICE
              There's Volterra.

Alice punches it as Bella SEES --
BELLA'S POV - A MEDIEVAL FORTIFIED VILLAGE atop a distant
hill. Volterra.

EXT. VOLTERRA - DAY

The narrow, centuries-old streets are crowded with festival
revellers who all wear RED. They gaily head toward the town
square carrying red pendants, balloons, scarves. The
PORSCHE weaves through them, hurrying forward.

INTERCUT INSIDE THE PORSCHE --

                          BELLA
              Why are they all wearing red?

                                                          97.



                          ALICE
              San Marcos Day festival. The perfect               
              setting. Large crowds. The Volturi                 
              won't let him get far enough to reveal             
              himself - he's counting on that.                   

                          BELLA
              We only have five minutes --

Alice screeches to a halt at a ROAD BLOCK.   Italian POLICE      
wave her back. Bella jumps out --

                          BELLA
              Where's the square?

                          ALICE
              Follow that lane --

-- Bella's already running --

                          ALICE
              He'll be under the clock tower!

Alice watches her go... then senses something, looks up --

ALICE'S POV - ON THE ROOFTOPS - A FIGURE IN A BLACK HOODED
OVERCOAT leaps from building to building, tracking Bella.
As he disappears, off Alice --

EXT. VOLTERRA ALLEYS - SERIES OF FAST CUTS - DAY

Bella races down the cobble-stoned alleys, stumbling on the
uneven stones. Festival revellers head in the same
direction, she maneuvers around them.

ABOVE BELLA - SEE flashes of the FIGURE IN THE OVERCOAT --

As Bella nears the square, the alleys become more populated.
She pushes past people AD LIBBING "excuse me," "sorry."
Finally, she emerges into --

EXT. PALAZZO DEI PRIORI (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

BELLA'S POV - a sea of scarlet flags, dresses and jackets.
On the other side of the crowded square - THE CLOCK TOWER;
it reads one minute before noon.

Bella battles her way through the square; the crowd shoves
back, shouting at her in Italian --

                          ITALIAN MAN
              Fare attenzione!

                                                            98.



Bella charges forward to find herself blocked by --

A FOUNTAIN - Suddenly, GONG!    The clock tower bells chime.
It's noon!

Bella jumps into the fountain, wades through the shallow
water to the other side -- she jumps out and barrels through
the crowd. Finally, she SEES --

BELLA'S POV - BENEATH THE CLOCK TOWER

Edward, in the shadows, just inches from the sunlight.

                            BELLA
              Edward! --
-- GONG! Bella's cry is drowned out by the BOOMING CHIME.
She pushes toward him, fighting to reach him as --

CLOSE ON EDWARD (IN SLOW MOTION) - as he unbuttons his
shirt, exposing his bare chest --

ON BELLA (IN SLOW MOTION) - calling his name --

ON EDWARD'S FACE - he closes his eyes, welcoming death --
then slowly --

Edward takes a step into the sunlight, the rays hitting his        
shoe, but before the sun touches his skin --                       

BELLA SLAMS into him - it's like running into a brick wall --      

                            BELLA
              No, Edward!    Don't!

Edward opens his eyes and looks at Bella as the clock booms
its final CHIME. He's amazed, already dead in his mind.            
                          EDWARD                                   
              Carlisle was right... heaven...                      

                          BELLA                                    
              No, I'm here. I'm alive.                             

                          EDWARD
                   (confused)                                      
              You're... not real.

                            BELLA
              Look at me!    Alice was wrong.                      

He begins to realize... she is real.

                                                            99.



                          EDWARD
              Bella?

                          BELLA
              Please, step back.   I'm alive, I'm --

He suddenly kisses her, stepping back into the shade with
her. They soak each other in like starved people suddenly
nourished. He pulls away to look at her...

                          EDWARD
              You're here.

                          BELLA
              I'm here.
They share a long look, he's about to kiss her again... when
suddenly, he stiffens -- and abruptly PUSHES Bella behind
him, taking a protective stance in front of her --

They face the DARK ALLEY that runs under the clock tower.
Out of the alley's shadows emerge --

TWO FIGURES IN HOODED OVERCOATS. Both stunningly handsome
males in their 20's: FELIX, huge, strong; and DEMETRI,             
slender, elegant. Both have unsettling burgundy red EYES.

                          EDWARD
              I won't be needing your services after
              all, gentlemen.

                          FELIX
              Aro wants to speak with you again.

                          EDWARD
              No rules were broken.                                

Demetri's smile suggests he doesn't agree. He's the more
gracious of the two. But no less dangerous.

                          DEMETRI
              We should take this conversation to a
              more appropriate venue.

                          EDWARD
              Fine. Bella, why don't you stay and                  
              enjoy the festival?                                  

                          FELIX
              The girl comes with us.

                          EDWARD
              That's not going to happen --                        

                                                         100.



ALICE suddenly appears, lightly tripping through the alley       
toward them, pulling back the hood of her white swing coat.

                          ALICE
              Come on, guys, it's a festival.                    

She reaches Edward and Bella, positioning herself in a
protective stance, as well.                                      

                          ALICE                                  
              We wouldn't want to make a scene.                  

                          FELIX                                  
              There won't be any scene.    And we'll             
              still win.                                         
                          EDWARD
              But not easily --

                            JANE (O.S.)
              Enough.

A very tiny, young woman appears, JANE. She also wears a
dark overcoat, her Botticelli angel-like face peering out
from under the hood. SEE her CRIMSON IRISES.

Felix and Demetri are back off immediately. Edward and           
Alice step back, as well. Bella can see they're afraid of        
this small girl.

                            EDWARD
                      (nodding to her)
              Jane.

                          BELLA
                   (sotto to Alice)
              Who is she?
                          ALICE
                   (sotto to Bella)
              Just do as she says.

Jane tosses Edward an overcoat.    He dons it.

                            JANE
              Follow me.

Jane simply turns and heads up the alley, confident they'll
follow. Felix, smirking, gestures for them to go ahead of
him. Edward takes Bella's hand...

                                                           101.



EXT. VOLTERRA STREETS - DAY

Jane leads Edward, Bella and Alice through several narrow,
dark alleys. Felix and Demetri bring up the rear. Edward
never loosens his grip on Bella's hand.

Their path dead ends at a WALL OF BRICK. Jane just strides
forward and, without breaking pace - drops down into an OPEN
HOLE in the street; it's a drain. Alice follows Jane.
Bella looks down, sees nothing but BLACKNESS.

                          EDWARD
              It's alright. Alice will catch you.

Edward takes her wrists, dangles her over the hole --
INT. SEWERS (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- ON BELLA as she drops through the darkness, to be caught
by Alice. Edward lands beside them, then Felix and Demetri.

Edward pulls Bella close as they follow Jane through the
sewer. He meets Bella's eyes, trying to look reassuring,
but he's tense as hell. Finally, they reach --

A FOLDING IRON ELEVATOR DOOR. Jane easily pulls it aside.
They all enter. As the door CLANGS shut on them --

                                                     SMASH TO:

CLOSE ON MODERN ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING. They all exit into --      

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LOBBY (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

An elegantly decorated space with old world charm. They're         
greeted politely by GIANNA an attractive (human) receptionist.     

                          GIANNA
              Buon pomeriggio.

They head through the lobby to --

THE LONG CORRIDOR that Edward traversed earlier.   Finally,
they reach the carved double doors which open --                   

INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

Bella, Edward and Alice enter to face the three ancients:
Aro, Marcus, Caius.

Eight VOLTURI GUARDS (including Jane, Felix, Demetri) line the
walls in a variety of modern dark overcoats.

                                                           102.



BELLA'S POV - THE FLOOR - there's a depression in the center
that leads to a drain. Bella shivers.

Aro rises, greets them like old friends, taking Edward's
hand and shaking it --

                          ARO
              What a happy surprise! Bella is alive
              after all. Isn't that wonderful?

Caius responds with a sour expression. Marcus could care           
less. Aro doesn't release Edward's hand, looks at him as --        

                          ARO
              Her blood appeals to you so much it
              makes me thirsty. How can you stand
              to be so close to her?

                          EDWARD
              It's not without effort.

                          ARO
                   (laughing)
              I can see that.

Off Bella's look, Edward explains --                               

                          EDWARD
              One touch and Aro can see every                      
              thought I've ever had in my life.

                          ARO
              You're quite the telepath yourself,
              Edward. Though... you can't read
              Bella's thoughts. Fascinating.

He releases Edward's hand and turns to Bella.
                          ARO
              I would love to see if you are an                    
              exception to my gifts, as well.                      

He reaches for Bella's hand. She hesitates, does she have a        
choice? Aro laughs at her reluctance, further extends his          
hand. Bella finally takes it.                                      

A beat as he holds her hand... confusion sweeping over him.        

                          ARO
              Interesting.

He releases her, moves back to his chair, deep in thought.

                                                             103.



                          ARO
              I wonder if --                                         

                            EDWARD                                   
                      (reading Aro's thoughts)                       
              No!                                                    

                          ARO                                        
              Let's see if she's immune to all our                   
              powers, shall we Jane?                                 

Jane turns toward Bella but Edward springs in front of her --        

Jane instead focuses her gaze on Edward which FLINGS him             
across the room where he collapses, writhing in agony. Jane          
concentrates on him with a small smile, enjoying his pain.           
                            BELLA
              Stop!

Bella and Alice rush to his side.    As soon as Jane looks
away, Edward's pain ceases.

                            ARO
              Jane, dear.    The girl?                               

Jane's gaze now turns toward Bella who cringes, awaiting the         
pain... but nothing happens. Jane's grin is replaced by              
anger. Aro laughs like a child with a new toy.                       

Jane, infuriated, moves toward Bella, but Aro stops her with         
a tiny gesture.                                                      

                          ARO
              Remarkable! She confounds us all.      So
              what do we do with you now?

                          MARCUS                                     
                   (seemingly bored)                                 
              You already know what you'll do, Aro.                  

                          CAIUS                                      
              She knows too much; she's a liability.                 

                          ARO
              That's true. Unless Edward intends to
              give her immortality...
                   (looks at Edward)
              But that's not your intention, is it.
              Shame.

He nods to Felix who moves toward Bella, but he only takes a         
step before Edward tackles him.                                      

                                                          104.



                          BELLA                                   
              Edward, don't!                                      

Alice leaps to help but several Volturi guard hold her back,      
which is no easy job. As she struggles mightily --                

Edward is David to Felix's Goliath.    Edward will lose, but      
he'll go down fighting.                                           

-- Edward is fast, anticipating Felix's moves before he           
makes them, but Felix is stronger --                              

-- Felix grabs Edward, throws him into the ceiling, SMASHING      
against the marble; he drops like a stone. Is then                
immediately KICKED across the room.                               
                         BELLA                                    
                   (to Aro)                                       
              Stop this! Please!                                  

But Aro ignores her, leans forward to study Edward.    Jane is    
itching to step in. Aro gestures her back.                        

-- Felix takes some hits, but then lifts Edward overhead,         
CRACKING him like a nut, then flinging him against a wall --      

Bella runs toward Aro but a Volturi Guard flings her away;        
she flies HARD against the wall.                                  

The guard is then occupied by the thrashing Alice --              

Bella, bruised, but not broken, makes another attempt to get      
to Aro -- finally reaches him, kneels in front of him --          

                            BELLA
              Do it!    Kill me! Just leave them
              alone!
-- as she yanks her collar back, exposing her neck to him.
Aro is surprised and intrigued. A beat.

                           ARO
              Enough.                                             

Felix immediately releases Edward who manages to look up.         
He sees Bella kneeling in front of Aro.                           

                          EDWARD
              Get away from her -- !

Edward moves toward Aro but is quickly immediately pinned by      
Jane's invisible powers; he writhes in agony. Alice can no        
longer bear Edward's suffering --                                 

                                                          105.



                          ALICE                                   
              Edward, stop. I've already seen it.                 

                          EDWARD                                  
                   (through gritted teeth)                        
              Alice, stay out of it.                              

                          ALICE                                   
              I know what to do.                                  

Aro, intrigued, gestures for Jane to stop; Edward goes limp.      

                          ARO
              Ah yes, the clairvoyant. I saw your
              gift in Edward's thoughts. What is it               
              you've seen?                                        
                          EDWARD                                  
              ... don't...                                        

                          ALICE                                   
              I'm the one who will change Bella.                  

Bella is taken aback by this.   Aro is surprised, as well.        

                         ARO

                          ALICE                                   
              Not here. Her father is in law                      
              enforcement. If she goes missing,                   
              there will be questions.                            

                          CAIUS                                   
              He is easily dealt with.                            

                          ALICE
              It will happen, Aro.   See for                      
              yourself.

She thrusts out her hand. Aro nods to the Guards who              
release her. She gives him her hand. He closes his eyes --        

                                                   SMASH TO:

EXT. FOREST - DAY (ALICE'S VISION)

Edward hunts a deer. Matching his pace is another vampire -
Bella! She's pale and beautiful - she and Edward smile at
each other as they take a last grand leap for the kill --

                                               SMASH BACK TO:

INT. CIRCULAR WHITE MARBLE HALL - DAY

BACK ON ARO, utterly delighted.   He releases Alice's hand.

                          ARO
              Mesmerizing! To see the things you've
              seen, that haven't happened yet!                      

Alice moves to Edward's side, helps him up.                         

                          ALICE

Caius glares at them threateningly.

              I would not delay. We do not offer                    
              second chances.                                       

Edward, recovered now, takes Bella by the arm and, with             
Alice, they cautiously back toward the door --

INT. VOLTURI HEADQUARTERS - LONG CORRIDOR (CONTINUOUS) - DAY

-- Demetri leads Bella, Edward and Alice out of the hall.
As they make their way up the corridor, they see coming
toward them --

A GROUP OF TWO DOZEN TOURISTS, led by a beautiful vampire,
HEIDI. Edward, Alice and Bella stop to let them all pass.
As Heidi passes Demetri, he gives her a flirtatious smile --

                                                            107.



                            DEMETRI
                     (sotto)                                        
                Nice fishing, Heidi, save some for me.              

Heidi smiles.   She gives Bella a curious once-over, then
continues on.

                            HEIDI
                     (to the group)
                This way, please. Stay together...

A HUSBAND and WIFE, 60's, cameras around their necks, pass
Bella. The Husband winks at Bella --

                            TOURIST HUSBAND
                Unusual tour, isn't it?
                            TOURIST WIFE
                Bill, get a picture of that bust there.

As the Tourists file past, we HEAR a variety of languages,
German, Japanese, English.

The group is moved toward the carved double doors which
swing open for them. They file into the marble hall --

Edward pulls Bella forward, but she cranes her neck back as
the last of the tourists disappear inside.

As the large doors close... we begin to HEAR SCREAMING --

Edward and Alice rush Bella out - PUSH IN ON BELLA'S                
TORMENTED FACE as the SCREAMING gets louder... and louder --

                                                     SMASH TO:

INT. BELLA'S ROOM - NIGHT
ON BELLA'S SLEEPING FACE as the SCREAMING CRESCENDOS --
Bella sits bolt upright, yelling --

                            BELLA
                -- Stop!                                            

She catches her breath, disoriented, confused. Then she             
turns to find Edward lying beside her, looking at her.              

                            BELLA
                It... wasn't a dream.                               

                            EDWARD
                Go back to sleep. You've been through               
                a lot.

                                                         108.



                          BELLA                                  
              No, you might --                                   

                          EDWARD                                 
              I'll be here when you wake up.                     

Beat, she looks at him, wary.                                    

                           BELLA                                 
              Why?   Out of guilt?                               

                          EDWARD                                 
                   (realizing)                                   
              You... think I asked the Volturi to                
              kill me because I felt guilty?                     
                            BELLA                                
              Didn't you?                                        

                          EDWARD                                 
              I went to them because I thought I'd               
              lost you.                                          

                          BELLA                                  
              You didn't even want me.                           

Now Edward takes her by the shoulders.                           

                          EDWARD                                 
              Bella. The only reason I left was to               
              protect you. I wanted you to have a                
              chance at a normal, happy life.                    

                          BELLA                                  
              But it was so easy for you to leave.               

                          EDWARD                                 
              I had to be convincing. But easy?     In           
              my hundred years, I've never had a                 
              harder time than what I just went                  
              through.                                           

She's beginning to believe him.                                  

                          BELLA                                  
              I kept seeing you. Visions of you.                 
              Always protecting me. I thought I was              
              going crazy.                                       

                          EDWARD                                 
              Your own instincts were speaking to                
              you. I wish it had been me. But                    
              you're the heroic one. You saved me.               

                                                            109.



He moves to kiss her... but abruptly stops.   Suddenly --           

HER DOOR swings open - she spins toward it as the LIGHTS            
flip on and Charlie enters. Edward is gone.                         

                          CHARLIE                                   
              You alright? Another nightmare?                       

                            BELLA                                   
              I'm okay.    You don't have to worry.                 

                          CHARLIE                                   
              Last time you said that, you                          
              disappeared. You want to talk                         
              nightmares?                                           
                          BELLA                                     
                   (sincere)                                        
              I'm really sorry, Dad.                                

                          CHARLIE                                   
              Just... don't ever do that to me                      
              again. Okay?                                          
                   (off her nod)                                    
              And you're grounded for the rest of                   
              your life.                                            

                           BELLA                                    
              I know.                                               

                          CHARLIE                                   
              Get some rest so I can keep lecturing                 
              you in the morning.                                   

He kisses her forehead. Exits.     A beat... she turns to find      
Edward sitting on the bed.                                          

                          EDWARD                                    
              He won't forgive me easily.                           

                           BELLA                                    
              Nope.                                                 

                          EDWARD
              Will you? I don't deserve it but... I                 
              hope you will. Because I honestly                     
              have no idea how to live without you.                 

Bella melts in his eyes.   He kisses her.

                          BELLA
              You won't be able to get rid of me                    
              once Alice changes me.                                

                                                          110.



                          EDWARD
              She won't have to. There are ways to                
              keep the Volturi in the dark.                       

                          BELLA
                   (pulling away)
              They'll come after your whole family.
              You'd risk that just to keep me human?

                          EDWARD
              Just? You really don't understand
              what you'd be giving up.

                          BELLA
              I really do.
They look at each other; an impasse.    She decides something,    
grabs her jeans, pulls them on--

                          BELLA
              You're not the only one with a say in it.           

INT. CULLEN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN                            

CLOSE ON BELLA --

                          BELLA
              You all know what Edward wants. And
              you know what I want. But I won't
              force myself on you...

INCLUDE THE ENTIRE CULLEN FAMILY who surround Bella. The          
house has been restored to it's original warmth and beauty.       
Edward sits off to the side as Bella addresses them.              

                          BELLA
              I think the only fair way to handle                 
              this is by vote --
                          EDWARD
              You can't be serious --                             

                          BELLA
                   (firmly)
              This is my meeting, Edward.

Edward, frustrated, sits back.    She faces the family again.

                          BELLA
              However this turns out, I'm not                     
              letting the Volturi hurt you. I'll go               
              back to Italy alone --                              

                                                            111.



                            EMMETT
                The hell you will.   I'm not missing
                another fight.

                            BELLA
                That's not up for a vote, Emmett.    I
                don't want you involved.

                            ESME
                We've always been involved, honey, and
                we're not going to stop --

                            BELLA
                No, please -- I want you to seriously
                think about this. If I join you,
                you'll be stuck with me for a long
                time - forever. It's a huge decision.
                And I want - I need your honesty here.

They nod or otherwise communicate agreement.

                            BELLA
                Then let's take a vote... Alice?

Alice jumps up and hugs Bella.

                            ALICE
                Like you're not already my sister.     Of
                course, yes!

Bella smiles.   Jasper rises, but keeps his distance.

                            JASPER
                I vote yes. It'll be a relief not to
                want to kill you.

                             BELLA
                Um.   Thanks? Okay, Rosalie?
Rosalie, torn, looks at Edward who's stony toward her.

                            ROSALIE
                Edward, I'm sorry for what I did. I
                really am. And I know you're not
                ready to forgive me...
                     (to Bella)
                But this isn't the life I'd have
                chosen for myself. I wish there'd
                been someone to vote no for me...
                     (she exchanges a glance
                      with Carlisle - then...)
                So... no.

                                                            112.



Bella takes it stoically.    Emmett bounds over and lifts           
Bella into a bear hug.

                          EMMETT
              I vote hell yeah. We can pick a fight
              with these Volturi some other way.

Esme approaches and embraces Bella warmly.

                          ESME
              I already think of you as part of the
              family. Yes.

                          BELLA
              Thank you, Esme.
Carlisle moves, not to Bella, but to --

                            CARLISLE
              Edward --

                          EDWARD
              You can't go along with this,
              Carlisle, you know what it means.

                          CARLISLE
              You've chosen not to live without her,
              which leaves me no choice. I won't
              lose my son.
                   (turns to Bella)
              But Alice has never turned anyone.
              It'd be safer if I did it --

The front door suddenly SLAMS. Edward's gone.     Bella
blanches but turns to the family.                                   

                            BELLA
              Thank you.    Thank you all.

POV FROM AFAR ON A HILLTOP -- REVEAL IT'S VICTORIA watching         
the house down below. Off her seething fury --                      

                                                    SMASH TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

A FERRARI has pulled over to the side of the road. VICTORIA
PEERS IN THE WINDOW. The DRIVER, a middle-aged man smiles --        

                          VICTORIA
              Where you headed?

                                                           113.



                            DRIVER
              Seattle.                                             

                          VICTORIA
                   (a slow grin)                                   
              Sounds perfect.                                      

As she climbs in...                                                

INT. EDWARD'S CAR - MORNING

Edward drives Bella home.    He is somber.   She is resigned.      

                            EDWARD
              When?
                          BELLA
              After graduation.                                    

                          EDWARD                                   
              Just two months.                                     

                          BELLA
              It'll be best for Dad that way. I can                
              pretend to be at college somewhere.                  
              Carlisle suggested it. But...                        
                   (quiet, emotional)                              
              I wish you'd be the one to change me.                

                          EDWARD
                   (beat)
              Would you be willing to trade for that?

                         BELLA
                   (hopeful)                                       
              Name it.

                          EDWARD
              Five more years as a human.

                          BELLA
              The Volturi won't wait that long.

                          EDWARD
              I'll settle for three.                               

                          BELLA
                   (sadly, shakes her head)
              I won't risk it. It'll have to be
              Carlisle.

He takes her hand.

                                                           114.



                          EDWARD
              Why are you so willing to give up your
              soul?

                          BELLA
              Because I don't believe you've lost
              yours. And I want to share mine with
              you forever.

He looks to her, kisses her hand... then suddenly Edward           
SLAMS on the brakes --

THEIR POV - THE ROAD

-- Someone stands in the road directly in front of them --
it's JACOB. He glares, then turns and walks into the woods.
                          BELLA
              What is he doing?

                          EDWARD
              He wants to talk to me.

                          BELLA
              Well, he can talk to me first.

She pushes out of the car --

INT. WOODS - MORNING

Edward and Bella tramp through the woods to FIND -- Jacob
leaning against a tree. His expression is hard.

                          JACOB
              You're still alive.                                  

                          BELLA                                    
              I've been calling you.                               
                          JACOB
              Couldn't drop by?                                    

                          EDWARD
              He thinks I'm keeping you away.

                          JACOB
                   (spinning on him)
              Stay the hell out of my head!

                          BELLA
              Dad grounded me, Jake. We're trying                  
              to get back before he wakes up.                      

                                                           115.



Jacob doesn't buy it. Bella is frustrated. But Edward
takes a step toward Jacob. Calm. Diplomatic.

                          EDWARD
              Jacob, I know you have something to
              say to me, but I'd like to say
              something first. Alright?

Jacob leans back against the tree, arms folded, waiting.

                          EDWARD
                   (sincere)
              Thank you. For keeping Bella alive
              when I... didn't.

                          JACOB
              No, you didn't. And it wasn't for
              your benefit, trust me.

                          EDWARD
              I know. I'm still grateful.
                   (then)
              But I'm back now. And I'm not leaving
              Bella's side till she orders me away.

She looks at him. He returns the look. Jacob sees the              
devotion between them. It wounds him. But he masks it.

                           JACOB
              We'll see.

                          EDWARD
              Either way, we'll handle Victoria from
              here on out.

                          JACOB
              She's been laying low. Ever since
              your freaky sister showed up. Guess
              she can't stand you Cullens either.

                          EDWARD
              She'll come back.

                          JACOB
              She does, she's ours.   She killed on
              our turf.

                           EDWARD
              We'll see.

                          JACOB                                    
              My turn to talk. I'm here to remind
              you about a key point in the Treaty.

                                                          116.



                          EDWARD
                   (reads his thoughts, nods)
              I haven't forgotten.

                          JACOB
              Good.

                           BELLA
              What?   What key point?

                          JACOB
              If any of them bites a human, the
              truce is over. That's bite, not kill.

                          BELLA
                   (realizing)
              But... if I choose it, it's none of
              your business.

Jacob is horrified, starting to shake with rage.

                          JACOB
              If you... what!? No.      No way.   I
              won't let you --

                          EDWARD
              -- Bella, step back --

                          JACOB
              You're not gonna be one of them.

                          BELLA
              That's not your call --

                          JACOB
                   (even more intense)
              You know what we'll do to you - I
              won't have a choice --
                          EDWARD
              We're done here --

Edward takes Bella's arm, starts to pull her away.    Jacob
lunges, trying to extract Bella from him --

                          JACOB
              You don't speak for her!

Edward PUSHES Jacob away; he flies back ten feet in the air,
but mid-air he PHASES INTO A WOLF!

                                                         117.



-- The Jacob-wolf lands on all fours, spinning to face
Edward in an attack stance. Edward shifts stance, as well,
readying for a fight --

                          BELLA
              Stop!

Edward and Jacob circle one another, seconds from lunging --

                          EDWARD
                   (to Bella)
              Get out of here. Now!

But Bella races between them, forceful, insistent.

                          BELLA
                   (to both of them)
              You do this, you'll be going through me.

A long tense beat, none of them backing down - it could go
either way --

                          BELLA
              I swear to God, I'm not moving.

Both rivals see she's dead serious. Edward backs off, ever-
so-slightly... the Jacob-wolf does the same.                     

                          BELLA
                   (turning to Edward)
              Give me a second. Please.

Edward shakes his head.   Doesn't move an inch.

                          BELLA
              Read his thoughts.   Is he going to                
              hurt me?
Edward does, and finally, reluctantly backs away. But his        
eyes never leave the wolf's. They glare at one another.

Bella carefully approaches the Jacob-wolf, blocking his line
of sight. Her voice is kind, pleading.

                          BELLA
              Jacob, I love you. You're my best
              friend. But... I can't change how I
              feel. Please don't make me choose.
                   (quietly, emotionally)
              Because it'll be him. It's always
              been him.

                                                           118.



Anguish sweeps through the wolf's fierce face.    It's even
harder to take than when he's in human form --

                          BELLA
              But you know how important you are to --

Suddenly, the wolf BOLTS out of there...

ON BELLA - fighting tears as she watches him disappear...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              There were problems ahead.     Seemingly             
              insurmountable...                                    

Edward's arms wrap around her from behind.                         
                          BELLA (V.O.)
              ... If I didn't become a vampire, the
              Volturi would kill me. If I did, my
              best friend would do the job himself,
              or get killed in the attempt.

She turns to face Edward, looking into his loving eyes...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              Victoria was still on the loose,
              putting everyone I loved in danger...

He kisses her tenderly, washing away her concerns.

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              But I'd already survived the worst --
              losing Edward. So I knew I could
              survive anything...

                           EDWARD                                  
              I'm here.   Always.
And she sees that's the truth, believes it. He takes her
hand and together they turn, heading out of the woods...

                          BELLA (V.O.)
              And soon, I'd be like him. We'd face
              our fate together. Forever.

Off them, hand in hand, inseparable... as we begin to --

                                               FADE TO BLACK:

... HEAR the agonized HOWL of a wolf in the far distance...        


                          THE END
THE UGLY TRUTH

1   INT. KPHX TV - LOBBY - DAY                                      1

    ABBY RICHTER, 30's, pretty, driven and absolutely in control,
    walks through the lobby, greeting the SECURITY GUARD.

                        ABBY
              Morning, Freddy.

                        SECURITY GUARD
              Morning, Abby. Another peaceful
              day?

                        ABBY
              If you say so...

2   INT. KPHX - CORRIDOR - MORNING - MOMENTS LATER                  2

    JOY, 40's, the associate producer, falls in step with Abby.

                        JOY
                  (panicked)
              We've got problems.

                         ABBY
              There are no problems, Joy.   Only
              solutions.

                        JOY
              The sky-cam on the traffic copter
              has a cracked lens and they can't
              fix it.

                         ABBY
              Okay, that's a problem.
                (thinking, then...)
              Call Matt Hardwick down at Media
              Services. He's got a few Sky Cams
              and he owes me. Now, where are my
              weathermen?

    Joy opens a door to a waiting area.

3   INT. KPHX - WAITING AREA - MORNING - CONTINUOUS                 3

    Several portly LATINO MEN look up and wave at Abby.

                           LATINO MEN
              Hey there!

                           ABBY
              Hi, guys!

    Abby waves back and closes the door.

                 Research shows people like fat
                 weathermen. It makes them feel
                 safe.

                 I like the one in the green and the
                 one in the brown, but I want to see
                 the one in the green with less
                 sideburns and the one in the brown
                 with more, then I'll make my
                 decision.

                 Abby!

    LARRY, 50's, the pompous, uptight anchor man, catches up to

                 Morning, Larry.

                           LARRY
                 I'm sorry to do this to you, Abby,
                 but I don't think I can work with
                 her anymore. It's bad enough I
                 have to take her criticism at home.
                 I can't do it on air, too. A man
                 can only take so much.

    Abby nods, taking him seriously, but you can tell she's done
    this before.

                           ABBY
                 You're not a man, Larry...
                     (off his look)
                 You're a newsman. A newsman isn't
                 defined by the easy times, Larry,
                 he's defined by the difficult ones.
                 Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris
                 Hansen or Anderson Cooper having
                 their wives as co-anchor? Hell, no,
                 because they couldn't handle it.
                 But you can. You've got balls the
                 size of Volkswagens. Don't think I
                 haven't noticed.

              as of late, but you're right. They
              are quite sizeable. But not
              disproportionately so.
                  (with pride)

                 Have you seen the ratings for
                 yesterday? We got beat by all the
                 network shows, plus a rerun of
                 "Who's the Boss". The one where
                 the vacuum breaks.

                           ABBY
                 It's a temporary setback. This week
                 we'll do better.

                            STUART
                 The guy with the cable access show
                 on Channel 83 does better. If we
                 programed Jerry Springer re-runs,
                 we'd do a nine share at a quarter
                 the price.

    Abby looks worried.

                 Please tell me you're not thinking
                 of killing the show.

                 I'm not, but I can guarantee you
                 that's what the new management's

                  a little short, but he's read The

                  makes it any better.

                            ABBY
                  Jim -- hey. Hi. Hey.

                            HOSTESS
                  Shall I show you to your table?

     Abby and a mildly perturbed Jim follow, clearly not off to a
     banner start.

11   INT. RESTAURANT DINING AREA - NIGHT                                11

     Abby and Jim sit at a table. Abby looks around, tense.

                            ABBY
                  You know what? This is not the best
                  angle. We should get the table over
                  there. Then we both get a view,
                  instead of one of us looking at the
                  busboy station.

                            JIM
                  I'm fine here.

                            ABBY
                  No, trust me. It'll be better over
                  there.

     He looks at her like she's crazy, as they get up and move.

12   ANTOHER TABLE - MOMENTS LATER                                      12

     The waiter is now taking their drink order.

                            WAITER
                  Can I get you some water for the
                  table?

                            JIM
                  Bottle of flat, please.

                            ABBY
                  You know, they've done studies that
                  show tap water is no different from
                  bottled water. And they passed a
                  law recently to have all
                  restaurants filter their tap water.
                  So, technically it's not tap water.

                  It's filtered water, which is
                  exactly what bottled water is,
                  except you don't have to pay $7 for
                  it.

                            JIM
                  Yeah, I still like the way it
                  tastes better.

                            WAITER
                  Can I get you any cocktails?

                            JIM
                  Scotch on the rocks.

                            ABBY
                  In your profile, you said you liked
                  red wine.

                            JIM
                  I do, I just feel like having a
                  scotch right now.

     She looks disappointed, then pulls out a piece of paper.

                            ABBY
                      (re the paper)
                  Was there anything else you changed

                  can figure it into the overall
                  picture.

                            JIM
                  You printed out my profile?

                            ABBY
                  Actually, my associate producer
                  did. She likes me to be prepared.
                  Not that I'm ever not prepared.
                  Kudos on your comprehensive car
                  insurance policy, by the way.

                            JIM
                  That wasn't in my profile.

                  No, but it was in your background

                         ABBY
               Good point.

     There's an awkward silence between them. She pulls out
     another piece of paper, and hands it to him.

                         ABBY
               I printed out some talking points
               for us just in case this happened.

                         JIM
               I take it it's happened before?

                         ABBY
               No, but since you have nine out of
               ten of the necessary attributes on
               my checklist, I just wanted to make
               sure this goes as smoothly as
               possible.

     As Jim processes this, the waiter arrives with drinks.

                            JIM
               Thank you.

     He takes a huge sip, relieved. Abby looks at him.

                         ABBY
               You realize the ice in that scotch
               is made from tap water, don't you?

     He looks at her, realizing she's a complete nightmare.

13   EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT- NIGHT                                13

     Jim and Abby walk to their cars. Jim is walking faster than
     she is, trying to get away. She trots along, trying to keep
     up.

                         ABBY
               Next time we could go bowling. I
               noticed online that you're the mid-

               mean, if there is a next time. I'm

     Jim doesn't even consider refuting this. He just wants to
     leave. Abby reaches into her purse and pulls out --                    *

                  FYI, be sure to eat this by
                  tomorrow. With curry, you can't
                  smell if it's gone bad, so after
                  three days, you should just toss
                  it. Really, don't even give it to a
                  pet or anything.

                            JIM
                  Three days. Got it.

     Abby has officially lost control to the producer part of
     herself...she knows what she's doing, but can't stop herself.

                            ABBY
                  Here, just to be sure, I'll write
                  today's date on it for you.

     Abby takes a pen out and writes a date on the bag.

                      (annoyed)
                  It's fine, really...

     The bottom of the bag gives out and a container of goopy
     leftovers SPILLS all over Jim's lap.

     her front door. Her calico cat D'ARTAGNAN, 9, skeptical and
     easily annoyed, stares up at her.

                  Loving Men"...

     He drops the books on the floor, picks up a can of gasoline
     and pours it on the books.

                  Billions and billions of dollars
                  wasted on self-help psycho­babble.

     Mike lights a match and tosses it on the books, setting them
     ablaze. Then opens up his jacket and takes out a stick with a
     marshmallow. Begins roasting the marshmallow on the flame.

                  because at the end of the day, all
                  we're interested in is looks. No
                  one falls in love with your

                  fall in love with your tits and

     WE PAN off the television to the bed, where Abby now watches,
     appalled.

                            ABBY
                  Oh my God. It's that cable access
                  jackass Stuart was talking about.

20   INT. CHANNEL 83 - STAGE    - NIGHT                                20

     Mike takes a call.

                            FEMALE CALLER (O.S.)
                  How dare you burn those books?
                  They've helped my personal life
                  more than --

                  What's your boyfriend's name,
                  princess?

                            FEMALE CALLER (O.S.)
                  I'm not seeing anyone right now
                  but --

     Mike hangs up the phone.

21   INT. ABBY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                        21

     Abby, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing.

     WE INTERCUT between the stage and her apartment, as Mike
     continues his rant.

                            MIKE
                  Men don't fall in love. Men fall in
                  "want." We want things. We're
                  hunters and gatherers. We're the
                  same as we were when we were
                  cavemen and a gillion years of
                  evolution hasn't done squat. Trust
                  me, there was a Pamela Anderson of
                  cave women and all the cave guys
                  were trying to stick their dicks in
                  her.

     Mike walks over to a chalk board with the word "LOVE" on it.
     He crosses it out and writes "LUST."

                            MIKE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  Now girls, if you want to think
                  lust is the same as love, that's
                  fine, but you're delusional. Let's
                  take some more calls.
                      (picks up the phone)
                  You're on the air.

     Abby is now on the phone.

                            ABBY
                  So you're saying men are incapable
                  of love?

                            MIKE
                  Did I burst your little Harlequin
                  Romance bubble?

     Irritated, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed.                 *

                            ABBY
                  The only thing you burst is your
                  credibility. Men are absolutely
                  capable of experiencing love.

                            MIKE
                  Okay, I'll bite. Who's the guy?

                  The guy, Mr. Wonderful, the one
                  who's so capable of love. Who is
                  he? What's he like?

                            ABBY
                  Well, he's not like you, that's for
                  sure.

                            MIKE
                  Thank you very much. Go on.

                  He's smart...he's handsome but

                      (enjoying the fantasy)
                  He's successful, but in a job that
                  means something. He loves red wine,
                  classical music, Cary Grant
                  movies...

                            MIKE
                  This is a guy in America, right?
                  You're not calling from Europe or
                  anything.

                            ABBY
                  Are you interested in listening or
                  not?

                  No, please. I'm loving this.

                             ABBY
                  He works out, not because he's
                  vain, because it's healthy. He's
                  socially liberal but fiscally
                  conservative. He likes dogs but
                  he's a cat person. He never gets
                  out of bed before you on a Sunday
                  morning --

               Why are those qualities so
               threatening to you? Perhaps because
               your complete lack of any one of
               them is the real reason why women
               aren't interested in you. At least
               women of quality.

     Mike scoffs, but he's thrown. He takes a moment, then...

                         MIKE
               Where is this guy? I will give you
               one hundred dollars of my own money
               to bring him down here and let me
               meet him.

               Oh, he's out there...somewhere.

                         MIKE
               Wait a second. You're not even
               dating this guy?!

               Well, no...I'm just describing a
               type...I thought that's what we

     Mike bowls over LAUGHING. Abby realizes she's been had.

               You heard me. You must be. If you

               Yeah, and as you can tell by all
               the screaming rugrats in this town,
               Latino guys like to have a lot of
               sex. Which means they'd rather
               listen to me tell them how to bang
               hot chicks than hear about why they
               can't bring grandma across the

     A KNOCK. Then the door opens and Mike appears.

               Hey, no hard feelings, right?

                         ABBY
               You don't even knock?

                         MIKE
               I knocked. I got no response.

                         ABBY
               So, essentially your knock was
               negated by your complete lack of
               adherence to the social etiquette
               of what follows a knock.

               want Mike Alexander to be nothing
               but a pile of ash on the seat next
               to you. I want the janitor to come
               in with his Dustbuster and vacuum
               up the ashes of Mike Alexander, and
               then when he throws the ashes into
               the dumpster outside, I want the
               rats to vomit and then defecate on

                  about lowering television
                  standards. But many believe that

                  access show, "The Ugly Truth," have
                  brought things to a new low. With
                  that, we welcome Mike Alexander.

                  love and we should stop pretending
                  it is.

               I agree. You've economically
               emasculated your husband to such a
               point that he's afraid to desire
               you. Sure, you can dump his ass,

               Found her.

     Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet.

                         STUART
               One thousand, one hundred and forty-
               seven calls and over three hundred
               E-mails. And fifty-three percent of
               them were women. This guy's a
               lightening rod!

                         ABBY
                   (confused)
               People liked him?!

                         STUART
               Liked him? They loved him.

                         ABBY
               How is that possible?

                         STUART
               I don't know, but I'm scaling back
               the news and giving it to "The Ugly
               Truth." Corporate wants five
               minutes of Mike Alexander, five
               days a week.

                          ABBY
               Stuart, I really think this is a
               mistake --

                  Just keep him happy and both of our
                  contracts will be renewed.

     Mike enters his apartment, throws his keys on the counter and
     hits play on his answering machine.

                  Why haven't you called me? I miss
                  you. It's Laura, by the way.
                  Remember? We went to the track?

                  Remember? How could I forget? You
                  threw up in my car.

     JONAH, 14, awkward, Mike's nephew, walks in.

                            JONAH
                  Dude, you totally hosed me!

                             MIKE

                            JONAH
                  Last week on your show, you said
                  you should always be mean to hot
                  girls because they'll want you
                  more. I tried it today, she cried,
                  and then I got detention.

                  First of all - don't listen to what
                  I say on my show. Second of all,
                  you're supposed to do that to 25-
                  year-old girls who think they're
                  hot and can get any guy they want.
                  Not 14-year-old girls. They're
                  going through puberty. They have
                  enough problems.

                  Mom said when she was fourteen, she
                  was the prettiest girl in the
                  class.

                            MIKE
                  Well, I was there when she was
                  fourteen and let me tell you
                  something -- she lied.

     Mike's sister, ELIZABETH, 40's, walks in, wearing a nurse's
     uniform and holding a cake box.

                            ELIZABETH
                  Don't listen to your Uncle Mike, he
                  was blind from masturbating too
                  much.

                            MIKE
                  Oh, that's a nice thing to tell
                  your son --

                            ELIZABETH
                  It's nothing worse than what he's
                  heard on your show.

     She hands him the cake box.

                            ELIZABETH
                  Let's hope you can clean it up now
                  that you're on a network. Congrats.

     She gives him a kiss on the cheek.      He grins.

                            MIKE
                  Thanks.

     He opens the box.

                            MIKE
                  Promise you'll talk dirty?

     Mike is cut off by Cliff in the booth.

                            CLIFF (O.S.)
                  And camera one. Action Mike.

     Abby slips out of frame just in time. Mike looks to the
     camera.

                            MIKE
                  I'm Mike Alexander and this is "The
                  Ugly Truth," where we'll be taking
                  a few minutes every day to talk
                  about men, women and relationships.
                  Let's start with men. Men are
                  simple. To illustrate my point --
                  on my left we have the best our
                  world has to offer.

     He crosses to -- a CANDLE-LIT TABLE with a fancy dinner
     placed in the center. Several books rest beside it. Beside
     the table, a man plays violin.

                            MIKE (CONT'D)
                  You have a gourmet meal, fine wine,
                  classical music and great
                  literature.

     He picks up a copy of "Ulysses" from the table.

               Now, if you'll follow me we have
               something quite different...

     He starts to walk off the set.

     Now in the control room, Abby panics.

     ...Mike exits the stage door and walks into the alley,
     followed by the confused camera crew.

                         MIKE
               Ah, I see you ladies have started
               without me.

     He smiles at TWO BLONDE TWINS IN BIKINIS, who wrestle in a
     kiddie pool of Jello.

     We INTERCUT with the control room.

                         ABBY
               Who let them on the lot? Don't we
               have security?

     IN THE ALLEY, a security guard watches the girls, smitten.

     Mike smiles to the camera.

                         MIKE
               Babes wrestling in Jello. Let's
               just take a quick survey and see
               which option the men out there
               would pick.

                         ABBY

     As Abby looks horrified, the PHONES in the control room start
     RINGING off the hook. Realizing her defeat, Abby sighs.

                            ABBY
                  Jesus, if we're gonna do this, we
                  might as well milk it.

                  Two, go wide! Good. Ready, one --

     Abby grabs the microphone for Mike's ear piece...

                            ABBY
                  Lick the Jello off her finger!

     ON THE MONITOR -- A slightly puzzled look from Mike, but he
     lifts the girl's finger and licks the Jello off it.

                            ABBY (COMT'D)
                      (into headset)

     The camera focuses tightly on his face.

                            MIKE
                  Mmmm...I was wrong. It's cherry.
                  And that's the ugly truth. Over to
                  you, Georgia.

     As Mike waves to camera, he's pulled into the Jello pool and
     the girls rip off his shirt.

     Mike walks in, covered in Jello, to find Abby standing there,
     arms crossed, quietly containing her rage.

                            ABBY

                  Archbishop Desmond Tutu on this

                            MIKE
                  Who's that?

     Abby rubs her temples.

                            ABBY
                  I can't even illustrate how far
                  I've fallen, because you're not
                  smart enough to get the references.

     She walks off. Confused by her reaction, he follows.

                  to lick the Jello.

                  Do you have any idea how much I

     Abby sighs and follows.

                  It's okay. I've got you.

     D'Artagnan safely in hand, she looks around and notices she's
     just outside a window. She looks in and sees --

     A handsome man in a steamy bathroom taking a shower. This is
     COLIN ANDERSON.

     Abby covers the cat's eyes, then looks away. But a moment
     later, she's looking back in the window, to see --

     Colin step out of the shower. Abby takes a deep breath as he
     crosses to the mirror, giving her a look at his abs.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Oh, my, my...

     towel.

                      (a delighted gasp)

     Suddenly we hear a CRACK, and the branch breaks. Colin looks
     out the window and makes eye contact with Abby just as --

                  Ahhhh!

     D'Artagnan leaps to another branch as Abby falls. As she
     plummets, her foot gets caught between some branches, leaving
     her now HANGING UPSIDE DOWN.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Help!

     The front lights SWITCH ON and Colin, still in a towel, races
     out of his condo. As he runs up to the tree --

                            COLIN
                  Just stay calm. You're gonna be
                  fine.

     The branch breaks.

     She DROPS out of his arms and onto the ground. As she goes,
     his TOWEL GOES WITH HER. Landing on her face.

               Whoops.

     She pulls the towel away and looks up, trying not to make eye
     contact with the one-eyed trouser snake staring back at her.

               Guys, enough with the fan mail.

39   INT. COLIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                                        39

     Unpacked boxes are stacked everywhere. Classical music plays
     on the stereo. Colin, now in sweats and a t-shirt, examines
     Abby's ankle.

                            ABBY
                      (impressed)
                  You're a doctor?

                            COLIN
                  An orthopedic surgeon.

     She glances around the room and sees a bottle of red wine and
     a half empty wine glass sitting on a table.

                            COLIN
                  I do a lot of leg and hip stuff but
                  I do get the occasional foot. You
                  seem to be fine. No sprain.

                            ABBY
                  Well, I guess I'm pretty lucky
                  D'Artagnan picked your tree to
                  climb. Dave in the next unit over
                  sells lawn furniture. I don't know
                  that I would have been as confident
                  with his diagnosis.

                            COLIN
                  I'm here whenever you need me.

     Abby puts on her shoes as Colin opens his wallet and hands
     her a card.

                            COLIN (CONT'D)
                  My home number's on the back. If
                  the ankle starts giving you
                  problems, just give me a call.

     Colin picks up the cat, who starts purring.

                            ABBY
                  Wow, he doesn't usually like men.

                            COLIN
                  Dogs are great, but...well, you're
                  a cat person. You know.

     Abby looks at him, nodding. Delighted at his complete and
     utter perfection.

                            ABBY
                  Well, I guess I should get going
                  now.

     She remains rooted to her spot. He waits a beat then, feeling
     awkward, makes a move to open the door.

                            ABBY (CONT'D)
                  Thanks again for saving me.

                              COLIN
                  Any time.

     She walks out and Colin closes the door. Realizing that he
     still has the cat in his arms, he opens the door to find --

     Abby doing a SPAZZY HAPPY DANCE. Startled, she quickly
     composes herself.

                            COLIN (CONT'D)
                  You forgot your cat.

                            ABBY
                      (re the dance)
                  Oh. Thanks. There was a -- spider.
                  On me. But it's gone now.

     He chuckles, hands her D'Artagnan.

                            COLIN
                  Good night.

     He closes the door.
                                                                   41.

     Abby hates herself.

                         ABBY
               I'm such an idiot --

     She starts doing a SELF-HATING SPAZZY DANCE, mocking her
     previous dance. Just as Colin opens the door again --

                         COLIN
               You alright?

     She freezes.

                         ABBY
               Yes. I'm going now. Good night.

     She walks off, trying to maintain her dignity.

                  Hi, this is Abby Richter calling
                  for Dr. Anderson. Yes, I'll hold.

                            MIKE
                  You're calling the guy?! You can't
                  do that. You've gotta let him call
                  you.

                  Hi Colin. This is Abby. Your
                  neighbor. From last night.

45   INT. COLIN'S OFFICE - DAY                                         45

     Colin, in a white doctor's jacket, talks on the phone while
     going over patient files.

                            COLIN
                  Oh, hi. Everything okay?

     We INTERCUT.

                            ABBY
                  Couldn't be better. I just wanted
                  to call and tell you how much I
                  enjoyed meeting you.

     Mike picks up the extension and listens in. Abby glares at
     him, but she can't stop him.

                            COLIN
                  Oh, thanks.

                            ABBY
                  So... I was just thinking that we
                  should have dinner.

                            COLIN
                      (not great)
                  Oh... great.

     Mike shakes his head, knowing where this is going.

                            ABBY
                  There's this new French Bistro that
                  got fantastic reviews and there's a
                  gallery opening in Old Town on
                  Friday. So, if you want, we could
                  have dinner, then go to the
                  opening.

                            COLIN
                  Hmmm, Friday... wow.

                  Actually, Abby, I'm still kind of
                  unsettled with the move and
                  everything so I`m really not --

     Mike snatches the phone from Abby and hangs it up.

                            ABBY
                  He was not.

     She moves to pick up the phone. Mike sits on the phone to
     stop her.

                            MIKE
                  Don't! He'll be expecting you to
                  call him back. When you don't,
                  he'll call you.

                            ABBY
                  How do you know?

                            MIKE
                  Because I know men. If you want it
                  to work out with this guy, you'll
                  listen to me and do exactly as I
                  say. You already did irreparable
                  damage with your psycho-aggressive
                  control freak phone call. It might
                  even be too late. Even if you do
                  salvage the situation, you'll
                  probably never be more than Abby,
                  his desperate neighbor.

                             ABBY
                  I'm not desperate!
                      (then)
                  Why, did I sound desperate?

                            MIKE
                  Listen to you -- desperately asking
                  me if you sound desperate.

     A concerned look from Abby as...the phone rings. Her caller

                  he's still holding on after thirty
                  more seconds, you may actually have

               Rule number one. Never criticize.

                         ABBY
               Even if it's constructive?

                         MIKE
               Never. Men are incapable of growth,
               change or progress. For men, self-
               improvement ends at toilet-
               training. Rule number two. Laugh at
               whatever he says.

                         ABBY
               What if what he's saying isn't
               funny?

               That's irrelevant. A fake laugh is
               like a fake orgasm.

                         ABBY
               And a fake orgasm is good?

                         MIKE
               No, but a fake orgasm is better
               than no orgasm at all.

                         ABBY
               A fake orgasm is no orgasm.

                            ABBY
                  Okay, I'm trying to decide whether
                  I should just walk away right now,
                  or run.

                            MIKE
                  I know you think Colin is above it
                  all, but he's a guy. If he's even
                  remotely into you, he's thought
                  about each one of your orifices at
                  least ten times.

                            ABBY
                  I love how you assume every man is
                  as perverse as you are.

                            MIKE
                  I don't assume. I know.

50   EXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    50

     Mike and Abby walk along, coffees in hand.

                          MIKE
               Rule number four. Men are very
               visual. Ninety percent of a
               relationship is based on how good
               the woman looks. We have to change
               your look.

                         ABBY
               What's wrong with my look?

                         MIKE
                   (taking her in)
               Sports bras? Khakis? Srunchies?
               Nurse shoes?

                          ABBY
               These aren't nurse shoes! They're
               Lady Keds.

                         MIKE
               Abby, you're a very attractive
               woman but you are completely
               inaccessible. You're all about
               comfort and efficiency.

                         ABBY
               What's wrong with comfort and
               efficiency?

                         MIKE
               Nothing. Except no one wants to
               fuck it.

     With that, a MONTAGE BEGINS...

51   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY                                       51

     Mike and Abby wander through the racks of lingerie.

                         ABBY
               I am not getting breast implants.

                         MIKE
               Size isn't everything. Breasts just
               have to be friendly. They have to
               say, "Hello, everybody! Look at
               me!"

     Abby looks down at her breasts, curiously.

                            MIKE
                  Uh, "I'm reading Tolstoy and I
                  don't want to be disturbed"?

                            ABBY
                  Really? I hate Tolstoy.

     A SALESWOMAN passes them.

                            MIKE (CONT'D)
                  Excuse me ma'am, but we need some
                  bras that will make my friend's
                  boobs say, "Put me in your mouth --
                  I taste good."

     The saleswoman looks disturbed, but hands him a push-up water
     bra.

                            SALESWOMAN
                  This should do the trick.

                            MIKE
                  Sweet.
                      (to Abby)
                  Strap it on, flapjacks.

     Abby glares at him as we CUT TO --

52   INT. SHOE STORE - DAY                                             52

     Abby, wearing high heels, awkwardly makes her way over to
     Mike.

                            ABBY
                  I look like a hooker.

                            MIKE
                  That's a good thing.

     She falls, KNOCKING OVER a large display of shoes.

                            MIKE (cont'd)
                  Well, you're on your back, so that
                  works.

53   INT. HAIR SALON - DAY                                             53

     Abby sits at a rinse chair, while Mike and the HAIRDRESSER
     study her look.

                  You're not touching my hair until I
                  know exactly what you're going to
                  do with it.

                            MIKE
                  We're giving you bedhead.

                            ABBY
                  Why would I want bedhead?

                            MIKE
                  Bedhead is sexy.
                      (re her current hairdo)
                  A ponytail implies that you are
                  either operating heavy machinery or
                  emptying the litter box. Neither of
                  these things inspires an erection.

     The hairdresser shoves her head under the sink and douses her
     with water.

54   EXT. CONDO COMPLEX      - NIGHT                                   54

     Night has fallen on the condo complex.

55   INT. ABBY'S CONDO - LIVING ROOM -      NIGHT                      55

     Mike avoids the cat while waiting in the living room.

                            ABBY (O.S.)
                  I just don't want to be perceived
                  as a bimbo.

                            MIKE
                  I don't want you to be a bimbo. You
                  need to be two people, the saint
                  and the sinner, the librarian and
                  the stripper. It's a delicate
                  balance. On one hand, you have to
                  push the guy away with cold
                  indifference and yet on the other
                  hand be a sexually teasing tornado.

     Abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and
     sling backs. Her hair and make-up are sexy but not trashy.

                             ABBY
                  Well just don't sit there. Say
                  something.

                             MIKE

                  You need glasses.

                            ABBY
                  But I wear contacts. Besides,
                  doesn't the woman usually remove
                  glasses during a makeover?

                             MIKE
                  Yeah, but we're going for a
                  stripper­librarian thing. Right
                  now, I wouldn't trust you to find
                  me a book.

     Abby opens a drawer and takes out some glasses. She puts them
     on.

                  Not bad. Now we need to practice
                  flirting.

                            ABBY
                  I know how to flirt.

                            MIKE
                  Do you want to be an old maid?

                  So, if I don't listen to you, I'll

                      (acting old)
                  "My name's Abby and I'm arthritic
                  and alone. I have eighteen cats who
                  keep me company."

                  "Are you wearing underwear?"

     She grabs his ass.

               Do you want to go the Lobos game on
               Saturday?

     She looks at Mike in amazement, then breaks into the happy
     dance. He watches, horrified at her spazziness.

                         MIKE
               What the hell is that?!

     As she continues to dork out, we CUT TO --

     The ROAR of the crowd at the Lobos game.

     Colin walks with Abby, who adjusts something in her ear. Now
     she's wearing the earpiece from the station, and on the other
     end...

     MIKE'S POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -- A different angle of Abby
     walking down the aisle.

                         MIKE
               Nod if you can hear me.

     BINOCULARS POV -- Abby nods.

                  Just relax. You're gonna be fine.
                  I'll walk you through this.

     Colin looks at Abby and smiles as they take their seats,               *
     popcorn in hand.                                                       *

                  Do you follow baseball?

     We INTERCUT with Mike.

                            MIKE
                  There's no right answer to that
                  question. Do something non-
                  committal...

     Abby does something between a nod and shaking her head. Colin
     hooks at her, confused.

                            COLIN
                  I'm really more of a fair weather
                  fan myself. I do like watching Mike
                  DeLoggia pitch, though. Amazing
                  bone structure.

                               MIKE
                  Laugh.

     Abby is baffled but proceeds to laugh awkwardly. Colin looks
     at her.

                            COLIN
                  What's so funny?

                               ABBY

                               COLIN
                  What joke?

                            MIKE
                  Shit, he was serious?

     Feeling a popcorn kernel in her teeth, Abby takes out her              *
     floss.                                                                 *

               Yeah. I was just trying to get us a

               Alright, we need a recovery. Make
               sure to eat your hot dog slowly.

     Unbeknownst to them, the batter hits a pop fly near them.

     THE JUMBOTRON CAMERA follows the guy catching the fly, then
     finds Abby and Colin. PANS over to them and --

     It looks like Abby is giving Colin an enthusiastic HAND JOB.

     The ENTIRE STADIUM, ballplayers included, stop what they're

     Then, she turns around and rushes over to --

     MIKE. She throws her arms around him, embracing him.

                            ABBY
                  You did it! You did it!

     Mike pulls back, a little uncomfortable.

                             MIKE
                  I didn't do anything. It was you.
                  Don't ask me why, but I think he
                  likes you.

                            ABBY
                  He's really a great guy, isn't he?

                            MIKE
                  Yeah, he's dreamy.

                             ABBY
                  And he fits all ten criteria on my
                  checklist!

               pretty much being gay?

     Abby puts her key in the door.

                         ABBY
               I'm going to ignore that because
               I'm in a very good mood.

                         MIKE
               Yeah, I heard, wet crotch.

     Abby rolls her eyes with a smile and goes inside. As Mike is
     walking away, he turns back for a moment, then keeps walking.

59   INT. ELIZABETH'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -       NIGHT                59

     Jonah and Mike sit on the couch, playing "Fight Night."

                         JONAH
               So, no date tonight?

                         MIKE
               As a matter of fact, I did have a
               date. It wasn't mine, but it was a
               date. I was helping out a friend.

                         JONAH
               Guy or girl?

                           MIKE
               Girl.

                         JONAH
               Ooh...is she hot?

               She would be if she were less
               irritating.

                         JONAH
               So she likes to make fun of your
               clothes and stuff?

                         MIKE
               No, actually I make fun of hers'.

               You told me not to do that.

                  That's right. And you should listen

                            JONAH
                  If you know so much about chicks,
                  why are you sitting here playing
                  "Fight Night" with me when you
                  could be out with the Jello girls?

                  Because this is better.

     Elizabeth enters, wearing a pair of sweats and carrying her
     laptop. She hands Mike a digital camera.

                            ELIZABETH
                  Hurry, take a picture of me. I'm
                  online with Fugly35 and he wants to
                  know what i look like.

                  You really want to go out with a

                  He's being ironic. Look, he's hot.

     She holds up her laptop. Mike peers at it.

                            MIKE
                  Uh...look closer. That's Jim
                  Morrison. Who I'm pretty sure
                  isn't an accountant in Rio Rancho.

                            ELIZABETH
                  Shit. Are you serious?

     Jonah holds out his hand to his mom.

     A cage of randy Bonobos getting it on. Mike, in a gorilla
     suit, does a segment. Next to him is an anthropologist, DR.
     LESTER.

                            DR. LESTER
                  Of all primates, Bonobos are the
                  closest relatives to human beings,
                  both genetically and socially ­-
                  especially when it comes to sex.
                  For the Bonobo, sex is a way to
                  ease stress and diffuse tensions.

                            MIKE
                  So summing up Bonobo-land, the
                  chicks look great, get freaky in
                  bed and in turn, they get to sit on
                  their asses and boss their men
                  around all day.

                            DR. LESTER
                  That's one way of looking at it.

                            MIKE
                  If that's not an argument for
                  evolution, I don't know what is.

     He winks at the camera as --

                  I can't. I have a date with Colin.

                            MIKE
                  We'll pick him up on the way.

                            ABBY
                  Mike, I'm not going on your dinner.

                             MIKE
                  So, if it doesn't go well and they
                  cut the segment and the ratings go
                  back down to negative fourteen and
                  they cancel the show, you're cool
                  with that?

     Abby thinks a moment, then --

                  Let me get my purse.

65   EXT. COLIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                                        65

     Colin opens the door to find Abby standing there.

                            COLIN
                  Hey, you're early --

                            ABBY
                  Yeah...

     Mike pops out from behind Abby.

                            MIKE
                  I'm Mike. Change in plans. Grab
                  your keys. We gotta go.

     As Colin looks confused, we CUT TO --

     Mike's driving. In the passenger seat, Abby turns to Colin,
     who sits in the back.

                            ABBY
                  We'll just stay for one drink. I'm
                  really sorry about this.

                            COLIN
                  No worries.
                      (to Mike)
                  Are you a news producer as well?

                  So you're one of the anchors?

                      (to Abby)

                  Not everyone wants to start their
                  day by watching you rant about
                  implants and g-strings.

                      (to Mike)
                  You talk about g-strings?

67   INT. SAFFRON - BAR AREA - NIGHT                                   67

     As Abby, Mike and Colin walk into the bar, two buxom blonde
     twin JELLO GIRLS, BAMBI and CANDI, rush up to Mike.

                            MIKE
                  Hey, ladies. You're looking quite
                  fetching.

                              BAMBI
                  Hi, Mike!

                            CANDI
                  Do you like my dress?

     She leans over and displays her cleavage.

                            ABBY
                      (displeased)
                  Are these the Jello Girls?

                            MIKE
                  Yeah, they're my dates.

     She tries to control her displeasure, as Stuart walks in with
     two guys in suits, BOB and HAROLD, in their 50's.

                            STUART
                  Hey, the gang's all here! Abby, you
                  know Harold and Bob.

     They slap him on the back, eyeing the twins.

                            HAROLD
                  And who are these lovely ladies?

68   INT. SAFFRON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                68

     The group sits down at the table.

                            MIKE
                  So, you guys here to give me a
                  raise, or what?

     UNDER THE TABLE

     Abby tries to kick Mike. As she does, she unwittingly knocks
     over her purse. The contents spill out and the REMOTE for
     her vibrating underwear rolls away, stopping UNDER THE TABLE
     NEXT TO THEM.

     AT THE NEXT TABLE

     A PRECOCIOUS KID, 8, sits with his parents. Bored out of his
     skull. When the remote rolls under his feet, the kid picks
     it up and flicks the switch. A small RED LIGHT turns on.

     AT ABBY'S TABLE

     As Harold and Bob laugh, Stuart slaps Mike on the back.

                            STUART
                  That's my guy. Always with the
                  jokes.

     Abby turns to Bob and Harold.

                            ABBY
                  We're really excited about the
                  ratings increase this year. Next
                  quarter we hope to --

     Suddenly, her smile quickly changes to horror.

     She shifts in her seat, trying to control her NOW-VIBRATING
     UNDERWEAR.

                            COLIN
                  What's wrong?

                               ABBY
                  Nothing...

     She leans down to grab her purse.

     UNDER THE TABLE

     She pokes her head under the table to see that the contents
     of her purse have spilled. Mike's head appears next to hers.

                            MIKE
                  What are you doing?

                            ABBY
                  I'm looking for the remote.

                            MIKE
                  What remote?

                            ABBY
                      (gritting her teeth)
                  For...the...underwear.

     Mike starts laughing.

                            MIKE
                  You're wearing them? Now?

     She writhes again, hitting her head on the bottom of the
     table.

     AT THE TABLE

     Stuart watches, worried, as Abby rises from underneath the
     table, clutching her head and looking around frantically,
     trying to figure out who has the remote.

     AT THE NEXT TABLE

     The kid has flicked up the speed on the remote even higher.

     Abby's eyes roll back. She looks like she's on three hits of
     ecstasy.

                         STUART
               Hold on. Tell Harold about the new
               teaser campaign we're starting next
               week.
                   (to Harold)
               You're going to love this.

               Yeah, Abby. Tell us about the
               teasers.

     Abby glares at Mike and sits back down.

               Well, it's fifteen seconds...each
               hour.

     As she fumbles, Mike spots the kid at the next table, remote
     in hand. He starts to get up but --

                         ABBY (cont'd)
               They're very -- oh!

     Abby grabs Mike's arm, yanking him back down, in the throes
     of panic and pleasure.

                         ABBY (cont'd)
               Mike! -- Wait! You -- tell them.

     She looks into his eyes, imploring.

               Actually, I'm really enjoying the
               way you're telling them.

     Candi looks at Harold, intrigued by Abby's display.

                         CANDI
               What's in a ceviche?

     As Stuart frowns, concerned, Abby spasms, then rushes through
     it as fast as she can.

               Dude, you got me laid three times
               last month. Drinks are on me.

                         MIKE
               Just doing my job.

     Just then a CUTE BRUNETTE in a tight t-shirt and ridiculously
     gynormous implants walks up.

                         CUTE BRUNETTE
               I got implants, just like you said!

                         MIKE
                   (horrified)
               Indeed you did.

                         DWAYNE
               Here's to implants!

     Steve clinks his beer bottle against Mike's.

                         STEVE
               You're a rock star, bro.

     A waiter takes Colin and Abby's order.

                            WAITER
                  A bottle of water to start?

                            COLIN
                  Yes, a bottle of flat, please.

     She starts to say something, then smiles at the waiter.

                            ABBY
                  I'll have one, too.

     Colin smiles at her as THE MONTAGE ENDS.

                  The Balloon Fiesta is coming up,
                  so, I was thinking for sweeps, we
                  could do a segment on "how men are
                  full of hot air."

     He doesn't answer.

                  I was kidding --

     Mike isn't even listening. He's watching a trashy redhead at
     the bar. Abby notices.

                            ABBY (cont'd)
                  Colin would never like a girl like
                  that.

                            MIKE
                  I forgot, Colin only likes "women
                  of quality."

                            ABBY
                  Exactly my point. Man-whores want
                  women who wear slutty clothes and
                  suck lots of cock.

                             MIKE
                  Every man wants that. And for your
                  information, I was only with the
                  one who can read.
                      (then)
                  Did you just say cock?

                  What? I can say cock. You don't own
                  that word. Cock. There. I said it
                  again.

                             MIKE
                  A week ago you cried at the thought
                  of a vibrator. Now you're all "cock
                  this,""cock that."
                      (then)
                  You had sex with Colin, didn't you?

     Mike holds up a glass.

                         MIKE
               Here's to overturning assumptions.
               I'm really a man of discriminating
               taste and you're a foul-mouthed
               slut.

                         MIKE
               So there you have it. Never assume
               a girl is easy, or assume she's a
               prude. There are many layers in
               between and it's your job,
               gentlemen, to peel back those
               layers and figure out exactly what
               type of woman you are dealing with.

     NEARBY, a confused Joy looks at Abby.

                         JOY
               What happened to him? That sounded
               almost enlightened.

     Abby doesn't know weather to be pleased or worried.

                         MIKE
               Because once you do peel back those
               layers, my friends, her lady garden
               awaits. And I'm pretty sure you're
               gonna want to fertilize that patch
               of petunias. And that there is the
               Ugly Truth.

                         JOY
               And -- he's back.

                  petunias are going to see any
                  rainfall this weekend.

                  flower-vagina metaphors. Georgia
                  O'Keefe would be so pleased.

     At this, a slick AGENT in a suit, 30's, walks up and slaps
     Mike on the shoulder.

85   INT. TOWN CAR - DAY                                               85

     Abby and Mike sit in the backseat.      Abby looks down at her
     notes.

                            ABBY
                  Okay, so let's go over the pre-
                  interview questions.

     Mike studies her.

                            MIKE
                  I'm sorry you didn't get to meet
                  little Colin this weekend. And by
                  little, I don't mean undersized,
                  although I highly suspect that's
                  the case.

                            ABBY
                  Really? Colin's penis? That's what
                  you want to talk about right now? I
                  was thinking maybe we should talk
                  about what you're gonna say on the
                  show.
                      (doing Jay)
                  So, tell me Mike. How did "The Ugly
                  Truth" start?

                            MIKE
                  Well, Jay, I had a sales job where
                  I drove around a lot, listening to
                  talk radio. I started calling in
                  and lo and behold, people liked
                  what I had to say. Then I decided
                  what the hell, I need my own show.
                  I have a message people need to
                  hear.

     Abby rolls her eyes, still angry with him.

                  Yes -- thousands of lives are being
                  enriched by your wisdom.

                            MIKE
                  Excuse me, lady, but you have a
                  boyfriend right now because of me.

                            ABBY
                  It may have started because of you,
                  but it's lasted because of me.

                            MIKE
                  So, you've been acting like your
                  normal control freak psycho self in
                  front of him?

                            ABBY
                  I'm not a control freak.

                            MIKE
                  When you checked into the hotel,
                  did you or did you not insist on
                  getting an "Eastern-facing" room on
                  "a floor not below seven"?

                  I like rising with the sun. And a
                  view.

                            MIKE
                  My point is, Colin likes the Mike
                  version of Abby, not the Abby
                  version of Abby. So, don't go
                  knocking my words of wisdom when
                  you're living proof that they work.

     Abby sits there, fuming that he's right.

                  I could be having sex right now --

     A "Tonight Show" handler in a headset readies a visibly
     nervous Mike backstage. Mike's Agent stands next to him,
     giving him a pep talk as Abby watches skeptically.

                  Dude, this is awesome. You're about
                  to go on Leno! NBC is going to give
                  you the moon --

     Mike shoots him a "shut up" look. Abby pretends not to
     notice.

                            AGENT
                  -- in a gift basket, of course.

                            MIKE
                  This isn't helping.

                            AGENT
                  Just do what you always do.

                            MIKE
                  What do I always do?

                  You entertain people with your
                  moronery. And they love you for it.

     Mike looks at her, surprised.

                            MIKE
                  That might be the nicest thing
                  you've ever said to me.

                            ABBY
                  Your welcome.

     She smiles at him. Looking a little calmer, he smiles back
     at Abby. The Agent rolls his eyes. The handler gives Mike
     the nod, as we HEAR --

                            JAY LENO (O.S.)
                  And that was Kiku, the penguin that

                            JAY
                  So what's your number one piece of
                  advice to all the people out there
                  who are trying to find love?

                            MIKE
                  Don't do it. Try to find lust
                  instead. It's a lot easier and a
                  lot less messy. Blue balls only
                  last a few hours. A broken heart
                  can last years.

     The audience reacts with hollers and cheers. Abby shakes her
     head.

                            JAY
                  So, what's her name?

                            MIKE
                  Who?

                            JAY
                  The girl who screwed you up. She
                  must have been a doozy.

     Mike looks a bit taken aback, but recovers quickly.

                            MIKE
                  Like I said, better a floozy than a
                  doozy.

     Abby cocks her head, intrigued by Mike's reaction.

                            JAY
                  Well, what do you say to guys like
                  me who have been happily married
                  for twenty-seven years? We can't be
                  the exception to the rule, can we?
                  There's plenty of us out there.

                            MIKE
                  Well, Jay, let me tell ya --

     He hesitates, then looks at Abby for a moment. She gives him
     an encouraging nod. He gains confidence, and continues.

                            MIKE
                  Marriage starts off great. She's
                  cute, you're cute, the world's
                  cute. Nothing can burst your bubble
                  of everlasting love.

               months. By year twenty, you've

               occasion that you actually do make
               love, she probably thinks about
               Jake Gyllenhaal.

     Jay looks stricken, going along with the bit.

                  It wasn't just one...it was more
                  like a parade. By the time I hit
                  thirty, I realized you can only
                  have so many bad relationships
                  before you figure out there's no
                  such thing as a good one.

                  To my very core.

     Just then, the waitress walks up.

                  Just bring us tap water.

     She nods and leaves. Abby stares at him.

                         ABBY
               So I've been told.

     He stands up.

                         MIKE
               C'mon, let's dance.

                         ABBY
               I don't think so.

                         MIKE
               I'm serious. I've seen your spazzy
               dance, now I want to see the real
               thing.

     Abby looks out at the dance floor, seeing that even the worst
     dancers are great.

                         ABBY
               I can't dance like that.

                           MIKE
               I can.

     Mike grabs her hand and leads her onto --

91   INT. EL FLORADITA - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT                           91

     Mike and Abby make their way onto the crowded dance floor.

                         MIKE
               You'll be fine.

     Abby looks at him, sure that he's about to make a fool of
     them both.

     Then, he takes her in his arms, completely self-assured, and
     starts leading her in a salsa dance and...

     ...he's good. But not just good. Great.

     She follows his moves, half-shocked and half-turned on. He
     pulls her in a bit closer, and for the first time, she allows
     herself to be led without trying to control the situation.

     For about five seconds.          Then she looks at her watch.

                            ABBY (cont'd)
                  We've got an early flight tomorrow.

     Mike and Abby ride up the elevator.

                  So the car's picking us up
                  downstairs at eight. You want me to
                  call you?

                            MIKE
                  I'll get a wake up call.

                               ABBY
                  Good idea.

     There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.

                            ABBY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I had a great time.

                               MIKE
                  Me, too.

     The elevator comes to a stop.

     They hug. It's long hug. They give a quick kiss.

                  Good night.

     Mike starts out the elevator, then returns, grabbing Abby.
     And suddenly --

     They're ALL OVER EACH OTHER.

     In the midst of this, the elevators try to close but their
     furious groping blocks it, until --

     A shrill BUZZING begins. They abruptly step apart staring at
     each other.

                            MIKE (cont'd)
                  So, I guess I should --

                             ABBY
                  Yeah.

     Mike backs out of the elevator, looking shell-shocked. The
     doors close. Abby is flushed and stunned.

                             ABBY (cont'd)
                  Wow.

                  What the hell was that? And why do
                  I want to do it again?

     There's a KNOCK at the door. She leaps up, smooths her hair,
     checks her reflection, and goes to the door. Opening it with
     a smile, she finds --

     Standing there, bottle of red wine in hand, is... Colin.

                             COLIN
                  Miss me?

     It takes a moment for Abby to adjust.

                  Since you couldn't come to Santa
                  Fe, I decided to come to you.

                  Nothing. I'm just so -- surprised
                  to see you.

                            COLIN
                  Well, you told me you were
                  spontaneous. Guess the proof is in
                  the pudding.

                  Whoops. Looks like we'll have to
                  get naked sooner than I thought.

                  Sorry, about that. He was upset

                To be honest, I didn't like the way
                you poured the wine. I would have
                decanted it. And I was editing that
                speech as you were giving it.

     She looks around.

                Plus, this bed should be facing

                I haven't been myself for one
                second of the two weeks and five
                days we've been dating.

                          COLIN
                Then who have you been?

     Abby paces in front of the gate and checks her watch, while
     talking on her cell phone.

                And you're sure he checked out?
                Okay, thanks.

     She hangs up the phone. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches her.

                           FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                Miss, we're going to need you to
                board now.

     Resigned, she picks up her bag and walks on board.

                   Morning, Freddy.

      The security guard just looks at her and shakes his head,
      disappointed. Stuart rushes up to her.

                             STUART
                   I thought you said we had him.

                   He quit this morning. I got a smug
                   call from Channel 4 saying they
                   closed a deal with him. Corporate's
                   having a shit fit. What the hell
                   happened?

      Abby is hurt and stunned, but overcomes it with fierce and
      abiding hatred.

                             ABBY
                   We don't need Mike Alexander. He's
                   a dime a dozen.

                             STUART
                   You better hope so, because you're
                   going to find me a new one by the

      Abby and Joy walk through the waiting area, which is filled
      with MIKE ALEXANDER REPLACEMENT HOPEFULS of all different
      shapes and sizes. Abby points at candidates, while Joy makes
      notes on a clipboard.

                   I still can't believe that you
                   broke up with Colin.

      Channel 4's brighter and more expensive stage, with a
      prominent logo for "MORNING MAYHEM WITH MIKE!"

      Mike, dressed in an Armani suit, glandhands the Channel 4

      Mike, in his suit, walks up the front steps. Jonah sits on a
      lawn chair, drinking a soda and watching --

      IN THE NEARBY VALLEY

      Hundreds of multi-colored, multi-shaped HOT AIR BALLOONS are
      aloft.

                          JONAH
                Dude, check it out. Balloon Fiesta.

                          JONAH

                New station. New wardrobe.

                          JONAH
                You're never going to get any pussy
                looking like that.

                          MIKE
                Look at me, Jonah. I'm 38, I'm
                still single, I live alone... Does
                it look like it's all working out?
                If there's one thing you don't want
                to be, it's like me.

      As he opens the door and goes inside, Jonah calls out --

                          JONAH
                I'm pretty sure you don't want to
                open your new show with that.

                   Most of you are watching this show
                   so you can learn how to get chicks.
                   Let me assure you, you're in good
                   hands. You're looking at a guy

                   We're here at the Balloon Fiesta,
                   and I'm supposed to be telling you
                   men are full of hot air, but I
                   think we all know, it's the ladies
                   that are full of crap. Just because
                   she says no, doesn't mean she means
                   no.

      At this Jack Magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon
      basket. After a moment --

      A frazzled ABBY pops up in his place.

                   no longer be able to do "The Ugly
                   Truth" segment. Which should really
                   come as no surprise. Because men

                       (into phone)
                   Hey, Harold. Yes, I know -- we're

                   Take Mike Alexander, for instance.
                   He up and quit the show without so
                   much as a word. You think you know
                   what men are going to do, you think
                   you know what they want to do...but
                   when it comes down to the moment
                   where they actually have to nut up,
                   they turn around and do something
                   completely different.

                Oh, I'm all over this.

      He races out, as Jonah calls after him.

                The big, strong, romantic men we've
                been reading about in novels and
                watching in movies since we were
                nine? They're fallacies. "Blue
                Lagoon" is a total freakin' lie.
                Men are not strong. Men are not
                brave. Men are afraid.

                          ABBY
                Even if they have a moment in a
                hotel elevator that's totally
                romantic and filled with potential,
                men are completely incapable of
                copping to it. Because men are
                weak.

                          MIKE (O.S.)
                Let me tell you something about
                women.

      She turns to see --

      MIKE standing there. He pushes past Joy and climbs into the
      balloon. Grabbing the mic from Abby's hand.

                            ABBY
                Hey --

                          MIKE
                    (ignoring her; to camera)
                Women would have us believe that
                they are the victims. They aren't.
                They want us to think that we break
                their hearts for sport. That's
                crap. They say they want romance.
                They say they want true love, but
                all they want is a checklist. Is he
                perfect? Is he handsome? Is he a
                doctor?

                   That is not true.

      BY THE CAMERAMAN, Joy shrugs.

                             JOY
                   Well, kinda true.

      Mike continues his rant.

                             MIKE
                   You men that fit the criteria --
                   don't kid yourselves. They're not
                   sleeping with you. They're sleeping
                   with a carefully calculated set of
                   venal choices. Money over
                   substance. Looks over soul. Polish
                   over principles. No gesture, no
                   matter how real or romantic, will
                   ever compensate for a really
                   impressive list of credentials.

                   Says the man who's never made a
                   gesture except for this one --

      She makes the universally known "jack-off" hand gesture.

                             MIKE
                   So, the elevator wasn't a gesture?

                             ABBY
                   The elevator was a moment of
                   passion, followed by a moment of
                   panic on your part, apparently.

                I came by your room!

                          ABBY
                And then you ran away.

                          MIKE
                Well, that wasn't panic,
                sweetheart. It was an unwillingness
                to compete with the walking
                checklist that was in your bed. You
                should be thanking me.

      NEARBY, Joy taps her watch.

                          JOY
                We have ten seconds.

      An OVERZEALOUS BALLOON PILOT walks up.

                          PILOT
                Are we ready to soar up, up and
                away?

      IN THE BASKET, Mike looks at the camera.

                          MIKE
                And that's the Ugly Truth, folks. A
                girl in heat for two guys will
                always pick the one with the better
                resume.

      BEHIND HIM, the Pilot silently boards the balloon.

                That is bullsh --

      The TORCH of the BALLOON is suddenly fired, covering her FBC
      violation.

      The cameraman follows the balloon as it slowly starts to
      rise.

                          MIKE
                No, you hate yourself for being so
                shallow.

                             PILOT

      Abby and Mike spin around to look at him.       Realizing the
      balloon is now soaring upwards.

                          MIKE

                What a shock. You're bailing.

                          PILOT
                I wouldn't recommend that...

      Mike looks down to see --

      They are now FIFTEEN FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. And rising.         He
      stops climbing, as the balloon continues to float up and

      at opposite ends of the sky, hating that they are trapped
      together.

                          MIKE

                you and Colin had having sex in Los

      Georgia and Larry look at each other.

      Abby stares at Mike.

                          ABBY
                I am not a psycho.

                          MIKE
                I just told you I loved you and all
                you heard was "psycho". You are the
                definition of neurotic.

                           ABBY
                The definition of neurotic is a
                person who suffers from anxiety,
                obsessional thoughts, compulsive
                acts and physical ailments without
                having any objective evidence of
                disease --

                          MIKE
                Again, I just told you I'm in love
                with you and you're standing here
                giving me a vocabulary lesson.
                    (to the Pilot)
                Back me up on this, buddy...who
                here is afraid?

                           PILOT
                I'm just going to drink my
                champagne.

                           ABBY
                     (skeptical)
                You're in love with me.      Really.
                Why?

                          MIKE
                Beats the shit out of me, but I am.

      Abby opens her mouth, about to make a retort, then realizes
      what's been said to her. For the first time in her life, she
      stops thinking and --

      Grabs Mike and kisses the hell out of him. The sheer force of
      her kissing THROWS them into the pilot, causing --

      The torch to FLAME radically.

      The balloon WHOOSHES upwards.
                                                                115.

      An elated Stuart picks up the phone.

                    (into phone)
                Joy, how do you feel about a
                promotion?

      On the phone, Joy hi-fives the cameraman, then quickly
      composes herself.

                          JOY
                    (into phone)
                I feel good about it.

      Abby finally loosens her grip on Mike. Hair askew, he looks a
      little like he's been hit by a cyclone.

                          ABBY
                    (breathless)
                If you say "just kidding", I'm
                going to throw you out of this
                balloon and watch your body
                splatter to the ground.

                          MIKE
                Are you going to threaten me with
                death when we have sex? Because it
                might be distracting.

      The Pilot looks worried for his safety.

                          PILOT
                May I suggest you wait until we
                land?

      Abby and Mike keep kissing as the balloon sails into the
      sunset, and we FADE TO BLACK, then CUT TO --

133   EXT. BOTANICAL GARDENS - DAY                                     133

      CLOSE ON Mike, as he addresses the camera. He holds a mic,
      wears a tuxedo and speaks in a hushed voice.

                             MIKE
                   As many of you know, sometimes a
                   guy's gotta admit what he thought
                   was the truth isn't necessarily the
                   whole truth. Yes, women have a
                   checklist, but sometimes that list
                   includes a foul-mouthed idiot who
                   took way too long to realize he was
                   in love.
                       (holds up a finger)
                   Let's continue this conversation in
                   a second.

      WE PULL BACK to REVEAL --

      Mike is standing in a garden with rows and rows of WEDDING
      GUESTS seated behind him. An altar with flowers and a
      minister wait patiently.

      Mike gestures for the camera to follow him as he makes his
      way up to the altar.

      As he arrives he greets his groomsman, JONAH, also wearing a
      tux. He only has eyes for Joy, Abby's bridesmaid.

                             JONAH
                       (to Joy)
                   Has anyone ever told you you have a
                   stupendous bosom?

                             JOY
                   Not lately, so feel free to say it
                   again.

      A string quartet's version of "HERE COMES THE BRIDE" begins,
      as we PAN OVER to see --

      ABBY, in a wedding dress, about to make her way up the aisle.
      Looking absolutely beautiful.

                             MIKE
                       (wowed; to camera)
                   Zoom in on this, guys. I want the
                   whole city to see how lucky I am.

      The cameraman ZOOMS IN on Abby, as she catches Mike's eye and
      smiles.

      IN THE AUDIENCE, Elizabeth takes photo after photo. Her date
      -- a dead ringer for Jim Morrison -- looks at her, amused.

                What? No one's ever going to
                believe this. I need proof.

      AT THE ALTAR, Abby finally arrives and looks at Mike.

                          ABBY
                    (re the cameras)
                What's this?

                          MIKE
                Hope you don't mind, but we're
                live.

                          ABBY
                    (re the cameraman)
                No, what's Jorge doing so close?
                We need a master.

                          MIKE
                    (surprised)
                You knew about this?

                          ABBY
                Hello...I'm the producer. It's
                sweeps week. How do you think I
                got them to pay for this?

      She gestures to -- BOB and HAROLD from Corporate, who sit in
      the audience.

      Mike looks momentarily surprised, then --

                          MIKE
                God, I love you.

      He turns to the camera.

                          MIKE
                So, here it is, guys. The games,
                the manipulation, the ploys, the
                tactics... all the things we do to
                think we're in control. But guess
                what? We never are.

      Abby leans over his shoulder.

                          ABBY
                    (to the camera)
                Isn't it beautiful?

           The collectables and knick-knacks.
           Feel the weight as it adds up. Now,
           start adding the larger stuff. Your
           clothes, table top appliances,

          Steve in a small meeting.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           ...or passed me in the hall...
                         
                         
          INT. ELEVATOR BRIDGE - DAY
                         
          Steve passes a female coworker.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           ... or told me a story in the break
           room....

          Steve laughs at a coworker's story.

           RYAN (V.O.)
           And that's because I don't work
           here. I work for another company
           that lends me out to pussies like
           Steve's boss...

          Steve's BOSS sits at his desk. Subtitle reads - "A Big Pussy"
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           ... who don't have the balls to
           sack their own employees. And in
           some cases, for good reason.
           Because, people do crazy shit when
           they get fired.

          Steve shreds sensitive documents.
                         
          Steve pours bleach into the communal coffee pot.
                         
          Steve loads an assault rifle. He stands up to get a view of
          his coworkers on a coffee break.

           RYAN (V.O.)
           And that's where I come in.
                         
                          STEVE
           What did I... do? What could I have
           done differently here?
                         
                          RYAN
           This is not an assessment of your
           productivity. It's important not to
           personalize this.
                         
          Steve scoffs at this.
                         
          Ryan slides Steve a PACKET.
           5.
                         
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Steve, I want you to review this
           packet. Take it seriously. I think
           you're going to find a lot of
           answers in there.
                         
                          STEVE
                          (DISMISSIVE)
           Oh, I'm sure it's going be really
           helpful.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Look, anybody who ever built an
           empire, or changed the world, sat
           where you are now. And it's because
           they sat there that they were able
           to do it.
                         
          And just for a moment, Steve looks hopeful.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I'm going to need your key card.
                         
                          STEVE
           Right...
                         
          Steve begins removing it from his wallet.
                         
                          RYAN
           Take the day. Put together your
           personal things. Talk to your co-
           workers. Tomorrow, go out and get
           some exercise. Go for a jog. Give
           yourself routines and pretty soon
           you'll find your legs.
                         
          Steve nods and gets up to leave. Just as he's about to walk
          out, he stops and turns back.
                         
                          STEVE
           Wait, how do I get in touch with you?
                         
                          RYAN
           Don't worry. We'll be in touch
           soon. This is just the beginning.
                         
          Steve nods and exits the room.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           I'll never see Steve again.

          INT. RYAN'S ROOM - PHOENIX HILTON - DAY
                         
          The choreography of Ryan's packing is worthy of Tchaikovsky.
                         
          A coat slides off a hanger... A travel toothbrush folds
          closed like a switchblade... A briefcase clicks onto a roll-
          away bag... A hand flips a light switch without looking.
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY, PHOENIX HILTON - DAY
                         
          Ryan is at the check out desk.
                         
                          CHECKOUT GIRL
           Do you have your Hilton Honors Card
           with you?
                         
          Ryan smiles... "Do I?"
                         
          He hands it to her, close enough to camera, that we get a
          nice big close up of it. She runs the card and the screen
          pops up with information that makes her blush.
                         
                          CHECKOUT GIRL
           Oh my God... Do you like, live, at
           the Hilton?
                         
          Ryan nods in faux modesty.
                         
                         
          EXT. OUTDOOR CAR RETURN, HERTZ RENT-A-CAR - DAY
                         
          Ryan pulls up to one of the spaces marked with the #1 GOLD
          PRESIDENTS CLUB emblem. He hops out and a uniformed man with a
          handheld device begins to punch in the license plate number.
                         
          Ryan pulls out his HERTZ PRESIDENTS CLUB CARD and places it
          nice and close to lens so we can see it.
                         
          The card slides through the handheld device and we see the
          DIGITAL NUMBER increase by a few thousand points.
                         
                         
          INT. MAIN CONCOURSE, PHOENIX SKY HARBOR INTL AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          The automated GLASS DOORS slide open. Ryan enters the
          concourse and takes a deep breath of the temperately
          controlled air. He has arrived.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           This is where I live.

          Ryan skips the long lines and steps directly into the
          AAdvantage Executive Platinum line.
                         
          Glorious close-up of Ryan's AAdvantage Executive Platinum
          CARD sliding through the AUTOMATED MACHINE. Were it any
          sexier, we'd hear a moan. Maybe we even do.
                         
          Immediately, the AIRPORT CLERK registers and perks up.
                         
                          AIRPORT CLERK
           Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           When I run my card, the system
           automatically prompts the desk
           clerk to greet me with this exact
           statement.
                         
          We see it again...
                         
                          AIRPORT CLERK
           Pleasure to see you again, Mr. Bingham.
                         
          Ryan nods back to the clerk.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           Had my status simply been gold or
           God-forbid, silver. I might have
           gotten a hello or a smile... Maybe.
                         
          Ryan continues to hit buttons, swiftly checking in.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           Loyalty is earned and rewarded with
           these small touches. It's these kinds
           of systemized friendly touches that
           keep my world in orbit.
                         
          A ticket begins printing. Ryan snaps it up.
                         
                         
          INT. SECURITY - PHOENIX SKY HARBOR INTL AIRPORT - SAME
                         
          Ryan steps up and observes his line choices. He finds a few
          Asian businessmen and hops in behind them.

          RYAN MOVING THROUGH THE SECURITY SCREENING
                         
          It's a beautiful choreographed ballet of a bag handle
          collapsing, shoes coming off, a laptop going in a separate
          tray, wallet and watch sliding into a shoe, a boarding card
          sliding into a back pocket... both hands always moving,
          performing separate actions... It really is gorgeous.

          Ryan enters and presents his ADMIRALS CLUB CARD. It has a
          hologram. The ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS immediately smiles.
                         
           ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS
           Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.
                         
          Ryan walks past a stack of newspapers on the way to the
          buffet, the whole time framed by an enormous window
          overlooking the tarmac.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           All the things you probably hate
           about travelling - The recycled air.
           The artificial lighting. The digital
           juice dispensers and mini pizzas
           stacked to their heat lamps are the
           warm reminders that I am home.
                         
          With that comment, Ryan slides into a leather club seat. A
          DIGITAL DISPLAY reads: "Thank You For Your Loyalty".
                         
          He opens his briefcase and pulls out his ITINERARY. He scans
          it. We see a string of flights, car rentals, and stays at
          Hitons. Then, something makes him frown. He pulls out his
          cell phone and dials...

           We start chatting, impersonally at

           You tell me your best joke. I've

           Nothing like turbulence to cement a

           and besides, last June she read
           some book and woke up one morning a

          and the Businessman get up and open the overheads.

           RYAN (V.O.)
           Sad? Not really. We're a busy bunch.
           I'm peaceful. I'm in my element here.
           I suppose I'm a sort of mutation, a
           new species. I live between the
           margins of my itineraries.
                         
          Ryan and the Businessman reach a point that separates -
          CONNECTING FLIGHTS go left / LONG TERM PARKING goes right.
                         
          They share an awkward smile with a nod, then head in their
          separate directions.

           Hertz keeps its vehicles too long.

          it doesn't work.

           Sometimes I forget that you even
           live here. You could probably save
           money and move into a hotel.

           I looked into it, but the IRS
           requires a permanent address for
           employment. Otherwise, they
           classify you as a vagrant.
                         
          Ding! - Ryan gets off at his floor.

          Ryan walks in and sets his bag down. Reveal - the place is
          empty... Like empty, empty.
                         
          Ryan opens the fridge - Chinese take out. Pizza box. Bottle
          of Vodka. Takes a whiff of something - not good.
                         
                          WOMAN'S VOICE
           Hey neighbor.
                         
          Ryan turns to find Dianne, a pretty woman just shy of forty.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey yourself.
                         
          They hug - It's just intimate enough to know they've violated
          the rules of sleeping with your neighbors.
                         
                          DIANNE
           (hands over a package)
           I signed for this while you were gone.
                         
                          RYAN
           Thanks. Hope it wasn't a bother.
                         
          Ryan opens it and finds the CUT-OUT of his sister Julie and
          her fiance Jim. It's an eighteen inch card stock photo of Jim
          hugging Julie from behind.
                         
                          DIANNE
                          (RE: PHOTO)
           They seem happy.
                         
                          RYAN
           It's my sister. She's getting
           married. Haven't met the guy yet.
                         
                          DIANNE
           Lots of luck.

           I know, right?
                         
          They share a smile. Then, Dianne goes to leave.
                         
                          DIANNE
           It's good to see you. Feels like a
           while this time.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey, you want to come over tonight?
                         
          Dianne gets a little uncomfortable.
                         
                          DIANNE
           Actually, I kind of started seeing
           somebody.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, that's... that's great.
                         
                          DIANNE
           Yeah, we're having drinks tonight
           if you want to come over.
                         
                          RYAN
           That's okay... I' think I'll settle in.
                         
          Dianne gives a smile/nod and exits. Ryan take another long
          look at the CUT-OUT. He shakes his head.

           Auto industry is in the dump.
           Housing market doesn't have a

           one of the worst times on record
           for America... and I don't want to
           be standing here two years from

           Now, last Summer we received a
           dynamite young woman by way of
           Cornell. She challenged us with some
           big ideas. My first reaction was, who
           does this kid think she is? But when I
           started to give a listen, I was pretty
           knocked out. So now, with a little
           peek into our future - Natalie Keener.

           This company keeps twenty three
           people on the road, at least two
           hundred fifty days a year. It's
           expensive and it's inefficient.
           When I came to Craig three months
           ago with this, he told me, and
           quite astutely - it's only a

          Natalie turns to the monitor and proceeds to fire Ned. It is
          a pretty dry process and lacks Ryan's charm.

           Hearing the words "You've been let

           scary. But consider the following -
           (using Ryan's line)
           Anybody who ever built an empire,
           or changed the world, sat where you
           are now. And it's because they sat
           there that they were able to do it.

                          CRAIG GREGORY
           You don't get it. You're grounded, Ryan.
           Everyone is. It's done.
                         
                          RYAN
           Okay, what we do here is brutal and
           leaves people devastated, but there's
           a dignity to the way I do it.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Stabbing people in the chest
           instead of the back?
                         
          Ryan rolls his eyes.
                         
          Craig's door opens and Natalie pops her head in.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You wanted to see me?
                         
          Craig goes to wave her off.
                         
                          RYAN
           Yeah, why don't you come in.
                         
          Natalie is confused but takes the chair next to Ryan.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Great job in there, Nat.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Thank you. How's everyone taking it?
                         
          Natalie and Ryan hold a look for a second.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (TO NATALIE)
           Look, I appreciate your... zeal. And
           you have some good ideas. But you
           know nothing of the realities of my
           job. Sure, you can set up an iChat...
           but you don't know how people think.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Actually, I minored in psychology.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Nice.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (TO NATALIE)
           Okay kiddo, fire me.

                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Ryan, stop it.
                         
                          RYAN
           She's going to be doing this on a
           regular basis. You don't want to
           know if she can fire somebody?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           She just fired Ned.
                         
                          RYAN
           My dog could fire Ned.
                          (TO NATALIE)
           Fire me.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Ryan.
                         
                          NATALIE
           It's okay, I got this.
                         
          Ryan and Natalie turn to face each other.

           Mr. Bingham, I regret to inform you
           that your position is no longer
           available.

           My name is Miss Keener and I'm here
           today to discuss your future.
                         
                          RYAN
           My future? I don't know you. The
           only person who can fire me is
           Craig Gregory.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Mr. Gregory hired me to handle this
           for him.
                         
                          RYAN
           Handle what? Handle me? Mr. Gregory
           hired me and he's the only one who can
           fire me. I'm going to talk to him.
                         
          Ryan gets up. Natalie gets up too.

                          NATALIE
           I just did.
                         
                          RYAN
           Actually, you didn't. Now, fire me.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Stop it, Ryan.

           inform you that your position is no
           longer available.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm fired?
                         
                          NATALIE
           Yes, you're fired.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (ASIDE)
           Never say fired.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You've been let go.

           Why?
                         
                          NATALIE
           (breaks the moment)
           This is a mythical situation. How
           could I possibly know why?
                         
                          RYAN
           You never know why. Why doesn't
           matter.

           (back on track)
           It's important not to focus on the
           "why" and rather to spend your
           energy thinking about your future.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm going to spend my energy on
           suing you if you don't give me a
           reason that you're firing me.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Mr. Bingham, the reason is not
           important.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, so you're firing me without
           grounds.
                          (TO CRAIG)
           Now, I really have a lawsuit.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Ryan, I think we know what you're
           trying to say...
                         
                          NATALIE
           (still in character)
           Don't take this personally, Mr.
           Bingham.
                         
          Ryan stops.
                         
                          RYAN
           Personally?
           (quiet and calm)
           This is the most personal situation
           you will ever enter. So before you
           try to revolutionize my business,
           I'd like to know that you actually
           know my business.

           (frankly...)
           No... We're making you irrelevant.

           Hey, don't blame me. Blame fuel

           rewire an entire company.

           you can. But you're not going to be

          Ryan is packing his ROLL-AWAY BAG. It is practiced and
          systematic. He's just about finished, when he notices the CUT-
          OUT of his sister's engagement photo.
                         
          He tries placing it in the open bag, but it is immediately
          clear that the photo is two inches to long. He tries putting
          it on an angle, but that doesn't help.
                         
                          RYAN
           Huh.
                         
          Ryan centers the cut-out again and tries to ZIP around it,
          but he can't get the zipper around the HEADS of the photo.
          For a moment, it almost seems like he's assaulting their tiny
          head with the zipper handle. Doesn't help.
                         
          A moment of silent frustration.

          Being pulled through an airport. The little heads of Ryan's
          sister and her fiance are poking out the top of the bag. The

          they were tiny passengers peeking out the sunroof.

          Ryan cuts right through the crowd, wheeling his carry-on
          towards the automatic check-in machines.
                         
          Ryan stops when he notices NATALIE saying goodbye to her
          BOYFRIEND - a kind of Hollister looking guy in his mid-
          twenties. He's not thrilled by the public affection. After a
          beat, they break and he exits.
                         
          Natalie sees Ryan and starts dragging her LARGE SUITCASE
          towards him. The SCRAPING against the terrazzo sends a shiver
          up Ryan's spine.
                         
          She arrives and sets the heavy bag down with a CLUNK. Ryan
          stares at her travel case for a beat then up to her.
                         
                          NATALIE
           What?
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          A ROW OF ROLL AWAY BAGS
                         
                         
          INT. LUGGAGE STORE, EPPLEY AIRFIELD - MORNING
                         
          Ryan pulls one out and tests the action.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I really like my luggage.
                         
                          RYAN
           That's exactly what it is. Luggage.
           (off of Natalie's look)
           You know how much time you lose by
           checking in?
                         
                          NATALIE
           I don't know, maybe five minutes
           waiting for...
           36.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Thirty five minutes per flight. I
           travel two hundred seventy days a
           year. That makes one hundred fifty
           seven hours... That's Seven Days.

           You ready to throw away a whole
           week on that?

          the airport. Ryan helps by throwing a couple things out.

                          RYAN
           Bingo. Asians.
                         
          Ryan starts walking.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You can't be serious.
                         
          As they pass the first line - A FAMILY OF SIX.
                         
                          RYAN
           Never get behind people travelling
           with infants. I've never seen a
           stroller collapse in less than
           twenty minutes.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Old people are worse. Their bodies
           are littered with hidden metal and
           they never seem to appreciate how
           little time they have left on Earth.
                         
          Third Line - A COUPLE MIDDLE EASTERN GUYS.

           Five words. Randomly selected for
           additional screening.
                         
          They enter the fourth line behind the Asians.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Asians. They're light packers,
           treasure efficiency, and have a thing
           for slip-on shoes. God love'em.
                         
                          NATALIE
           That's racist.

          Ryan is just fastening his belt, having just gone through
          security, when we hear a beeping go off. Natalie is trying to
          find the metal on her body that has set off the machine. She also
          has forgotten to take her laptop out of her bag. It's a mess.
                         
                         
          INT. BOEING 757 - MID FLIGHT
                         
          Ryan is sketching a theoretical book cover for "The
          Backback". Natalie is working on an Excel Document on her
          laptop - She's a loud tapper... Hitting the keys with violent
          strokes. It draws Ryan's attention and a raised eyebrow.
                         
                          RYAN
           Are you upset at your laptop?
                         
                          NATALIE
           No. Why?

           I'm building a work flow of firing

           Actions & reactions. A script that
           works kind of like a tributary,
           taking you through the steps of

           Theoretically, you could put it in
           the hands of anybody and they could
           be downsizing immediately. All they
           have to do is follow the steps.
                         
                          RYAN
           Natalie, what is it, you think we
           do here?
                         
                          NATALIE
           We prepare the newly unemployed for
           the emotional and physical hurdles
           of job hunting while... Minimizing

                          RYAN
           That's what we're selling. But it's
           not what we're doing.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Okay, what are we doing?

                          NATALIE
           That was really impressive. You
           rehearse that?
                         
          Natalie smiles and goes back to her work. Ryan goes to say
          something, but holds back for now.

           Ryan, I'm not some waitress you
           banged in a snow storm. The word
           "Appropriate" has no place in our

                          RYAN
           Thank you for coming by. As you're
           probably well aware, this is a
           tough economic climate and your
           company is not immune.
                         
          REAL PEOPLE tighten up as they begin to catch on.
                         
                          RYAN
           While I wish I was here with better
           news, the reason you and I are
           meeting is this is your final week
           of employment here.
                         
          REAL PEOPLE blame all sorts of people and situations that
          they personally hold responsible.
                         
                          RYAN
           This is not a time to look for
           blame. Your position simply no
           longer exists.
                         
          REAL PEOPLE respond further. Some are enraged. Some are
          polite. One is even grateful.
                         
                          RYAN
           I understand why you are saying
           these things.

           It's perfectly natural to feel
           this way. I want you to take the
           next week to explore this strategy
           packet...
                         
          Ryan nods to Natalie who we now see begrudgingly HANDING
          PACKETS to all of the REAL PEOPLE we've already met.
                         
                          RYAN
           Fill out the skill set work
           sheet... Use the hopes and dreams
           diagram... And the tree of
           aspirations.
                         
          We SEE the "TREE OF ASPIRATIONS" sheet.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (WITH EMPHASIS)
           The answers are all in there.
                         
          We see more packets getting handed out as Ryan repeats...
                         
                          RYAN
           The answers are all in there.

                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          BOB (AN ACTOR) PRESENTING A PHOTO OF HIS CHILDREN
                         
                          BOB
           And what do you suggest I tell
           them?
                         
          BOB. Dry red eyes from tears of rage stare down the lens.
                         
          Natalie can't hold back any longer.
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (A SUGGESTION)
           Perhaps you're underestimating the
           positive effect your career transition
           may have on your children.
                         
          Ryan looks at Natalie like she's out of her mind.
                         
                          BOB
           Positive effect?
           43.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           Well, tests have shown that
           children under moderate trauma have
           a tendency to apply themselves
           academically as a method of coping.
                         
                          BOB
           Go fuck yourself. That's what my
           kids'll think.
                         
          Natalie shrinks. Ryan immediately covers.
                         
                          RYAN
           Your children's admiration is
           important to you?
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah. It was.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (FRANKLY)
           Well, I doubt they ever admired
           you, Bob.
                         
          Bob looks up shocked and pissed.
                         
                          BOB
           Hey asshole, aren't you here to
           console me?
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm not a shrink, Bob. I'm a wake
           up call. You know why kids love
           athletes?
                         
                          BOB
           Because they screw lingerie models.
                         
                          RYAN
           No, that's why we love athletes.
           Kids love them because they follow
           their dreams.
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah, well I can't dunk.
                         
                          RYAN
           But you can cook.
                         
          Natalie looks to Ryan - Where is he going with this?
                         
                          BOB
           What are you talking about?
           44.
                         
                         
          Ryan picks up Bob's resume.
                         
                          RYAN
           Your resume says you minored in
           French Culinary Arts. Most students
           work the frier at KFC. You bussed
           tables at Il Picatorre to support
           yourself. Then you got out of
           college and started working here.
           (looks up at Bob)
           How much did they first pay you to
           give up on your dreams?
                         
                          BOB
                          (FLAT)
           Twenty seven thousand a year.
                         
                          RYAN
           At what point were you going to
           stop and go back to what made you
           happy?
                         
          Bob simply shrugs.
                         
                          RYAN
           Do you believe in fate, Bob?
                         
                          BOB
           Fate?
                         
                          RYAN
           Yeah. You know, the mysterious ways
           in which we wind up doing the
           things we were meant to do.
                         
                          BOB
                          (OFFERING)
           I met my wife at a gas station.
                         
                          RYAN
           Exactly. Well, I think fate is
           telling you to do something, Bob.
                         
          Bob looks up and meets eyes with Ryan.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           I see guys who work for the same
           company their entire lives. Clock
           in. Clock out. Never a moment of
           happiness.
           (pauses for effect)
           Not everyone gets this kind of
           opportunity.

                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           The chance for rebirth. If not for
           yourself... Do it for your kids.
                         
          Bob's eyes begin to water again. He's a changed man.
                         
          Ryan shoots Natalie a look - Hand over the packet.
                         
          Natalie jumps to attention and hands Bob a packet.
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY, ST. LOUIS HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          There's a BUSINESS WOMAN waiting in the regular line. Ryan
          walks right past her and gets into the ELITE LINE. They are
          now both first in their respective lines for the counter.
                         
          The woman looks over at Ryan and sighs. Natalie holds back,
          confused by Ryan's actions and wanting to avoid confrontation.
                         
          The DESK CLERK frees up and gestures for Ryan to step
          forward. Ryan begins wheeling his bag forward. Meanwhile, the
          woman lifts her hand in outrage.
                         
                          BUSINESS WOMAN
           I've been waiting ten minutes. He just
           waltzes in and gets to cut in line.
                         
                          DESK CLERK
           We reserve priority assistance for
           our Hilton Honors members.
                         
          Ryan grabs a BROCHURE for ELITE MEMBERSHIP off the desk and
          hands it to the business woman.
                         
                          RYAN
           You should look into it - The
           promotions are great...
                         
          The woman bats it out of Ryan's hand onto the floor.
                         
                          BUSINESS WOMAN
           Fuck off.
                         
          Ryan looks back at the desk clerk and smiles. The desk clerk
          swipes his card.
                         
          Ryan's DIGITAL NUMBER bumps up another thousand points.
                         
                         
          INT. PUBLIC BATHROOM, ST. LOUIS HILTON - EVENING
                         
          Natalie is washing her hands, when she stops to look at
          herself in the mirror.
           46.
                         
                         
          After a beat, she hears someone CRYING in one of the stalls.
          She goes to see if the woman is okay, then stops herself -
          Maybe I fired her.
                         
          She grabs a paper towel, dries off her hands, and leaves.
                         
                         
          INT. RESTAURANT BAR, ST. LOUIS HILTON - EVENING
                         
          Natalie sits back down at the table a little visibly shaken.
                         
                          RYAN
           You okay?
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (COVERS QUICKLY)
           Yeah. Fine.
                         
          Just then, their food arrives... And there's a lot of food.
          Natalie's eyes move back and forth trying to figure out why
          there seems to be three main courses and a bunch of sides.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Hungry, much?
                         
                          RYAN
           Our expense account allots for forty
           dollars each on dinner. I plan on
           grabbing every mile I can.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Okay, you got to fill me in on this mile
           business. What's that all about? Are you
           talking like frequent flier miles?
                         
          Ryan gives Natalie a look - Is she ready for this information?
                         
                          RYAN
           Your really want to know?
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (MOCK SERIOUS)
           I'm dying to know.
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't spend a nickel, if I can help
           it, unless it somehow profits my
           mileage account. I'm not talking
           hotel rooms and rental cars either,
           but internet services, cell phone,
           music downloads, teleflorists. The
           works. I shop them according to the
           miles they pay and I pit them against
           each other for the most value.
           47.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           So, what are you saving up for?
           Hawaii? South of France?
                         
                          RYAN
           No, it's not like that... The miles
           are the goal.
                         
                          NATALIE
           That's it? You're saving to save?
                         
                          RYAN
           Let's just say I've got a number in
           mind and haven't hit it yet.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Wow. Seems a little abstract.
           What's your target?
                         
                          RYAN
           I'd rather not.
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (TEASING)
           It's a secret target?
                         
                          RYAN
           It's ten million miles.

          INT. HILTON HOTEL LOBBY - EARLY MORNING
                         
          Ryan turns a corner to find Natalie talking to her computer
          screen with headphones on.
           54.
                         
                         
          She's having an iChat with someone, but we only hear her side
          of the conversation. Ryan decides to listen in for a second.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I'll be back soon. Not really sure
           how long this whole exercise is
           supposed to last. He's fine... It's
           hard for these guys to accept
           change, you know.
           (listens, rolls eyes)
           I... I'm not even going to answer
           that... No, I can't even think of
           him that way... He's old.
                         
          Ryan frowns. Checks a mirror.

          RYAN'S HEADSHOT - sitting on an EASLE.
                         
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, WICHITA HOTEL - AFTERNOON
                         
          Ryan stands before a similar crowd as the opening of the film.
                         
                          RYAN
           Okay. This is where it gets a
           little difficult, but stay with me.
           You have a new backpack... but this
           time, I want you to fill it with
           people. Start with casual
           acquaintances, people around the
           office, friends of friends and work
           your way to the people you trust
           with your most intimate secrets.
           Now move into family members -
           cousins, aunts, and uncles. Get
           your sisters and your brothers and
           you parents. Get them all in that
           backpack. And finally your husband
           or wife or boyfriend or girlfriend.
           Get them in their too.
           55.
                         
                         
          A titter through the crowd. For the first time, we see
          Natalie near the side, watching.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Don't worry. I'm not going to ask
           you to light it on fire.
                         
          Light laughter.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Feel the weight of that bag. Make
           no mistake, your relationships are
           the heaviest components of your
           life. Feel the straps cutting into
           your shoulders. All those
           negotiations and arguments and
           secrets and compromises.
                         
          Ryan lets the weight sink in.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Now set that bag down.
                         
          You can feel the relief in the room.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           You don't need to carry all that
           weight.
                         
          Noticeable agreement.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Some animals were meant to carry
           each other. To live symbiotically
           over a lifetime. Star-crossed
           lovers. Monogamous swans. We are
           not one of those animals.
                         
          Ryan focuses towards his conclusion.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           The slower we move, the faster we
           die. We are not swans. We're
           sharks.

          Ryan has finished his session and is talking to eager
          stragglers. Ryan accepts a business card and elaborates on
          one of his theories.

          Meanwhile, down the hall, Natalie is finishing a phone call.
          She looks shell shocked. She closes her phone and pockets it
          in silence.

          We're following a HILTON SHUTTLE down a street of PALM TREES.
                         
                         
          INT. HILTON AIRPORT SHUTTLE - AFTERNOON
                         
          Natalie and Ryan ride back to the airport. We catch them mid-
          conversation as Natalie drills Ryan on his theory.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Never...?
                         
          Ryan smiles to the few other riders as if apologizing.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           You never want to get married?
           Never want kids?
                         
                          RYAN
           Is that so bizarre?
                         
                          NATALIE
           Yes. Yes it is.
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't see the value.
                         
          Natalie sighs.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Sell it to me.
                         
                          NATALIE
           What?
                         
                          RYAN
           Sell me marriage.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I... Uh... How how about love?
                         
                          RYAN
           Pff...
           57.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           Okay. Stability?
                         
                          RYAN
           How many stabile marriages do you
           know?
                         
                          NATALIE
           Someone to talk to, spend your life
           with?
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm surrounded by people to talk
           to. I doubt that will change.
                         
          The shuttle stops and everyone goes to grab their bags.
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY, MIAMI HILTON - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Natalie enter, still having the same conversation.
                         
                          NATALIE
           How about just not dying alone?
                         
          Ryan stops to address this.
                         
                          RYAN
           Starting when I was twelve, we
           moved each one of my grandparents
           into a nursing facility. My parents
           went the same way.
                          (A BEAT)
           Make no mistake. We all die alone.
                         
          Ryan turns, thinks of something, then turns back.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
                          (ADDING)
           Those cult members down in San
           Diego with the white sneakers and
           little Dixie cups of Kool-Aid. They
           didn't die alone.
                         
          Natalie looks steamed.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Just saying - There's options.
                         
          Out of nowhere, Natalie starts crying.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (ALMOST SILENT)
           Oh fuck.
           58.
                         
                         
          Natalie is now balling in the middle of the lobby.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Brian left me.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, hey... I...
                         
          Ryan goes to hug Natalie and she simply folds into his arms -
          A mop of tears. Ryan looks around for a place to set her
          down. Instead, he finds...
                         
          ALEX - Who gives a questioning look to the young sobbing girl.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hi. Alex this is Natalie. Natalie,
           this is my... friend, Alex.
                         
                          ALEX
           I should give you both a moment.
                         
          Natalie attempts a recovery. It's not graceful.
                         
                          NATALIE
           No, it's fine. I'm fine. Just
           stupid emotions.
                         
          Natalie gives Alex a firm handshake.
                         
                          ALEX
           Maybe a drink?
                         
          Ryan goes to challenge the idea, when...
                         
                          NATALIE
           Now we're talking.
                         
          Natalie leads the way. Alex and Ryan exchange quick hellos.

          The three share a booth. Natalie is sipping a drink. She seems
          to have settled a little.
           59.
                         
                         
                          ALEX
           He broke up with you over text
           message?
                         
                          RYAN
                          (SOFT DIG)
           That's kind of like firing people
           over the internet.
                         
          Both Natalie and Alex shoot Ryan a look.
                         
                          ALEX
           (re: the ex-boyfriend)
           What a weasely prick.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Yeah, but what does that make me?
           Someone who falls for a prick?
                         
                          ALEX
           We all fall for them. Pricks are
           spontaneous, unpredictable, and
           fun. And then we're surprised when
           they turn out to be pricks.

           I followed him to Omaha.
                         
                          RYAN
           You did?
                         
                          NATALIE
           I had a job waiting for me in San
           Fran, when he got an offer from
           ConAgra. He told me we could start
           a life together. So I followed him.

           I look in the mirror and I just see
           compromise... I'm supposed to do
           something.
                         
                          ALEX
           You'll do plenty.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I just can't... I thought I'd be
           engaged by now.

                          ALEX RYAN
          It's alright. None taken.

           When I was sixteen, I thought by
           twenty three, I would be married,
           maybe have a kid... Corner office
           by day, entertaining at night. I
           was supposed to be driving a Grand
           Cherokee by now.
                         
                          ALEX
           Life can underwhelm you that way.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Now I have my sights on twenty
           nine, because thirty is just way
           too... apocalyptic. I mean, where
           did you think you'd be by...
                         
          Natalie catches herself, having no idea how old Alex is.
                         
                          ALEX
           It doesn't work that way.
                         
                          RYAN
           At a certain point, you stop with
           the deadlines.
                         
                          ALEX
           They can be a little counterproductive.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I don't want to say anything
           that's... anti-feminist. I mean, I
           really appreciate everything your
           generation did for me.
                         
                          ALEX
           (my generation?)
           It was our pleasure.
                         
                          RYAN
           Well done.
                         
                          NATALIE
           But sometimes it feels like no
           matter how much success I have, it
           all won't matter until I find the
           right guy.
                         
                          ALEX
           You really thought this guy was the one.
           61.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I
           could have made it work. He just
           really fit the bill.
                         
                          RYAN
           The bill?
                         
                          NATALIE
           My type. You know, white collar.
           College grad. Loves dogs. Likes funny
           movies. Six foot one. Brown hair.
           Kind eyes. Works in finance but is
           Outdoorsy, you know, on the weekends.
           (we think she's done)
           I always imagined he'd have a
           single syllable name like Matt or
           John or... Dave. In a perfect
           world, he drives a Four Runner and
           the only thing he loves more than
           me is his golden lab. Oh... and a
           nice smile.
           (back to Alex and Ryan)
           How about you?
                         
          This catches both Alex and Ryan off guard.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm not sure if...
                         
                          NATALIE
           I meant Alex...
                         
                          RYAN
           Right.
                         
                          ALEX
           Huh, let me think for a sec.
           (mulls it over)
           Well, by the time you're thirty four,
           all the physical requirements are
           pretty much out the window. I mean you
           secretly prey he'll be taller than you.
                         
          Ryan smiles.
                         
                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           Not an asshole would be nice? Just
           someone who enjoys my company. Comes
           from a good family - You don't think
           about that when you're younger.
                          (THINKING)
           Wants kids... Likes kids...

                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           Wants kids. Healthy enough to play
           catch with his future son one day.
                         
          We can tell Ryan is taking a serious interest in this.
                         
                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           Please let him earn more than I do.
           That doesn't make sense now, but
           believe me, it will one day. Otherwise
           it's just a recipe for disaster.
                          (REACHING)
           Hopefully some hair on his head...?
           But it's not exactly a deal-breaker
           anymore. Nice smile... Yep, a nice
           smile just might do it.
                         
          Alex looks to Ryan. He has a nice smile.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Wow. That was depressing.
                         
          Alex and Ryan react - It's not that bad.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           I should just date lesbians.
                         
                          ALEX
           Tried it. We're no picnic
           ourselves.
                         
          Natalie looks worse than when the conversation started.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I don't mind being married to my
           career, and I don't expect it to
           hold me in bed as I fall asleep.
                          (LOOKS UP)
           I just don't want to settle.
                         
                          ALEX
           You're young. Right now you see
           settling as some sort of failure.
                         
                          NATALIE
           It is. By definition.
                         
                          ALEX
           Don't worry, by the time someone is
           right for you, it won't feel like
           settling... And the only person
           left to judge you will be the
           twenty four year old girl with a
           target on your back.
           63.
                         
                         
          Natalie cracks a smile.
                         
          Ryan looks to Alex. They've grown closer.
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY LOUNGE, MIAMI HILTON - DAY
                         
          Ryan, Alex, and Natalie wheel their ROLL-AWAYS towards the
          elevator.
                         
                          NATALIE
           So, what's the plan for this
           evening?
                         
          Ryan and Alex share an uncomfortable silence.
                         
                          NATALIE
           What...? Oh, is it illicit?
                         
                          RYAN
                          (QUICKLY)
           No...
                         
                          ALEX
           It's nothing like that.
                         
                          NATALIE
           We are in Miami.
                         
                          RYAN
           ... We were going to hit that party
           for the tech conference in the hotel.
                         
          Natalie notices a group of SOFTWARE TYPES mingling with
          badges around their necks.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I didn't know you could just attend
           those...
                         
                          ALEX
           Well, I mean...
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (EYES WIDEN)
           You're going to crash it?
                         
                          RYAN ALEX
          I mean, I don't know if... More money than they know
          These guy put on a quite a what to do with...
          party...
                         
                          NATALIE
           No, I get it. I'm in!

          INT. CONFERENCE CORRIDOR, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan, Alex, and Natalie confidently walk up to the CHECK-IN
          TABLE and take BADGES.
                         
          They turn the corner. Alex reads Natalie's badge.
                         
                          ALEX

                          NATALIE
           Oh shit!
                         
                          RYAN
           It's going to be fine.
                         
                         
          INT. SOFTWARE CONVENTION PARTY, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          Corporate color balloons. Lots of guys in LOGO POLOS. That
          great hip hop song from 1998 is playing over the PA.
                         
          We find Ryan, Alex, and Natalie at a stand up table. They're now
          wearing badges. Natalie is pretty tipsy at this point.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (TO NATALIE)
           You okay there?
                         
                          NATALIE
           Oh yeah... This was a great idea.
                          (TO ALEX)
           You are so pretty. You're exactly what
           I want to look like in fifteen years.
                         
                          ALEX
           Thank you, Natalie.
                         
          A CONFERENCE LEADER steps up to an on stage MIC.
                         
                          CONFERENCE LEADER
           How's everyone doing out there?!
                         
          People cheer. So do Ryan, Alex, and particularly Natalie.
                         
                          CONFERENCE LEADER
           I'm going to need you to all put
           your hands together for a very
           special guest - YOUNG... M... C!
                         
          The opening beats of the 90's jam "Bust-A-Move" blast over
          the speakers and sure enough, now-40-year-old rapper, Young
          MC steps out and starts rapping.

          Everyone goes crazy and starts dancing.
                         
          Ryan and Alex make it out to the dance floor. They're awful
          dancers, but they're having fun.
                         
                          RYAN
           Think she'll be okay?

           Look...
                         
          Natalie has already found a dancing partner, who can't
          believe his luck. She's all over him. Ryan smiles.
                         
                         
          EXT. BOAT - NIGHT
                         
          A nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before
          the bubble popped. Inside the galley, a group is playing
          karaoke. NATALIE, wearing BADGES like Mardi Gras beads, is
          singing "Time After Time".
                         
          Meanwhile, near the back, Ryan and Alex sit with their legs
          hanging off the back of the hull.
                         
                          ALEX
           Back home, I don't get to act the way
           I do with you.
                         
                          RYAN
           That's why I don't have a "back home".
                         
                          ALEX
           I know. You're so cool. "Mr. Empty
           Back Pack".
                         
          Ryan emotionally stumbles.
                         
                          RYAN
           You know about the back pack?
                         
                          ALEX

                          RYAN
          Did it bother you?
                         
                          ALEX
          Well, that depends. Is the bag
          empty because you hate people or
          just the baggage they bring along?

          I don't hate people. I'm not
          exactly a hermit.
                         
                          ALEX
          You just don't want to be tied down?
          The whole responsibility thing.
                         
                          RYAN
          I don't think it's even that...
          I... First time I ever flew, I was
          sixteen.
                         
                          ALEX
          You're not going to answer? You're
          just going to tell me a story?
                         
                          RYAN
           (smiles, continues story)
          It was January and I had just
          gotten my driver's license. The
          lakes were frozen over, so we piled
          into my car and hit the ice to do
          donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit
          a soft spot and the hood of my car
          tilted up and I was sinking
          backwards into the water.
                         
                          ALEX
          Jesus...
                         
                          RYAN
          I literally started to drown.
          Within a few seconds, I black out.
          Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a
          helicopter, laying on a stretcher.
          This guy in a uniform is telling me I
          was minutes away from dying.
                         
                          ALEX
          Oh my God.
           67.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Right?
           (relives it for a second)
           So just as we're hovering over the
           hospital, I sit up. And from there,
           I could see the whole western
           horizon. We'd been flying twenty
           minutes. Twenty minutes to reach a
           city I'd thought of as remote,
           halfway across the state... a
           foreign capital.
                          (A BEAT)
           My parents had taught me we lived
           in the best place on Earth, but now
           I could see the world was really
           just one place and comparing didn't
           make much sense. And I remember
           thinking - Don't tell me this isn't
           an age of miracles. Don't tell me
           we can't be everywhere at once.
                         
          The idea settles in. Ryan returns to the point.
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't know what originally
           sparked the back pack. I probably
           needed to be alone. Recently, I've
           been thinking that maybe I needed
           to empty the bag before I knew what
           to put back in.
                         
          And now they kiss. It's notably different from their previous
          kisses. Now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people
          kiss in the first place.
                         
          Then, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. The
          motor has stopped. Ryan and Alex look back to find the
          software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk.
                         
                          SOFTWARE DUDE
           Hey... I think we're out of gas.
                         
          Ryan and Alex look out to shore... about 500 yards away. For
          whatever reason, they just start cracking up.
                         
                         
          EXT. PONTOON BOAT - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan and Alex are huddled under a blanket in the corner of
          the rubber boat as it putters its way to shore.
                         
          Cold, soaked, and smiling.
                         
          Natalie and David are there too... still kissing.
           68.
                         
                         
          EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
                         
          Everyone gets out of the boat in the cold knee deep water and
          splashes up to shore.
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan and Alex followed by Natalie and her make-out buddy,
          soaked from the knee down, holding their shoes, scamper into
          the hotel on the balls of their feet.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S HOTEL ROOM, MIAMI HILTON - NEXT MORNING
                         
          Ryan's eyes flutter awake to see Alex getting dressed.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey, you're up...
                         
                          ALEX
           Got to fly stand-by and make a
           meeting in Milwaukee.
                         
                          RYAN
                          (DISAPPOINTED)
           Oh... Okay.
                         
                          ALEX
           (notices, teasing)
           Oh, no. I made you feel cheap.
                         
                          RYAN
           Yeah, all right... Just leave the
           money on the dresser.
                         
                          ALEX
                          (SWEETLY)
           I'll text you later so we can swap
           schedules.
                         
          Alex gives him a peck. Ryan takes her wrist so she can't leave.
                         
                          RYAN
           I can't remember the last time I
           enjoyed spending time with someone
           as much as you.
                         
                          ALEX
           Neither can I.
                         
          They kiss again and he lets go. Alex leaves and the door
          closes. Ryan just lays in bed for a moment.
           69.
                         
                         
          INT. CAFE - MIAMI HILTON - MORNING
                         
          Ryan and Natalie have a quiet breakfast. Natalie looks pretty
          worse for wear.
                         
          In the background is a TRAVELING SALESMAN rolling calls. He
          perks up for each message then goes back to being miserable.
                         
          Meanwhile, after a little silent eating...
                         
                          NATALIE
           Last night got a little out of
           hand. I said things... I don't
           remember everything I said. I just
           didn't want you to think...
                         
                          RYAN
           Just relax. It was nice to see you
           cut loose. So, did you wake him up
           or slip out?
                         
                          NATALIE
           What?
                         
                          RYAN
           This morning... Your new friend.
           Did you wake him for an awkward
           good bye or just slip out so he
           could feel like a whore.
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (NOT PROUD)
           I... just left.
                         
                          RYAN
           Protocol is always tricky.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I didn't know what was right.
                         
                          RYAN
           Sometimes there really is no right
           thing to do.
                         
          This doesn't comfort her.
                         
                         
          EXT. OCEAN BOARDWALK, MIAMI - DAY
                         
          The walkway overlooks a large MARINA filled with giant
          YACHTS. Ryan and Natalie are doing the photo thing with the
          CUT OUT of the engagement portrait again.
           70.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
          What happened to Alex?
                         
                          RYAN
          Had to skip town early to make a
          meeting.
                         
                          NATALIE
          That's too bad. Where does she live?
                         
                          RYAN
          Chicago.
                         
                          NATALIE
          You thinking of going to see her?
                         
                          RYAN
          I don't know. We just don't have
          that kind of relationship.
                         
                          NATALIE
          What kind of relationship do you
          have?
                         
                          RYAN
          It's, you know. Casual.
                         
                          NATALIE
          Sounds pretty special.
                         
                          RYAN
          It works for us.
                         
                          NATALIE
          Think there's any future there?
                         
                          RYAN
          Never thought about it. What's
          going on here?
                         
                          NATALIE
          Really never thought about it?
                         
                          RYAN
           (a good lie)
          No.
                         
                          NATALIE
          How can you not think about these
          things? How does it not even cross
          your mind that you might want to
          have a future with somebody?
           71.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           It's simple, you know that moment
           when you look into someone's eyes
           and you feel them looking right
           into your soul, and the whole world
           goes quiet for a second.
                         
                          NATALIE
           (finally, a break through)
           Yes.
                         
                          RYAN
           Right. Well, I don't.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You're an asshole.
                         
          Natalie knocks over the CUT OUT and stands up.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh come on, I'm just dicking
           around. I need your help...
                         
                          NATALIE
           Don't you think it's worth giving
           her a chance?
                         
                          RYAN
           A chance to what?
                         
                          NATALIE
           A chance at something real?
                         
                          RYAN
           Natalie, your definition of "real"
           is going to evolve as you get
           older...
                         
                          NATALIE
           Would you stop condescending for
           one second? Or is that one of the
           principles of your bullshit
           philosophy?
                         
                          RYAN
           Bullshit philosophy?
                         
                          NATALIE
           The isolation? The traveling? Is
           that supposed to be charming?
                         
                          RYAN
           No, it's simply a life choice.
           72.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           It's a cocoon of self-banishment.
                         
                          RYAN
           Wow. Big words.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Screw you.
                         
                          RYAN
           Well, screw you too.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You've set up a way of life that
           basically makes it impossible for
           you to make any human connections.
           Now, somehow, this woman runs the
           gauntlet of your ridiculous "life
           choice" and comes out the other end
           with a smile - Just so you can call
           her casual. Jesus. I need to grow
           up? You're a twelve year old.
                         
          Natalie begins walking away.
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't have a gauntlet of...
                         
          A GUST OF WIND suddenly blows the CUTOUT across the boardwalk
          into the OCEAN.
                         
                          RYAN
           ... Fuck!
                         
          Ryan goes running after the cutout. He climbs down a GANGWAY
          to a dock that is closest to the CUTOUT, which is beginning
          to sink in the filthy water.
                         
          Ryan reaches... and reaches... and just as he's got a finger
          tip on the photo... FALLS IN.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, MIAMI HILTON - DAY
                         
          Ryan, still damp from the ocean, is drying the CUTOUT with a
          hair dryer.
                         
                         
          INT. CONCOURSE, MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          We're following the CUTOUT HEADS popping out of the ROLL-AWAY
          like earlier, only now they are slightly faded and bent from
          their trip in the harbor.
           73.
                         
                         
                         
                         
          EXT. TARMAC, MIAMI INTERNATIONAL - DAY
                         
          We're watching Ryan through the window of the plane. He
          almost looks trapped.
                         
                         
          EXT. TARMAC, DETROIT INTERATIONAL - DAY
                         
          The plane lands amidst snow.
                         
                         
          INT. RENTAL CAR, DETROIT HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Natalie drive in silence. The weather is frigid.
                         
                          RYAN
           These Detroit guys can be tough.
           They've been getting hammered. Don't
           get distracted. Stick to the simple
           stuff. Get the packet in their hands
           and get them out the door.
                         
                         
          EXT. DETROIT CAR PART COMPANY - DAY
                         
          A one story brick building. There's an inch of snow on the
          ground. Ryan and Natalie enter the building in silence.
                         
                         
          INT. DETROIT COMPANY - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Natalie check in at the front desk.
                         
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - DAY
                         
          The door opens. Ryan and Natalie enter, when they both see
          something and immediately stop short.
                         
          Sitting on the conference table is a COMPUTER set up for a
          VIDEO CONFERENCE.
                         
          Framed up in a WINDOW on the screen is CRAIG GREGORY.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Welcome to Detroit.
                         
          Natalie and Ryan exchange a look.
                         
                          RYAN
           What's going on here?
           74.
                         
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I've been getting those great
           numbers over the last few days.
           Thought we should nut up and give
           this a try.
                         
                          RYAN
           We could use a little more time.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Gotta leave the nest at some point.
                         
                          RYAN
           This is a real company, Craig.
           We're here to do some damage.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I know. Good thing we brought our
           best. So let's stop screwing
           around, alright?
                         
                         
          Ryan sighs.
                         
                          RYAN
           Just give me a minute to prepare
           and get my things together.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I was thinking Natalie takes this one.
                         
          Natalie, once confident, now takes pause.
                         
                          RYAN
           She's hardly ready for this.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I've been watching her. She's great.
                         
                          RYAN
           (re: the webcam)
           This is a whole other animal...
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           I mean, she created it. Natalie,
           you not up for it?
                         
                          NATALIE
           I'm... I'm game.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Atta girl.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Ryan and Natalie have a moment aside.
                         
                          RYAN
           Just remember, don't apologize.
           Don't tell them how hard this is
           for you. Today is one of the worst
           days they will ever have. What we
           feel doesn't even compare.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Got it.
                         
                          RYAN
           Just keep it professional. You're
           going to do fine.
                         
                         
          INT. CRAIG GREGORY'S OFFICE, CTC - LATER
                         
          Craig is leaning back in his office chair, watching Natalie
          on his monitor.
                         
                         
          INT. ALTERNATE CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - DAY
                         
          An unsuspecting man in his mid fifties enters the room and
          takes a seat at a COMPUTER TERMINAL.
                         
          (for the remainder of the scene, we will intercut between
          Natalie's room and the POV of the man's iChat session.)
                         
                          NATALIE
           Hello, Mr. Samuels. My name is
           Natalie Keener.
                         
                          SAMUELS
           (checking out the PC)
           What's going on here?
                         
                          NATALIE
           I wish I was here with better news,
           however your position here at
           Deckers is no longer available.
                         
                          SAMUELS
           What are you talking about?
                         
                          NATALIE
           You've been let go.
           76.
                         
                         
                          SAMUELS
           What, just like that? I can't
           believe... Who are you?
                         
                          NATALIE
           My name is Miss Keener. I am here
           to tell you about your options...
                         
                          SAMUELS
           I work here for seventeen years and
           they send some fourth grader in here
           to can me? What the fuck is this?!
                         
          Ryan fights the urge to jump in. He is sitting next to
          Natalie, but just out of view of the camera.
                         
                          NATALIE
           It's perfectly normal to be upset.
           However, the sooner you can tell
           yourself that there are greater
           opportunities waiting for you...
                         
                          SAMUELS
           Greater opportunities? I'm fifty-
           seven-fucking years old!
                         
          Mr. Samuels is now on the verge of tears. Eyes red.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Anybody who ever built an empire,
           or changed the world, sat where you
           are now. And it's because they sat
           there that they were able to do it.
                         
          We remain in the room with Natalie and Ryan, but we hear Mr.
          Samuels crying. It's loud and embarrassing. It's coming from
          the next room. He's literally on the other side of the wall.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           There's a packet in front of you.
                         
          Samuels picks up the packet and opens it.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           I want you to take some time and
           review it.
                         
          Samuels begins to leaf through.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           All the answers you're looking for
           are inside those pages.

           The sooner you trust the process,
           the sooner your next step in life
           will unveil itself.
                         
          Samuels puts down the packet. The tears still coming slowly.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           I need you to return to your office
           now and begin to put together your
           personal things.
                         
          Samuels doesn't move. He's just sitting there in a daze.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Thank you for your time, Mr. Samuels.
                         
          No reaction. Just more silent tears. Natalie is getting nervous.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Mr. Samuels? There's nothing else
           we can discuss now.
                          (AND AGAIN)
           Thank you for your time.
                         
          Ryan fights the urge to break in as Natalie continues to lose
          her composure.
                         
          Craig leans into his computer, watching intently.
                         
                          NATALIE (CONT'D)
           Mr. Samuels... Mr. Samuels.... MR.
           SAMUELS...
                         
          Finally, Samuels breaks from his daze. He looks up and around
          for a second, then gets up and leaves.
                         
          Natalie catches her breath. A second later, Samuels passes
          their room, visible through the conference room windows. They
          watch as he walks away.
                         
                          RYAN
           You did good.
                         
          Natalie nods.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           You okay? Want me to take over.
                         
                          NATALIE
           No, I'm alright.
                         
          Natalie pulls out a LIST OF FORTY NAMES. The amount of people
          is daunting. She crosses off the first name.
           78.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARKING LOT, DETROIT CAR PART COMPANY - AFTERNOON
                         
          We find Natalie standing next to the rental car. She's staring
          into a snow drift. Her eyes say everything - She just grew up.
                         
          Meanwhile, Ryan is on his CELL. We catch the end of his
          conversation with Craig.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           ... We just got out here. That was
           one place. I think we need to try a
           few more...
                          (LISTENS)
           Maybe there isn't a difference, but
           it's comforting to know we're in
           the next room.
                          (LISTENING)
           I know you don't give a shit about
           my comfort.
                          (LISTENS)
           We could just use a little more
           time. That's all I'm saying.
                          (LISTENS)
           Right... Right.
           (shakes his head)
           Yeah... Alright... Uh huh. Bye.
                         
          Ryan hangs up.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           He thought you did a great job. You
           did - I was real proud of you.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Thanks.
                         
                          RYAN
           We're being pulled off the road.
                          (CLARIFYING)
           We're going home.
                         
                          NATALIE
           For good?
                         
                          RYAN
           That's what it looks like.
                         
          A moment of mixed emotions.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S ROOM, DETROIT HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan is holding the LARGE EMBOSSED ENVELOPE of his sister's
          WEDDING INVITATION.
           79.
                         
                         
          He pulls out the RESPONSE CARD, looks at the line for extra
          guests, then sets it down. He pulls out the actual
          INVITATION. It looks inexpensive. Sighs.
                         
                         
          INT. NORTH TERMINAL, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING
                         
          Ryan and Natalie ride the MOVING WALKWAY. Something is on
          Natalie's mind. She speaks up.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I'm sorry about what I said about
           Alex. I was out of line.
                         
                          RYAN
           It's alright. I understand.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I mean, who am I to be dolling out
           relationship advice?
                         
                          RYAN
           It's fine.
                         
                          NATALIE
           You going to be okay?
                         
                          RYAN
           What do you mean?
                         
                          NATALIE
           In Omaha?
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, I don't know.
                         
                          NATALIE
           It's better than you'd think.
                         
          They get off the moving walkway and stop at a GATE that reads
          "Omaha". Something off screen grabs Ryan's attention.
                         
          Ryan begins to walk off. Pulls out his BLACKBERRY and dials.
                         
                          NATALIE
           Ryan, where are you going?
                         
                          RYAN
           Grabbing another flight... Something
           I need to take care of. I'll see you
           in, uh... at home.
                         
          Ryan disappears in the crowd.
           80.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS - DAY
                         
          We're looking at the LUXOR PYRAMID.
                         
           RYAN (O.C.)
           Okay, start walking it in from the left.
                         
          ALEX enters frame, carrying the engagement CUT OUT.
                         
                          ALEX
           I have to admit, when you asked me to
           meet you in Vegas... I thought we'd
           gamble, make out in a heart shaped
           jacuzzi, maybe see one of those weird
           French Canadian circus shows.
                         
                          RYAN
           There'll be plenty of time for all that.
           (directing the photo)
           One more foot to the left.
                         
          Alex obliges. She checks out the engagement photo.
                         
                          ALEX
           How do you feel about the wedding?
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm fine, I guess.
           (directing the photo)
           Okay great... walk away.
                         
          Ryan takes the photo.
                         
          Alex picks up the engagement photo.
                         
                          ALEX
           They're a cute couple.
                         
                          RYAN
           Think so?
                         
                          ALEX
           Yeah, they'll make cute kids. If they're
           lucky, maybe look a little like you.
                         
          Alex and Ryan look at the photo together for a second.
                         
                          RYAN
           How do you like Wisconsin in February?

           Who doesn't?

                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           I like it if you're there. Besides, I
           know a killer burger in Milwaukee.

           What are you doing this weekend?
                         
          This quickly registers... He's inviting me to the wedding.
                         
                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           No...
                         
                          RYAN
           What? I haven't even...
                         
                          ALEX
           I can't.
                         
                          RYAN
           Why not?
                         
                          ALEX
           I couldn't.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm being serious.
                         
                          ALEX
           You want me to be your date?
                         
                          RYAN
           Well... Yeah.
                         
                          ALEX
           To a wedding... Jesus, Ryan. Your
           sister's wedding?
                         
                          RYAN
           It's not like I know her that well.
                         
                          ALEX
           I'm just not sure if it's
           appropriate for me to...
                         
                          RYAN
           Look. You know. I'm not the wedding
           type. But for the first time in my
           life... I don't want to be that
           guy, alone with his drink. I want a
           dancing partner. I want a plus one.
           And if you can stomach it, I'd like
           it to be you.

          A long thoughtful beat. Alex sighs.
                         
                          ALEX
           Okay.
                         
                          RYAN
           Really?
                         
                          ALEX
           Yeah, I can't believe I... Yeah,
           I'm in. When is it?
                         
                          RYAN
           I feel like we should kiss or
           something.
                         
                          ALEX
           Then kiss me.
                         
          They do.
                         
                         
          INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL, MILWAUKEE AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          Two ROLL-AWAYS side-by-side, moving through the terminal.
                         
          Ryan and Alex walk in unison. They share a smile. Almost like
          they can't believe they're getting away with something.
                         
          They pass a LARGE AIRLINE ADVERTISEMENT featuring MAYNARD
          FINCH in uniform. "We Value Your Loyalty."
                         
                         
          EXT. DRIVEWAY, CHALET SUITES - DAY
                         
          Ryan's rental car pulls into the CHALET SUITES driveway. It's
          halfway between a Swiss Lodge and a Best Western. Just a
          little sadder. A yellow sign reads "Welcome Miller-Bingham
          Wedding Guests!"
                         
                         
          INT. LOBBY, CHALET SUITES HOTEL - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Alex approach the check-in lines. Of course, there's
          an elite membership line, but they can't use it.
                         
          Ryan is forced to stand in a queue of three people while a
          CHECK-IN LADY just stands at her computer at the elite line.
                         
                          RYAN
           (to the CHECK-IN LADY)
           Are you available?

           Sorry, this line is for members of
           our Matterhorn program.
                         
          Ryan steams.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, CHALET SUITES - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Alex walk down the long hallway. They've been given
          a room at the end. Just as they're entering their room, the
          door across the hall opens revealing a woman in her early
          forties with a basket of laundry. It's Ryan's sister KARA.
                         
                          KARA
           Ryan?
                         
          Ryan turns and stops. It's been a while...
                         
                          RYAN
           Kara...
                         
          They hug. It's a strange hug. Awkward but heartfelt.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Alex, this is my sister Kara.
                         
                          KARA
           Well, hello.
                         
                          ALEX
           Hi.
                         
                          KARA
           (quite frankly...)
           Ryan has told me nothing about you.
                         
                          RYAN
           Kara, what are you doing at a hotel?
                         
                          KARA
           Fuck, I was hoping I wouldn't have
           to... Yeah, uh, Frank and I are
           trying out a trial separation.
                         
                          RYAN
           You're not staying at the house?
                         
                          KARA
           There was an extra room on hold
           here, so I just took it for the
           weekend.
           84.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, okay.
                         
                          KARA
           Yup. So, you guys are dating?
                         
          Ryan and Alex fumble over each other.
                         
                          RYAN
           Um...
                         
                          ALEX
           It's not exactly...
                         
                          KARA
           Hey, don't worry about it. We're
           all getting a little old to be
           calling someone girlfriend... I
           remember when mom used to call Jack
           her boyfriend. It drove me up the
           wall. Boyfriends are for kids...
                          (MOCK ANNOUNCING)
           And I'm just a divorcee!
                         
          An awkward beat in the corridor of the Chalet Suites.
                         
                          RYAN
           So, the rehearsal dinner?
                         
                          KARA
           Yeah, I'll see you two there.
                         
          Kara humps the laundry basket down the hall.
                         
                         
          INT. HOTEL ROOM, CHALET SUITES - DAY
                         
          Ryan and Alex settle in. There's a cheap basket with a pink
          ribbon tied sloppily around some cellophane. In the basket is
          a packet, outlining the wedding weekend.
                         
                          RYAN
           There's a packet.
                         
                          ALEX
           What in life is worth doing that
           doesn't have a packet.
                         
                          RYAN
           Um, I love you?
                         
          Ryan is kidding, but not really. They play it off as a joke,
          but can't help feel the weight of this "moment".
           85.
                         
                         
          INT. CLUB ROOM FIRESIDE LOUNGE, CHALET SUITES - EVENING
                         
          A group of tables have been slid together for the rehearsal
          dinner. Ryan and Alex find the dinner in full swing.
                         
          Ryan's sister JULIE, the bride, waves wildly.
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh my God, Ryan!
                         
          She hops up and gives him a hug.
                         
                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           You must be Alex. You are so
           beautiful. Kara was right. Did you
           get the basket?
                         
                          ALEX
           The basket was very lovely.
                         
                          JULIE
           Tammy wrapped all of them.
                         
          Tammy waves.
                         
                          JULIE (CONT'D)
           Ryan, you look so grown up.
                         
                          RYAN
           Me? You're the one getting married.
                         
                          JULIE
           I know, right? You haven't even
           seen my ring.
                         
          Julie shows off her ring. It's not quite balanced and seems
          to favor quantity over quality.
                         
                          JULIE (CONT'D)
                          (PROUDLY)
           Jim designed it.
                         
          JIM raises a hand. This is Julie's husband-to-be and we can
          tell immediately that Ryan isn't thrilled.
                         
          Ryan thinks of something. He pulls out the 5X7 PHOTOS they
          took of the JIM & JULIE CUT OUT.
                         
                          RYAN
           I brought those photos you were
           asking for...
           86.
                         
                         
                          JULIE
                          (LIGHTS UP)
           Oh great! They go over there.
                         
          Julie points to a table and Ryan walks over. When he gets there,
          we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of America. It's
          overwhelming. All of a sudden, his effort seems miniscule.
                         
          Ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities
          where they were taken. He backs away to see it as a whole and
          his addition has already become invisible.
                         
          Ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and Alex.
                         
                          RYAN
           There were quite a few already up
           there. Almost couldn't find room.
                         
                          JULIE
           I know, isn't it great how everyone
           chipped in?
                         
                          RYAN
           What gave you the idea to do
           something so...
                         
                          ALEX
                          (HELPS)
           ... Substantial?
                         
                          JULIE
           Well, Jim has a lot of our nest egg
           invested in this real estate
           venture right now. So when we went
           over our finances, a honeymoon just
           didn't seem affordable this
           second... So I thought... Hey, just
           because we can't travel doesn't
           mean we can't have pictures.
                         
          The idea of this lands on Ryan pretty hard.
                         
                          ALEX
           It was a great idea.
                         
                          JULIE
           Thanks.

          AN HOUR LATER
                         
          Ryan is stuck with Jim, talking real estate. Alex is having a
          chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama.
                         
                          JIM
           It's sixty acres up against the
           foothills. I subdivided the old
           Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice
           for myself.
                         
                          RYAN
           Sounds nice.
                         
          Jim makes an exhale noise that means "you bet your ass".
                         
                          JIM
           Homes will go in the high fours.
                         
                          RYAN
           Must be a nice development.
                         
                          JIM
                          (CORRECTING)
           It's a community, not a development.
           The concept is turn-key everything.
           You buy a maintenance contract with
           the home. We'll whack your weeds,
           we'll even change the light bulb.
           Furniture? You buy your own or choose
           a package. Seamless traditionalism,
           yet all the perks.
                         
                          RYAN
           Nice.
                         
          Ryan and Alex make eye contact. There's a joy in their
          connection amongst the ramblings of their company.
                         
                          JIM
           We all need a place to call our
           own. This is America. This is what
           we were promised.
                         
                          RYAN
           That's a nice touch.
                         
                          JIM
           What?
                         
                          RYAN
           That bit at the end about
           promise... I like it.

           Thanks.
                          (LEADING)
           So, you still renting that one-
           bedroom?
                         
                          RYAN
           I gave it up.
                         
                          JIM
                          (SURPRISED)
           You own now?
                         
                          RYAN
           No.
                         
                          JIM
           But you're looking?
                         
                          RYAN
           Not really. No.
                         
          The conversation stalls out.

          Everyone is leaving. Tammy grabs Julie's hands.
                         
                          TAMMY
           Can you believe it's tomorrow?! How
           are you going to sleep?
                         
                          JULIE
           I don't know!
                         
                          TAMMY
           You want some Xanax?
                         
                          RYAN
           I don't think that's for sleeping.
                         
                          JULIE
           No, I'm good. I'll have some warm
           milk. That should do the trick.
                         
          Jim comes walking by with a box of flower arrangements from
          the tables inside that are going to be reused at the wedding.
                         
                          JIM
           One more box...

                          ALEX
           I'll get it.
                         
                          RYAN
           You sure?
                         
                          ALEX
           Yeah, yeah...
                         
          Alex steps back in and for the first time in who knows how
          many years, Ryan, Kara, and Julie are alone together.
                         
                          RYAN
           Jim seems like a good guy.
                         
                          JULIE
           Yeah, I know... Isn't he great?
                         
                          KARA
           He's going to make a great husband.
                         
          There's a moment where they just look at each other and
          giggle a little. Just the three of them.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey, Julie, I was thinking... with
           dad not being... Well, I didn't
           know if you had someone to walk you
           down the aisle...
                         
                          JULIE
           Oh, yeah, Jim's uncle is going to
           do it.

                          RYAN
           Oh... Oh, great. Just wanted to
           make sure you were covered. So I
           should get there at...

           Things get going at 530. So you
           know, around then. It's easy. Just
           come down the elevator.
                         
          Alex comes out with the second box. Ryan notices and grabs the
          flowers from her and sets them in Jim's luxury pick-up truck.

                          KARA
           No Ryan. Actually, she's 37 years
           old. She's barely squeaking by.

          The rental car pulls up into the empty lot. Snow on the
          ground. It's cold.
                         
          Ryan and Alex walk up the steps and try the door of the main
          building - it's locked. Ryan shrugs.
                         
                          ALEX
           That's all you got?
                         
          Alex starts walking down the side of the building, looking
          for an open window. The third one opens a crack. She slides
          her HOTEL HONORS CARD in and opens the latch.
                         
                          RYAN

          climbs in after her. He immediately recognizes his
          surroundings.

           in bed and I couldn't sleep. I was
           thinking about the wedding and the
           ceremony and all. Us buying a house
           and moving in together. Having a
           kid... Having another kid...

           break, football games, all of a sudden

           getting married, And then, you know...
           I'm a grandparent. I'm retired. Before
           you know it - I'm dead... and I just
           kept thinking... "What's the point?"

           Jim, I'm not going to lie. Marriage
           can be a pain in the ass. And

           Kind of lonely?
                         
                          JIM
           Yeah.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hey. Everybody needs a copilot.
                         
          This resonates with Jim and he can't help but smile.
                         
                          JIM
           That's a nice touch.
                         
                          RYAN
           Thanks.
                         
                          JIM
           What's the mood like out there?
                         
                          RYAN
           It's not good... Emotional.
                         
                          JIM
           What should I do?
                         
                          RYAN
           (twinkle in his eye)
           Go get her.
           98.
                         
                         
          INT. ENTRY, CHURCH
                         
          Jim walks over to the huddle of bride's maids. They part and
          let him in. He kneels at Julie's feet...
                         
                          JIM
           I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up...
           Will you be my co-pilot?
                         
          Julie gives him a perplexed look before smiling and falling
          into his arms. Tears and smiles spread amongst the girls.
                         
          Kara walks over to Ryan and pats him on the shoulder.
                         
                          KARA
           Welcome home.
                         
          MONTAGE BEGINS AS A SERIES OF IMAGES:
                         
          - Ryan and Alex getting dressed in a little kitchen in the
          church. They're in a hurry and a little sloppy, but there's a
          crooked joy in their faces.
                         
          - Jim standing at the alter with the priest getting a pat on
          the back from his best man.
                         
          - Julie getting walked to the alter by Jim's uncle. They pass
          Ryan, who looks on proudly.
                         
          - The priest gives his blessings.
                         
          - Jim raises Julie's veil. They kiss.
                         
          - Wedding attendees file into the Chalet Suites Banquet Hall.
                         
          - Ryan and Alex mingle with their table.
                         
                          RYAN
           Hi, I'm Ryan.
                         
                          WEDDING GUEST
           I'm your cousin... Harold.
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh, hey!
                         
          - Ryan and Alex dance like teenagers.
                         
          - The band does a cheesy choreographed dance step.
                         
          - Jim makes a speech. He is not good at public speaking, but
          the guests are generous with laughter.
                         
          - Tammy has her tongue down a groomsmen's throat.
           99.
                         
                         
          - Ryan pulls Kara onto the dance floor. She rests her head on
          his shoulder and they slow dance.
                         
          - Jim and Julie make their farewell and run off.
                         
          - Ryan and Alex help pick the center pieces off the tables.
                         
          - Ryan and Alex get into the elevator together. She's wearing
          his jacket. We're about to see them kiss, when the elevator
          door closes.
                         
                         
          INT. CONCOURSE, MILWAUKEE AIRPORT - MORNING
                         
          Ryan and Alex stand between their gates. One sign reads
          OMAHA. The other sign reads CHICAGO.
                         
                          ALEX
           When am I going to see you?
                         
                          RYAN
           You're just going to have to come
           and visit.
                         
                          ALEX
           So settled down. You're not going
           to change on me...
                         
                          RYAN
           Same guy. Just one address.
                         
          We hear a boarding announcement for Chicago. Alex begins to
          step away to her gate.
                         
                          ALEX
           Call me if you get lonely.
                         
          A beat. And then...
                         
                          RYAN
           ... I'm lonely.
                         
          Alex turns for her gate and joins the crowd. Ryan goes to say
          something. He has an impulse... but he finally ignores it and
          gets in line under the sign that reads "OMAHA".
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S APARTMENT, OMAHA - EARLY EVENING
                         
          The door opens and Ryan wheels in his Roll-Away. He walks over
          to the window, parts the blinds and checks out his awful view.
           100.
                         
                         
          We see Ryan opening some mail. We see Ryan laying in bed.
                         
          It's quiet. It's alone.
                         
                         
          INT. CTC HEADQUARTERS, CTC - DAY
                         
          Natalie is giving Ryan a tour of the new ONLINE FIRING AREA -
          A series of cubicles with YOUNG GUYS ON HEADSETS. She is in
          her element and very proud of her work.
                         
                          NATALIE
           ... Some guy sits down in a
           conference room somewhere and a
           server routes their session to one
           of our termination engineers.
                         
                          RYAN
           You don't actually call them that.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I prefer "terminators", but it
           bumped with legal.
                         
                          RYAN
           Really? I can't imagine why.
                         
                          NATALIE
           They follow a workflow that can take
           them through anything from a standard
           dismissal to a violent aggressor.
                         
                          RYAN
           Are they actually on line, right now?
                         
                          NATALIE
           No, they're beta-testing. Role-playing.
           We go live at the end of the month.
           (catches one of the guys
           making a mistake)
           Kyle, you're running through the
           events too quickly. You have to give
           them time to acknowledge each
           statement. Okay? It's a legal thing.
                         
          Ryan can only watch.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY
                         
          Ryan is sitting at his desk. He puts on a HEADSET.
                         
                          RYAN
           This is ridiculous.
           101.
                         
                         
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, CTC - ANOTHER DAY
                         
          Craig is leading a meeting. Ryan seems focused on something
          on his laptop. We see his screen: An itinerary for GoalQuest.
                         
                         
          EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - DAY
                         
          One of the GIANT DIGITAL MARQUEES reads: "GOALQUEST XX"
                         
                         
          INT. GREEN ROOM, GOALQUEST - DAY
                         
          Ryan sits on a sofa, holding his BACKPACK. A slick GOALQUEST
          HOST enters the room.
                         
                          GOALQUEST HOST
           You ready to rock?
                         
          Ryan nods and gets up.
                         
                         
          INT. CONVENTION HALL, LAS VEGAS - DAY
                         
          Ryan stands in the wings. He takes a breath, then steps out
          in front of a sea of people.
                         
          The GOALQUEST XX stage is like nothing we've seen yet. Large
          and professional. Blue Banners hang from the ceiling. Digital
          projectors show Ryan's Headshot - What's In Your Backpack?
                         
          Ryan sets the BACK PACK on a table and quickly unzips it.
                         
          A breath.
                         
                          RYAN
           Last year, I flew three hundred
           fifty thousand miles. The moon is
           only two fifty.
                         
          A long beat. Uncomfortable. Ryan looks at the back pack.
                         
                          RYAN
           Imagine for a second that you're
           carrying a backpack... I want you
           to feel the straps on your
           shoulders... You feel them?
                         
          Ryan isn't feeling them. He is not inspired. He isn't
          believable. He's barely even there.
           102.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Now, I want you to pack it with all
           the stuff you have in your life.
           Start with the little things.
                         
          Ryan is trying, but he can't find the will to do this.
                         
                          RYAN
           The... um... The stuff in drawers
           and on shelves.
                         
          Ryan takes a beat. He just stares at the backpack and thinks
          about all the things he has removed from it... And then...
                         
                          RYAN
           Excuse me.
                         
          And with that, Ryan leaves the stage. Handlers try to figure
          out what Ryan is doing. The Host runs for the mic.
                         
                          GOALQUEST HOST
                          (TO RYAN)
           What the fuck are you doing?
                          (TO CROWD)
           Okay, everyone just relax. We'll
           have your next guest out in a sec.
                         
                         
          EXT. CONCOURSE, MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          Ryan hustles past SLOT MACHINES until he is actually jogging.
                         
                         
          INT. BOARDING GATE, MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          Ryan runs up to a gate. He's the last one to board.
                         
                         
          INT. BOEING 757 - NIGHT
                         
          Over Ryan's shoulder, through the window, we see Chicago
          below as the flight begins its descent.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR OF LIGHT, CHICAGO O'HARE AIRPORT - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan on the PEOPLE MOVER under the ceiling of NEON LIGHTS.
          Peaceful music emits from hidden speakers. Ryan walks briskly
          past idle riders.
           103.
                         
                         
          EXT. RENTAL CAR SATELLITE KIOSK, CHICAGO - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan hurriedly signs a hand-held device, hops into a SEDAN
          and speeds off. The RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT suddenly realizes...
                         
           RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT
           Hey, you forgot to give me your
           Devotion Club card!
                         
                         
          EXT. TOWNHOUSE, CHICAGO SUBURBS - NIGHT
                         
          Ryan steps out of his rental car and approaches the door of
          the townhouse - checking the address against a piece of
          HILTON STATIONARY.
                         
          Ryan stops, knocks, and puts on a smile.
                         
          We hear Footsteps. The door unlocks and opens revealing ALEX.
          She's wearing sweatpants and glasses. She's at home. She
          looks different.
                         
                          RYAN
           Surprise.
                         
          But there's something else. Alex is in shock... She's frozen.
                         
          Something's wrong. Ryan's smile begins to melt.
                         
          A man's voice calls from inside.
                         
           MAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
           Honey, who's at the door?
                         
          A couple kids run by through the background, giggling. A man
          chases after them.
                         
          Alex is still speechless. Her eyes are angry and apologizing
          all at the same time.
                         
          Ryan just stands there. Emotionally bleeding to death.
                         
                          ALEX
                          (ALMOST INAUDIBLE)
           What are you doing here?
                         
          Ryan begins to step away. He turns and heads for his car,
          dropping the flowers.
                         
          Alex's husband becomes visible just as she's shutting the door.
                         
                          ALEX'S HUSBAND
           Who was that?
           104.
                         
                         
                          ALEX
           ... just some guy who was lost.
                         
          Ryan gets in his rental car and drives off.
                         
                         
          EXT. CHICAGO HILTON - NIGHT
                         
          We're watching Ryan through his window from far away... almost
          as if looking through binoculars. He sits on his bed, tie
          undone, holding a glass with an inch of scotch on his knee.

          We see quick glimpses of Ryan getting ready. Crappy little
          COFFEE MAKER crappily brewing. Crappy hotel BAR OF SOAP
          crappily lathering. Crappy HAIR DRYER crappily blowing.

          Ryan is on the phone with Alex.
                         
                          RYAN
           How could you lie to me?

          Alex sits in the car with the engine running.
                         
                          ALEX
           What were you thinking - Just
           showing up at my door like that?
                         
                          RYAN
           What do you mean? I wanted to see
           you. I didn't know you had a family
           - Why didn't you tell me that?
                         
                          ALEX
           Come on, I thought we signed up for
           the same thing.
                         
                          RYAN
           Try to help me understand. What is
           it you signed up for?

           Seriously, Ryan? I can't believe
           we're having this conversation. I
           mean what do you want?
                         
          Ryan stumbles on this. What does he want?
                         
                          ALEX (CONT'D)
           You don't even know what you want.
           I'm sorry that I ruined your night...
           But you could have seriously screwed
           things up for me. That was my family.
           That's my real life.
                         
                          RYAN

                          (SIGHS)
           Look, Ryan. I'm a grown up. I don't
           hold a grudge. When you're ready to
           be an adult and see me again, just
           give me a call.
                         
          Ryan can't quite believe what he's hearing. There's only one
          thing he can do. He hangs up.
                         
                         
          EXT. ESCALATOR, CHICAGO O'HARE AIRPORT - MORNING
                         
          Ryan is walking when his phone buzzes. He checks the DISPLAY -
          CTC Calling. He presses IGNORE.

          Ryan walks up to the TICKET DESK. He is more lost than usual.
          There is something plucky about the TICKET AGENT.
                         
           PLUCKY TICKET AGENT
           Welcome back, Mr. Bingham.

                          RYAN
           Yeah, right, you got me in 2C?
                         
           PLUCKY TICKET AGENT
           Of course. Left side aisle, non-
           bulkhead. Just like you like it.
                         
                          RYAN
           What's got you so fucking happy?
                         
          The plucky agent fades a bit, then tries to recompose.
                         
           PLUCKY TICKET AGENT
           Your boarding card, Mr. Bingham.
                         
          Ryan takes the ticket and exits.
                         
                         
          INT. BOEING 757 - DAY
                         
          Ryan sits doing nothing. Others around him play Sudoku, read
          trashy paperbacks, work on laptops. Ryan just stairs at the
          stitching on the seat in front of him. When... "Bing"
                         
                          PURSER
           Ladies and gentlemen, we have a
           special announcement to make.
                         
          Passengers look up.
                         
                          PURSER (CONT'D)
           Our pilot has just informed me that we
           are passing over the city of Mesa...
           which might not mean much to most of
           you, but means a lot to one of our
           fliers today, because he just hit
           TEN... MILLION... MILES...
                         
                          RYAN
           Oh no...
                         
          The Gershwin theme song for the airline rains down from the
          overhead speakers. Passengers clap. Flight attendants gather
          at Ryan's seat with big smiles and champagne.
                         
          Ryan doesn't even react. He's just stunned.
                         
          The flight attendants separate just enough for a man in a
          bomber jacket to squeeze through. It's Maynard Finch, the
          Chief Pilot from the commercial.
                         
                          MAYNARD FINCH
                          (TO RYAN)
           That seat taken?
           107.
                         
                         
          Maynard gives a little salute to his flight attendants, then
          slides by Ryan to the window seat.
                         
                          MAYNARD FINCH
           You're the youngest yet to hit
           twenty mil. Don't know where you
           found the time...
                          (REMEMBERS)
           Oh right, here you go.
                         
          Maynard pulls out a MEMBERSHIP CARD. It's actually been
          stamped from platinum.
                         
           MAYNARD FINCH (CONT'D)
           Seventh card we've made. Small club.
           We really appreciate your loyalty.
                         
          It has a pair of wings around "Member Number 7". Ryan holds
          it between his fingertips... Catches his own reflection.
                         
                          RYAN
           You know how many times I've
           thought about this moment? Played
           out the conversation I'd have with
           you right here.
                         
                          MAYNARD FINCH
           Really? What did you want to say?
                         
          A long beat.
                         
                          RYAN
           You know, I... I can't remember.
                         
                          MAYNARD FINCH
           That's alright. Happens to all of us.
           (attempts chit chat)
           So, where you from?
                         
          Ryan looks at him straight in the face.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm from here.

          Ryan picks up the phone at his desk. He removes his new TEN
          MILLION MILE CARD and dials a number off the back.
                         
                          AIRLINE OPERATOR

           Oh. I'd like to transfer some of my
           miles. Can you open up an account
           under Jim and Julie Miller?
                         
                          AIRLINE OPERATOR
           Certainly. How many miles would you
           like to transfer?

           How many miles would it take to

           We have our "around-the-world" tickets.
           They're five hundred thousand miles each.

           Sounds perfect.
                         
          Craig enters Ryan's doorway.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Got a second?

           I'm going to have to call you right back.
                         
          Craig takes a seat across from Ryan.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           What happened to you yesterday? I
           was trying to reach you all day.
                         
                          RYAN
           I got tied up in... personal stuff.
           What's going on?
                         
          An uncomfortable beat.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Do you remember Karen Barnes?

           She was part of a thirty person
           reduction a few weeks back in
           Wichita. Natalie fired her.
                         
                          RYAN
           No, I fire dozens of people a day.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           She killed herself. Jumped off a bridge.

                          RYAN
           They're all depressed. We're firing them.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Hey, look, you know I have to ask.
                         
                          RYAN
           No, I don't remember anything. Of
           course they're upset. You never
           think that...
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Wasn't any woman who gave you any
           indication...? Anything?
                         
          Ryan remembers her.
                         
                          RYAN
           No, nothing that stands out.

           Is Natalie alright? Is she coming in?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Natalie quit.
                         
          Ryan isn't surprised.
                         
                          RYAN
           Just like that?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Text message.
           110.
                         
                         
          Ryan stifles a laugh.
                         
           CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)
           Yeah, real fucking nice, right? No
           one has manners anymore.
                         
                          RYAN
           She say where she was going?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           Nah. She was pretty upset.
                         
                          RYAN
           I should give her a call.
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
                          (BUSINESS)
           I need you back in the air.
                         
          Ryan doesn't react.
                         
           CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D)
           Did you hear me? I thought you'd be
           thrilled.
                         
                          RYAN
           I'm fine. What about video conferencing?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           CTC is pausing on the whole new media
           front for a moment. Giving it a little
           more thought. Getting our work horses
           back out doing what they do best.
                         
                          RYAN
           How long are you sending me out?
                         
                          CRAIG GREGORY
           We're going to let you sail and
           sail. Send us a postcard if you
           ever get there.
                         
          Ryan absorbs this. Nods.
                         
                         
          INT. OFFICE, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
                         
          A MANAGEMENT LEVEL GUY sits at his desk. Bay Area sports
          paraphernalia on the wall.
                         
                          MANAGER
           So, what happened?
                         
          We turn to reveal Natalie.
           111.
                         
                         
                          NATALIE
           How exactly do you mean?
                         
                          MANAGER
           You graduated top of your class.
           You seemed to have your pick of
           employment... Including right here.
           Instead, you went to Omaha... to
           fire people for a living.
                         
                          NATALIE
                          (OBVIOUS COVER)
           It's challenging work.
                         
                          MANAGER
           I can't imagine doing that day-in-
           day-out. Not in this climate.
                         
                          NATALIE
           (after a beat)
           ... I followed a boy.
                         
          The manager smiles to himself.
                         
                          MANAGER
           Everybody does at one point or
           another.
                         
          The manager raises a letter - It's Ryan's letter.
                         
                          MANAGER
           This guy says I'd be lucky to have
           you.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY
                         
          Ryan writing the letter. We hear what he's writing...
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           To whom it may concern, I can't even
           count the number of people I've fired
           in my lifetime. So many, that I've
           forgotten what it's like to actually
           hire somebody. We've never met, but I
           know you'd be lucky to have Natalie
           Keener. My advice? Take her and don't
           look back. She'll be the best
           decision you've made in a long time.
                         
                         
          INT. OFFICE, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
           112.
                         
                         
          The manager puts down the letter and reaches out a hand.
                         
                          MANAGER
           Hope he's right.
                         
          Natalie breaks into a smile, then jumps back to professional.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR, RYAN'S LOFT - DAY
                         
          Ryan steps out his front door, ROLL-AWAY in tow.
                         
                         
          INT. OMAHA AIRPORT - DAY
                         
          Ryan walks through the automated door. He looks like he did
          in the opening of the film. Maybe even wearing the same
          clothes. Something is different though.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           Tonight, most people will be
           welcomed home by jumping dogs and
           squealing kids. Their spouses will
           ask about their day and tonight
           they'll sleep.
                         
          Ryan stops and looks up at a GIANT BOARD OF DESTINATIONS. An
          endless list of cities around the world. A menu of new lives
          departing every five minutes.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           The stars will wheel forth from their
           daytime hiding places.
                         
          We look back at Ryan. His eyes lock on one of the cities. We
          don't see which one. He makes a mental decision and turns in
          the direction of the gate. He lets go of his ROLL-AWAY.
                         
           RYAN (V.O.)
           And one of those lights, slightly
           brighter than the rest, will be my
           wingtip, passing over, blessing them.
                         
          Ryan takes a step, but before his foot can land we...
                         
           CUT TO CLOUDS
VANILLA SKY

          ON BLACK
          We hear a whooshing sound, getting louder.

          A BLINK OF AN IMAGE
          New York City from a perspective of flight, not an
          airplane, a swooping diving shot. Back to black.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          Abre los ojos... open your eyes...
          open your eyes...

          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

          DAVID AAMES, JR., 32, swings out of bed and sits on the
          corner of his mattress. it's a chilly New York City
          morning. Early sunlight glows around the corner's of his
          curtains.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          open your eyes...
          He reaches behind him to shut off a slim voice-activated
          clock-radio. He rises, a comforter draped around his
          shoulders, and heads to the bathroom.

          INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - MORNING

          David regards himself in the mirror of a beautifully-tiled
          and well-appointed bathroom. in his thirties now, his
          looks have only deepened and improved. He brushes his
          teeth. He spots a gray hair, and holding tweezers, seizes
          and plucks it.

          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - MORNING

          David puts on a shirt. Checks his wallet for money. His
          bedroom is elegant and spare.

          INT. DAVID'S NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT - MORNING

          He slips down the stairs into the expansive living area of
          this deeply-textured apartment. A stunning, inherited book
          collection lines the walls.

          INT./EXT. NEW YORK CITY GARAGE BELOW APARTMENT/STREETS -


          MORNING
          David starts up his dark green sports car, and roars onto
          the New York City streets.

          EXT. NEW YORK SIDE STREETS u- MORNING
          David travels the side-streets to work. He senses a
          growing weirdness. The streets are empty. He looks at. his
          watch. It's        8:12.  He continues anxiously. Runs a red
          light. Music rises.

          EXT. TIMES SQUARE -- MORNING

          The most recognized piece of real-estate in the world is
          silent. It is as if the world's biggest parade has just
          left, taking everybody with it. David pulls over
          haphazardly. He exits the car, leaving it in the middle of
          the street. He begins to walk, faster now, as music rises.
          All the electricity is on. There is absolutely nobody in
          sight. David begins to run, searching for humanity. The
          billboards - electronic and still - all sell easy solutions
          to his loneliness. He pulls up short., stopping and crying
          out in anguish. There is no one left in the world.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          Open your eyes... open your eyes,
          David...

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

          David hangs out of bed, his mouth in an open silent scream.
          Covers his face with both hands.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          . open your eyes...
          He reaches behind to shut off the same clock-radio, and its
          voice.  He makes a relieved agonized sound into the
          pillow. Gets up, sees a pizza box... a container of
          soup... a remote control on the floor. We hear an incisive
          voice with a comforting lilt - a man we'll meet later.

          A MAN'S VOICE
          Well, I suppose the empty street
          meant loneliness.

          DAVID'S VOICE
          You're a shrink. You've got to do
          better than that.

          A MAN'S VOICE
          I'm a doctor. Let's not
          stereotype each other. Not all
          rich kids are soul-less, and not
          all psychologists care about
          dreams. The question is how you

          

          

          

          

          3
          got here, and why you've been
          charged.

          DAVID'S VOICE
          What do you want to know? I was
          about to turn 33. I ran three
          magazines, and a world-wide
          publishing house. On most days I
          actually fooled myself into
          believing it would last forever.

          INT. BATHROOM - MORNING

          David checks himself in the mirror. Seizes and plucks that
          same gray hair.

          DAVID'S VOICE
          Isn't that what being young is
          about? Believing secretly that
          you would be the one person, in
          the history of man, who would live
          forever?

          INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

          David enters, reaching for his wallet, repeating the
          morning ritual. A figure stirs in the bed behind him. She
          leans upward, wearing David's college basketball tank for a
          pajama-top. She's warm and wicked, a mildly reformed party
          girl, the kind of girl first-novels are written about. She
          is JULIANNA GIANNI,25.

          JULIANNA
          Where you going so early?

          DAVID
          (slightly self-conscious)
          Hey, don't record any more
          messages on my alarm--clock, okay?

          JULIANNA
          Why not?

          DAVID
          I'll think we're married or
          something.

          JULIANNA
          Don't you ever say that word. Or
          I'll never come over here and
          bring you chicken soup and fuck
          your brains out again.

          DAVID  (O.S.)
          (exiting, from other
          room)
          How's your cold?

          JULIANNA
          Still there. How's yours?

          DAVID  (U.S..)
          I guess you took my mind off it.
          She pulls a pink pill-box purse from the nightstand,
          withdraws a multi-colored phone.

          JULIANNA
          Reyna, it's Julianna. I missed my
          audition.
          (dramatic, like Bette Davis)
          I lost my head. Listen, I have to
          go.
          (whispers)
          I'm with David.

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          David in his steel-and-linoleum bachelor kitchen. Julie
          swings into view. Her blouse is unbuttoned two buttons
          too many, down to mid-chest. She gives him a kiss on the
          cheek and lingers. David grabs a racquetball bag, talks to
          the next. room.

          DAVID
          Help yourself to whatever you
          want. Set the alarm, Maria will
          clean up. Lock up when you go.
          And... you are the greatest.

          JULIANNA
          Bye "honey!"

          DAVID
          Bye "honey!" I'll call you later.

          JULIANNA
          When? When?

          DAVID
          Soon!
          They have a comfortable, healthy, mutually satisfying,
          gloriously superficial relationship.

          

          

          

          

          5

          INT./EXT. NEW YORK CITY GARAGE/STREETS - DAY

          David is about to enter the green sports car, then thinks
          better of it. He fires up a knock-around beater car from
          his collection. He drives into the street which is,
          comfortingly, now full of people. We hear R.E.M.'s "All
          The Right Friends."

          EXT. NEW YORK SIDE-STREETS - DAY

          David drives the crowded streets.        It all seems more
          poignant today. Life is good again.

          EXT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

          David pulls up to a lower-end apartment, checks his watch.
          Enter the hung-over BRIAN SHELBY,        30ish. In a world of
          acquaintances, Brian is a true friend.   He has all the
          qualities of Abe Lincoln and, much to his chagrin, the
          looks too. He hops in the car with racquetball bag.

          DAVID
          Did you reserve the court?

          BRIAN
          Easy. I can't handle heavy
          conversation at this ungodly hour.

          DAVID
          I'm sorry to do this early. I
          gotta be done by 10.
          Car phone rings. David checks Caller ID - it's his office.
          He clicks on.

          ASSISTANT VOICE   (RACHEL)
          You're not going to make the 8:45,
          are you?

          DAVID
          How did you find me?

          RACHEL'S VOICE
          David Aames, you have to check the
          colors of the letters for the new
          issue of Rise.

          DAVID
          What are the colors?

          RACHEL'S VOICE

          Let, me think about it.

          RACHEL'S VOICE
          David, please. Don't be late for
          the ten o'clock with the board.

          DAVID
          Okay, but. don't tell anybody where
          I am I don't care if God calls.
          I'm very busy.

          BRIAN
          Can't you just get rid of that
          board?

          DAVID
          The Seven Dwarves? No.

          BRIAN
          Those people drive you nuts.

          DAVID
          And that was the desire of my
          father, who hired them.

          BRIAN
          (suspicious pause)
          You fucked Julie Gianni again,
          didn't you?
          David takes off driving.

          INT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY - DRIVING


          BRIAN
          I know someone was there when I
          called. You had that tone.
          (imitates nasal phone
          voice)
          Oh, no man, I've got a cold. I'm
          hanging in tonight.

          DAVID
          (shaky defense)
          I had a cold. I was alone.

          BRIAN
          Fine. You can do whatever you
          want with your life -

          DAVID
          Thanks.

          BRIAN
          -- but one day you'll know what
          love truly is. It's the sour and
          the sweet. And I know sour which
          allows me to appreciate the sweet.

          DAVID
          Julie Gi.anni is a friend.
          Sometimes we sleep together.
          Brian howls in pain, like a hurt dog.

          DAVID
          What --

          BRIAN
          My dream girl... Julie Gianni...
          is your... fuck buddy.
          Brian emits another pained howl. David reaches over to
          change the music.

          DAVID
          What do you want to listen to?

          BRIAN
          Slow down, man.

          DAVID
          What have we got here - Barcelona,
          Looper... Radiohead?
          Brian freezes at what he sees.

          BRIAN
          Look out! Look out!
          David turns and sees he's hurtling into the back of a car
          stopped just in front of him. Clenching he hits the
          brakes, narrowly avoiding a high-speech collision. And
          then... to his right... another car comes hurtling toward
          him... and stops within an inch of deadly impact.           There
          is an awful moment, as the second car blares on the horn.
          Traffic continues, but the lingering feeling of dread and
          confusion is still in the air.

          BRIAN
          Fuck!

          DAVID
          (annoyed)
          We almost died.

          BRIAN
          I know. My own death was right
          there in front of me, and you know
          what happened? Your life flashed
          before my eyes.

          DAVID
          How was it?

          BRIAN
          Almost worth dying for.
          Pedestrians continue walking around the honking tangled
          mass of the near-.accident.

          EXT. AAMES PUBLICATIONS - DAY

          David meets Peter Brown and RACHEL, his second assistant,
          at. the front of the well-appointed headquarters of Aames
          Publications. Aames hops out of car and heads into the
          building.

          INT. AAMES PUBLICATIONS - DAY

          David Aames Jr. turns down the corridor of Rise Magazine, a
          male youth-culture-style magazine. Rachel gives him daily
          tabloid reports, continues with the essentials.

          RACHEL
          The art department needs a
          decision on the colors. Yellow-
          and- red, or white? And the
          board is pissed you're late.

          DAVID
          You changed your hair.
          David taps on the window of the art department, in panic
          over several cover mock-ups. He gives a presidential
          thumbs-up, moves on. They look at each other, trying to
          decipher if the thumbs-up was a decision.

          ART EDITOR
          Did he mean the yellow-and-red or
          the white?
          David passes a holdover from the old days, older
          Receptionist       (BEATRICE) who speaks uncomfortably and
          gruffly into a headset. She gives David a knowing look -
          late again.

          RACHEL
          They're all waiting for you. And
          David - opinions are expected.

          A MAN'S VOICE
          Do you dream about the Board,
          David? The Seven Dwarves, as you
          call them?
          David walks into the office. Framed original photos from
          album covers co-mingle with a splash of cultured art and
          books. Seven very-interested and very-alert looking Older
          Executives wait.

          DAVID (V.0.)
          Sneezy, Bashful, Sleepy, Happy,
          Doc, Dopey, and of course, Grumpy.

          GRUMPY
          (skeptical)
          How was Aspen?

          DAVID
          (playful, mock drama)
          Good. Now I want answers, and I
          want them now.
          (pause)
          How's it going?
          He gestures charmingly, easily, and bows with apology over
          his lateness. All are happy to see him. Sort of.

          DAVID'S VOICE
          They still look at me like I was
          still eleven years old.

          FLASHBACK
          David at          11, blithely skateboarding the hallways. He
          passes Beatrice, who turns to an editor.

          The light from a small line of chicken-wired windows cuts
          through the blackness. In the shadows of this dank room,
          we hear his voice but we do not see him. It is the
          smaller, slightly muffled tone of David Aames. In the
          shadows, he wears a mask.

          MCCABE
          You're scared of your dreams,

          of his brilliance just yet. It's too early in their
          relationship. He stands tall, leaning on a steel desk,
          polishing his glasses with end of his coat.

          DAVID
          It's a nightmare either way.

          MCCABE
          Is that how do you explain what's
          happened to you?

          DAVID
          What --

          MCCABE
          What happened to your face?

          DAVID
          I'm not talking to you anymore.

          MCCABE
          And you don't want to show me your
          face.

          DAVID
          No.

          MCCABE
          Do you know why you're here?

          (sarcastic)
          The conversation, the coffee --

          David - the part where we parry
          and joust, and get to know each
          other bit-by-bit... we're going to
          have to skip it. You've been
          charged with murder. In four
          weeks, a judge will determine your
          fate based on what I write. You
          will talk to me --

          DAVID

          happen! I don't have to talk to
          anybody!
          A Contentious Prison Guard (AARON) swings his feet down and
          gets up from watching a 17-inch television on a stool. He
          exits into the bigger room to quiet down David Aames.

          Slight push in to show the television show he is watching,
          and we see a snippet of "To Kill A Mockingbird."

          AARON
          You want me to help -

          DAVID
          Get the fuck away from me.

          AARON
          Take it easy, sunshine.

          DAVID
          Get the fuck away from me.

          AARON
          Take it easy, Face. Your whole
          story is full of holes!
          With great power, McCabe advances on the guard. His
          presence, when he turns on the switches, is considerable.

          MCCABE.
          Stop! Please leave. Right now.
          I'll take responsibility.

          AARON
          (whispering, exiting)
          I'm gonna get you, Daddy's boy
          little freak.

          My parents are dead, you fuck!

          MCCABE
          Enough!
          The Contentious Guard leaves.

          MCCABE
          Is it true?

          McDonald's, not once, and never
          watched television. Yet his
          biggest magazine is still TV
          Digest. He and my mother threw
          the grandest parties of the
          literary world. He ballooned,
          jumped from planes, sought
          adventure... His autobiography is
          the manual for every cutthroat
          publisher in New York. It's
          called Defending the Kingdom.

          MCCABE
          I've read it. Page  127.           "David
          Junior was a delight as a child."
          Did I miss something here? Is
          that all he wrote about you?

          DAVID
          I don't think he ever got over the
          fact that I was terrified of
          heights. And when he and my
          mother were run over by a drunken
          teenager on New Year's Eve, ten
          years ago...
          David Aames moves closer to the light. We see a strange
          bland expression of his mask, at first other--worldly... and
          then more clearly.

          DAVID
          he left the keys to the
          Kingdom to me...    51% control,   49%
          going to a group of seven board
          members who all thought they were
          first in line.

          MCCABE
          And you believe the Board, the
          Seven Dwarves, put you here to
          take control of your company.

          DAVID
          What do you care?

          MCCABE
          We're just talking. And tonight's
          Wednesday night, and I go to Black
          Angus for dinner with my daughters
          on Wednesday nights, so I'll have
          to leave soon. You understand
          that our time is limited, don't
          you?

          DAVID
          If I talk, you'll just think I'm
          crazy.
          McCabe gathers his things.

          MCCABE
          With all the respect I can offer a
          man wearing a latex mask and
          spouting conspiracy theories,
          David, trust me - you've crossed
          that bridge.

          DAVID
          Fine. Enjoy your dinner.
          Somehow the lilt in McCabe's voice draws him closer.

          MCCABE
          There are five basic emotions in
          life. Tell me. what emotion
          gripped... him... before he
          entered that cell? Was it Guilt?
          Shadows. There is no answer, just a rustling and a growing
          sense of anticipation in the darkness.

          MCCABE
          Hate? Shame?
          Shadows. Still no answer.

          MCCABE
          Revenge...
          McCabe now shows the invisible skill with which he has
          brought his client to the precipice. And now, with one
          word, he invites David Aames to look over.

          MCCABE
          Love?
          In the darkness, a rustling and the slight turn of a head.

          MCCABE
          I'm completely on the wrong track,
          aren't I?

          From the darkened back room, David Aames appears with ice,
          and re-enters his party.

          DAVID
          Who needs ice?
          Aames moves swirls is more like it - through into his
          party, which is nicely underway. Upscale. Modern. Part
          literary crowd. Part fashion crowd.       He's great in a
          crowd. Surrounded by people, David Aames comes alive.

          DAVID MOVES THROUGH PARTY
          catching the attention of a model.        (LYNETTE)

          LYNETTE
          David! Happy Birthday.

          DAVID
          Jesus, you have the greatest taste
          in shoes I've ever seen. Bar
          none. Anywhere.
          A Woman Caterer in Whites    (EMMA) slips by with a knowing
          smile.

          EMMA THE CATERER
          The old place sure looks more
          crowded with people in it.

          DAVID
          Emma, do you know Lynette?

          EMMA THE CATERER
          No, but I shudder to think what. we
          might have in common.
          David notices that Brian Shelby has arrived with a guest, a
          Woman who struggles with a package and a very large coat.
          On first glance, she's just another girl. On second
          glance, she's a killer. He notes her oddly funny behavior.
          She removes the coat to reveal a very simple natural
          beauty. She is SOFIA SERRANO, a 27 year-old city girl with
          a barely containable life-force. Enter PETER BROWN,
          David's male assistant with surreptitious headset. He
          gestures to a stereo appliance set up in David's living
          room.

          The Living Stereo system is online
          and looking great. it's an

          amazing prototype. They'd love an
          article on it if you like it...
          David nods, still focused on Sofia. Suddenly, he finds he
          can't take his eyes off her.

          PETER BROWN
          and happy birthday, sir.

          ANGLE ON FRONT ENTRANCE
          as David arrives to greet Brian and his guest.

          BRIAN
          Hey man. Happy birthday and all
          the usual shit people say to each
          other. How you doing?

          DAVID
          Livin' the dream, baby. Livin'
          the dream.
          The two friends hug. David shares a quick glance with
          Brian's date, who still burdened with coat.

          BRIAN
          (to Sofia, as in 'meet the
          notorious...')
          Meet David Aames.

          DAVID
          (can't help but flirt)
          And to what do I owe this
          pleasure, the pleasure of --

          -- the pleasure of Sofia. Serrano.

          BRIAN
          We met today at the library, if
          you can believe that --

          SOFIA
          I'm sorry about my coat. It's too
          big for your closet.

          BRIAN
          - we were both pretending to be
          intellectuals.

          DAVID
          No no, I think it's amazing. I
          love your coat.

          SOFIA
          I overdressed. I mean I
          underdressed.

          BRIAN
          I'll just continue like you're
          both actually listening to me.

          SOFIA
          (to David)
          Do you have another room to put it
          in?

          BRIAN
          (invisible, re: their chemistry)
          I have ceased to exist.

          DAVID
          Well, Madison Square Garden is
          nearby, it might fit there.

          SOFIA
          (shoves David playfully,
          as in touche)
          Happy Birthday.
          Her upbeat physicality is intoxicating. Sofia hands David
          her present.

          We picked it out together.
          Neither look at Brian. Brian takes a breath. He's been
          here before.

          DAVID
          Thank you.

          BRIAN
          We picked it out together. We...

          SOFIA
          Welcome.

          BRIAN
          Stop flirting and open it.

          DAVID
          Okay.

          BRIAN
          Let's get a drink.

          

          

          

          

          17

          SOFIA
          Okay.

          DAVID
          I'll leave this upstairs.
          David exits. They are left to consider his personal
          charisma.

          ANGLE ON A HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY CONNECTED TO STEREO
          An odd and disarmingly beautiful display of Coltrane
          performing "My Favorite Things" in David's living room.
          Sofia passes a hand through Coltrane's image, admires it.

          ON DAVID
          David is approached by THOMAS TIPP, a Brit, and an
          Associate board-member at Aames Publications. Tipp is ten
          years older than David, and he is the rarest of birds. A
          sentimental lawyer. And at the moment he's a bit drunk.

          DAVID
          Hey Tommy.
          David moves to address him so he can still track Sofia.

          TIPP
          Hey.  Listen to me. Don't blow
          me off. I'm all packed, I'm going
          back to London and I understand.
          You put me up for that other
          attorney's job, so you didn't have
          to fire me. A classy move, and
          your father would have done the
          same ---

          DAVID
          It's okay, Tommy --

          TIPP
          I became incompetent. Is there
          anything more unbecoming than an
          aging mascot? I cared about your
          father. I lived and breathed for
          him. But these guys, the board,
          they think you're stupid.  A
          corporate hazard, a rogue.
          But the word "stupid" is what David heard loudest of all.
          Nearby, we see a Woman Partner          (one of the Seven Dwarves)
          taking a quick look at David.

          

          

          

          

          18

          TIPP
          But they're going to find a way to
          get you out. They're lined up for
          your office -
          David scans the room. Beneath the good cheer, he sees the
          other layer. Lying. Disloyalty. All part of the
          institution he enjoys forgetting exists. Each word bashes
          his soul.

          TIPP
          -- your job. Your life. Your
          position. They are working day
          and night. to cheat you out of your
          51% vote. And they are going to
          sell this tradition, this
          tradition of words, so they can
          eat at a better cafeteria. And
          what they don't know is this -
          (gestures grandly to
          books that surround
          them)
          - people will read again.
          David's gaze falls upon Sofia, who is looking directly at
          him. And for one blinding moment, something passes between
          them. She looks away. He feels saved.

          DAVID
          (interrupting with
          finality)
          I got it.

          TIPP
          They even have a nickname for you
          behind your back.
          David smiles faintly. Understandingly.   Tipp kisses him
          on the cheek, boldly and drunkenly. He feels like a hero
          to himself.

          TIPP
          Citizen Dildo.
          David flinches, just a little.

          TIPP
          Now you've got great instincts.
          But I say this with complete love.
          Claim your life... Learn to be an
          Asshole... Don't be         -

          

          

          

          

          19

          DAVID
          (extracting himself)
          Two's enough -

          TIPP
          Don ' t be-
          (immediately)
          Okay. Forgive me. I still
          believe in this family. Even if
          it's only you.
          David continues tracking Sofia as he slips over to Peter
          Brown.

          DAVID
          Get Tipp out of here, drive him
          home, and in the morning tell him
          he's re-hired with a 50% raise.
          Set up a meeting with the other
          attorneys. I'm going to be in
          early tomorrow --
          (a look from Peter Brown)
          -- earlier than usual.

          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          David enters, shuts the door and sets Sofia's present down.
          A party dress is on his bed.

          JULIANNA
          Hello handsome.
          He turns to see Julie Gianni in the bathroom doorway,
          wrapped in a comforter.

          JULIANNA
          I've come to wish you happy
          birthday.

          DAVID
          I didn't invite you, Julie.

          JULIANNA
          Yeah, that was a little weird -

          DAVID
          But that's how it works with
          parties. You have to be invited.

          JULIANNA
          I'm mad at you, you dick. We made
          love four times the other night.

          

          

          

          

          20

          DAVID
          Is that good?

          JULIANNA
          Two is good. Three is very good.
          But four -

          DAVID
          (fishing for a
          compliment)
          Four is pretty good?

          JULIANNA
          No, four is... four is... just
          hold me.

          DAVID
          Four is what?

          JULIANNA
          Hold me, and then I'll leave, and
          you can go talk to that cute
          brunette.

          DAVID
          Four is what?

          JULIANNA
          I don't want to meet your fancy
          friends. I knew 'em all back when
          I was fancy too.
          He holds her. They talk in between friendly kisses.

          DAVID
          Four is what?
          She pulls away, and talks plainly to him.

          JULIANNA
          She looks like a moth, David.

          DAVID
          A moth?

          JULIANNA
          Sometimes I worry about one of
          these clever girls in a big silly
          coat who'll play you in just the
          right way, and I'll lose my
          friend. And there'll be no more
          chicken soup parties for you and
          me.

          

          

          

          

          21
          She kisses him again. David very gently, and skillfully
          resists. She gets the message.

          JULIANNA
          When will you call me? And don't
          say soon. I hate it when you say
          "soon."

          INT. PARTY -- NIGHT

          Sofia eyes a framed smashed guitar handsomely mounted in a
          glass display case.

          SOFIA
          So this is what's become of rock
          and roll. A smashed guitar behind
          a glass case displayed on some
          rich guy's wall.

          DAVID
          It was a gift, actually.
          She turns and sees it's David, engaging smile in place.
          She jumps slightly.

          SOFIA
          (apologetic)
          I like it.
          She turns and walks away, David following close behind.

          DAVID
          Whoa, whoa, whoa.

          SOFIA
          - how did you get all this stuff,
          this apartment, this life -
          David is looking just over her shoulder. She turns to see
          an almost disturbingly large portrait of David Aames, Sr.
          She turns back.

          SOFIA
          I see.

          DAVID
          How about if you help me? Unless
          I'm horning in here.

          SOFIA
          You are, but the food's good.

          

          

          

          

          22

          DAVID
          (playful, like a spy)
          See, I've got a little problem.
          I've got a stalker.

          SOFIA
          It doesn't. sound life-threatening.
          Someone passes, bumping her slightly, into him.

          DAVID
          I need a cover. I need for you to
          pretend we're having a
          scintillating conversation. And
          you're wildly entertained. I know
          it's tough.

          SOFIA
          I'll improvise    -

          DAVID
          She's right across the room and
          she's burning a hole in my back
          right now, isn't she?

          SOFIA
          Red dress, strappy shoes?

          DAVID
          Yes_

          SOFIA
          (beat, jarred)
          -- wow, she's really staring at
          you.

          DAVID
          Shit.

          SOFIA
          And she seems to be growing...
          less happy.

          DAVID
          Hmm.

          SOFIA
          I think she's the saddest girl to
          ever hold a martini.
          Julie Gianni sits on the steps watching. The girl, and the
          dress, looked much happier in the bedroom. Julie rises and
          begins to move.

          

          

          

          

          23

          ON BRIAN
          Brian holds a drink, attempts to crash a conversation
          between two models. His debonair act is shaky.

          INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE   -- NIGHT

          David and Sofia race up the stairs. Bad kids having fun.

          SOFIA
          You have another apartment?

          DAVID
          Sort of a day office. Come on -
          They arrive at the door to a smaller upstairs apartment.

          SOFIA
          I'm not going in there.

          DAVID
          Well I am. Goodnight.
          He enters and shuts the door. Frustrated, she stands for    a
          moment, listening to the music streaming from the
          downstairs apartment. We watch her private moment as she
          decides to leave him, turns, feels the emotional pull,
          dances back and knocks sharply three times.

          SOFIA
          I hear her coming.

          DAVID (0.5.)
          Really?

          SOFIA
          No.
          David pulls her inside. Shuts the door behind them.

          INT. PARTY - NIGHT

          Julianna and Brian, both looking for David, discover each
          other.

          INT. HOME APARTMENT/OFFICE - NIGHT

          Artwork on the walls. Sofia is drawn to a powerful
          Monet... and it is not a copy.

          DAVID
          We're safe.      And I've got nothing
          to drink...

          

          

          

          

          24

          SOFIA
          Who did these paintings?

          DAVID
          This is Joni Mitchell. This one
          is Monet. And this one is done by
          me.
          (as a tour guide)
          It is a snowboard.

          SOFIA
          Well, two of them are geniuses.
          (laughs)

          DAVID
          (off the Monet)
          It's the real thing. His
          paintbrush painted that vanilla
          sky. His canvas. It. was my
          mother's.

          INT. PARTY - NIGHT

          Julianna and Brian hold their private conversation by a
          piano. They are bonded, almost mesmerized by their mutual
          fascination for David.

          INT. DAVID'S OTHER APARTMENT -- NIGHT

          David and Sofia laugh.

          DAVID
          You know what I think? You're
          either a very good actress or you
          really do sort of like me.

          SOFIA
          I am an actress.

          DAVID
          There's probably not too much you
          aren't great at.

          SOFIA
          Are you about to compliment, my
          phone voice?

          DAVID
          It's pretty good, you know -

          SOFIA
          Oh, I'd only disappoint, you. See
          - I'm not. qualified. I can spell.

          

          

          

          

          25

          DAVID
          I'm surprised you're available.

          SOFIA
          I'm surprised you're surprised.

          DAVID
          I can't keep this banter going.

          SOFIA
          Me neither.
          Beat. They drop the act. A powerful, awkward moment... and
          the door opens.

          BRIAN
          I caught you.

          SOFIA
          Brian! Come in here!

          DAVID
          What's going on --

          BRIAN
          Your friends are fun and I'm
          drunk.

          DAVID
          (cheerful)
          Julie Gianni is stalking me.

          SOFIA
          She looked dangerous.

          BRIAN
          Nobody stalks me. So I drink.

          DAVID
          Well, we're out of drinks up here.

          BRIAN
          Here, finish my Jack and Coke.
          He messily tries to hand his drink to David, but spills it
          embarrassingly. All his cool is gone, and what's left are
          his friends covering for him, cleaning up.

          DAVID
          These stupid glasses        -

          BRIAN
          No, it's the stupid guy holding
          it.

          

          

          

          

          26

          SOFIA
          (embarrassed)
          Don't worry. I'll get. us all
          something. Jacks and Cokes?
          She exits, leaving the two friends.

          BRIAN
          I better hit it. I drank too much
          and I didn't fucking eat.

          DAVID
          Don't be stupid. The party's just
          starting.

          BRIAN
          (moving away)
          For you it is.

          DAVID
          You can't go. You're my guest of
          honor.

          BRIAN
          Fuck you, David. You're paying me
          to write my novel, so you own me.

          DAVID
          I don't own you. You're
          brilliant, you're good-looking,
          you're handsome.

          BRIAN
          But why'd you have to hit on
          Sofia?

          DAVID
          No one's hitting on Sofia.

          BRIAN
          Fine. Whatever you say.               I'm
          crazy, I'm blind.

          DAVID
          No, you're not blind. You're just
          drinking Jack Daniels. And when
          you drink Jack, you start. in with
          that Frank Sinatra, "She Shot. Me
          Down," gimme a cigarette, King of
          Sad thing...

          BRIAN
          That. I do. Gimme a cigarette.

          

          

          

          

          27

          DAVID
          I'll find one.

          BRIAN
          But wait. You're rich and women
          love you and I'm from Ohio and I'm
          drunk. Can I tell you the truth?

          DAVID
          Everyone does.

          BRIAN
          I dig her.        And I've never said
          this to you before, about any
          girl. But she could be... could
          be could be could be... the girl
          of my fuckin dreams.

          DAVID
          You're not from Ohio.

          BRIAN
          I know.

          BRIAN
          But if she fucks tip our friendship
          - she can go to hell. I won't
          allow it!         We are bros.

          DAVID
          I feel the same way.

          BRIAN
          (wishes he believed it)
          Sure you do.
          Brianprepares to leave, as Sofia returns with   drinks.

          SOFIA
          Where you going?

          BRIAN
          I am Frank. And Frank must go.

          SOFIA
          Huh?

          BRIAN
          I good you bid evening.
          Sofialooks at her watch, and the situation.

          SOFIA
          Hang on, I'll go with you.

          

          

          

          

          28

          BRIAN
          Stay, baby.

          DAVID
          I'll give you a lift home later.

          SOFIA
          No, I have to work tomorrow.

          BRIAN
          You're in great. hands.
          (beat, realizing it's
          over)
          I'm just humoring myself that my
          opinion matters.
          Brian looks at the two of them. Life is telling him, and
          he knows it's time to go. Portrait of a man who will not
          get what. he wants. David notes the poetry in his friend.

          BRIAN
          (leans in close to David)
          You will never know the exquisite
          pain of the guy who goes home
          alone. Because without. the
          bitter, baby, the sweet ain't as
          sweet. Have a good time.
          He exits like a champ, a glorious sad-sack, with a hand
          flourish.

          DAVID
          The Sweet and Sour speech again.

          INT. PARTY

          Julie Gianni dances, her eyes closed, her hand around a
          strange man's neck.

          EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT __ NIGHT

          They stand nervously out in front of her apartment. In the
          distance, rain.

          DAVID
          A lot of people are scared of
          heights. It's not the heights
          that bother me, it's the impact
          that terrifies me.
          (off her look)
          I won't stay long.
          She laughs. It was never his decision to make.

          

          

          

          

          29

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          She switches the light on in an artfully messy city girl
          apartment. A life is lived here, a bed on the back-room
          floor, a bag of trash on the counter, lamp is askew. She
          makes no attempt to clean it up. He soaks in the details,
          including some miniature dolls that occupy her kitchen and
          shelves.

          SOFIA
          Hey Paulo!
          A large goofy dog comes running at her, and then proceeds
          to slather David with love too.

          DAVID
          I'm glad he protects you. This is
          a lethal canine.

          SOFIA
          (from other room)
          I love living here. And I refuse
          to clean up!

          DAVID
          No problem.

          SOFIA
          I've got to work around the clock
          to keep this place.
          David eases the dog away as he examines the oddly exquisite
          dolls. He grabs a look at her in the other room. A bit of
          leg between boot and skirt.  As he admires the dolls:

          DAVID
          So you're really a dancer, huh?

          SOFIA
          For     14     years.   But I don't dance
          like you dance.
          She laughs to herself, steals a look at him. Turns away.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT


          SOFIA
          Do you want something to drink?

          DAVID
          Sure.
          David looks at her refrigerator. A note reads: Call Dad!
          An odd epiphany occurs as he sees the collage of photos

          

          

          

          

          30
          that represent a hard-working, hard-earned, committed and
          passionate life.
          Shot moves across the photos. A young girl living a young
          girl's hard-working and happy life. Group photos of co-
          workers. A few from a vacation. A whole new cast of
          characters, all committed, and they all look inviting to
          him. And one gloriously random photo of her in Cabo San
          Lucas, raising a toast with friends.

          DAVID
          I like your life.

          SOFIA
          Well, it's mine and you can't have
          it.
          David examines a humorously embarrassing vacation photo of
          a sloshed Sofia, a guy's arm reaching for her breast.
          Dedication reads: To Sergio! Marry me!

          DAVID
          I do not want to know the story
          behind this photo. Who's Sergio?

          SOFIA
          It's a nickname.

          DAVID
          Your nickname is Sergio?

          SOFIA
          It's a long story, and we don't
          know each other.

          DAVID
          So many secrets.

          SOFIA
          That's because I'm really an arms
          dealer.

          DAVID
          I've never known an arms dealer.

          SOFIA
          You do now. What about you?
          What's your nickname?
          David freezes. And then decides what the hell - to tell
          the truth.

          DAVID
          Citizen Dildo.

          

          

          

          

          31

          SOFIA
          You're not staying over.

          DAVID
          (still stung over
          nickname)
          Never run a company. Stay an
          artist. Stay an arms dealer.

          SOFIA
          Oh please. Somehow, I can't play
          the violin for you.
          (beat)
          Although. It must be hard
          controlling all those people's
          lives. Everyone at that party is
          connected to you for survival in
          some way, it seems.
          David looks at her, mentally assessing her level of guile.

          SOFIA
          Ever been married?

          DAVID
          No. Ever accept any of your
          12,000 proposals?

          SOFIA
          (playful, self-
          deprecating)
          12,008.No.

          DAVID
          And you moved to New York. To
          dance and paint and act and deal
          arms.

          SOFIA
          Right.
          (going through CDs)
          Do you want to hear Jeff
          Buckley... or Vikki Carr?

          DAVID
          Jeff Buckley... or Vikki Carr?
          Both - simultaneously.
          He continues looking. Flashes of the photos on her
          refrigerator.

          SOFIA
          Everyone said "don't go to New
          York." But I just think good

          

          

          

          

          32
          things will happen if you're a
          good person with a good attitude.
          Doncha think?
          He regards her.  He's a little restless, and a lot
          enchanted. Is she for real?

          SOFIA
          You think I'm naive.
          He decides she's for real. He turns back to the photos on
          her fridge.

          DAVID
          No. I really don't.

          DAVID (V.0.)
          I dug her completely. Somehow, I
          had found the last semi-guileless
          girl in New York City.

          SOFIA
          I have to get to sleep.
          Truthfully -- I'm also working
          mornings as a dental assistant.

          DAVID
          (to himself)
          Boy, am I going to the wrong
          dentist.

          MCCABE(V.0.)
          And you didn't immediately want to
          sleep with her?

          DAVID (V.0.)
          Well you know - I'm a pleasure
          delayer.

          MCCABE (V.O.)
          (interested in his
          romantic style)
          How does that work?

          DAVID (V.0.)
          (toying with the shrink)
          Pleasure delaying... you don't
          know? You keep the relationship
          casual until the absolute breaking
          point.And then, one night, or
          afternoon, or morning... it could
          be months from now... oh, you know
          how it works -

          

          

          

          

          33
          His vision moves across the bright blue sky of one of
          Sofia's photos. A single crimson cloud.

          INT. PSYCHIATRIC UNIT CELL -, DAY         -- THE NEXT


          WEEK/INTERROGATION # 2
          David sits with the mask, facing McCabe. McCabe is hanging
          on every word.

          MCCABE
          - actually no I don't. I've been
          married for twenty-two years.

          DAVID
          Ah, you've got dinner with your
          daughters.

          MCCABE
          That's right. I do.

          DAVID
          Back then I had intricate systems
          with women you wouldn't believe.

          MCCABE
          Like... what...

          DAVID
          Hey Doc. Don't get all melancholy
          over the thirty seconds you were
          single a long time ago.

          MCCABE
          That's what you think I'm doing?

          DAVID
          Yes.

          MCCABE
          Well, you may have a point.
          Let's continue. Time is not our
          friend.

          INT. AARON'S CUBLICLE/PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - DAY

          Aaron watches David, a 17-inch television on a stool to his
          right. Again, strangely, it is "To Kill A Mockingbird"
          that he's watching. We hear audio from the movie through
          the glass.

          INT. LIVING ROOM NIGHT

          David with artist's notebook in hand. Across the table,
          Sofia holds the other notebook.

          

          

          

          

          34

          DAVID
          Just our shortcomings. That's all
          we're allowed to draw.

          SOFIA
          (confidently)
          I've never drawn such a true
          likeness before.

          DAVID
          Mine's finished.

          SOFIA
          Already? Hang on. Okay - done.
          Sofia offers her drawing. It's a caricature of a good-
          looking guy surrounded by money, cars and very thin girls.
          He snatches it, studies it, and what he sees hurts him in
          surprising ways.

          DAVID
          (embarrassed laugh)
          Jesus. That's how you see me?

          SOFIA
          Maybe I didn't add enough money --

          DAVID
          No. It's wonderful. It's
          something you'd see on the wall of
          a steak-house in hell, but it's
          wonderful. Sign it.
          Sofia's face falls a bit. She sees she's hurt him. She
          takes the drawing and signs it, a little guilty.

          SOFIA
          Let's see yours.

          DAVID
          No.
          She grabs it. Its a rich portrait, filled with detail,
          humor and style. She is rocked by its elegance.

          SOFIA
          Wow. I feel bad.
          (regarding it carefully)
          You said to draw a caricature.

          DAVID
          I know. I couldn't. I saw you
          like that.

          

          

          

          

          35

          SOFIA
          Well, it's very good.

          DAVID
          I'll sell it to you.

          SOFIA
          You monster. How much for?

          DAVID
          One kiss.
          She smiles. Something is developing between them.

          DAVID
          That smile is gonna be the end of
          me.

          SOFIA
          (serious)
          And what happens when your friend
          calls you tomorrow?

          DAVID
          He only met you a few hours before
          me. He would do the same.

          SOFIA
          I see that friendship is important
          to you.

          DAVID
          It is. But as his best friend, I
          also know that he's trying to
          finish a novel about inadequacy
          and rejection. So the longer I
          stay, the better it is for his
          career.
          Sofia smiles, shakes her head. And yawns.

          SOFIA
          Your career is one I'd worry
          about.
          David looks down. She's hit a nerve.

          SOFIA
          I'm sorry -

          DAVID
          No, no. You're more right then
          you even know. I used to be one
          of those guys who was just

          

          

          

          

          36
          snowboarding through his life,
          with no focus whatsoever.

          SOFIA
          When did you change?

          DAVID
          (pause, confesses)
          About five minutes ago.

          SOFIA
          (direct, slightly
          whimsical)
          Every passing minute is another
          chance to turn it all around.
          David shakes his head a little. Her words strike right to
          the heart of him.

          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - LATER

          Sofia is asleep on the sofa. Clothes still on.               David
          gently strokes her hair.    Television in b.g. It's one of
          those late-night infomercials, and it's ridiculously
          compelling. The perfect thing to bond over on a great,
          lingering date.

          INTERVIEWER ON T.V.
          And to those who think that you're
          a charlatan?

          OLDER MAN ON T.V.
          I understand. The perception of a
          head frozen somewhere waiting for
          reanimation - it sounds like
          science fiction.

          SOFIA
          What are you watching?

          DAVID
          It's the greatest show... it's
          called "Sofia."
          Sofia looks at him and smiles. They look back to the
          television.

          ON TV INFOMERCIAL
          A charming looking older-man discusses eternal life with a
          television interviewer.

          

          

          

          

          37

          SOFIA
          (off t.v.)
          I've seen this thirty times.

          DAVID
          We did a story on this guy. He
          owns half of Arizona.

          SOFIA
          Is he a fraud?

          DAVID
          How would you ever know?

          SOFIA
          Good point.

          INTERVIEWER ON T.V.
          Can you unfreeze a human life?

          OLDER MAN ON T.V.
          Take the case of Benny the dog.
          Benny is a dog who was frozen for
          three months, and thawed out to
          live a normal life.

          SOFIA
          Oh, well that's comforting. It's
          safe for Benny. I'm in!
          David moves closer to her.

          SOFIA
          We better watch out.
          They regard each other, and David gets up off the sofa.
          It's true. The promise is too great to not savor it, and
          walk away for now. Thrill remains in the air.

          SOFIA
          Where are you going?

          DAVID
          I left my number on your fridge.
          He makes a courtly bow and turns. She feels the loss of
          his company.

          SOFIA
          Come here, I want to tell you a
          secret.
          He pauses a moment, and turns. In this instant, a fleeting
          instant, it's the oddest thing. He can see their entire

          

          

          

          

          38
          life together. He returns to her. Tentatively, she grabs
          a quick sweet kiss on his mouth. He stays for an extra
          moment, kissing just her upper lip, leaving no doubt as to
          the potential of their future. And then... very close she
          says:

          SOFIA
          I meant that to be your forehead.
          David stands. He looks around the small apartment.

          DAVID
          Thank you for the inspiration. I
          will now attempt to run my
          company, showing compassion for
          the seething throng of my partners
          who root quietly for me to fail.
          She looks at him, quite aware of his personal and business
          crossroads. Silently, she roots for him like crazy.

          DAVID
          For things you don't even know -
          thank you. I'm going to go to
          work. I have a company to run.

          SOFIA
          Pleasure delayer.
          He is still somewhat stunned by the evening, and the girl.
          He actually wants to run his company.

          EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

          David slips out onto the street. It's shabbier than the
          alluring night-time version. He'd never notice, or care...
          because David is a man with a brand new buzz.                The city is
          his. Everything good and great suddenly feels inevitable.
          Life feels like a great pop song. Behind him, a car with
          its lights still on starts and advances alongside.           Behind
          the wheel is Julianna Gianni.

          JULIANNA
          David Aames.
          David leans on his car, turns and shakes his head.

          DAVID
          Julie Gianni.     You're following
          me.

          JULIANNA
          only a little.    I wanted to
          finish what we were talking about.

          

          

          

          

          39

          DAVID
          And _-

          JUL IANNA
          How'd it work out with our Moth
          Girl? Did she turn into a
          butterfly for you?

          DAVID
          Yes she did.

          JULIANNA
          But I can see from your walk that
          you didn't sleep with her.
          David turns.

          JULIANNA
          Let me see if I can guess. You
          haven't slept with her because...
          it's more fun when you can draw it
          out. Sex just isn't as good if
          the woman hasn't told all her
          friends she'd never sleep with
          you.

          DAVID
          You're right on the money, Julie.

          JULIANNA
          She must be exhausted from trying
          to be witty for you all night
          long.

          DAVID
          Hey, Julie.

          JUL IANNA
          Sorry. You're just never there
          for your friends until they've
          already given up on you.

          DAVID
          I'm not blowing you off! I just
          want to be alone for a little bit.
          Trust me - I have a lot of things
          I gotta take care of. If we're
          friends, which we are, you'll
          understand.

          JULIANNA
          (simple, honest)
          I'm sorry I got weird. I missed
          an audition and I just felt bad

          

          

          

          

          40
          you didn't invite me to your
          party.
          It zings him. David turns, considers her.

          JULIANNA
          Do you want to make it up to me?
          I won't tell a soul.
          Slowly, he is drawn to her. His old self rallies one last
          time. He gets in the car.

          INT. JULIANNA'S CAR -- EARLY MORNING

          The streets are empty. She plays a CD of a romantic sweet
          pop track with a feeble vocal.

          JULIANNA
          Would you do a story about me if I
          made a CD?

          DAVID
          Sure I would -

          JULIANNA
          Do you like my music?

          DAVID
          (winning, truthful)
          It's vivid.

          JULIANNA
          If I weren't me, I would buy a CD
          by me.

          DAVID
          Well, you know, if you can reach
          one person.
          Julianna is a little hurt, hides it well.

          JULIANNA
          What is happiness to you, David?

          DAVID
          (considering)
          what is happiness?

          JULIANNA
          For me, this is happiness. Being
          with you.
          David doesn't look at her. She speeds up, slowly.

          

          

          

          

          41

          JU.LIANNA
          One thing bothers me. Why did you
          tell Brian I was your fuck-buddy?

          DAVID
          I didn't tell him that. I didn't
          say that.

          JULIANNA
          When did you stop caring?

          DAVID
          (watching the road)
          About what --

          JULIANNA
          About the consequences of the
          promises you made.

          DAVID
          Promises         - I thought we had an
          understanding.

          JULIANNA
          Do you know how hard it is to
          pretend to be your "buddy?" I
          love you, David. You fucked me
          four times in one night. You have
          been inside me and I have
          swallowed your come. That means
          something.

          DAVID
          Julie...

          JULIANNA
          Four times, David! That means
          something. Four times.
          He grabs at the wheel. She won't let go, and speeds up.

          DAVID
          stop the car!
          She picks at things on the dashboard, as she talks with a
          manic energy.

          JULIANNA
          Twenty-four hours a day I live
          with the aching possibility that
          you might call me to do something.

          

          

          

          

          42

          DAVID
          (caring, almost. pleading)
          Take me to your house. We'll talk
          this out. I want to see where you
          live. I want you to stop the car,
          Julie. I want you to stop the
          car!

          JULIANNA
          Don't you know, David? Every time
          you sleep with someone... your
          body makes a promise whether you
          do or not?

          PROFILE OF DAVID AAMES JR.
          who turns slowly to face her. All he sees are haunted
          blue eyes. He knows at the very least, there will be a
          crash. She guns the accelerator.         He is paralyzed, unable
          to alter his fate.

          JULIANNA
          Tell me something, David. Do you
          believe in God?
          Sweet pop music swells. She bursts the barrier of the
          winding road, and the car sails into an embankment of a
          road below. All sound disappears, as we hear a new kind of
          music. Ethereal, almost wondrous. This music continues.

          TO BLACK

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - HALL OF TREES - DAY - DREAM

          David walks the hall of trees. It's the gentle seductive
          whoosh of a new day, the way the world sounds when you're
          in love. Vibrant. Alive. Ironically rich in the beauty
          we all take for granted when we're not in love. He looks
          impossibly drawn forward to Sofia, who stands waiting to
          meet him.

          SOFIA
          Hello.
          He steals a kiss. They both feel like they're getting away
          with something.

          DAVID
          You're amazing. Hello.

          SOFIA
          Did you get to work alright?

          

          

          

          

          43

          DAVID
          Yeah, well, actually... I had a
          horrible dream.

          SOFIA
          You dreamed you'd never see me
          again.

          DAVID
          I left your house. I went to the
          car, and my friend the stalker had
          been following me.

          SOFIA
          Julie.

          DAVID
          Yes. She followed me down the
          street. She wanted to talk, and I
          had that buzz... from you and me,
          and I think my mind was on that
          terrible drawing of me... and, you
          know, I got inside. And she drove
          me off a bridge and committed
          suicide with me in the car.

          SOFIA
          I thought you were going straight
          to work.

          DAVID
          But I survive! I survive with my
          arm and my face reconstructed.
          And what's worse I couldn't wake
          up.

          SOFIA
          (shushing)
          How was your house after the
          party?

          DAVID
          What party? A party?

          SOFIA
          The PARTY. Remember? Red
          dress... strappy shoes... I
          spilled something on your SHIRT...
          sweet and sour... and the saddest
          girl to ever hold a martini.
          He looks at her, completely lost and spacy.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          My dreams are a cruel joke. They
          taunt me. Even in my dreams, I'm
          an idiot who knows he's about to
          wake up to reality. If I could
          only avoid sleep, but I can't.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DAY

          The alarm clock goes off.   A hand shuts it off. He looks
          at a model plane by the side of the bed.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          I try to tell myself what to
          dream. I try to dream that I'm
          flying, something freeing. It
          never works.
          Viewed in shadow, he rises out of bed.

          the dark bathroom. He pauses, and reaches slowly for the
          light. As in every previous occasion, he has been revealed
          in the mirror. But today, viewed over his shoulder, we see
          that the mirror is now a wooden cabinet.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          Here's what you remember from a
          coma. Nothing.

          He shuffles down the hallway, seen from behind, a little
          heavier, a wool cap on. There are no shiny surfaces around
          the house. Music continues.

          MCCABE (V.0.)
          What happened next?

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          What really happened? What,
          didn't you read the file? I was
          out for three-and--a-half weeks.
          My face and arm were shattered.
          My jaw was broken in four places.
          No surgery could be performed
          because of the coma. You can't
          feel the darkness, or the
          numbness, you can't even feel.

          BACK TO UNIT

          DAVID
          And then... I came back to life.
          Just like that dog, Benny. Benny

          how big business operates. A
          random accident. A "lifestyle
          mishap?" They are not
          coincidences. How do you think
          air-tight contracts are broken?
          These are power upheavals.

          being watched. Shot continues parallel to her. She stops,
          sees someone she knows. A truck with several panes of
          glass passes by and stops in traffic. Her image blurs
          behind the glass, but visible to us in the window is David
          Acmes. His healing face is dotted with stubble. He wears
          a wool hat. He looks noble, an assembled victim, a modern
          miracle. He looks like many things. But he no longer
          looks like David Aames. The truck moves through frame.

          INT. HOSPITAL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          A dashing-looking surgeon dripping with confidence, DR.
          POMERANZ, talks with David.

          DR. POMERANZ
          The cranial structure was based on
          thirty pins fastened by small
          panels and bits of bone from the
          mandible... and it seems the
          cartilage grafts have maintained
          your cheek structure.
          Unfortunately, because you were in
          a coma, immediate plastic surgery
          was impossible.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          Doctors. Their power is in
          jargon. So you study up...

          DAVID
          Is that the procedure for all
          Bilateral Periorbital Hematomas in
          a LeFort III fracture of a
          comatose patient?

          DR. POMERANZ
          (pleasantly surprised)
          In a LeFort III   - absolutely. The
          potential for sub-cranial brain
          damage was too great.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          . you do your best.
          David consults a list he's made.

          DAVID
          And beyond the cheek grafts, Dr.
          Pomeranz is, are the pins fastened

          ready for another operation.

          ANGLE SHIFTS TO REVEAL
          three other doctors in the room listening.

          DR. POMERANZ
          Yes, we are working on processes.
          But it... you're specifically not
          at the stage where we can
          experiment --

          DAVID
          Experiment. Use me.

          DR. POMERANZ
          The headaches will go away -

          DAVID
          These are more than headaches.
          This is like a steel plate slicing
          through my every thought.

          DR. POMERANZ
          We're not cowboys. We can't, just
          wing it.

          DAVID
          Because I can't think straight
          most of the time.

          DR. POMERANZ
          We can increase your medication.

          DAVID
          Yes. Medication.

          DR. POMERANZ
          And there are things we'll
          continue to investigate. But
          there are so many others who've
          not been able to benefit
          aesthetically from plastic surgery
          as you have --

          DAVID
          This isn't about vanity, Dr.
          Pomeranz!

          This isn't about vanity. This is
          about functioning in the world.

          It is my job to be out there
          functioning. I've got the money,
          and I'll pay any amount. Invent
          something. Play jazz. You say
          you're the best face man in New
          York City. Fucking prove it.

          OTHER DOCTOR
          We could do something about your
          arm --

          DAVID
          Fuck my arm!
          Dr. Pomeranz looks over to a young assistant.

          DR. POMERANZ
          Nobody here takes your feelings
          for granted. We did prepare
          something for you, based on the
          preliminary examination.

          DAVID
          Tell me. Bring it on.

          DR. POMERANZ
          It's sometimes useful in the early
          stages of rejection. It's a
          facial prosthetic. It was two
          weeks in the making.
          The assistant opens a black-leather bound box. In it is
          the mask - molded from David's own face, locked into a
          pleasant, bland expression.

          DAVID
          A facial prosthetic.

          DR. POMERANZ
          The aesthetic replacement does
          work. Emotionally, and actually.

          OTHER DOCTOR
          (helpfully)
          And the plastic in the aesthetic
          shield also filters out abusive
          rays, and assists in the
          regeneration of cells.

          DAVID
          So it's an aesthetic regenerative
          shield.

          

          

          

          

          50

          DR. POMERANZ
          That's correct. Exactly.

          THIRD DOCTOR
          And the ergonomics of the plate-
          barrier allows it to reflexively
          interact with the movements of
          your own face.

          DAVID
          I see --

          DR. POMERANZ
          It's a helpful unit.

          DAVID
          Good. Because for a minute there
          I thought we were talking about a
          fucking mask!

          DR. POMERANZ
          (beat)
          It's only a mask if you treat it
          that way.

          DAVID
          No it's great. This completely
          takes care of Halloween. But what
          about the other 364         days of the
          year?

          EXT. MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING - NIGHT

          Families lined up watching the ritual blowing up of the
          balloons the night before Thanksgiving. Parents hug
          children, detailing the magical events of an autumn night.
          Sagging balloons come to life-

          A new form of me began to take

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM -- DAY

          David by the window of his darkened apartment. The Macy's
          Thanksgiving Day Parade passes just outside his window.
          The top of Homer Simpson's head floats by. We are a world
          away from the lively apartment that once hosted his
          swinging birthday party.

          I planned my re-emergence like the
          Normandy Invasion.
          Take-out boxes, catalog orders with new clothes, comic
          books and magazines with ripped-out pages fill the living
          room.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - DAY

          A memo is placed on the floor of David's living room. Shot
          pulls back to see he has covered the entire floor of his
          living room with memos and paperwork from Aames Publishing.
          He stands regarding all of this information, stooped and
          wearing his bathrobe.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          David stands in front of the bathroom mirror, practicing
          aloud.

          DAVID
          Sofia. Sofia. Sofia. Sofia.
          Sofia. Sofia.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM -- DAY


          DAVID POV (V.0.)
          I'll just say it   - I did my
          homework. I read every memo.
          Thomas Tipp was right. People
          will read again.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          David stares at his screen. Disheveled, in underwear, he
          eats red--vine licorice and M&Ms.

          DAVID (V.0.)
          I attended the monthly board
          meeting of the Seven Dwarves by
          video hook-up. Oh, baby. This
          was war.
          On screen before him, all seven, and Thomas Tipp too. Shot
          moves in on screen. We can feel the cool tension of their
          imminent takeover. David twitches, feels it physically.

          DAVID
          because nobody's buying books
          let's invest... my father was
          an adventurer.

          David sits in the middle of his office. Push in on the
          white tape that covers the camera on the top of the
          monitors.

          Sofiaaaaaaaaaaa. Serrano.

          DAVID   (V.0.)
          I grew stronger in ways I had
          never known before. And on
          December 5th... my planes filled
          the sky... the return of David
          Aames, Jr. Citizen Dildo.

          INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY

          Sofia dances at the end of a long day. A few others leave
          for the day, trying not to stare at David. Sofia is there
          alone. For a moment, we share her solitude. She practices
          ballet, twisting and turning and landing in frame, looking
          just past camera. She freezes. She catches sight of
          David, undisguised. And she begins dancing again. Harder.
          Does she even recognize him? He moves closer, attempting
          an easy-going persona. We hear nothing but the sound of
          his heart pounding, in odd counter-rhythm to her dancing.
          Finally she stops.

          DAVID
          You won't believe this... but this
          is me smiling.
          She laughs a little at his strange new humor, keeps a brave
          front.

          SOFIA
          It's been a long time. I tried to
          see you but your people wouldn't
          let me.

          DAVID
          I didn't want to see me, okay.
          But then I woke up today and
          finally, a good hair day.
          David fights anxiety, smoothes his coat.

          DAVID
          You want to go out, you want to do
          something?

          SOFIA
          (convincing herself)
          Sure.

          DAVID
          What?

          SOFIA
          Let's go out and do something.

          DAVID
          This weekend. I'll cancel an
          operation or two. We'll have fun.
          Because I am all about fun.
          She kisses his cheek, pulls back quickly, and as she
          exits... he sees her fighting tears.

          INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

          David's mirror is restored. He studies himself. Raises
          his arm higher than he has been able to. In the next room
          we hear Conan O'Brien welcoming:

          CONAN (O.S.)
          . please welcome, Benny the Dog.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          David watches Conan. The Owner of Benny sits with Benny
          himself. He wears a t-shirt reading: L.E. Benny is not
          the most excitable dog in town. In fact, he seems rather
          spacey.

          CONAN (O.S.)
          I have so many questions. To
          start off, tell us all just what
          has happened to Benny. What's
          Benny been through?

          OLDER MAN/OWNER
          Benny fell into the water near our
          home, and was frozen in the
          Skykomish River. And I went
          fishing, thinking he'd gone three
          months earlier', and there he was
          in a block of ice, and...
          David grabs the phone, and dials a number.

          CONAN
          (off the dog's
          complacency)
          He is thawed out, right?
          Laughter on the t.v. Riding the buzz of what he's
          watching, David dials.

          DAVID
          Hey listen, it's David. I'm back
          in your life. I saw you earlier
          tonight. I was just watching our
          old friend Benny the Dog on... on
          Conan... and I thought of you.
          (laughs)
          Whatever. I loved seeing you
          today. So I'll see you soon.
          You're a great dancer!
          He hangs up and feels instantly mortified. He looks at the
          phone in his hand.

          TO BLACK

          INT. CLUB - NIGHT

          David moves into the thick of a high-energy neighborhood
          dance club. He wears a facial prosthetic. In the
          darkness, he doesn't stick out, not much. He spots Sofia
          and Brian, chatting, waiting for him. The sight of the two
          together recalls happier times. Sofia is dressed down.
          Brian, on the other hand, has never looked better. His
          clothes are nicer. He wears them with confidence. David
          has practiced an opening joke, clapping his hands together.
          He will be trying too hard, all night long.
          They regard him in the mask.

          SOFIA
          (a little too big)
          Hi!

          BRIAN
          (equally big)
          Hey.

          DAVID
          What are you drinking?

          SOFIA
          Nothing.

          

          

          

          

          55

          BRIAN
          I am in the mood for cheap sugary
          overpriced rum-and-cokes. You
          want one?

          DAVID
          (spreads arms)
          Is there any other kind?

          BRIAN
          I'll go get us some         -

          SOFIA
          Where's the bathroom?

          BRIAN
          Behind... over by the place next
          to the door by the chick... I
          mean, girl who looks like Bjork.
          She leaves. David turns to Brian immediately.

          DAVID
          You look good, man. How's your
          book?

          BRIAN
          Take it off.

          DAVID
          I can't. It's a facial shield.
          It's an antiseptic prosthesis to
          stop infections. These fucking
          doctors.

          BRIAN
          (with all love)
          Take off the mask! It's freaking
          me out.

          DAVID
          I can't. It's my face. This is
          my face.

          BRIAN
          Oh no. Trust me. It's a little
          different.

          DAVID
          Hey, if you're embarrassed, just
          go. Nobody asked you to chaperone

          

          

          

          

          56

          BRIAN
          Sofia asked me.

          DAVID
          She didn't want to be alone with
          me?
          (Brian regrets his words)
          That's bullshit. Because I think
          I'm being pretty fucking cool
          about the whole thing.

          BRIAN
          Talk to a shrink!        Or you can
          call me sometime, instead of
          hiding in your apartment. Don't
          take it out on a girl you only met
          once.

          DAVID
          (stung)
          Did she say that? I met her
          "once?" Did she say I met her
          "once?"
          Brian looks away. He's said too much.

          BRIAN
          Cut it out. I miss the old you.
          We all miss the old you. Because
          the new guy is shit.
          David turns away. The perfectly wrong thing to say.

          BRIAN
          Oh. Man. Wait. That came out
          wrong. I love you - period.
          How's your arm, man?
          David shakes his head, moves toward the bar.

          DAVID
          Fuck you, Brian. How about no
          more sympathy? How about if
          that's the deal we make with each
          other? Okay?
          David shakes him off, goes to the bar, and rips off his
          mask. His head thuds from a migraine.

          DAVID
          Gimme a Budweiser and a shot of
          tequila.

          

          

          

          

          57

          BARMAN
          (avoiding eye contact)
          What kind of tequila?

          DAVID
          What did you say to me?

          BARMAN
          (leans closer, still
          looking down)
          I said - What. Kind. Of.
          Tequila.

          DAVID
          Why don't you ask me to my face,
          bitch?
          The barman looks up, expressionless.

          DAVID
          Patron. If you have it.

          ON DAVID - LATER
          watching Sofia and Brian from a distance, talking as
          friends.

          DAVID
          Another shot, another Bud.
          He throws bills on the bar.

          BARMAN
          No. This is on the house.

          DAVID
          Why -

          BARMAN
          (odd compassion)
          It just is. Bitch.
          David looks across the club to see Sofia. A Clubgoer Guy
          whispers something in her ear. She shakes it off. He
          pounds down another shot at the bar, this time with the
          Barman.

          DAVID
          Patron!
          David regards a video monitor behind the bar. Someone's
          camera is fixed on Sofia dancing with Brian, and another
          good-looking Young Man. She playfully shoves the good-
          looking Young Man away, not unlike the move that won David

          

          

          

          

          58
          over lo those many nights ago at her apartment. He pounds
          back another drink.

          INT. CLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Weaving at the urinal, David pees. Squeezes his temples to
          ward off a headache.

          CLUBGOER # 1
          Dude, fix your face!!
          The Clubgoers laugh. David laughs too. Suddenly, he feels
          better.

          INT. CLUB         - NIGHT

          David moves through the crowd, powered by a new sense of
          belonging. The music swirls, and takes him along with it.
          He dances wildly. In the strobing darkness, he is
          anonymous, moving with the group, lost as one. David takes
          the mask and pulls it over his head, backwards. In
          profile, his two faces stare in opposite directions. David
          sees his moment. Sofia is alone near the corner of the
          club. He approaches her.

          DAVID
          Hello again.

          SOFIA
          Hello again.

          DAVID
          Idea. Let's start all over.
          He regards her for a moment, sees her apprehension and
          discomfort.

          DAVID
          How about if you help me? Unless
          I'm horning in here -
          (beat, does her)
          You are. But the food is good.
          He continues, taking a step.

          DAVID
          See, I've got a little problem.
          I've got a stalker.
          (does her)
          It doesn't sound life-threatening.
          (does himself, self-
          deprecating)
          I need a cover. I need for you to
          pretend we're having a

          

          

          

          

          59
          scintillating conversation and
          you're wildly entertained. I know
          it's tough.
          (does her, with head nod)
          I'll improvise.

          SOFIA
          (a touch playful)
          I don't talk like that.

          DAVID
          She's right across the room and
          she's burning a hole in my back
          right now, isn't she?

          SOFIA
          Red dress, strappy shoes?

          DAVID
          That's right!
          Their heads are close together, looking off into the club.
          David doesn't notice that Sofia is having a hard time
          playing along with this game. She is overwhelmed, holding
          it in. David continues.

          DAVID
          I think she' s the saddest girl to
          ever hold a martini.

          SOFIA
          (about to burst)
          David --

          DAVID
          Are you okay?

          SOFIA
          No.

          DAVID
          What's wrong? Is it me?

          SOFIA
          I'll tell you later.

          DAVID
          Come on. Tell me now.
          Something's wrong. Tell me
          everything. Let's talk about it
          right now.

          

          

          

          

          60

          SOFIA
          I'll tell you in another life...
          when we are both cats.
          David looks at her. His eyes flash at her choice of words.
          Perhaps there is hope. Sofia stares at. him, worried about
          his sanity as he goes overboard with his praise of her turn
          of a phrase. Push into close-ups as they struggle to deal
          with the discomfort of this moment.

          DAVID
          I don't believe you just said
          that. That. is the best thing I've
          ever heard. That is hilarious.
          God, that just killed me. The way
          you said that. See - that's what
          I love about you. "I'll tell you
          in another life when we are both
          cats."

          EXT. CLUB STREET - NIGHT

          David, Brian and Sofia walk swiftly down the street in
          silence. David weaves. They are anxious to pretend it was
          a wonderful evening.

          SOFIA
          Well, this is where I leave you.

          BRIAN
          Wait. I'll walk you to your door.

          SOFIA
          No, I live just around the corner.

          BRIAN
          I've got my bike here.

          SOFIA
          I'd rather walk.

          DAVID
          Don't be a drag. Can't you see
          she wants to go on her own?

          BRIAN
          Shut up, you're drunk.

          DAVID
          I may be an idiot, but I'm not
          drunk.

          BRIAN

          

          

          

          

          61

          SOFIA
          Seriously, I don't need you to
          walk me home. Thank you.

          BRIAN
          Okay then. So. We'll call you.

          SOFIA
          (unconvincing)
          Great. We'll go catch a movie or
          something.

          SOFIA
          So. We'll meet up soon.
          The word sounds a lot like goodbye and they both know it.

          DAVID
          We'll meet up soon.
          Sofia turns and runs away.

          DAVID
          (lacking all pride)
          We'll call you again to go out
          with me!

          BRIAN
          We'll call you.
          David and Brian walk on. Brian turns back to see Sofia
          running to the corner.

          BRIAN
          Well, it's been a real blast,
          David. I bid you good evening.

          DAVID
          Where you going?

          BRIAN
          My bike. It's back over there.
          We'll hang soon. Bring your mask
          if you want. I'm getting used to
          it.

          DAVID
          Wait a minute.

          BRIAN
          (stops)
          What?

          

          

          

          

          62

          DAVID
          (shrugs)
          I don't know.

          BRIAN
          You drank a little too much. Call
          me tomorrow if you want.

          DAVID
          Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.

          BRIAN
          (starts in Sofia's
          direction)
          No you won't. You just need to
          sleep.

          DAVID
          Hey!

          BRIAN
          (Brian's itching to go)
          What!

          DAVID
          What did you say to Julie Gianni
          the night of the accident?

          BRIAN
          What?

          DAVID
          You told her she was a "fuck
          buddy."

          BRIAN
          Never.

          DAVID
          And she was a little more than
          pissed about it.

          BRIAN
          (a little guilty)
          Have you been harboring this shit
          all along? I never talked to her.

          DAVID
          Whatever. I mean - who am I, if I
          can't. be the one who tells you
          you're not ugly? Aw, give me a
          courtesy laugh. Come on!
          Brian shakes his head, starts running.

          

          

          

          

          63

          DAVID
          Brian!! I'm so fucked up. I'm
          just so fucked up!
          Brian stops one last time, irritated, at the far end of the
          street.

          DAVID
          We're best friends! We're bros!
          Brian needs to rid himself of David. He turns and runs in
          the direction of Sofia.
          David feels the deep pangs of rejection. Breathing hard.
          His head hurts. His body hurts.

          DAVID
          Come on, man, we're bros.
          Beat. He sprints down the middle of the street after
          Brian.

          EXT. CLUB STREET/SOFIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          David runs frantically, heartbroken and sobbing.

          HIS MIND
          Brian catches up to Sofia. She turns, relieved. They kiss
          messily, hungrily. Her shoes arch to reach his height.
          David runs the streets, nearing her home. The images are
          tearing his mind apart. He stops and leans against a car,
          unsteady and nauseous. Holding his head in pain, he
          manages to run further.
          David stops on the street outside her apartment. His sobs
          overwhelm him. He drops to the pavement. He passes out,
          mouth agape. The empty street visible in the b.g., his
          hand loosens its grip on the mask.

          FADE TO BLACK

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          Open your eyes... open your
          eyes...

          EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT -- EARLY MORNING

          David is passed out, the mask is still clutched in his
          hand. A Butterfly crosses frame. A hand enters, resting
          on his shoulder.

          

          

          

          

          64

          WOMAN'S VOICE
          This is a cheap ploy for sympathy.
          David wakes up and looks into the kind face of Julie
          Gianni.

          JULIANNA
          Boo!
          He recoils. His vision sharpens. In the morning shadows,
          with increasing focus, we see that it is actually Sofia.

          DAVID
          No, I'm okay -

          DAVID POV
          Sofia examines him with a look of concern and
          understanding. Everything takes on a clear and sharp
          focus. Behind her is a beautiful vanilla sky.

          SOFIA
          And it worked. Get up.

          DAVID
          Ugh -

          SOFIA
          (helping him up)
          That's right. I agree. Ugh.

          DAVID
          This is a joke.

          SOFIA
          (touches his cheek)
          David. I'm not going to lie to
          you. I liked the way you looked.
          But if you don't pull it together,
          I'll forget the other guy. You
          know that. other guy - YOU?

          DAVID
          (groggy)
          I'm still that guy. I'm still
          that guy.
          Sofia speaks with rapid-fire conviction, as if she might
          change her mind if she thought about it too much.

          SOFIA
          I don't. have a mother-savior bone
          in my body. It's not about that.
          You're coming inside. But if this

          

          

          

          

          65
          turns out to be a big mistake, I
          do have the ability to fall out of
          love with you -
          (snaps fingers)
          - like that.
          She helps him up.

          DAVID
          I am still that guy.

          SOFIA
          Shut up.

          DAVID   (V.0.)
          We created our own world together.
          Us vs. Them -

          DAVID
          Where's Brian?

          SOFIA
          He went with you, didn't he?

          DAVID
          (shaking head at his own
          paranoia)
          I thought you guys hooked up.
          She stops in profile with him. She's astonished at his
          jealousy. Then:

          SOFIA
          (raw truth)
          I wish you hadn't gotten in the
          car with that girl.

          DAVID
          (a long apology is
          coming)
          Sofia... I'm...
          She covers his mouth, nose and face. Only his eyes remain.

          SOFIA
          Your eyes apologized better. Come
          on.
          Portrait of the two, her leading him to the door, the crisp
          glycerine morning overhead.

          

          

          

          

          66

          SOFIA
          Holy God, this is going to change
          my life in a zillion different
          ways... I must be nuts.

          DAVID   (V.0.)
          - and we were quite a pair.   Her
          believing in me. Me believing
          that I deserved it.
          We hear the sound of voices, human voices howling like
          dogs.

          EXT. PRISON - NIGHT

          Prison. Human voices, howling like dogs.

          INT. PRISON HALLWAY -- NIGHT

          David is led down the hallway to his appointment, past many
          door's with thick windows and howling prisoners. Aaron
          pulls him along. They arrive at the Psychiatric Unit..
          McCabe is visible, standing, deep in thought through the
          door.

          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - DAY -      (INTERROGATION # 3)

          McCabe holds his drawings, standing. David is seated.

          MCCABE
          I see you haven't been wasting
          your time. Do you ever draw
          anything else?
          All the drawings are of Sofia, drawn in a similar fashion.
          David is a little jumpy, a little amped.
          He moves to the window. The yard is filled with prisoners.

          DAVID
          No.

          MCCABE
          Did you sleep last night.?

          DAVID
          No. I did not sleep.

          MCCABE
          I've got to leave early today, so
          you'll have to be brief. Now.
          What can you tell me about the
          name "Ellie?"

          

          

          

          

          DAVID
          Ellie?

          MCCABE
          Is that a girl you knew? A girl
          you were in love with?

          DAVID
          I've only been in love once.

          MCCABE
          Apparently, you kept repeating it
          last night. You did sleep, David,
          and your advisor said you cried
          out, you had a nightmare.

          DAVID
          Everything is a nightmare --

          MCCABE
          You cried out for "Ellie," David.
          Do you remember what happened?

          DAVID
          No... no...

          MCCABE
          Dig deep, David. Dig deep. You
          cried out for Ellie. What do you
          remember about Ellie? Show me
          your face, David. Help me. Open
          the door.
          David rises and goes to the prison window.
          ANGLE ON McCABE
          In powerful framing, lower shot capturing him powerfully.

          MCCABE
          (digging deeper', aching
          to help)
          It's true you had an accident.
          It's true you were disfigured, but
          not anymore. Do you remember?!
          (with certainty)
          They did fix your face. Take off
          that mask, David. You'll see your
          face is perfect under there.

          DAVID
          I never trusted the Doctors. What
          happened next was surreal. That
          same arrogant bastard, Dr.

          (warmly)
          David! Hey, my brother. I felt.
          really bad about our last
          conversation.

          CLOSE ON DAVID

          DAVID
          He'd discovered a new form of
          reconstructive surgery, with the
          help of a doctor from Berlin.

          ON DOCTOR FROM BERLIN
          who bows to camera.

          DOCTOR FROM BERLIN
          Hello.

          CLOSE ON DAVID - CONTINUED

          DAVID
          The next thing I knew they shot me
          full of drugs I'd never heard of
          and away we went.

          INT. SURGICAL THEATRE -â¢ DAY

          David is wheeled down the hallway on a stretcher. He is
          high on tranquilizers, singing "One of Us." The doctors
          are all smiles.

          DAVID(SINGING)
          what if Gawd was one of
          ussssss... "

          DAVID(V.0.)
          The odds, they said, were one in
          three that the headaches could be
          reduced by 50% and facial tissue
          could be regenerated.

          

          

          

          

          69

          INT. SURGICAL THEATRE - DAY

          David is strapped onto a plank headed for a metallic
          capsule. We hear odd noises and see high--tech details of
          the operation. Laser beams criss-cross his face. Shot
          moves to the video playback of the operation with this
          legend beneath: Capture. An assistant doctor captures
          Polaroid frames.

          DAVID   (V.0.)
          I couldn't tell you what they did.
          It seemed like science fiction to
          me.

          DOCTOR (V.0.)
          He's going to be one good-looking
          guy when I'm done.
          A Polaroid still of David in mid-operation rolls out of the
          print-machine.

          DAVID   (V.0.)
          Obviously, I was suspicious.
          Wouldn't you be?

          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT -    (INTERROGATION # 3)

          David and McCabe both sit against the wall. McCabe listens
          intently.

          MCCABE
          Suspicious of whom? Of what?

          DAVID
          Once you've been driven off a
          bridge at 80 miles an hour,
          somehow you don't invite happiness
          in without a full body search.

          MCCABE
          Well, at the risk of boring you, I
          can present the alternate
          argument. I once knew a guy who
          was a real loner. And one day he
          woke up at 40, with two daughters
          who lit his life up with purpose.
          Suddenly he goes to endless school
          plays, he gets home at       9:20                  for
          the evening discussion, and he has
          the time of his life. His
          favorite Beatle was once John, and
          now it's Paul.

          

          

          

          

          70

          DAVID
          I always liked... George.

          MCCABE
          It all depends on the individual,
          doesn't it? Tell me. What's
          happiness for you?

          INT. JULIANNA GIANNI'S CAR - DAWN - FLASHBACK


          JULIANNA
          What's happiness to you, David?

          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT - BACK TO PRESENT


          DAVID
          How about another question -

          MCCABE
          Well, you won't show me your face.
          So back to the time-line. Hurry.
          Let's move through this.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT - DUSK

          There is tension in the air. David's face is covered in
          high-tech facial plates. He sits at a table near the
          window. Sofia stands.

          SOFIA
          You've got to take the plates off,
          David.

          DAVID
          I don't want to know what's under
          here.

          SOFIA
          It's going to be fine, you'll see.

          DAVID
          I already called Pomeranz and
          switched it to Wednesday.

          SOFIA
          I hope that shrew at the front
          desk gave you shit about it.

          DAVID
          I'll go in the morning. The
          car'll be fixed.
          She advances, takes his face in her hands. She tugs at the
          corner of one of the plates.

          

          

          

          

          71

          SOFIA
          Good, because I know that the
          problem wouldn't be you delaying
          something you were dreading.

          DAVID
          Couldn't be that.

          SOFIA
          Nooooo, it couldn't be that.
          She pulls off one of the plates.

          SOFIA
          I mean, I agree, it's very
          important to have...
          She pulls off another one of the plates. She grows a bit
          emotional.

          SOFIA
          . the right car...
          She pulls off another one of the plates. Tearing slightly.

          SOFIA
          . to take you where you want to
          go...  24   hours a day...
          Quadrant by quadrant, his face is restored to a pale-
          skinned and tender... perfection.

          DAVID
          How bad is it?

          SOFIA
          Well, your ears are in the right
          place. And the rest of it is...
          not too bad at all.
          Tenderly she kisses, and hugs him.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- DUSK

          Sofia and David make love, looking into each other's eyes.

          SOFIA
          Do you love me? I mean, really
          love me... because if you don't,
          I'll just... have to kill you.

          DAVID
          In my next life I want to come
          back as this mole -

          

          

          

          

          72
          (points out mole between
          her breasts)
          - seriously, this mole. I mean,
          you'll have to wear bikini tops to
          work, or loose-fitting shirts so I
          can breathe, but -

          SOFIA
          I love you. I love you. I love
          you.

          DAVID
          - I could live right there.

          SOFIA
          Is this a dream?

          DAVID
          Oh absolutely.
          She grabs his face, kisses him... a powerful moment, like
          few others in this life.

          EXT. VILLAGE STREET - DAY

          Portrait of the couple together, moving down the middle of
          the street on fresh snow.

          DAVID  (V.0.)
          We talked about the big things,
          the little things, and the big
          things. But in truth, with Sofia,
          it was the in-between times.

          INT. FLORENTINE'S BAR AND GRILL - DAY

          Sofia laughs. A perfect laugh. David admires her, sits
          next to her, holding her hand. Theirs is the unmistakable
          closeness of a couple in the first real throes of a sexual
          relationship. They share a giddy open secret. Across the
          table, we reveal Brian. He's got a tiny high-tech camera.
          Sofia speaks sweetly and passionately to David in Spanish.
          David replies knowingly - "si"           - every few words. It's a
          deep communication. She exits.

          BRIAN
          What, did she say?

          DAVID
          (in love)
          I have no idea.
          Brian shakes his head.

          

          

          

          

          73

          DAVID
          How's things, Brian?

          BRIAN
          Fine.
          David's face is huge in the Brian's viewfinder.

          DAVID
          How's things, Brian?

          BRIAN
          Don't flatter yourself. I'm fine.
          Besides - Sofia is great, but by
          no means one-of--a-kind. She was a
          proximity infatuation.
          Brian, naturally suspicious and somewhat jealous,             spots  a
          writer at a nearby table making notes.

          BRIAN
          (to writer)
          And don't use that, it's mine.
          The writer looks busted.

          DAVID
          Where'd you get the camera?

          BRIAN
          I'm into things... you have no
          idea.

          DAVID
          Well, as long as you're okay.

          BRIAN
          And anyway, we're friends, aren't
          we?

          DAVID
          Always.
          David offers his hand. They shake.

          DAVID'S POV
          David's gaze moves to a 40 year-old man staring at him with
          a bemused smile. A plate of food sits in front of him.
          His eyes suggest a piercing intellect, he looks at David
          with deep familiarity. David can't quite place the face.

          

          

          

          

          74

          BRIAN
          Hey what's up with your face?
          Fuck, there's a seam opening or
          something!

          DAVID
          (mounting horror)
          What - what are you talking about?
          Brian laughs. The spell is broken. Friends again.

          DAVID
          You asshole!

          INT. DAVID'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

          David sleeps next to Sofia. He sits up, takes a glass of
          water from the night-stand, admires his girlfriend and
          moves to the bathroom.

          INT. BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT

          He turns on the light, fills the glass with water. Looks
          up into the restored mirror. His face is disfigured. He
          recoils in terror, knocking against a towel rack, sinking
          to the floor and grabbing a look at a shiny surface on the
          lower cabinet.
          Sofia bolts upright. She sees him on the floor across the
          room, sees his face and backs up in the bed, leaning on her
          arm, screaming.

          INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          He awakens suddenly. Sofia is next to him, smiling.

          SOFIA
          Was I snoring?

          DAVID
          (still breathing heavily)
          No, I think it was me. Thirsty,
          that's all.
          She kisses his hand reassuringly.

          SOFIA
          I'm dreaming about you. Mmmmmmm.
          He gets up and goes to the bathroom.

          

          

          

          

          75

          INT. BATHROOM

          Tentatively, he flips the light on. A very relieved David
          regards his restored face. He shuts off the light quickly,
          and fills the glass of water. Splashes some water on his
          face.

          INT. BEDROOM

          David climbs back into bed.

          SOFIA

          DAVID
          (small laugh)
          I could listen to you say "mmmmm"
          for the rest of my life.

          SOFIA
          They kiss. The kiss expands, as he moves to the back of
          her neck. He caresses her body. She kisses his
          fingertips. Her back to him. Tangled in sheets, they ease
          into lovemaking with the perfect fit of two bodies meant
          for each other. He gently grabs a handful of her hair.
          His hand stops.   It's not Sofia's hair. He slowly turns
          her face to his, and we glimpse David over the shoulder of
          the woman who is not Sofia. He leaps out of bed, falling
          to the floor, the sheet tangled around him. He turns on
          the light.
          Julie Gianni hides her face from the light, like a night
          animal caught in the intrusive glare of day.
          When she speaks, it is with Sofia's cadence and accent.

          JULIANNA
          (scared, uncomprehending)
          Baby, what's wrong?
          He gasps for breath, backing away. Totally terrified.
          Paralyzed. In a low voice:

          DAVID
          Where. Is. She.

          JULIANNA
          Who?
          His instinct is to protect his lifeline Sofia - and he
          pounces on her with a manic will to survive.

          

          

          

          

          76
          Julie Gianni looks a little loopy, almost stoned.
          Taunting.

          JULIANNA
          (taunting, sweet)
          I'm Sofia.

          INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

          David dismantles the phone, takes the cord. He ties her
          willing hands to the posts of the bed. She protests oddly,
          like an actress playing a part.

          DAVID
          Now I'm going to make sure that I
          tie this four times. Do you know
          why, Julie? Because four times
          really means something.
          David pulls his pants on, frantically opens the wardrobe
          closet. No Sofia. Goes to the kitchen. No Sofia. Julie
          sobs quietly, sweetly, tied to the bed. She behaves and
          acts like Sofia.

          JULIANNA
          David, don't hurt me.
          David returns and sits across from her on the bed,
          terrified and barely hanging on.

          DAVID
          Okay, I'm freaked out. It worked.
          So just tell me right now - where
          is Sofia?

          JULIANNA
          I am Sofia.

          DAVID
          In one minute I'm going to call
          the police --

          JULIANNA
          (heart breaking)
          Don't do it, honey.

          DAVID
          I knew you'd survived the
          accident.
          She looks at him with tearful eyes.

          JULIANNA
          What. accident?

          

          

          

          

          77

          DAVID
          Whose body was it? Who's the one
          who hired you? The Seven Dwarves?

          JULIANNA
          I haven't had any accident!

          DAVID
          No, of course not. It wasn't an
          accident at all. It was attempted
          murder!

          JULIANNA
          Honey, please.
          He picks up the phone. Dials 911.

          DAVID
          Police Department? I've captured
          an intruder who's entered my home.
          He turns to her. Her eyes are yearning.

          INT. POLICE STATION/INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

          The flash of mug shots. We see David sitting, sweating,
          agitated waiting in a Police station holding room.
          Suddenly, the door opens and Thomas Tipp enters, flanked by
          other Detectives.

          TIPP
          Guys, can you give us a minute
          here? Detective Larson...
          Detective Andrews... thank you.
          The room empties, and Tipp approaches David.

          DAVID
          They think that I had something to
          so with this.

          TIPP
          I'm going to handle this exactly
          the way your father would have
          handled this. I've got it solved.

          DAVID
          You've got it solved? Where is
          she?

          TIPP
          She's going to be fine.
          David hugs Tipp.

          

          

          

          

          78

          DAVID
          Thank God you're here, man. I
          love her.

          TIPP
          Yeah... Now, I want you to look
          at these photos and then I'm going
          to destroy them. Sofia's
          testimony is also in here. It
          won't exist. She's not going to
          press charges.

          DAVID
          Press charges against. me?

          TIPP
          David, wake up. As your friend, I
          think you should see what you did
          to Sofia. The press won't get
          hold of this if you get. away
          quickly.
          David leans back in his seat. It's all of them - everybody
          - against him. Tipp opens a file thick with paperwork, two
          computer discs and photos. He displays a photo to David,
          moving it into the light so he sees it clearly.              Julie
          Gianni, battered.

          DAVID
          This is Julie Gianni. That's not
          Sofia. This is Julie Gianni. I
          didn't do that do that to her.
          (beginning to shut down)
          Tommy, someone's setting me up.

          TIPP
          David, the Board and I have taken
          care of everything. They've been
          really great, actually. All of
          this is going to disappear. We're
          all behind you... even the Board.
          David looks at Tipp. It's very clear now. He's one of
          them. David attempts calm.

          TIPP
          (quiet, helpful)
          Get out of here.
          A migraine is thundering in David's head. His world is
          spinning backwards.

          

          

          

          

          79

          INT. POLICE STATION -â¢ NIGHT

          David strides down the hallway. A Man in a crystal blue
          sport coat stands, waiting. As David passes, the Man
          confides a single line - as if smuggling out a valuable
          secret. Voices from other rooms, including a small child
          saying: "Mommy, mommy."

          MAN IN BLUE COAT
          This is a revolution of the mind.

          INT./EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

          Exiting, David is intercepted by a furious Brian.

          BRIAN
          You're in fucking sad shape, man.
          Don't fucking ever hit a girl,
          man. Hit me, but don't fucking
          EVER hit a girl.
          David looks up -- sees a small security camera trained on
          them - pulls Brian out of the station.

          DAVID
          It wasn't Sofia. It was Julie.

          BRIAN
          Oh... it was Julie Gianni. So,
          Sofia was abducted by Julie, and
          now Julie is posing as Sofia.

          DAVID
          Yes.

          BRIAN
          You're in O.J. land, man. Julie
          Gianni is fucking dead!

          DAVID
          I don't know what the cops have
          told you, but let me assure you -
          Julie Gianni is alive alive ALIVE.

          BRIAN
          I didn't talk to the cops. I
          talked to Sofia!

          DAVID
          Where is she?

          BRIAN
          I just dropped Sofia off. And I
          saw everything you did to her.

          

          

          

          

          80

          DAVID
          Let me tell you something - I did
          not do that to her. Look me in
          the eye and tell me that it was
          the same girl you brought to the
          party. Tell me it was your dream
          girl, your "proximity
          infatuation."

          BRIAN
          (raw, finally)
          Yes! And you stole her from me!
          David backs away, as Brian responds bitterly, from his
          heart.

          BRIAN
          The one girl I really wanted, and
          you took her from me. You're
          insane. You're losing it, man.
          David nods powerfully. He now understands. Brian is one
          of them too.

          DAVID
          You have revealed yourself.

          BRIAN
          Oh yeah, I'm with them.

          DAVID
          Where'd you get the coat, Brian?
          Where'd you get the camera? How
          much did they pay you?

          BRIAN
          Listen to me, 'cause it's the last
          time we're ever gonna speak. I
          was your only friend.

          DAVID
          You have revealed yourself to me.

          INT. FLORENTINE'S - NIGHT

          David nurses a drink, still breathing heavily. He's been
          crying. His head aches with this thought - maybe I am
          insane. A man in a classy suit walks towards him, inviting
          himself to sit at the table. His bedside manner is
          impeccable. His smile offers infinite compassion. He was
          the man staring at. him in this same restaurant. He is

          EDMUND VENTURA.

          

          

          

          

          81

          VENTURA
          Problems?

          DAVID
          (takes a sip)
          I'm in no mood to be fucked with.
          So do yourself a favor and le -

          VENTURA
          There's an explanation for all
          this, David.

          DAVID
          Who the fuck are you?

          VENTURA
          You and I know each other. You
          found me on the Internet.
          Silence. David stares at the man.

          DAVID
          What do you want? Why are you
          following me?

          VENTURA
          I'm here to help you. And first
          of all, it's very important that
          you calm down.

          DAVID
          Calm down?

          VENTURA
          You must overcome your fears and
          regain control. Take hold of your
          life again. It's as easy as
          holding that glass. What if I
          told you that you can take control
          of all of this... everything...
          even me...
          David turns to him.

          DAVID
          Look. I'm straight, okay?

          VENTURA
          David, look at these people. It
          seems as though they're chatting
          away, doesn't it? Nothing to do
          with you -

          

          

          

          

          82
          David listens, as he looks at the spirited Saturday night
          crowd, lost in their revelry.

          VENTURA
          -- and yet, they might only be here
          because you wanted them to be.
          You are their God. And not only
          that, you could make them obey
          you... or even destroy you.
          David shakes his head, exhausted and in no mood. He shuts
          his eyes, fights off a headache.

          DAVID
          (cutting him off)
          What I'd like them to do is shut
          up! Especially you!
          Silence. David opens his eyes. They're all staring at
          him. Casually waiting for orders.

          VENTURA
          You see?
          David looks at him with horror, backing away. Receding in
          his vision:

          VENTURA
          You and I signed a contract,
          David.

          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - DAY -    (INTERROGATION # 4)

          McCabe is taut, following the thread. His voice calming.

          MCCABE
          Who is the man in the restaurant?
          Who is it?

          DAVID
          I can' t.        --

          MCCABE
          Can you tell the difference
          between dreams and reality?

          DAVID
          Of course. Can you?

          MCCABE
          Think about it. Think with your
          head. You signed a contract, did
          you not.?

          

          

          

          

          83

          RACING THOUGHTS
          A woman walks down the hallway, looking back. Flash   of
          papers signed.

          DAVID
          I signed something.

          MCCABE
          Was the man at the restaurant
          there?
          McCabe's voice becomes infinitely calm and helpful.

          DAVID
          Fuck!

          MCCABE
          Accept your body's resistance.
          Let your head answer.

          DAVID
          Yes.

          MCCABE
          That's right. Who is Ellie?

          DAVID
          I... I don't know what's real.

          MCCABE
          What happened that night, David?
          Somebody died.

          DAVID
          I don't want to remember.

          MCCABE
          Do you understand that you hold
          the keys to this prison?

          DAVID
          It wasn't Sofia.

          MCCABE
          Who was it?

          DAVID
          No.

          MCCABE
          Who was it?

          

          

          

          

          84

          DAVID
          No!

          MCCABE
          You want to let it out, don't you
          David? You're about to tell me.
          Tell me what your heart and soul
          will not allow you to forget.
          David shudders. It's coming.

          MCCABE
          Did you kill Sofia?
          McCabe stands tall, stunned and curious, still pressing to
          pull the nightmare out of him.

          INT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT - DAY - FLASHBACK

          The clown figurine on her stove-top falls over as we hear
          the front door kicked in. David enters, slamming the door
          behind him. He looks around what was once the site of such
          happiness. The same details he'd glimpsed long ago are now
          horrifying to him. He looks at a photo on the
          refrigerator. The same note: Call Dad! The exact
          expression, exact photograph he'd seen on his earlier
          visit. Now it is Julie who is in her place.
          He opens her drawer. Just some papers. And then... the
          drawing he'd once done of her. Now featuring Julie. He
          rips up the drawing, and proceeds to destroy the apartment
          until he stops, collecting himself. Takes a breath and...
          Smash. A lamp is broken over his head. Julie Gianni bends
          down to help him. A shard of the lamp-base is still in her
          hand. Julie's whole demeanor is that of a different girl.
          Even her voice is softer, almost exactly the knock-around
          sweetness of Sofia.

          JULIANNA
          I thought you were a vandal.

          DAVID
          (with difficulty)
          Who... are... you?

          JULIANNA
          I'm Sofia.

          DAVID
          You are not Sofia... you're not
          Sofia...

          

          

          

          

          85

          JULIANNA
          I'm Sofia.

          DAVID
          Whatever.
          Julie starts to cry. Battling tears, she offers her heart
          and soul.

          JULIANNA
          David, honey. This will all be
          over soon. We'll be together
          again. You'll forget Julianna and
          I won't be afraid of you. Let me
          get you a cold towel.
          She exits. He struggles to rise. His head is a swirling
          mess. And then:

          ON KITCHEN DOORWAY
          Sofia slowly returns with towel. Her image still blurry.
          David advances, and faints into her arms.

          DAVID
          Sofia?

          SOFIA
          (whispers)
          Yes, David, I'm Sofia. I'm Sofia.
          He accepts it, all of it, whatever it is, just to hold her.
          They kiss, gently, then more powerfully.

          INT. SOFIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

          They make love, emotionally and deeply. Two bodies
          yearning to possess the other. Camera moves across their
          bodies, as David wipes frame to black, as the move
          continues onto her back.

          DAVID
          Where were you...
          Sofia doesn't answer, doesn't want to lose the moment.

          DAVID
          I don't want to know.
          (thrusting)
          Just tell me you love me.
          David keeps his face buried in her shoulder'. He doesn't
          want to look. The passion gives way to a mounting dread,
          as he hears a voice almost like Sofia's.

          

          

          

          

          86

          JULIANNA (O.S.)
          I love you. I'm afraid of how
          powerful this is.
          He continues moving passionately, harder now. Julie
          responds to the overwhelming surge within David. She gives
          over to the waves of dark pleasure, riding him like a
          rocket. from hell. Harder now. Grabbing her hands and
          pulling them high above her head, clamping down with his
          own.
          Julie Gianni cries a deep, guttural sound of passion.
          This is what someone sounds like when they're not faking
          it. And then... slam... a pillow comes down over her face.

          DAVID
          What the fuck is happening?
          Julie begins to react to what is clearly no longer an
          advanced lovemaking session.

          DAVID
          I want to see your face!
          She grabs at the pillow.

          DAVID
          I want to see your face!
          David reaches orgasm, sobbing, recklessly out of control.
          Julie's body stops kicking and settles into silence. He
          loosens the pillow, and is rewarded with one last violent
          attempt at life. Her hand smacks his neck. He's so taut
          it bounces off. She grabs at his face one last time, her
          hand is left with enough power only to caress his face.
          She goes limp. Silence. David's crying turns to a
          whimper. He looks at the pillow over Julie's head. He's
          confused, a puddle of jagged adrenaline. He doesn't want
          to remove the pillow for fear of who could be underneath.
          He rises up, his elbow across her lifeless chest. With
          true horror, he knows he has to move his hand, but his hand
          will reveal who he's just killed.

          ON HER TORSO
          as his arm moves inexorably away from her chest. Quarter-
          inch by quarter-inch he inches it downward, across the top
          of her breasts... dreading the inevitable, not seeing it,
          and then... there it is. The mole between her breasts.

          INT. HALLWAY STAIRS - DAY

          David exits hurriedly, past some tenants, down the stairs.
          He looks up at his own reflection in the hallway mirror.

          

          

          

          

          87
          He looks horribly disfigured. We hear the sound of
          breathing, encased in a mask.

          INT. PRISON PSYCHIATRIC UNIT - NIGHT -  (INTERROGATION # 4)

          McCabe sits across from David. McCabe looks away, haunted
          by the admission of guilt.

          DAVID
          I did it, didn't I? I don't...
          feel... like I killed someone. I
          feel like...

          MCCABE
          David, who...

          DAVID
          I'm in a dream...

          MCCABE
          . was the man at the restaurant?
          David shakes his head.

          MCCABE
          (pained)
          Sometimes the mind behaves as if
          it were in a dream. Faces change,
          people become other people. The
          subconscious is a powerful thing.
          You treated Julie carelessly,
          didn't you, David? Your feeling
          of responsibility or guilt over
          Julie might have easily turned
          Sofia into Julie.
          (pause)
          Do you know what derangement is?

          DAVID
          I need your help.

          MCCABE
          All I know is, you killed your
          girlfriend and I don't know what's
          in your mind.

          DAVID
          I need your help.

          MCCABE
          I'd work on this case forever if I
          could, but we've run out of time.

          

          

          

          

          88

          DAVID
          What will you plead?

          MCCABE
          Temporary derangement. It's your
          best chance. They won't believe
          me.

          DAVID
          What do you believe?

          MCCABE
          Believe it or not, I care about
          you. You've become like family to
          me. I don't want to give up on
          you.
          David looks at, him oddly. Suddenly, the archetype seems
          very familiar. McCabe continues with the noble concern of
          a towering father figure.

          MCCABE
          (continued)
          But I needed more. I needed an
          answer. I... I even thought there
          was more than a good chance
          someone was playing tricks on you.
          Maybe it was the board. But I
          can't exceed my duties here. I'm
          just a psychologist, and I have to
          leave you.

          DAVID
          Will I see you at the trial?

          MCCABE
          No. I'm just the opening act.
          He exits. David sits at. the table as McCabe and Aaron
          exit. He hears Aaron's television; it's the Life Extension
          Infomercial.

          INT. AARON'S CUBICLE - NIGHT

          Through the glass of the psychiatric unit, we see McCabe
          and Aaron exit. Only Aaron's television, sitting on a
          stool, remains. Push in on the television, which is
          playing the L.E. Infomercial.
          Push in on the reverse. It's David at the window as he
          realizes the true meaning of "Ellie" -- L.E. He bangs on
          the glass, at first slow, then faster, yelling for McCabe.
          The L.E. Infomercial and Benny the Dog are reflected on the
          window.

          

          

          

          

          89

          DAVID
          McCABE!!! McCABE!!! COME BACK!!!

          COME BACK!!!

          INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - DAY

          McCabe hustles down the hallway with David. McCabe stands
          tall, moving forward, like Atticus Finch with Tom Robinson.

          INT. CAR

          McCabe watches David closely. Aaron the Guard turns to
          look at David behind the glass partition that separates
          them. David looks out the window at the world he's missed.

          EXT. PLAZA - DAY

          The police vehicle pulls up in front of a crowded business
          plaza. McCabe exits with David. Always watching his every
          move, his every revelation. David looks upward at the
          towering skyscraper in the center of the plaza, rising high
          into the sky.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY

          A Building Guard guides them through the lobby. McCabe
          trained on David. A look between the two. A Building
          Guard intercepts them.

          MCCABE
          (to Building Guard)
          Life Extension Corporation,
          please.

          GUARD
          What -

          MCCABE
          (a look to David)
          L.E. We hold a court order.

          DAVID
          I think I've been here before -
          McCabe strides purposefully past the Building Guard. Aaron
          shows the pass, and hustles to keep up.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER-63RD FLOOR/L.E. OUTER OFFICE AND HALLWAY-


          DAY
          The elevator door opens to reveal a very pleasant and
          peaceful environment. Comfortable lounging chairs. On the
          reception station is written - L.E. and underneath it the
          words: Life Extension Corporation. Two more Guards meet

          

          

          

          

          90
          them. McCabe watches David, as Aaron releases him from the
          handcuffs. The group moves together. Senses are
          overwhelming David, as they approach the reception station.

          DAVID
          Her name is Libby.
          A stunning young woman rises and moves to greet them.

          LIBBY
          Good morning. I'm Libby. I'm
          here to assist you.
          Libby stares at David's masked face. It's slightly
          unsettling to her.

          MCCABE
          He's my son. He's very shy.

          LIBBY
          (smiling professionally)
          You're not. with the media or part.
          of any legal consortium, correct?

          MCCABE
          No.

          LIBBY
          Welcome to Life Extension. Have a
          look at our proposal. Please
          follow me.
          She-offers them two bound folders featuring the logo - L.E.
          - and guides them down the hallway, looking back with great
          style, beckoning, just as in David's dream recollections.

          MCCABE
          (to Aaron)
          You can wait out here.

          LIBBY
          You'll be meeting Rebecca
          Dearborn.
          (aside)
          My personal role model.

          ON HALLWAY WALLS
          Containing monitors with video-taped "tour guides."
          Talking heads expressing the convictions of Life Extension.
          Compassionate, expressive people. The bits of their
          testimonials echo phrases from David's own life.

          

          

          

          

          91

          PATIENT #1
          .and I'm not a "true believer"
          by nature. But the older you get,
          the more you see the flow of the
          future, and I made a choice...

          PATIENT #2
          .why not embrace the future? I
          Believe the research - the future
          is in the union of the
          spiritual... and the scientific...
          Annoyed at everything around him, McCabe pulls David
          onward.

          INT. LIFE EXTENSION OFFICE  - DAY

          Aames and McCabe sit and wait in a warm wood-paneled
          office, proposals in hand. A glimpse shows words like Re-
          Evolve and Re-Experience, peppered with colorful photos of
          simple, life-affirming portraits of everyday life. It's
          well-appointed and well-marketed organization.
          McCabe regards David as the victim of a lunatic's scam.
          Injustice fuels McCabe.

          MCCABE
          (continuing, scoffing)
          "Cryonization - a journey of re-
          awakening after the preservation
          of the human body at extremely low
          temperatures."

          DAVID
          They laughed at Jules Verne too.

          MCCABE
          (a little sadly)
          David, you're not-
          Account Liaison REBECCA DEARBORN enters with paperwork.
          She is an electric presence. Efficient, caring and oddly
          compassionate.

          DEARBORN
          Mr. McCabe, how are you? I'm
          Rebecca Dearborn.
          (quick notice of mask)
          Life Extension, or L.E. as we like
          to refer to it, is a glimpse of
          the future... a ticket... not in

          deeply meaningful sense that can

          The DNA codes of the human body
          have been broken. Soon, heart
          ailments, cancer and so much more,
          will be a thing of the past. Very
          simply, your anguish... your
          discontent... even your death is
          no longer necessary in a
          traditional sense. Whatever
          malady that hides behind that
          mask... is temporary.
          She looks directly at David, and it stirs him. McCabe
          studies her, and the operation. He thirsts for clues.
          David flips through the folder - toward the back, a panel
          of photos of storage tanks. Lavishly and warmly
          photographed, just like next year's cars in a magazine.

          zero. Power outages, earthquakes,

          DAVID
          What's the "Lucid Dream" option?

          DEARBORN
          Good choice. The Lucid Dream is
          Life Extension's newest option.
          For a little extra, we offer the
          cryonic union of science and
          entertainment.

          "Cryo-tainment. "
          Dearborn spreads apart the paperwork on her desk to reveal
          a thin Video Monitor built into the glass table-top. Aames
          and McCabe peer into the table--top as Dearborn presses
          play.

          ON MONITOR - THE PRESENTATION
          An appealing presentation begins         -- Man's Life. A generic
          happy-looking Man with graphics floating out of his mouth:
          Re-Emerge ...     . Re-Store                 .Re--Invent...a voice takes over for
          Dearborn. A wonderfully comforting tone is present in the
          narration. Like that of a parent.

          stage)
          and Death. Imagine that you
          are suffering from a terminal
          illness. You'd like to be
          cryonized, but you'd rather be
          resurrected to continue your own
          life, as you know it now. L.E.
          offers you the answer. Upon
          resurrection you will continue in
          an ageless state - preserved - but
          living in the "present" with a
          future of your choosing.

          VIDEO MONITOR -- THE PRESENTATION
          Push in on a door that opens to a panel of steel
          compartments. Music and atmosphere are seductive and
          compelling.

          NARRATION (CONT ' D )
          Your death will be wiped from your
          memory. Your life will continue
          as a realistic work of art,
          painted by you, minute-to-minute.
          And you'll live it with the
          romantic abandon of a summer
          day... with the feeling of a great
          movie, or a pop song you always
          loved. With no memory of how it
          all occurred, save for the
          knowledge that everything
          simply... improved. And in any
          instance of discontent, you'll be
          visited by Technical Support.

          David sits, reeling from the revelation he may be living a
          Lucid Dream.

          DAVID

          mistake? What if the dream became

          SIDE-ANGLE CU MCCABE
          Sits forward. He turns to David with great strength,
          worried for him.

          95
          And what is any life, if not the
          pursuit of a dream? The dream of
          peace. The dream of achievement.
          The dream of hearing someone
          saying these words, when they
          truly mean them.
          David is deeply moved as he listens. Somewhere, music
          begins to play. It is The Beach Boys' "Good Vibrations."

          I love you, David. Te Quiero.
          Roam free, David. Most of us live
          our whole lives with no real

          INT. LIFE EXTENSION CORRIDOR - DAY

          David storms around the corner from Dearborn's office,
          yelling, raving.

          DAVID
          I want to wake up! I want to wake

          chasing after him.

          DAVID
          It's a nightmare!
          The doors shut. Music rising.

          INT. EMPTY LOBBY - DAY

          David runs out of the elevator, into the empty lobby. Shot
          cranes up to reveal he is utterly alone, reminiscent of the
          much-earlier Times Square shot.

          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

          David enters the elevator to see Edmund Ventura, calmly
          waiting.

          VENTURA
          David Aames. I think it's time we
          had a proper re-introduction. I'm

          Yes, I'm your Tech Support. We
          first met      150   years ago.

          DAVID
          Oh shit. You sold me the Lucid
          Dream.
          Ventura smiles.

          DAVID
          Well, what the hell happened?

          VENTURA
          I tried to warn you in the bar. I
          told you to exercise control, that
          it all depended on your mind. All
          of this, everything is your
          creation. And we're now heading
          toward your true moment, of choice.

          DAVID
          "True moment of choice?"

          VENTURA
          Yes.

          Yes.

          EXT. SOFIA'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT - FLASHBACK

          David is collapsed on the ground. His mask clutched in his
          hand, passed out. Rhythmic score.

          VENTURA
          (with importance)
          That night, when Sofia left you
          and you fell asleep on the
          pavement, that was the moment you
          chose for the splice...

          DAVID
          (remembers the word)
          The splice?

          FADE OUT ON MASK
          The mask has tumbled out of his hand.

          VENTURA
          Splice. The end of your "real"
          life and the beginning of L.E.'s
          Lucid Dream. A splice of many
          years which passed while you were
          frozen and dreaming.

          FADE UP ON MASK
          A moody day dawns. David's mask is just outside the reach
          of his outstretched hand.

          ON DAVID PASSED OUT ON STREET
          Sofia's hand reaches in, and awakens him. Everything is
          suddenly a little more vivid, a little more super-real.

          SOFIA
          Open your eyes.
          They walk away, down the street, into a beautiful Vanilla
          Sky. Sofia slips her arm around his shoulder, as we've
          seen earlier.

          VENTURA
          From the moment you woke up on
          that street, nothing was "real" in

          who follow your every thought.
          Even at this moment.

          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

          The scene continues as David Aames rides the elevator. The
          compartment now rises above the first seven floors to
          reveal they are traveling upwards in an exterior elevator.
          Other skyscrapers pass by outside the window.

          VENTURA
          Forgive me. I'm blowing your
          mind.
          David looks down with dread.

          DAVID
          I'm not a big fan of heights.

          VENTURA
          I know.
          (continuing)
          We erased what really happened
          from your memory.

          DAVID
          (reaching to understand)
          ..erased?

          VENTURA
          Replaced by a better life under
          these beautiful Monet-like skies.

          DAVID
          (recognizing pieces)
          My mother's favorite.

          VENTURA
          That's right.. A better life
          because you had Sofia.

          ON SOFIA AND DAVID - FLASHBACK
          walking down the center of the Village Street.

          VENTURA
          And you sculpted your Lucid Dream
          out of the iconography of your
          youth.

          life in moments we've already seen.

          VENTURA
          An album cover that once moved
          you...

          An album cover?

          ON BOB DYLAN AND SUZE ROTOLO
          The cover of "Freewheelin' Bob Dylan." Same pose. Same
          street.

          VENTURA
          a movie you once saw late at
          night that showed you what a
          father could be like...

          INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

          The compartment hurtles upwards, rising higher than the
          surrounding buildings.

          VENTURA
          This was a kind woman, an
          individual, more than your equal.
          Ventura nods wistfully. He fell in love with her a little,
          too.

          VENTURA
          You barely knew her in real life,
          but. in your Lucid Dream, she was
          your savior.

          ON DAVID - SLIGHT PUSH
          trying to remember, feeling the flashes of truth in brief
          moments. And then a bracing, challenging realization that
          something went wrong.

          DAVID
          What happened in my real life?
          Something happened. What did you
          erase?

          VENTURA
          Do you really want to know?

          DAVID

          EXT. NIGHTCLUB STREET - DAY

          Match push in on David rising to his feet. His disfigured
          face thunders with a massive migraine. The exact. shot we
          once saw as David and Sofia walked away together. This
          time, David is alone.

          VENTURA
          The morning after the nightclub,
          you woke up on that street, hung-
          over and along. You got up and
          walked away. You never saw Sofia
          again.

          DAVID
          I didn't kill Sofia.

          VENTURA
          No.

          ON DAVID - IN ELEVATOR
          He can't remember any of this. And then...

          VENTURA
          You battled your board, the Seven
          Dwarves, for control. In the end
          it was Thomas Tipp, your father's

          

          

          

          

          101
          friend, the one whose job you
          saved, who wrenched the company
          back in your control.

          INT. RISE PUBLICATIONS - DAY - FLASHBACK

          David exits the company elevator and returns to Aames
          Publications. Tipp is out in front of the employees and
          staffers who welcome him back.

          DAVID

          But then... somebody died.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT      - NIGHT

          David sits in front of the computer in bad physical shape.

          VENTURA
          You longed for Sofia. You shut
          yourself away for months. You
          were alone. You couldn't take the
          pain anymore. Headaches... you
          could barely function.

          DAVID
          I found you on the Internet. I
          signed the contract with you. And
          then...

          INT. MOTEL --- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK

          Aames takes pills, collapses. Music plays.

          PUSH INTO CLOSE UP ON DAVID IN ELEVATOR

          DAVID

          It comes back to him, powerfully.

          The plastic-wrapped body of David Aames is slipped into a
          tube, which is clamped shut. A Christmas tree in the
          background, as music continues.

          VENTURA
          And on a day in late December, you
          gave yourself to us. You're now

          VENTURA
          Your friend Brian Shelby threw a

          Sofia ventures into David's apartment alone, taking in the
          environment and remembering the best moments of her brief
          encounter with David.

          VENTURA
          You were missed, David.
          She moves into close-up, and we see the wonder and the joy
          of a perfect love, nearly attained. She soaks in the
          beautiful, painful mystery of life.

          VENTURA
          It was Sofia who never fully
          recovered. It was she who somehow
          knew you best. And like you, she
          never forgot that one night where
          real, true love seemed possible.

          FLASHBACK - DAY
          David contemplates getting into the car with Julianna. He
          makes the choice that. will change this, and his next life.

          VENTURA
          Consequences, David. It's the
          little things.

          INT. DAVID'S APARTMENT -- DAY

          Sofia exits the shot and we're left with an empty frame.

          ON DAVID -- IN ELEVATOR
          David turns from looking out the window of the elevator.

          DAVID
          (tears in eyes)
          The little things. There's
          nothing bigger, is there?

          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

          David and Ventura exit the elevator onto the rooftop.

          VENTURA
          Your subconscious did create
          problems. Your dream turned into
          a nightmare. The glitch has been
          corrected.

          DAVID
          So all I have to do is imagine
          something? If I wanted McCabe to
          come back, right now -
          McCabe comes flying out of the door.

          MCCABE
          David. Listen to me. These
          people are dangerous. We're in
          trouble. We need to get off this
          roof now.

          MCC DAVID
          Who turns from McCabe to Ventura.
          Ventura leads David away.

          VENTURA
          We're now on "pause". And you're
          about to return to your Lucid
          Dream...

          MCCABE
          "Pause"?

          VENTURA
          (continuing)
          .. with all of the upgrades. You
          won't remember any of this, nor be
          charged for the technical support.
          it is now your moment of choice.
          You can return to your Lucid
          Dream, and live a beautiful life

          

          

          

          

          104
          with Sofia, or whomever you
          wish... or you can choose the
          world out there.
          Ventura gestures to the city beyond, as they come to a
          halt.

          CLOSE ON DAVID

          DAVID
          The world out. there. And you can
          bring me back, just. like Benny the
          Dog.

          CLOSE ON VENTURA
          The client is starting to understand.

          VENTURA
          Yes. Just like Benny the Dog.
          Your face and body can now be
          fixed, of course. But it's very
          different out there now. Your
          finances won't last long. Your
          panel of observers are waiting for
          you to choose.
          Ventura gestures into the camera. He begins walking
          backwards to the roof's ledge.

          VENTURA
          There are no guarantees. But
          remember, even in the future, the
          sweet is never as sweet without
          the sour.
          David sees that Brian Shelby has now joined McCabe on the
          roof. He nods to Brian, who nods back.

          DAVID
          How do I wake up?

          VENTURA
          The decision is yours.
          Ventura glances over the edge.

          DAVID
          And I chose this scenario, didn't

          I?

          

          

          

          

          105

          VENTURA
          (enjoying that he
          understands)
          Yes, to face your last remaining
          fear of heights.

          MCCABE
          David, don't listen to him. You
          were right. This is the Seven
          Dwarves. It's a set up! You
          can't trust him.
          David looks at McCabe with compassion.

          VENTURA
          Don't feel bad, David. This
          winning man is your creation.
          It's in his nature to fight for
          his existence. But he's not real.

          CLOSE ON DAVID
          who looks on with compassion.
          McCabe fights for himself.

          MCCABE
          I'm real. I have two daughters.
          You know that.

          VENTURA
          What are their names?

          MCCABE

          I    - I --

          CLOSE ON DAVID
          who feels for McCabe as the apparition crumbles.

          MCCABE
          Mortality as home entertainment.
          This cannot be the future. Can
          it?
          David regards McCabe. Once dynamic, McCabe now seems
          unsure of his own existence. Slowly, always looking at
          David, he settles into the truth of his very being. With
          great nobility, McCabe shoves his hands into his pockets
          and faces his own destiny... or lack thereof.

          MCCABE
          (quietly)
          Goodbye.

          

          

          

          

          106

          VENTURA
          It's been a brilliant journey of
          self-awakening, and you've simply
          got to ask yourself -- what is
          happiness to you?

          CLOSE PUSH IN ON DAVID AAMES
          His moment of realization.

          DAVID
          I want to live a real life. I
          don't want to dream any longer.

          VENTURA
          Any last wishes?

          DAVID
          Let them out there read my mind.

          VENTURA
          I wish you well, David.
          Music rises as he turns to see Sofia. He moves to her.
          She touches his cheek. His face is restored. They
          embrace.

          DAVID
          Look at us. I'm frozen, and
          you're dead. And I love you.

          SOFIA
          It's a problem.

          DAVID
          I lost you when I got in that car.
          I'm sorry.
          She looks at him, beguiling and understanding.

          DAVID
          But remember what you told me
          once? Every passing minute is
          another chance to turn it all
          around.
          She kisses him.

          SOFIA
          I'll find you again.
          She regards her lost love, taking him in. David treasures
          his last moments with her.
          

          107
          David takes a breath and begins backing to the ledge.

          DAVID
          I'll see you in another life when
          we are both cats.
          David backs up and begins to run. He arrives at the edge,
          looking down at the distance to the ground, stopping
          himself at the precipice.
          He looks back to Sofia one last time, and then leaps out
          into the celestial future. For a fraction of a moment, he
          is suspended in mid-air. And he hurtles to the ground.
          And the ground hurtles to meet him.

          SERIES OF IMAGES
          It is the little things, the random poetic instances of
          David Aames' life that come back to him. Music rises as he
          realizes, finally, his own true poetry and humanity. The
          images topple onto each other with the rhythm of his
          heartbeat. Father. Mother. A casual glance of a
          stranger. All combine to give his life meaning. And then,
          finally, we see the face of the one person who gave him
          purpose in this life... and the next. Sofia.

          TO WHITE:
          The sound of a breath. A gulp of life. Someone's heart is
          beating.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          Relax... relax, David... open your
          eyes...
          An eye opens and the pupil darts to the right and left.
          Life again.

          A WOMAN'S VOICE
          open your eyes.

          INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          WALTER VALE, sixty-two, is standing by the window of his
          modestly furnished Colonial house. He is holding a glass of
          wine and peering out through the drapes.
          
          After a few moments an OLD CAR pulls up. A slightly
          overweight WOMAN gets out of the car. She starts to walk up
          to the house.
          
          Walter steps back from the window and waits. The doorbell
          rings. Walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass
          down on the end table. And then he goes to the door and opens
          it.
          
                                 WOMAN
                    Mr. Vale?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Hello. I'm Barbra Watson. Nice to
                    meet you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Come in.
          
                                 BARBARA
                    Thank you.
          
          She steps into the house and Walter shuts the door. They both
          stand there awkwardly. Barbara is tightly wound and
          overcompensates with a forced pleasantness.
          
                              WALTER
                    Can I take your coat?
          
                              BARBARA
                    No, thank you.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. Would you like anything to
                    drink?
          
                                 BARBARA
                    No.
                        (Beat)
                    Shall we get started?
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.

          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, PIANO ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter and Barbara sit side by side in a very close
          proximity.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Let's try it again.
          
                              WALTER
                    The same thing?
          
                              BARBARA
                    Yes. Remember, fingers curved. Like
                    a tunnel.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK.
          
          Walter starts to play the piano. It's a lesson in progress.
          They are sitting at a beautiful GRAND PIANO but Walter is
          only a beginner. And not a very good beginner.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Don't flatten.
          
          Walter keeps playing.
          
                              BARBARA (CONT'D)
                    Make room for the train.
          
          Walter stops.
          
                              WALTER
                    What?
          
                              BARBARA
                    I said "make room for the train."
                    It's something that I tell my kids.
                    If you curve your fingers like
                    this...
                        (She demonstrates)
                    Then the train can pass through the
                    tunnel.
          
          She passes her pencil through her curved fingers. Walter
          looks at her for a long moment.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Walter walks Barbara to the front door. He opens it and then
          hands Barbara some money.

                              BARBARA
                    Thank you. Next Tuesday at the same
                    time?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. I don't think I'm going to
                    continue with our lessons.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Oh, no. Are you giving up?
          
                               WALTER
                    No.
          
          Barbara gets the point. He is stopping with her, not the
          lessons.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Oh. OK. Goodbye.
          
                               WALTER
                    Goodbye.
          
          Barbara walks out the door and then turns before Walter shuts
          it.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Mr. Vale? If I may ask, how many
                    teachers have you had before me?
          
                               WALTER
                    Four.
          
                              BARBARA
                    Well, for what it's worth, it's
                    difficult to learn an instrument at
                    your age. Especially if you don't
                    possess a natural gift for it. I'm
                    not saying this to be mean. But if
                    you do decide to give up then I
                    would really like to buy your
                    piano. It's a beautiful instrument.
          
          Walter nods, not quite sure how to receive the comment.
          
                               BARBARA (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye.
          
          Barbara turns and leaves. Walter shuts the door.

          Walter stands before a half-empty class. He is wrapping up a
          lecture on economic theory. There is nothing inspiring about
          it.
          
                              WALTER
                    East Asia's experience is really
                    the exception to the rule, because
                    the conditions there that made
                    trade liberalization for the Middle
                    East successful weren't present in
                    the developing countries in sub-
                    Saharan Africa, and in Central and
                    South America.

          Walter is staring out the window in his simple but very lived-
          in office. Classical music plays softly in the background. A
          knock at the door.
          
                               WALTER
                    Come in.

                    Hi.
          
          He sits down and sets a paper on the desk.
          
                              STUDENT (CONT'D)
                    Sorry it's late.
          
                              WALTER
                    Why is it late?
          
                              STUDENT
                    I had some personal things to deal
                    with.
          
                     5
          
          
          
          Walter hands back the paper.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm sorry. I can't accept it now.
          
                                 STUDENT
                    But...
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Walter goes back to work. The Student sits stunned for a
          moment and then gets up and picks up his paper. He opens the
          door and then stops.
          
                              STUDENT
                    You know you still haven't given us
                    a syllabus.
          
                              WALTER
                        (Lying)
                    I know.
          
          The Student shakes his head and leaves without another word.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON
          
          Walter pulls into the driveway of his house. He gets out,
          grabs his belongings out of the back seat and walks inside.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DUSK
          
          Walter is making dinner. Classical music plays from the other
          room. He adjusts the flame and covers a sauce pot. He leans
          against the counter and picks up a half empty bottle of wine
          and pours some into his glass. He catches sight of A SMALL
          FRAMED PICTURE of him and HIS WIFE, smiling.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE,    LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter sits at the piano and practices. It is still going
          badly. The wine glass sits on top of the piano. He lifts his
          hand and inspects his "tunnel".
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, WALTER'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Walter is at his computer. He pulls up his YEAR SYLLABUS on
          the computer and carefully changes 2005 to 2006. He saves it.
          His work is done. There is a knock at the door.
          
                     6
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          The door opens and Walter's colleague, CHARLES VAN HORN steps
          in.
          
                              CHARLES
                    Hello Walter.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Charles.
          
                              CHARLES
                    I'm sorry to interrupt.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That's OK.
          
                              CHARLES
                    Walter, Shelley can't make it down
                    to the NYU conference to present
                    your paper. I'm going to need you
                    to cover for her.
          
                              WALTER
                    Why can't she go?
          
                              CHARLES
                    She's been put on bed rest until
                    she has the baby.
          
          Walter is caught off guard.
          
                                 WALTER
                    When?
          
                              CHARLES
                    Next week. We'll cover your class
                    and make the arrangements.
          
                              WALTER
                    I wish I could, but now is not a
                    very good time, Charles.
          
                              CHARLES
                    I understand but you co-authored
                    the paper and the Dean wants it
                    presented. He wants to keep Shelley
                    on track for tenure.
          
                              WALTER
                    I just don't think I can with the
                    start of classes and my book.
          
                     7
          
          
          
                              CHARLES
                    You're only teaching one class,
                    Walter.
          
                               WALTER
                    So I can stay focused on my
                    writing. I'd really rather not go
                    right now.
          
                              CHARLES
                    I'm sorry but there really isn't
                    another option at this point.
          
          Walter is trapped. He comes clean.
          
                              WALTER
                    Charles, the truth is this is
                    really Shelley's paper. I just
                    agreed to co-author it because she
                    asked me to. I'm not really
                    prepared to present it.
          
                              CHARLES
                    That may be the case but you are
                    the co-author and she can't go.
                    Look Walter, you can take it up
                    with the Dean if you want, but, as
                    your friend, I wouldn't advise it.
                    Not with that argument.
          
          Walter just stares him.
          
                                CHARLES (CONT'D)
                    Good bye.
          
          And Charles is gone, shutting the door behind him.
          
          
          INT. NEW LONDON, THE BLIND TIGER BAR - NIGHT
          
          Walter sits at the end of a bar at a local pub. He is reading
          the newspaper. KAREN, a 44-year-old bartender, is talking to
          a BlONDE HAIRED WOMAN at other end of the bar.
          
          The wall is covered with HAND DRAWN CARICATURES OF REGULAR
          PATRONS. A WAITER hands a plate of food to Karen. She walks
          down the bar and sets it in front of Walter.
          
                              KAREN
                    Here you go, cutey.
          
                                WALTER
                    Thanks.

                              KAREN
                    So I thought you forgot about me.
                    Where've you been hiding?
          
          Karen automatically refills his wine glass.
          
                              WALTER
                    Just busy with work.
          
                              KAREN
                    Well you're never gonna make it on
                    the wall with that excuse. I'm glad
                    your back. Give a holler if you
                    need anything. I'm just gabbing
                    with one of my girlfriends.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK.
          
          She walks back down the bar. Walter starts to eat.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - MORNING
          
          Two cars are parked in Walter's driveway.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME
          
          Walter is packing, laying out his shirts on the bed. After a
          moment, Karen walks in, drying her hair with a towel.
          
                              KAREN
                    When are you going?
          
                              WALTER
                    Today after class.
          
          She takes her earrings of the night stand and puts them in.
          
                              KAREN
                    Sounds like fun. I'm gonna go have
                    a cigarette. You want some coffee?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. Thanks.
          
          Karen leaves. Walter keeps packing.
          
          
          EXT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CAFFETERIA - DAY
          
          Walter sits at a table and eats lunch alone.

          INT. WALTER'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Walter drives along the highway. He notices a SIGN which
          reads "Support Our Troops!"
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CITY, F.D.R. DRIVE - SUNSET

          Walter drives through the small busy streets of the East

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY, EAST VILLAGE, PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
          
          Walter pulls into a parking garage. He gets out and takes a
          ticket from the attendant. He grabs his bag and briefcase
          from the back seat.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET, EAST VILLAGE - NIGHT
          
          He walks down the street, taking in the sights and sounds of
          the city.
          
          
          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER
          
          Walter walks out of a liquor store with a SMALL BROWN BAG.
          
          
          EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME
          
          Walter arrives at a classic tenement building. He looks up at
          the building as if inspecting it.
          
          He takes out his keys. He opens the door and walks in.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME
          
          Walter walks into the well-lit but dingy foyer.   A YOUNG MAN
          brushes by him.
          
                       10
          
          
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, FOURTH FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
          
          He arrives at the second floor and stops in front of a door.
          He unlocks the door and walks in.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter steps into the apartment and drops his bags. He
          immediately notices that the kitchen light is on. Something
          is not right.
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello?
          
          He turns on the living room light and crosses to the kitchen
          table and sets the brown bag down. It's then that he notices
          some fresh flowers on the kitchen table. He looks slightly
          confused. He looks around the apartment. There is an UPRIGHT
          PIANO along one wall.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
          There is no answer. He walks down a LONG HALLWAY and looks in
          the kitchen. Nothing. He walks over to the FIRST BEDROOM and
          looks inside. There are signs of someone living there. He
          looks in the SECOND BEDROOM. He sees nothing.
          
          Suddenly he hears the sound of running water from the
          bathroom. He notices a light under the door. He walks to the
          bathroom and listens. A faucet is turned and the water stops
          running. He opens the door and looks in.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - SAME
          
          A YOUNG BLACK WOMAN is soaking in the bath tub.   She see's
          Walter and screams.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - SAME
          
          Walter screams too and then slams the door, stepping back
          into the hallway.
          
                              YOUNG BLACK WOMAN
                    Stay away from me!
          
          She has a West African accent.

                              WALTER
                    It's OK. I'm not going...
          
                              AFRICAN WOMAN
                    Leave me alone! My boyfriend is
                    coming home!
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm not going to hurt you.
          
                              AFRICAN WOMAN
                    Who are you? What are you doing in
                    here!?
          
                              WALTER
                    This is my apartment.
          
                              AFRICAN WOMAN
                    What do you mean? This apartment
                    does not belong to you. How did you
                    get in?
          
                              WALTER
                    My name is Walter Vale. I have
                    keys. It's my...
          
          Suddenly Walter is pushed up against the wall. Hard.
          
                              MAN'S VOICE
                    What the fuck?!
          
          A very angry, YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN is in Walter's face.
          He grabs Walter violently by the collar and shakes him.
          
                              YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
                    Who are you?! Zainab?!
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I'm in here! He is crazy!
          
                              WALTER
                    Stop it! I am not...
          
          The Young Middle Eastern Man slams him against the wall. It's
          more of a warning shot then a violent act. Walter is
          terrified.
          
                               YOUNG MIDDLE EASTERN MAN
                    Shut up!
          
                               WALTER
                    OK. OK.
          
                 12
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB (O.S.)
                        (In French)
                    Tarek. What is happening?
          
                              TAREK
                        (In French)
                    Are you OK?
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I'm fine.
          
                              TAREK
                        (In French)
                    Who is this?
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I have no idea! I was in the bath
                    and he was just standing there.
          
                              TAREK
                        (Shaking Walter)
                    Did you touch her?! Did you touch
                    her?!
          
                              WALTER
                    No! No!
          
          Zainab opens the door.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    He didn't touch me! But how did he
                    get in? He said he has keys.
          
                              TAREK
                    Do you have keys?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes! Yes! I have keys. It's my
                    apartment.
          
          Tarek stares at Walter, trying to make sense of it.
          
                               ZAINAB
                        (in French)
                    What does he mean it's his
                    apartment?
          
                              TAREK
                    I don't know! Show me your keys!
          
                    13
          
          
          
          Walter reaches into his pocket and holds up his keys.
          
                              WALTER
                    This is my apartment. I've owned it
                    for twenty-five years.
          
                              TAREK
                    So why haven't you been here!?
          
                              WALTER
                    I live in Connecticut. I haven't
                    used it in a long time.
          
          Walter is starting to get through.
          
                              TAREK
                    Are you friends with Ivan?
          
                              WALTER
                    Ivan? Who is Ivan?
          
          Tarek is getting nervous.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I knew this would happen! He
                    probably called the police.
          
          This catches Tarek's attention.
          
                              TAREK
                        (to Walter)
                    Did you call the police?
          
          Walter hesitates.
          
                              WALTER
                    No.
          
                              TAREK
                    You didn't call the police?
          
                              WALTER
                    No.
          
          Tarek looks like he might belt Walter. Instead, he lets him
          go and quickly backs up. He paces while trying to gather his
          thoughts. Walter doesn't move. Zainab runs into the bedroom.
          
                              TAREK
                    And you don't know Ivan?
          
                    14
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know Ivan. Who is he?
          
                              TAREK
                    He rented us this place. He said it
                    belonged to his friend who was out
                    of town.
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know who he is but this is
                    my apartment. I assure you.
          
          Tarek looks at Walter for a long moment. It's clear that he's
          telling the truth.
          
                               TAREK
                    Shit!
          
                              ZAINAB (O.S.)
                        (In French)
                    I told you not to trust anyone. You
                    never saw a contract.
          
                               TAREK
                    Enough! OK. Look. We don't want any
                    trouble. We will get out of your
                    apartment. This is all a mistake.
                    I'm sorry.
          
                               WALTER
                    OK.
          
                              TAREK
                    We will leave, OK?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes. OK.
          
          Zainab emerges from the bedroom. She is dressed.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    Where are we going to go?
          
                              TAREK
                        (In French)
                    I don't know but we have to go.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (In French)
                    I know we have to go. I am not
                    stupid!
          
                      15
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Are you OK?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. I'm just going to sit down.
          
                              TAREK
                    Of course. Please.
          
          Walter nods and then slowly walks down the hallway and sits
          down. He is clearly shaken. Tarek shuts the front door.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry if I hurt you. Are you
                    sure that you're OK?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. I'm OK.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Well, we'll pack up and get
                    out.
          
          Tarek walks back toward the bedroom. Walter tries to catch
          his breath.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting on the couch with a glass of wine. Tarek
          enters and sets down a bag. He picks up TWO AFRICAN DRUMS
          next to the piano and places them by the front door.
          
          Zainab enters from the bedroom mumbling something in an
          African dialect. She drops a bag and crosses back to the
          bedroom.
          
                              TAREK
                    I know I'm in trouble when she
                    starts speaking Wolof.
          
                              WALTER
                    How long have you lived here?
          
                              TAREK
                    Two months. We will pay you if you
                    want.
          
          Walter doesn't respond. Zainab emerges from the bedroom again
          with the last bag.
          
                       16
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (To Zainab)
                    Is that everything?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I think so. Do you want to check!?
          
          He hands her a SMALL PLASTIC BAG from a local grocery.
          
                              TAREK
                    Here is the coffee you wanted.
          
          She snatches it without a word.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (To Walter)
                    OK. So we'll go. I am sorry again.
                    Thank you for your understanding.
                    Good bye.
          
                                WALTER
                    Good bye.
          
          They turn and exit. Walter gets up and walks over to the
          front door and locks it.
          
          He stands by the front door trying to process the events.
          Then something catches his attention.
          
          
          WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks to the window and picks up a handcrafted,
          decorative FRAME off of the sill. It is a PHOTOGRAPH of Tarek
          and Zainab. They are hugging each other and smiling. Walter
          looks down onto the street.
          
          He sees Zainab and Tarek exit the building and cross the
          street. Zainab's cart tips on the curb and the contents spill
          out onto the sidewalk. Tarek quickly moves to help her.
          Zainab yells at him.
          
          Walter watches as they finally collect their belongings and
          move down the street.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - LATER
          
          Tarek has set his bags down in front of a closed store. He is
          talking in a very agitated tone on his cell phone. Zainab
          stands by silently.
          
                    17
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                        (In Arabic)
                    Look I know. Come on man, it'll
                    just be for a night or two until we
                    figure something out. OK.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek?
          
                              TAREK
                        (In Arabic)
                    Can you check and call me back?
                    OK. Thanks.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek?
          
                              TAREK
                    What!?
          
          Zainab points. Walter is standing there holding the framed
          photograph.
          
                              WALTER
                    You left this at the apartment.
          
          Tarek walks over and takes it.
          
                              TAREK
                    Thanks.
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              WALTER
                    Do you know where you're going to
                    stay tonight?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah.
          
          The lie is obvious. They are stuck. Walter just nods again.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter takes some books out of his briefcase. He crosses to
          the bookshelf and sets them down. He notices a small stack of
          CD's sitting on a shelf. He picks one of them up and stares
          at the CD for a long moment.
          
                              TAREK
                    You like classical music, huh?
          
                     18
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          Walter sets down the CD.
          
                              TAREK
                    Me too. Do you play piano?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No.
                        (Beat)
                    Do you?
          
                              TAREK
                    Me? No. I play the djembe. Well,
                    thanks again for letting us stay.
                    You saved me a lot of trouble.
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    See you in the morning.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. Good night.
          
          Tarek goes to bed. Walter resumes his work.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter is lying in bed, unable to sleep. He can hear Tarek
          and Zainab whispering and laughing.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, TAREK AND ZAINAB'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Tarek and Zainab are lying in bed together.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Stop it, Tarek. He'll hear us.
          
                              TAREK
                    Trust me. He's asleep.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    You don't know that.
          
                              TAREK
                    So let him hear. The guy probably
                    needs some excitement.
          
                    19
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I think he's probably had enough
                    for one night.
          
          Tarek nuzzles her. Zainab laughs but pushes him away.
          
                                 ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    Tarek. No!
          
          Zainab sits up in the bed. Tarek relents and rolls onto his
          back.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    What are we going to do, Tarek?
          
                               TAREK
                    I don't know. We'll figure it out
                    tomorrow. Who knows? Maybe he'll
                    let us stay. He's not really using
                    the place.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't want to be his roommate!
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. OK. So we'll figure it out in
                    the morning. I promise, habibti.
          
          Zainab shakes her head.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Do you still love me?
          
          Zainab looks at him.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    No.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Really?
          
          Zainab rolls over and straddles Tarek.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. I don't love you.
          
          She kisses Tarek.
          
                              TAREK
                    Not even a little?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    No.
          
                    20
          
          
          
          She kisses him again.
          
                              TAREK
                    So what is this?
          
          She gets very close to his face.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    It's your punishment.
          
                              TAREK
                    But what about our roommate?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Shhh.
          
          She kisses him long and hard. They start to make love.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
          
          Jacob walks outside with Sprinkles.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Walter is tying his tie in the mirror.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - LATER
          
          Walter walks out of his bedroom and runs into Zainab who is
          leaving her bedroom at the same time. It's obvious that she
          was trying to avoid Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good morning.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Morning.
          
                              WALTER
                    I made some coffee.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Thank you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Have a good day.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Goodbye.
          
                       21
          
          
          
          Walter leaves.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY - DAY
          
          The Kimmel Center towers over Washington Square Park.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY - DAY
          
          Walter is listening to the speaker.
          
                              SPEAKER
                    That will be on the last day of
                    conference. I hope you can all
                    attend. And now I'd like to welcome
                    my distinguished colleague and
                    the winner of John Bates Clark
                    Award, Stephen Kriegman.
          
          STEPHEN KRIEGMAN strides to the podium. He is a good deal
          younger then Walter.
          
                              STEPHEN KRIEGMAN
                    Thank you, Shiva. Good morning.
                    It's a pleasure to be here.
          
          
          INT. NYU BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
          
          Walter mingles at a reception. He is listening to another
          COLLEAGUE tell a story.
          
                              COLLEAGUE #1
                    And so I just stood up and walked
                    out!
          
          The group laughs. Stephen Kriegman approaches and talks to
          the COLLEAGUE.
          
                              STEPHEN KRIEGMAN
                    Jamie!
          
                              JAMIE
                    Stephen, how are you?
          
          Walter walks off.
          
          
          INT. NYU BANQUET HALL - LATER
          
          Walter eats dinner in a large, well appointed banquet room.
          Walter listens as a CHATTY MAN talks.
          
                    22
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER
          
          Walter is walking up the stairs carrying a briefcase. He
          passes a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who is walking down the stairs with
          a SMALL DOG on a leash.
          
                                 MIDDLE-AGED MAN (O.S.)
                    Excuse me.
          
          Walter stops and turns.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MIDDLE-AGED MAN
                    Are you Mr. Vale?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MIDDLE-AGED MAN
                    I thought so. How are you? It's me,
                    Jacob Konigsberg. Do you remember
                    me?
          
          Walter doesn't.
          
                              JACOB
                    I used to live here with my mother.
                    Your wife used to give me piano
                    lessons.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh. Right.
          
                              JACOB
                    It has been a long time. I thought
                    that maybe you sold the place. Oh.
                    This is Sprinkles.
                        (To the dog)
                    Say "hi", Sprinkles. Is your wife
                    here with you?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. She passed away.
          
                              JACOB
                    What?! No! I had no idea. I'm so
                    sorry. She was such a nice lady.
                    And I just loved listening to her
                    play.
          
                     23
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    How's your mother?
          
                              JACOB
                    She moved to Florida. Now I live
                    here. It's nice. There are a lot of
                    new faces. I hardly know anyone
                    anymore. But I have Sprinkles so...
          
                              WALTER
                    Nice to see you, Jacob.
          
                              JACOB
                    You too, Mr. Vale. Goodbye. Welcome
                    back.
          
          Walter nods and keeps walking.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter walks into the apartment. No one else is there.
          
          He sets down his case and walks toward his bedroom but stops
          at Tarek and Zainab's door, which is closed. He listens.
          Nothing.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter is reading over and "rehearsing" the paper that he has
          to present.
          
                              WALTER
                        (Sotto)
                    It is important to distinguish
                    between both our current political

                    important to distinguish between
                    our current political assessment...
          
          He stops and crosses out the world "both". He continues
          reading.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is practicing the piano. He continues to struggle. He
          sits back and takes a break. He notices the drum next to the
          piano. He looks at it for long moment and then continues
          playing.
          
                       24
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is lying in bed awake. He listens as Tarek and Zainab
          come home.
          
          
          EXT. NEWSSTAND - MORNING
          
          Walter buys a newspaper.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is back at the conference. He is listening to a
          presentation by a GERMAN ECONOMIST.
          
                              GERMAN ECONOMIST
                    However, we do find that financial
                    globalization can be beneficial
                    under the right circumstances.
                    Empirically, good institutions and
                    quality of governance are crucial
                    in helping developing countries
                    derive the benefits of
                    globalization.
          
          Walter checks his watch. He is obviously bored.
          
          
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting in the park and eating some Indian food
          from a local cart vendor. He finishes and drops it into the
          garbage can. He checks his watch and starts to head back
          toward the conference when a SOUND catches his attention.
          
          
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - LATER
          
          Walter watches two young AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN drumming on
          BUCKETS with reckless abandon.
          
                              MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                    We should have them come play
                    inside.
          
          Walter turns. THREE COLLEAGUES from the conference are
          standing next to him.
          
                                 COLLEAGUE #1

                    Yes. In a minute.
                        (Holding up his cell
                         phone)
                    I have to make a call.
          
                              COLLEAGUE #1
                    See you inside.
          
          Walter nods as the guys walk off. Walter watches them go. He
          turns and watches the drumming again.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter arrives on the top floor. He can hear the drum being
          played. He stops in front of his apartment. He listens for a
          moment and then slowly opens the door.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tarek is playing his drum in his T-shirt and underwear. He
          sees Walter and finishes with a flourish.
          
                              TAREK
                    Hey Walter. Welcome home.
          
                              WALTER
                    Hi.
          
          Tarek casually gets up and puts on his pants.
          
                              TAREK
                    You're home early.
          
                              WALTER
                    It was a half day.
          
                              TAREK
                    How was the conference?
          
                              WALTER
                    Fine.
          
          Tarek buttons his pants.
          
                              TAREK
                    Sorry about the pants. I've been
                    playing like this since I was a
                    kid.
          
          Walter nods.
          
                      26
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Hey. I think I might have a lead on
                    a place in Brooklyn.
          
                              WALTER
                    That's good.
                    You can keep practicing if you
                    like.
          
                              TAREK
                    Really? It won't bother you?
          
                               WALTER
                    No.   It's fine.
          
                              TAREK
                    Great. Thanks. I'll keep my pants
                    on.
          
          Tarek laughs. Walter smiles.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Zainab's going to make dinner
                    if you want to eat with us later.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. Thank you.
          
          Walter walks into his bedroom. Tarek watches him go and then
          starts playing again.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is lying down on his bed reading through his paper.
          His foot is tapping to the rhythm of the drum.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter and Zainab are sitting at the dinner table finishing
          their meal. Tarek is on the phone in the living room speaking
          in Arabic. He hangs up and rejoins the table.
          
                              TAREK
                    I'm sorry. That was my mother. If I
                    don't call her every day she thinks
                    something happened to me.
          
          
          Walter pours himself some wine. He offers some to Tarek.
          
                     27
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah. I'll have a bit. Thanks.
          
          Zainab shoots Tarek a glance. Walter misreads it.
          
                              WALTER
                    Are you sure that you wouldn't like
                    some?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't drink.
          
                               TAREK
                         (Jokingly)
                    She is a good Muslim. I'm a bad
                    one.
          
          Walter nods. Zainab gets up and starts to clear the table.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Are you finished?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Thank you. Here, let me...
          
                              ZAINAB
                    It's the least I can do.
          
          Her comment is more of an indictment than a pleasantry.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, thank you for the dinner. It
                    was very good.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    You're welcome.
          
          She leaves the room.
          
                              TAREK
                    So what's the conference about?
          
                              WALTER
                    Economic Growth in Developing
                    Nations.
          
                               TAREK
                    That's us.
                        (Pointing)
                    Syria. Senegal.
          
                     28
          
          
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    So have you written some books?
          
                              WALTER
                    Three. I'm working on my fourth.
          
                              TAREK
                    Four books?! Great. My father was
                    a writer. A journalist.
          
                              WALTER
                    Is he still writing?
          
                              TAREK
                    No. He died. Before we left Syria.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
                                 TAREK
                    So am I.
          
          Zainab enters.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek. It's eight-thirty.
          
                              TAREK
                    Oh. We have to go.
                        (To Walter)
                    I have a gig tonight.
          
          
          Zainab starts to put on her coat.   Tarek picks up his drum.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Walter, you can come if you want.
          
          Zainab shoots Tarek a glance.
          
                               WALTER
                    I have to get some work done but
                    thank you.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Well maybe another time
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Bye.
          
                      29
          
          
          
          Tarek and Zainab leave. Walter watches them go and then looks
          around the empty apartment.
          
          
          INT.    WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRS - CONTINUOUS
          
          Tarek and Zainab are walking down the stairs.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                           (In French)
                       Why did you invite him?
          
                                 TAREK
                           (In French)
                       We're staying in his apartment.
                       What could I do?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                           (In French)
                       Well I would have been the one
                       stuck sitting with him while you
                       played your drum.
          
          Tarek turns and looks at her very seriously.
          
                                 TAREK
                       You know you are very sexy when
                       you're mad at me.
          
          Zainab can't help but smile. Tarek starts to wrap his arms
          around her.
          
                                 WALTER (O.S.)
                       Hello.
          
          Tarek and Zainab stop in their tracks, already three flights
          down. They both look up the stairwell. Walter is looking down
          on them.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                       If you don't mind, I think I will
                       come.
          
          Tarek and Zainab share a quick look.
          
                                 TAREK
                       Cool.
          
          Walter disappears back into the apartment. Zainab looks at
          Tarek. He shrugs.
          
                    30
          
          
          
          
          INT. SMALL RESTAURANT - LATER.
          
          Tarek's Jazz Trio is playing. Walter and Zainab sit at a
          small table in the back. Walter is rapt. Zainab is sketching.
          She looks up from her pad and watches him before returning to
          her drawing.
          
          
          EXT. SMALL RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Walter and Zainab are standing outside on the empty street.
          There's an awkward silence.
          
                              WALTER
                    He's very good.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    The whole band is very good.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes.
          
          And then nothing. Finally Tarek emerges.
          
                              TAREK
                    Sorry guys. Let's go.
          
          They walk down the street.
          
          
          EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - DAY
          
          Walter is sitting in the park and eating PIZZA. This time he
          is sitting directly across from the two African American
          drummers.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks into the apartment and sets down his briefcase.
          He notices Tarek's drum sitting in the middle of the room.
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek?
          
          No one answers. Walter walks down the hallway a bit.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Tarek?
          
                       31
          
          
          
          Walter walks back into the living room and takes off his
          coat. He removes some papers from his briefcase and then he
          notices the drum again.
          
          He sits down in the chair next to Tarek's drum. He takes the
          drum between his legs and he hits it a few times.
          
          Then he starts to play. He stops and then he plays again.
          This time he is slightly more successful at finding a rhythm.
          He closes his eyes and bobs his head. He's really getting
          into it.
          
          He opens his eye's open and Tarek is standing in front of
          him. He has headphones around his neck. Walter jumps.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Oh. Hi.
          
                              TAREK
                    It sounded good Walter.
          
          Walter immediately stands.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. Well. I was just...I'm sorry
                    if I...
          
          Tarek walks over and grabs another chair from the kitchen
          table.
          
                               TAREK
                    Don't be sorry. That's what it's
                    there for.
          
          Tarek sets the chair down and grabs the other drum from
          beside the piano.
          
                               TAREK (CONT'D)
                    I was lying on my bed listening to
                    my music and then I was like
                    "what's the crazy rhythm I'm
                    hearing?".
          
          Tarek sits down with the other drum facing Walter.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Sit. Come on. I'll show you.
          
          Walter hesitates and then sits down.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Just put your feet flat on the
                    ground.
          
                   32
          
          
          
          Walter adjusts his feet.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Now take the drum between your
                    legs. Like this.
          
          Tarek grabs the drums with his knees. Walter follows.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Now you want to lift the inside
                    edge off the ground with your
                    ankles. Like this.
          
          Walter watches Tarek and follows suit.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Great. Feel OK?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Now Walter, I know you're a
                    very smart man but with the drum
                    you have to remember not to think.
                    Thinking just screws it up. OK?
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
                              TAREK
                    Now just give it a couple of bangs.
          
          Walter gives it a couple of hard bangs.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Not so hard. You're not angry at
                    it.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh. Right.     Sorry.
          
          He bangs it a few more times.
          
                              TAREK
                    Better. Did you think?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No.
          
                    33
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Good. Now one more thing, Walter.
                    You listen to classical music so
                    you think in fours. One. Two.
                    Three. Four. Da. Da. Da. Da. This
                    is an African drum. So we are gonna
                    play in three's. Tat. Tat. Tat. You
                    have to forget your classical.
                    Leave it behind. Tat. Tat. Tat.
                    One. Two. Three. Come on. Follow
                    me.
          
          Tarek bangs out a simple bass beat. Walter joins in.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Good. Good ear. Now keep going.
          
          Walter loses the beat.   Tarek keeps playing.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Don't worry. Start again.
          
          Walter tries again. And again. And then finally he gets it.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah! There it is. OK. Good. Now
                    keep it going and I will do this.
          
          Tarek riffs off of Walter's bass beat.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah. That's it. Keep it going.
          
          
          EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY
          
          Zainab is closing up her booth. Another VENDOR walks by and
          says good bye. Zainab smiles and nods good bye.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK - STREET
          
          Zainab is walking home with her supplies. Two NEW YORK POLICE
          OFFICERS are talking to THREE YOUNG HISPANIC KIDS. Zainab
          hesitates for the slightest moment before lowering her head
          and walking past.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Zainab enters the apartment and sees Walter drumming. His
          shirt is unbuttoned exposing his white undershirt. He stops.
          He is breathing very hard and sweating.
          
                     34
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Hello. Where is Tarek?
          
          She places her items down on the kitchen table and takes off
          her coat. She looks around the apartment.
          
                               WALTER
                    He went out. To look at another
                    apartment.
          
          She just looks at him with the drum. Walter is still out of
          breath.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Are you OK?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. Tarek is teaching me the
                    drum. I'm practicing. Don't worry,
                    I'll keep my pants on.
          
          Zainab looks shocked. Walter's attempt at levity has fallen
          short.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    What?
          
                              WALTER
                    Nothing. I was just...nothing.
          
          Zainab nods and walks into the kitchen.
          
          
          INT. JAZZ CLUB - LATER
          
          Tarek is playing with his band. Walter is at the bar
          watching. He is unconsciously tapping along on the bar.
          
          
          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - SAME
          
          Tarek, Walter, and Darren - the saxophone player - sit at a
          table by the window, eating.
          
                              TAREK
                    Hey Walter, what time are you done
                    tomorrow?
          
                 35
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I have to present a paper at
                    eleven. I should be done by twelve-
                    thirty.
          
                               TAREK
                    Cool.
          
                              DARREN
                        (To the waiter)
                    Hey man, could we get another order
                    of this?
                        (To Walter and Tarek)
                    I love this food.
          
                              TAREK
                    That's good. Because the Chinese
                    are taking over the world.
          
                              DARREN
                    That's not gonna happen.
          
                              TAREK
                    It's already happening. One day our
                    kids will be going to China for
                    jobs. Ask Walter.
          
          Darren and Tarek look at Walter.
          
                              DARREN
                    You think that's true?
          
          Walter is put on the spot.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well...if China continues to
                    threaten the wage earners in the
                    first-world economies by keeping
                    wages down, then it's really just a
                    matter of time. What they buy they
                    inflate. What they sell they
                    deflate. But then you have to ask
                    the question `who's paying the
                    cost?'. And the answer is the
                    Chinese people.
          
          Beat.
          
                               TAREK
                    You see?
          
          Tarek continues eating.
          
                     36
          
          
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is presenting his paper.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - LATER
          
          Walter is walks out of the building talking to a FEMALE
          COLLEAGUE.
          
                              TAREK (O.S.)
                    Hey, Walter!
          
          Walter and the Female Colleague turn. Tarek is standing a few
          feet away holding both drums.
          
          Walter nods and says good bye to the Colleague who looks a
          bit confused. Walter walks over to Tarek.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    How did the presentation go?
          
                              WALTER
                    Fine. Thanks.
          
                              TAREK
                    Cool. Guess what? I found an
                    apartment in Brooklyn. We can move
                    in on Monday.
          
                              WALTER
                    That's good.
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. It's small but it's a nice
                    building. I just hope Zainab likes
                    it.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think she will as long as no else
                    lives there.
          
          Tarek laughs.
          
                              TAREK
                    I think you're right. Come on,
                    let's go. You should take off the
                    name tag.
          
                              WALTER
                    Oh. Yeah. Thanks.
          
                    37
          
          
          
          Walter takes off his name tag and they start to walk.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Are you hungry?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. I'm starving. Do you like
                    shwarmas?
          
                              WALTER
                    Uh...yeah. I like sharmas.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Shwarmas.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yeah.
          
          They walk across the park.
          
          
          INT. FALAFEL STAND - LATER
          
          Walter and Tarek are finishing lunch. Tarek reaches into his
          bag and takes out a SMALL BAG.
          
                              TAREK
                    Here. This is for you. For letting
                    us stay.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Thank you.
          
          Walter takes it and opens it. It's a CD.
          
                              TAREK
                    It's Fela Kuti. You know him?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No.
          
                              TAREK
                    You don't know Fela? Oh, man!
                    Walter, you are in for a treat. He
                    started the whole Afro-Beat
                    movement. And his drummer Tony
                    Allen was just scary, man. You want
                    to play drums, you have to listen
                    to this.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. I will.
          
                     38
          
          
          
          A HANDSOME ARAB MAN walks past with a PRETTY BLONDE WOMAN.
          Tarek sees him and waves.
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       Hey Tarek. How's it going?
          
                                 TAREK
                           (in Arabic)
                       Good, Omar. How are you?
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       Not bad. It's fall in New York, you
                       know? How's the band?
          
                                 TAREK
                           (In Arabic)
                       Good. Playing a lot. New
                       girlfriend?
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       New friend.
          
                                 TAREK
                           (In Arabic)
                       You have a lot friends
          
                                 OMAR
                           (In Arabic)
                       I'm a very nice guy. Au revoir.
          
                                    TAREK
                       Au revoir.
          
          Omar walks off. Tarek shakes his head.
          
                                  TAREK (CONT'D)
                       The Lebanese. Bunch of playboys.
                       You ready?
          
                                    WALTER
                       Yeah.
          
          They pick up their drums and leave.
          
          
          EXT.    NEW YORK STREET FAIR - LATER
          
          Zainab is talking to two UPPER EAST SIDE WOMEN who have
          stopped at her stall.
          
                    39
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. I made it.
          
                                 UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    How much?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Thirty-five dollars.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    Will you take thirty?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. thiry-five.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    OK. I know my daughter will think
                    it's "cool". Here.
          
          She hands her the money. Zainab takes it and drops it into a
          small pouch.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    Where are you from?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Senegal.
          
                              UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    Oh. I was in Cape Town two winters
                    ago. It was just beautiful.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (Handing her the bag)
                    Thank you very much.
          
                                 UPPER EAST SIDE WOMAN
                    Thank you.
          
          The Woman walks away. A young Israeli man, ZEV is sitting at
          a nearby stall selling T-shirts.
          
                              ZEV
                    How far is Senegal from Cape Town?
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Far.
          
                              ZEV
                    I told a guy I was from Israel
                    yesterday and he asked if I had
                    ever visited the Holy Land.
          
                     40
          
          
          
          Zainab smiles. Zev sees someone over Zainab's shoulder.
          
                              ZEV (CONT'D)
                    Hey, look who it is. What's up
                    Tarek?
          
          Tarek and Walter are approaching.
          
                               TAREK
                    Zev!   How are you?
          
                                 ZEV
                    Good man.
          
                                 TAREK
                    Hey honey.
          
          He kisses Zainab.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Hello. Hi, Walter.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Hi.
          
                              TAREK
                    How's business?
          
                              ZEV
                    Ahh. You know.
          
          Walter looks at the Zainab's jewelry.
          
                              TAREK
                    Her stuff is great, right? She made
                    me this?
          
          Tarek holds up his wrist, revealing a bracelet.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    You should make one for Walter.
          
          Zainab nods noncommittally.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    So Walter and I are going up to the
                    park to play for a little bit. OK?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek, I told you we have to pick
                    up my new table today. He said he
                    would only hold it for today.
          
                    41
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    I know. I know. No problem.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek. You always say "no problem"
                    and then you are late or you
                    forget.
          
          Tarek smiles.
          
                              TAREK
                    I know. I will not be long. We'll
                    go up and play and then we'll come
                    back to help you. I promise,
                    habibti.
          
          He kisses her and starts to walk away.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. It's always "habibti" when you
                    want your way. It closes at five
                    p.m. Not Arab time, Tarek.
          
                              TAREK
                    No. Not Arab time. Real time,
                    habibti.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Don't "habibti" me.
          
          They turn and start to leave.
          
                              WALTER
                    What does habibti mean?
          
                              TAREK
                    Habibti? It means "beloved one".
          
                              WALTER
                    Does she know that?
          
          Tarek laughs.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY - LATER
          
          Tarek and Walter are waiting for the subway. A CHINESE
          MUSICIAN is playing on the opposite platform.
          
                              TAREK
                    He's been playing here for a long
                    time.
          
                      42
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Is he good?
          
                              TAREK
                    I have no idea but it's cool.
                    I always wanted to play down here.
                    It's supposed to be good money.
          
                              WALTER
                    So why haven't you?
          
          Tarek shrugs.
          
                              TAREK
                    Maybe some day we can do it
                    together. Split the profits.
          
          Walter watches the Chinese Musician.
          
          
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER.
          
          Walter and Tarek stand in front of the DRUM CIRCLE    in
          Central Park.
          
                              TAREK
                    What do you think?
          
          Walter sizes it up and makes his assessment.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think I'll just watch.
          
                              TAREK
                    Come on, Walter.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    It's easy. You just wait until you
                    feel it. Let's go.
          
          Tarek joins the drum circle. Walter lingers.
          
          
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER.
          
          Walter is on the edge of the Drum Circle, waiting to "feel
          it". Tarek is next to him playing away.
          
          Tarek looks at Walter and nods. Finally Walter starts to
          play. Slowly at first, but then he starts to really commit.
          Tarek encourages him with a smile.
          
                       43
          
          
          
          
          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER
          
          Tarek and Walter are leaving the park. Tarek checks his
          watch.
          
                                 TAREK
                       Shit, we have to get home. Zainab
                       is gonna kill me. I'm on Arab time
                       again.
          
                                 WALTER
                       What is Arab time?
          
                                 TAREK
                       It means I'm late by an hour. All
                       Arabs are late by an hour. It's
                       genetic. We can't help it.
          
          
          EXT.    72ND STREET SUBWAY STATION - LATER
          
          Tarek and Walter hurry down the stairs of the subway station.
          
          
          INT. 72ND STREET SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter and Tarek approach the turnstile.     They can hear the
          train arriving.
          
                                 TAREK
                       That's our train!
          
          They pick up the pace. Walter puts down his drum to take out
          his METROCARD. Tarek quickly picks it up.
          
                                 TAREK (CONT'D)
                       I got your drum. My card is empty.
                       Can you swipe me?
          
          Walter swipes his card for Tarek to pass through and then he
          swipes his own turnstile.
          
          Walter passes through. Tarek struggles a bit with both
          drums. He gets halfway through when the turnstile bar locks.
          He's stuck.
          
                                 TAREK (CONT'D)
                           (Laughing)
                       Hey. You paid for the drum and not
                       me. Here take this.
          
                    44
          
          
          
          Walter takes Tarek's drum and Tarek quickly ducks under the
          turn style that Walter just paid for.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (Re: the train)
                    I think we missed it. Zainab is not
                    going to be happy if...
          
          Suddenly a MAN takes Tarek by the arm.
          
                              MAN
                    Excuse me, sir. Could you please
                    step over here.
          
          Tarek reacts by pulling his arm away.
          
                              TAREK
                    What are you doing?
          
                              MAN
                    NYPD. Could you please step over
                    here?
          
          He reaches for Tarek again who instinctively moves his arm
          again which agitates the Cop. Another COP enters into the
          action.
          
                              COP #2
                    Just step over here, pal.
          
                              TAREK
                    Please, what do you want...
          
                              COP #1
                    You jumped the turnstile.
          
                              TAREK
                    I did not jump it! I paid. I paid!
                    It just didn't work.
          
          Walter steps up.
          
                              WALTER
                    Sir, I did pay his fare.
          
                              COP #2
                    Could you step back please?
          
                              WALTER
                    But I paid this man's...
          
                              COP #2
                    Sir, stand over there.
          
                    45
          
          
          
                              COP #1
                        (To Tarek)
                    Can I see some ID.
          
          Tarek takes out his wallet. He shows them an ID CARD. Walter
          steps back to the wall and sets the two drums down. Cop #2
          stands between him and the action. Walter can barely make out
          what is being said.
          
                              COP #1 (CONT'D)
                    You got anything else, Tarek.
          
                              TAREK
                    No.
          
                              COP #1
                    Where are you from?
          
                              TAREK
                    Syria. Why?
          
          Tarek is starting to panic. The two Cops share a look.
          Another train passes. Cop #1 asks Tarek a few more questions
          which Walter cannot hear.
          
          Suddenly Cop #1 starts to handcuff Tarek.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Why? I'm sorry. What did I do?
          
          Walter steps forward to intervene.
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't think that's necessary.
          
                              COP #2
                    Well we do. You can come down to
                    the station and make a statement.
          
                              WALTER
                    But he didn't mean...
          
                              COP #2
                    Sir, that's all I'm saying. Now
                    step back or we are gonna take you
                    in too.
          
                              WALTER
                    Where are you taking him?
          
                              COP #2
                    Ninth Precinct.
          
                      46
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter take the drum. Tell Zainab
                    what happened but don't let her
                    come for me. I will call you.
          
          The two Cops lead Tarek away. Walter watches helplessly.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Don't let her come! I will call
                    her!
          
          Walter watches him go.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Walter enters and shuts the door and Zainab is sitting on the
          couch working on her jewelry.
          
          She stops when she sees Walter standing alone, holding the
          two drums.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Where is Tarek?
          
                              WALTER
                    He was arrested.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    What?!
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. In the subway.
          
          Zainab immediately starts to panic.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Arrested?!
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. It was just a
                    misunderstanding. They said he
                    would be released later tonight.
          
          
          
          
          Zainab really starts to lose it. Her reaction is more than
          Walter was prepared for.
          
                    47
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    How could this happen? He knows
                    better! He would not do anything
                    wrong.
          
                              WALTER
                    He didn't. I'm sure we it will be
                    OK.
          
          She begins to pack up her work.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. It won't be OK.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes it will. I went down to the
                    precinct and made a statement.
          
                              ZAINAB
                        (Snapping at Walter)
                    That doesn't matter! He is
                    illegal! As am I! We are not
                    citizens. Do you know what that
                    means? Do you?! Of course you
                    don't. How could you?
          
          She picks up her things and walks down the hall to her room.
          Walter sits, stunned.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is talking on his cell phone and pacing.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. His name is Tarek Khalil.
                    Khalil. K. H. A. L. I. L. That's
                    right. Yes. I came down and made a
                    statement. They said he would be
                    released. That was six hours ago.
                    Well when should we know? Tomorrow?
                    Why? But he...OK. OK. Thank you.
          
          Walter hangs up.
          
          
          EXT. POLICE STATION - MORNING
          
          Walter walks out of the police station. He crosses the
          street. Zainab is standing there.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Well?
          
                     48
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    They've moved him.
          
                                ZAINAB
                    To where?
          
                              WALTER
                    To a detention center in Queens. He
                    was turned over to immigration.
                    They said we can see him during
                    visiting hours tomorrow night from
                    five to ten.
          
          Zainab shakes her head.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I can't visit him or I will end up
                    in that place too.
          
          Zainab fights to restrain her emotions. She turns and walks
          away. Walter watches her go.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Zainab's bedroom light is on.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, TAREK'S & ZAINAB'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Zainab is sitting on her bed and talking on her phone.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. We are going tomorrow. The
                    appointment is at eleven. I don't
                    know, he found him. What? No. I
                    don't want to. I just don't, Tarek.
                    Yes. I've already called him. I
                    know. I know. I just want you to be
                    here with me, Tarek.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK, DOWNTOWN - DAY
          
          A sea of skyscrapers near One Center Street.
          
          
          INT. DOWNTOWN OFFICE BUILDING, ELEVATOR BANK - DAY
          
          Zainab and Walter exit an elevator and walk down the hall.
          
                    49
          
          
          
          
          INT. LAW OFFICE - LATER
          
          Walter and Zainab talk to an, MR. SHAH, an INDIAN IMMIGRATION
          LAWYER who is jotting down notes. He is clinical, almost cold
          in his approach.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Zainab, you're also undocumented,
                    right?
          
                                ZAINAB
                    Yes.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    You know you can't visit Tarek at
                    the detention center, right?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. I know.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    How long have you known Tarek?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Almost a year.
          
                                MR. SHAH
                    Mr. Vale?
          
                                WALTER
                    A week.
          
                                MR. SHAH
                    A week?
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              MR. SHAH (CONT'D)
                    Does Tarek have any family living
                    here?
          
          Walter looks to Zainab.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    His mother lives in Michigan.
          
          This is news to Walter.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    She's also undocumented, correct?
          
          Zainab hesitates.
          
                 50
          
          
          
                              MR. SHAH (CONT'D)
                    It's OK. This is all confidential.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes, she is.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Does she know that Tarek is in
                    custody?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. Tarek told me not to tell her.
                    He doesn't want to worry her.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Has he ever been convicted of a
                    crime?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    No. He has had no trouble. He is a
                    good person.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Do you know if they ever applied
                    for asylum?
          
          Walter looks at Zainab. She is very uncomfortable.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Yes. When he first arrived from
                    Syria. But he didn't get it.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    When was that?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Seven years ago.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    And did they appeal it?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't know.
          
          Mr. Shah jots something down.
          
                              WALTER
                    Why wouldn't they appeal it?
          
                    51
          
          
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Fear of being deported. It used to
                    be that when your asylum case was
                    denied, they let you go until your
                    appeal. A lot of people didn't
                    bother with it. Getting denied once
                    was enough to spook them.
          
                              WALTER
                    So what happens if that's the case?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Then there may be a final order of
                    deportation on him which means he
                    won't even go before a judge this
                    time. He'll just be deported.
          
                               ZAINAB
                    They had to leave Syria! They had
                    no choice!
          
          This is also news to Walter.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Look, one step at a time. Let me
                    talk to him then we'll have a
                    better idea of his status and what
                    our options are.
          
                              WALTER
                    Is there anything I can do?
          
                                 MR. SHAH
                    Visit him.
          
          The lawyer slides a card across the table. Walter takes it.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY CAR - DAY
          
          Walter rides the subway. He looks down at the lawyer's card.
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS - LATER
          
          Walter emerges from the subway into a very industrial
          neighborhood. Factories and fences. He checks his piece of
          paper and starts walking.
          
                    52
          
          
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS - LATER
          
          Walter is still walking. The area is very deserted. He stops
          and tries to locate a street address amongst the anonymous
          factories. He checks his sheet of paper and continues
          walking.
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter is standing in front of the DETENTION CENTER. It looks
          like most of the other factories around it but perhaps with a
          bit more barbed wire.
          
          He presses a button and the automated door slowly opens. He
          walks inside.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER
          
          Walter walks into a small brightly lit waiting room. A few
          SODA MACHINES and TWELVE BLUE PLASTIC CHAIRS. In one corner
          is a guard booth with THREE GUARDS. One FEMALE GUARD is
          wearing a Muslim headdress. Walter approaches the window and
          waits in line. The other people waiting comprise a mix of
          nationalities: African, Latin American, Chinese, Indian.
          
          The Guard talks to a MAN in front of Walter. The Man has a
          Slavic accent.
          
                              GUARD
                    That detainee has been moved.
          
                                SLAVIC MAN
                    To where?
          
                              GUARD
                    I don't know.
          
                              SLAVIC MAN
                    He was here yesterday.
          
                              GUARD
                    But now he's not. That's all I
                    know. You can call ICE. The number
                    is on the wall. Next. Sir, step
                    aside please.
          
          The Slavic Man reluctantly steps aside, staring at a piece of
          paper. Walter steps up to the window. He sets a piece of
          paper on the window sill.
          
                      53
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Hi. I'm here to see Tarek Khalil.
          
          The Guard takes it.
          
                              GUARD
                    You been here before?
          
                                WALTER
                    No.
          
                              GUARD
                    Can I see your license please?
          
          Walter takes out his wallet.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter is let through a large metal door. There is an X-RAY
          MACHINE immediately in front of him.
          
          Walter empties his pockets and steps through.
          
          Walter waits for the sliding metal door to open. It does and
          he steps into a small room. The door slides shut and he is
          alone in the small white room until a door on the other side
          slides open.
          
          He steps through and walks down a small hallway. On the left
          side of the hallway are small, glassed in, meeting rooms for
          lawyer consultations.
          
          Walter enters into a large bright room. It resembles a prison
          visitation room. Along the perimeter of the room is a clear
          fiberglass wall with twenty-five small cubicles. Each cubicle
          has one seat and a phone. On the other side of the fiberglass
          is another seat and a phone.
          
          Walter looks around the room at the VISITORS and DETAINEES.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is still waiting. After a moment a door opens and
          Tarek walks out wearing a blue jump suit. He sees Walter and
          smiles.
          
          They each move toward the other and settle into a vacant
          seat. They both pick up the phone as they sit down.
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter. Thank you for coming.
          
                    54
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    Of course.
          
                              TAREK
                    How is Zainab?
          
                              WALTER
                    She's upset. I have a letter from
                    her.
          
                              TAREK
                    You can't give it to me. It has to
                    be sent to me by mail. But you can
                    put it up to the glass.
          
          Walter hesitates.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Go ahead. Open it and place it up
                    to the glass so I can read it. It's
                    OK. It's allowed.
          
          Walter complies. He sets down the phone so that he can press
          the letter up against the glass. Tarek reads the letter.
          
          Walter looks around the room, trying to give Tarek some
          privacy. He watches the various immigrant families speaking
          to one another. Tarek taps the glass and points to Walter's
          phone. Walter picks it up.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Thank you, Walter.
          
          Walter nods as he folds up the envelope and places it back
          into his coat.
          
                              WALTER
                    How are they treating you?
          
                               TAREK
                    OK. The place is very depressing.
                    There is no privacy. The lights are
                    always on.
          
                              WALTER
                    Do you need anything?
          
                              TAREK
                    No. I just want to get out of here.
          
                              WALTER
                    Zainab and I met with a lawyer
                    today.
          
                    55
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    Yes. What did he say?
          
                              WALTER
                    He is going to stop by to see you
                    tomorrow.
          
          They both sit for a moment. Unsure what to say next. Finally
          Walter's curiosity gets the best of him.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Tarek, Zainab said you were denied
                    asylum.
          
                              TAREK
                    You mean when we came here? Yeah.
          
                              WALTER
                    Did you go to your deportation
                    hearing?
          
                               TAREK
                    Yeah.
          
                               WALTER
                    You did?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. We did everything they told
                    us to.
          
          Walter can only nod, unsure of what else to say.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Hey, could you tell Darren? I
                    didn't call him.
          
          A GUARD walks past and taps Tarek on the shoulder and speaks
          to him. We can't hear what is being said.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                        (To Walter)
                    I have to go. They have to do a bed
                    count. Usually, I can visit for one
                    hour. Can you come tomorrow?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    Good. And tell Zainab I will call
                    her as soon as I can.
          
                    56
          
          
          
          Walter nods. Tarek gets up.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye, my friend.
          
                               WALTER
                    Goodbye.
          
          Tarek walks away. Walter watches him go.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/ KITCHEN
          
          Walter and Zainab are sitting at the kitchen table. Zainab is
          holding her letter.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Did you ask him if he went to his
                    hearing?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. He said that he did.
          
          Zainab stands up.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Walter, I'm going to leave now. I
                    have a cousin in the Bronx. I will
                    stay with him for now.
          
                               WALTER
                    You don't have to leave. You can
                    stay here.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I think it's best if I leave. When
                    Tarek calls me then I will tell
                    him. You know how to reach me if
                    you need to. Is it OK if I leave
                    Tarek's things here for now? My
                    cousin's place is not very big.
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S BUILDING - LATER
          
          Zainab walks away from the apartment.
          
                       57
          
          
          
          
          INT. SMALL BAR - NIGHT
          
          Walter drinks at the bar and watches Tarek's band play
          without Tarek.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MORNING
          
          Walter practices the drum.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
          
          Jacob walks Sprinkles in front of the apartment building.
          Walter walks outside and waves hello as he walks past.
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITORS ROOM - LATER
          
          Darren and Tarek are talking. Walter sits and listens.
          
          
          INT. CAFE - NIGHT
          
          Walter eats alone.
          
          
          EXT. STREET CORNER - MORNING
          
          Walter buys the morning paper from a kiosk. He walks to the
          corner and waits to cross the street. A large group of
          CHINESE TOURISTS led by a TOUR GUIDE step up next to him. He
          is surrounded by them.
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITOR'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Tarek talks to Mr. Shah.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is playing the drum. He finishes with an "end beat".
          He looks around the quiet apartment.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - DAY
          
          Walter is waiting for Tarek. The visiting room is empty.
          Suddenly the door opens on the detainee side of the glass and
          a VERY YOUNG LATIN WOMAN walks out tentatively. She almost
          looks absurd in the oversized blue jumpsuit.
          
                    58
          
          
          
          She looks at Walter, unsure if she is supposed to approach
          the glass and talk to him. Walter just stares back, also
          unsure of what to do. They are caught in awkward moment.
          Finally Walter manages a nod. She nods back and smiles. It is
          the innocent smile of a child.
          
          Suddenly a female guard appears in the doorway and beckons
          the Young Girl back inside. The Young Girl looks at Walter
          one last moment before disappearing behind the door.
          
          
          INT. QUEEN'S DETENTION CENTER, VISITING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is talking to Tarek.
          
                              WALTER
                    But I thought you said you went to
                    the hearing.
          
                              TAREK
                    We did. I remember it.
          
                              WALTER
                    So why is there a final order on
                    you? Did he say?
          
                              TAREK
                    No. He didn't know yet. He just
                    said that unless he can find a way
                    to reopen the case quickly they're
                    going to deport me.
          
                              WALTER
                    Maybe you should call your mother.
                    She might have...
          
                              TAREK
                    No. I don't want her to worry. I
                    can handle this.
          
          Tarek shakes his head.
          
                              WALTER
                    Did he say anything else?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. Three years ago I was working
                    for some guy who said he was going
                    to sponsor me for my green card but
                    then he turned out to be jerk. But
                    the lawyer said that might allow us
                    to reopen the case. I don't even
                    understand it.
          
                 59
          
          
          
          Walter nods.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    Walter, there are guys who have
                    been in here for years! I can't do
                    that Walter. I'll go crazy.
          
                              WALTER
                    He's trying to deal with the case
                    as quickly as possible.
          
          Tarek goes silent.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Tarek. I have to go back to
                    Connecticut. I'll be reachable by
                    phone if you need me for anything.
          
          Tarek's mind is racing. He shakes his head.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. Just please...don't forget
                    about me in here.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I won't.
          
                              TAREK
                    Are you still practicing?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    You should go back to the drum
                    circle.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (Quickly)
                    No.
          
          Tarek laughs.
          
                              TAREK
                    OK. But listen to that Fela CD.
                    That will help you, I promise.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I will.
          
                              TAREK
                    So show me what you've been working
                    on.
          
                    60
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    What?
          
                              TAREK
                    Show me. On that. Come on. I need
                    some music, man.
          
          Tarek points to the shelf in front of Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Now?
          
                              TAREK
                    Don't worry. They can't arrest you.
                    At least not yet.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK.
          
          Walter looks around and then cradles the phone in his
          shoulder and starts to bang a simple beat on his counter top.
          Tarek watches and listens for a moment.
          
                              TAREK
                    Ah. There it is. Good. Good. You
                    are getting better.
          
          And then he joins in. The two men continue to play together.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Walter is packing his suitcase. Suddenly there is a knock at
          his door. He exits the room.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter opens the door. Standing there is a strikingly
          attractive forty-five year-old ARAB WOMAN. She seems startled
          to see Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello.
          
                               ARAB WOMAN
                    I'm sorry. I must have the wrong
                    apartment.
          
          She starts to walk down the hall.
          
                              WALTER
                    Can I help you?
          
                     61
          
          
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    I'm looking for my son.
          
                              WALTER
                    Are you Tarek's mother?
          
                                 ARAB WOMAN
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    Oh. This is Tarek's apartment.
                    I...share the apartment with him.
          
          The Arab Woman is cautious.
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    He did not mention that he lived
                    with someone.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm not here very often. I live in
                    Connecticut.
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    Is Tarek here?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. He's...uh...he's not here. But
                    please come in.
          
          Mouna hesitates.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Please.
          
                                 ARAB WOMAN
                    Thank you.
          
          Mouna walks into the apartment. She stands by the door.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm Walter. Walter Vale.
          
                              ARAB WOMAN
                    I'm Mouna Khalil. I'm sorry to
                    show up unannounced but my son
                    calls me everyday. He has not
                    called me now for five days. I have
                    tried his cell phone but he does
                    not answer.
          
                              WALTER
                    Would you like to sit down?
          
                 62
          
          
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Thank you.
          
          Mouna sits.
          
                              WALTER
                    Would you like something to drink?
                    Coffee or water?
          
                              MOUNA
                    No. Is my son alright, Mr. Vale?
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek was arrested. He's being held
                    in a detention center in Queens.
                    They are trying to deport him.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Where is Queens?
          
                              WALTER
                    It's not far from here. Twenty
                    minutes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You have been there?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. I saw him yesterday. He's OK.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How did this happen?
          
                              WALTER
                    He was stopped in the subway
                    station. He didn't do anything
                    wrong.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would like to go there. To
                    Queens.
          
                               WALTER
                    OK. But Mrs. Khalil. The lawyer
                    mentioned that...I don't think that
                    you can...
          
                              MOUNA
                    I know I can't visit Tarek, Mr.
                    Vale. I just want to see where they
                    are holding him.
          
                      63
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. I can take you if you'd like.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Thank you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Let me get my coat.
          
          Mouna nods. Walter leaves. Mouna breathes deeply in an
          attempt to control her emotions. She looks around the
          apartment and spots Tarek's drum. The sight of it is almost
          enough to push her over the edge.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY - LATER
          
          The Chinese Musician is playing on the platform. Mouna and
          Walter are watching him.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY CAR - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna are sitting side by side on the subway.
          
          
          EXT. SUBWAY STATION, QUEENS - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna exit the subway station and walk down the
          empty street.
          
                              WALTER
                    Have you been to New York before,
                    Mrs. Khalil?
          
                              MOUNA
                    No. Tarek wanted to come to New
                    York to play music. I did not want
                    him to go but...do you have
                    children, Mr. Vale?
          
                              WALTER
                    I have a son. He lives in London.
          
                              MOUNA
                    And your wife?
          
                              WALTER
                    My wife passed away.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    I'm sorry.
          
                       64
          
          
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS STREET - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna stop across the street from the detention
          Center.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That's it.
          
                              MOUNA
                    This is where the prison is?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. That's it.
          
          Walter points to the Detention Center.
          
                              MOUNA
                    It does not look like a prison.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think that's the point.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How many people are in there?
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek said about three hundred.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    There is a coffee shop on that
                    corner. It's not very nice but...
          
                              MOUNA
                    I'll wait there. Here.
          
          She takes a letter out of her bag and hands it to Walter.
          
                                 MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.
          
          Walter turns and walks into the facility. Mouna lingers,
          taking in the building.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITATION ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is waiting for Tarek. He is watching as a LATIN WOMAN
          holds her BABY up to the glass as her HUSBAND taps on it from
          the other side.
          
          Finally a door opens and Tarek walks out. He waves and
          smiles. Walter picks up his phone. Tarek picks up his.

                              TAREK
                    Walter, I thought you were leaving.
          
                               WALTER
                    I was.   Tarek, your mother is here.
          
          This stops Tarek cold.
          
                              TAREK
                    What? My mother?! Where?
          
                              WALTER
                    She is waiting outside.
          
                              TAREK
                    When did she arrive?
          
                               WALTER
                    Today.
          
                              TAREK
                    Oh man. Why did she come? She can
                    do nothing for me.
          
                              WALTER
                    She said she hadn't heard from you.
          
                              TAREK
                    Walter. Listen to me. She can not
                    stay here. She doesn't know anyone
                    in New York. I'm sorry but you must
                    get her to go back to Michigan.
          
                              WALTER
                    OK. OK. Here. I have a letter from
                    her.
          
          Walter takes it out and puts it up to the glass.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS, DINER - LATER
          
          It's a dingy place occupied by truck drivers and factory
          workers. Mouna sitting in a booth clutching a cup of tea. She
          looks very out of place.
          
          Two DETENTION CENTER GUARDS enter and sit down in a booth.
          Mouna watches them. An Arab Waiter is cleaning the counter.
          He keeps looking at Mouna.
          
                              WAITER
                    Do you need anything else?

                    Where are you from?
          
                              MOUNA
                        (In Arabic)
                    I am Palestinian from Damascus.
          
                              WAITER
                        (In Arabic)
                    Ah. I knew it. I am from Egypt.
                    Alexandria. I'm Nasim. Why are you
                    here?
          
                              MOUNA
                        (In Arabic)
                    I am visiting my son.
          
                              NASIM
                        (In Arabic)
                    He is in detention.

                           (In Arabic)
                    Yes.
          
          The Waiter shakes his head.
          
                              NASIM
                        (In Arabic)
                    It's a bad place. I'm lucky. I have
                    a green card.
          
          He nods to the Guards.
          
                              NASIM (CONT'D)
                        (In Arabic)
                    They're the ones taking care of
                    your son. They come here everyday.
                    They don't tip.
          
          Mouna is uncomfortable.
          
                              NASIM (CONT'D)
                        (In Arab)
                    Don't worry. They can't understand
                    us.
          
          Walter enters and walks over to Mouna's booth.
          
                   67
          
          
          
                              NASIM (CONT'D)
                    Hello, sir.
          
          Walter nods and sits down. He hands Mouna her letter.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    How is he?
          
                              WALTER
                    He's good but he's concerned about
                    you being here.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I will not leave.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mrs. Khalil, I'm not sure that your
                    being in New York will do any good.
                    We have a very good lawyer working
                    on Tarek's case...
          
                              MOUNA
                        (Politely but forceful)
                    Mr. Vale, I cannot go back to
                    Michigan knowing that my son is in
                    that building. Even if I can't see
                    him, I will stay.
          
          She stands up, ready to leave.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Shall we go?
          
          Walter stands. Mouna digs in her purse.
          
                              NASIM
                        (In Arabic)
                    The tea is on me.
          
                               MOUNA
                        (In Arabic)

                              NASIM
                        (In Arabic)
                    Is that your lawyer? Or your
                    husband?
          
                              MOUNA

          Walter follows Mouna out.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER.
          
          Walter and Mouna arrive back at Walter's apartment building.
          Jacob emerges from the front door with Sprinkles.
          
                              JACOB
                    Oh. Hello, Mr. Vale.

                    Hello, Jacob.
          
          He sees Mouna.

                    I let her in earlier.
                        (To Mouna)
                    I'm Jacob, by the way. I live on
                    the third floor. And this is
                    Sprinkles.

                    So you two know each other?
          
          There is an awkward pause.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. Mr. Vale knows my son.

                    Oh. Tarek. He is very nice. And so
                    is his girlfriend. They are both so
                    polite.

                    My mother and I are planning a trip

                    excuse me.
          
          Mouna nods and heads into the building.
          
                              JACOB
                    Oh sure. We need to go on our walk

                    You too, Jacob.
          
          Mouna continues up the stairs. Walter follows her.

                    Goodbye, Mr. Vale.

          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna enter the apartment. Mouna picks up her

                              MOUNA
                    Thank you, Mr. Vale.
          
          Walter turns.

                    Where are you going?
          
                              MOUNA
                    I will find a hotel.

                              WALTER
                    You can stay here. You can use
                    Tarek's room.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you for your offer but I
                    cannot accept this. I don't want to
                    impose on you.
          
                              WALTER
                    You're not imposing. Please. I
                    would like you to stay.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Again, thank you. But I will
                    manage. Goodbye.
          
          Walter finally steps aside and opens the door.
          
                               MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Goodbye.

          EXT. WALTER'S APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mouna walks down the stairs.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mrs. Khalil?
          
          She turns. Walter is standing at the top of the stairway.
          
                               WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Please. I was with Tarek when he
                    was arrested. He was in the subway
                    in the first place because of me.
                    Please. Stay. Even if it's just for
                    the night.
          
          Walter's plea is heartfelt. Mouna looks at him and then she
          looks down the stairs for a long moment, considering her
          options.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, TAREK'S ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter enters the room and sets down Mouna's suitcase. She
          follows him into the cramped bedroom.

                    No. Thank you. Good night.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good night.
          
          Walter leaves, shutting the door behind him. Mouna sits on
          the bed and looks around the room.
          
          
          EXT. DETENTION CENTER - NIGHT
          
          Desolate streets. The sound of an airplane taking off breaks
          the night quiet.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - MORNING
          
          Walter walks out of his bedroom. He hears talking from the
          living room. He walks down the hall and sees Mouna sitting on
          the couch in the living room, talking on her cell phone in
          Arabic. He turns and walks back down the hallway.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN
          
          Walter pours a cup of coffee. He notices two newspaper's on
          the counter. One is the Financial Times and the other is Al
          Hayat, an Arabic newspaper. He picks up the Financial Times
          and reads the front page. Mouna enters.

                    Tarek said hello.
          
                                 WALTER
                    How is he?
          
                              MOUNA
                    I can't really tell. He wants me to
                    leave. But I am not leaving.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, you can stay here as long as
                    you need to.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you. That is very generous of
                    you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Thank you for the newspaper.
          
          Mouna nods and pours some more coffee for herself.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Walter? Did Tarek and his
                    girlfriend, Zainab, live here
                    together?
          
                              WALTER
                    Uhm...Yes. They did.
          
                              MOUNA
                    And where is she now?
          
                               WALTER
                    She's staying with her cousin in
                    the Bronx.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would like to meet her.
          
                              WALTER
                    We can go by her stall.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Her what?
          
                              WALTER
                    Her stall. She sells jewelry in a

          Walter and Mouna are standing in silence.

                    Do you spend a lot of time in the

                              WALTER
                    No. Not really. I just came down to
                    present a paper at a conference.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You wrote it?

                    Yes. Well I coauthored it.

          Walter and Mouna are talking to the Mr. Shah.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    And what happened after the
                    hearing?
          
                              MOUNA
                    We appealed. It took two years.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    And your appeal was denied?
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Yes.
          
                 74
          
          
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Then they should have sent you a
                    bag-and-baggage letter which
                    basically tells you where to show
                    up and be deported.
          
          Mouna nods.
          
                              MR. SHAH (CONT'D)
                    But you didn't receive it?
          
                                MOUNA
                    No.
          
                                MR. SHAH
                    You sure?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. I would remember this.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Did you move?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. Eventually we had to. But we
                    had our mail advanced.
          
          Mr. Shah is satisfied.
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Well, it wouldn't be the first time
                    that happened. And pre 9/11 it
                    wasn't much of a priority tracking
                    people down.
          
          Mouna bristles at the implied connection.
          
                              WALTER
                    So if they didn't get the letter
                    then does this help us?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    It keeps our chances alive. If they
                    got it and just ignored it then we
                    couldn't push to reopen the case.
          
                              MOUNA
                    So you can help him?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    It's still a long shot. Like I
                    said, the Government's approach has
                    changed radically.

                    It's very black and white now.
                    Either you belong or you don't.
                    Which means a lot of people who
                    have been living here for years are
                    suddenly being swept up and thrown
                    into detention.
                        (He starts writing)
                    Tarek's lucky. Most of them don't
                    even have lawyers.
          
          Mouna blanches.

                    Lucky?

                        (Without looking up)
                    Relatively speaking. We just have
                    to move quickly to get an emergency
                    stay from the board of immigration.
                    Then, we'll stick with the motion
                    to reopen pending his green card
                    application.
          
          Mouna and Walter share a look. They're lost.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Can you explain what that means?
          
                              MR. SHAH
                    Actually, I don't have the time
                    right now. I have to be in court
                    very shortly

                        (Without looking up)
                    I can't predict that. I'm sorry but
                    I am gonna have to wrap this up.
          
          Walter looks at Mouna. Mouna stares at the Mr. Shah.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Do you have children, Mr. Shah?

                    Yeah. Two kids. And for what it's
                    worth my uncle was deported after
                    raising a family here for twenty-
                    three years. If I can get Tarek

                    I'm living with my cousin. He has
                    two kids. And his mother. I mean
                    his wife...I'm sorry, I am very
                    nervous.

                                 MOUNA
                    Why?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't know. Have you spoken with
                    Tarek?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes. He called me this morning. He
                    is doing all right.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I wish that I could see him. Just
                    for a minute.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Me too. How long have you been
                    here?
          
                               ZAINAB
                    Two years. I was in detention when
                    I first arrived. Three months. It
                    was horrible. I would probably
                    still be there but they closed the
                    facility for poor conditions. They
                    released some of the women on
                    parole because we were...low risk.
                    I met Tarek one year later.
                        (Beat)
                    I am sorry for what happened with
                    Tarek. I hope you do not blame me.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Blame you?     No. I do not blame you.
          
          Zainab starts to break.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Tarek was doing nothing wrong. I
                    miss him so much. I don't know what
                    I am going to do without him.
          
                              MOUNA
                    He said the same thing about you.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    He did?
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Yes.
          
          Zainab smiles.

                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Zainab, I would like you to do
                    something for me.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    What?
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would like you to show me
                    something that you and Tarek liked
                    to do. Some place that you like to
                    go.
          
                                 ZAINAB
                    Like what?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Anything. Whatever you want.
          
                             ZAINAB
                    OK. But maybe we should get Walter
                    first.
          
          They both smile at the thought of Walter still at Zainab's
          table.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna walk down the street listening to Zainab who
          is wheeling her jewelry supplies behind her.
          
          
          EXT. STATEN ISLAND FERRY - LATER
          
          Walter, Mouna and Zainab are standing at the railing of the
          Ferry which is making its way across the harbor.
          
          The STATUE OF LIBERTY looms large; the ferry route providing
          a perfect vantage point.
          
                              MOUNA
                    So what is in Staten Island?
          
                              ZAINAB
                    I don't know. We never got off. We
                    just would go to the other side and
                    then come back.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Why?
          
                 80
          
          
          
                              ZAINAB
                    It's free. And it felt like we were
                    going somewhere.
          
          Mouna smiles.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    That is where the towers were. I
                    never saw them but Tarek did.
          
          Zainab crosses to the other railing and points.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    And over there is the Statue.    And
                    behind that is Ellis Island.
          
          Zainab smiles.
          
                              ZAINAB (CONT'D)
                    Sometimes Tarek would point at the
                    statue and jump up and down like we
                    were arriving to New York for the
                    first time. It was very funny.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Can you go up in the Statue?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. I think so.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You haven't been?
          
                              WALTER
                    No.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Oh.
          
          Walter's cell phone rings. He looks at it.
          
                               WALTER
                    Excuse me.
                        (Into the phone)
                    Hello? Oh. Hi Charles.
          
          He walks away from the Mouna and Zainab.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    What's that? Yes. I'm still in New
                    York actually. I stayed down here
                    to do some research. What's that?
                    Oh. I'm on a boat. Yes, a boat.
                              (MORE)
          
                     81
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Listen Charles, I'll explain when I
                    see you but I have to go right now.
                    I'll call you back. Goodbye.
          
          Walter hangs up the phone and rejoins Mouna and Zainab.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter is visiting with Tarek. Another detainee walks behind
          Tarek and taps him on the shoulder. Tarek nods hello and then
          keeps talking to Walter.
          
                              TAREK
                    You went on the ferry?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              TAREK
                    My mother too?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. She liked it.
          
                              TAREK
                    Did Zainab tell you how we used
                    pretend we arriving in New York for
                    the first time?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. She told us.
          
                              TAREK
                    You know they don't even let us
                    outside here. They just cut a hole
                    in the roof in one place.
          
                              WALTER
                    Really?
          
                              TAREK
                    Yeah. It's crazy stuff.
          
          Tarek looks around the room.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    And they seemed to get along?
                    Zainab and my mother?
          
                               WALTER
                    Yes. I think your mother likes her
                    very much.
          
                 82
          
          
          
          Tarek smiles. Then it fades.
          
                              TAREK
                    My mother's not going home, is she?
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't think so.
          
                              TAREK
                    I know she's thinking about my
                    father. He spent seven years in
                    jail in Syria for something he
                    wrote in the newspaper. By the time
                    they released him he was very sick.
                    He died two months later. That's
                    when we came here.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
                              TAREK
                    She thinks the same thing is gonna
                    happen to me.
          
          Tarek thinks for a long moment. He shakes his head.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    You know I have never seen them
                    together. Zainab and my mother.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET, NIGHT
          
          Walter and Mouna are walking home.
          
                              WALTER
                    Are you hungry, Mouna? We can stop
                    for dinner.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I would prefer to cook if you don't
                    mind?
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Should we stop at a market?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. That's probably a good idea.

          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - LATER
          
          Mouna is preparing dinner. Walter comes in and takes a bottle
          of wine out of the refrigerator.
          
                              WALTER
                    Would you like a glass of wine?
          
                              MOUNA
                    No thank you.
          
          Walter pours his glass.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna? I need to go back to
                    Connecticut tomorrow. For work. I
                    told Tarek.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How long will you be gone?
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know yet. I'll try to make
                    it back to visit Tarek as soon as I
                    can.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You don't have keep visiting him,
                    Walter. I'm sure you are busy.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'll see what I can do.
          
                              MOUNA
                    OK. Dinner will be ready soon.
          
          Walter walks out of the kitchen.

                    Do you go to Broadway, Walter?
          
                              WALTER
                    Broadway? Uhm. No. I haven't been

                    Tarek sent me the CD for "Phantom
                    of the Opera" for my birthday. The
                    music is lovely. Have you seen it?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. I haven't.

                    I haven't either but I think I know
                    every word.
          
          Walter smiles. Silence.
          
                              WALTER
                    Tarek is teaching me the drum.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Really? How is it going?
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, I sound a lot better when
                    he's playing with me.
          
          Mouna laughs.
          
                              MOUNA
                    How is your teaching going, Walter?
          
          Walter seems caught off guard by the question.
          
                              WALTER
                    My teaching?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well...I have a lighter schedule so
                    I can work on my book.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Your book? What is it about?
          
                              WALTER
                    Well, it covers quite a bit, so
                    it's hard to explain.
          
          Walter drinks his glass of wine.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Are you almost finished?
          
                    85
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm close.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You don't like to talk about your
                    work?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. It's just a bit complicated.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Why is that?
          
          Walter is agitated.
          
                              WALTER
                    It just is. It's just not a process
                    that's easy to talk about with
                    someone who's not a writer.
          
          Walter's cheap shot lands. Mouna is stung.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I didn't mean to pry.
          
          There is an awkward silence.
          
                              WALTER
                    I shouldn't have spoken to you like
                    that.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    It's OK.
          
          Walter picks up the wine bottle and fills his glass.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Walter is sitting on the edge of his bed and takes off his
          shoes. He pauses.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING
          
          An empty New York street. Mouna and Walter round the corner
          walking together. She is holding his briefcase. Walter is
          carrying the drum and his duffle bag.
          
          They arrive at the Parking Garage. Walter hands a ticket to
          the GARAGE ATTENDANT. He takes his briefcase from Mouna.
          
                       86
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Thank you. You have my number if
                    you need anything.
          
                               MOUNA
                    I'll be fine. Thank you. Have a
                    safe trip.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well good bye.
          
                               MOUNA
                    Goodbye.
          
          Mouna turns and walks down the street. Walter's car arrives.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - LATER
          
          Walter pulls into his driveway. He gets out of the car. He
          opens the trunk and takes out his bag and then his drum.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CLASSROOM - LATER
          
          Walter walks into the lecture hall. He sets his briefcase
          down.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good afternoon.
          
          He takes out some papers and opens them.
          
          
          EXT. NEW LONDON - LATER
          
          Walter is stopped at a traffic light in town.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S CAR - SAME
          
          Walter sees Karen walking toward him. She is talking on her
          cell phone and does not notice him. Walter just watches her
          pass without saying a word.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Walter sits in his office working. He stops and listens to
          the silence.
          
                       87
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter pours himself a drink and wanders around the empty
          house.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter opens the front door and walks outside.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks onto the front lawn and looks around the sleepy
          neighborhood. He listens to the quiet. It's a stark contrast
          from New York.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter roots through his briefcase and pulls out the FELA
          KUTI CD. He slips the CD into the stereo. He presses play.
          FELA KUTI's, "DON'T GAG ME" blares over the speakers.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S HOUSE, PIANO ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is sitting in a chair and playing the drum along with
          the Fela song. He is only wearing a T-shirt and boxers.
          
          
          INT. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
          
          Charles talks to Walter. They stand up and shake hands.
          
          
          EXT. WALTER'S HOUSE - DAY
          
          Three MOVERS are carefully removing the piano from Walter's
          house as Walter and Barbara Watson look on.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S CAR - DAY
          
          Walter drives back down the highway. The Fela Kuti music is
          playing. He is tapping on the steering wheel.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S BUILDING, STAIRWELL - LATER
          
          Walter walks quickly up the stairs to the fourth floor. He
          seems to be moving with a little more pep.
          
                     88
          
          
          
          As he approaches his door, he hears music emanating from his
          apartment. It's a PIANO SONATA. The music stops him in his
          tracks. He listens for a couple of moments. Finally he walks
          inside.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter enters to find Mouna mopping the floor.   Fresh flowers
          are on the table. She sees Walter and smiles.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Walter.
          
          She turns down the music.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    I did not expect you so soon. I
                    was just cleaning a bit. I hope you
                    don't mind.
          
                              WALTER
                    No. Thank you.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I like this CD very much.   The
                    music is lovely.
          
          She picks up the CD.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Is it your wife?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    She was beautiful.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Thank you.
          
          Mouna sets down the CD. She notices Walter's glasses.
          
                              MOUNA
                    These are different glasses?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Are they new?
          
                    89
          
          
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    They're nice.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Thank you.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I was going to make some lunch. Are
                    you hungry?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Thank you.
          
          Walter leaves. Then he returns.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                    Mouna?
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Yes.
          
                              WALTER
                    I was wondering if...Thursday night
                    ... Do you have plans?
          
          Mouna laughs.
          
                              MOUNA
                    No, Walter, I have no plans.
          
                               WALTER
                    Well, I thought that...we might do
                    something.
          
          
                                 MOUNA
                    OK.
          
                                 WALTER
                    OK.
          
          Walter nods and walks toward his room. Mouna watches him go
          and smiles.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER, VISITATION ROOM - LATER
          
          Walter and Tarek are talking. Tarek is very anxious.
          
                    90
          
          
          
                              TAREK
                    They keep moving people.
          
                                 WALTER
                    To where?
          
                              TAREK
                    I don't know. I think to other
                    detention centers. Two Moroccan
                    guys were just moved. They had no
                    idea. Suddenly they were just gone.
          
                              WALTER
                    Has anyone said anything to you?
          
                              TAREK
                    No one in here knows anything. I'm
                    not a criminal. I have committed no
                    crime. What do they think? I'm a
                    terrorist? There are no terrorists
                    in here. The terrorists have money.
                    They have support. This is not
                    fair!
          
                                 WALTER
                    I know.
          
                              TAREK
                        (Angrily)
                    How do you know?! You're out there!
          
          Tarek's question stops Walter in his tracks. Tarek tries to
          regain his composure.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm sorry.
          
                              TAREK
                    It's just... I'm starting to wonder
                    if I'm ever going to get out of
                    here. I sit in here at night and I
                    keep thinking about Zainab.
          
                              TAREK (CONT'D)
                    I just want to play my music and
                    live my life. What's so wrong about
                    that?
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK CAFE - DAY
          
          Walter, Mouna and Zainab are sitting at a cafe. Walter is on
          his cell phone.
          
                     91

                        (Into the phone)
                    OK. OK. Please do. Thank you. Bye.
          
          He hangs up.
          
                              MOUNA
                    What did he say?
          
                              WALTER
                    He would make some calls but they
                    can move him to another facility at
                    their discretion.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    What facility? Where?
          
                              WALTER
                    He said it could be anywhere.
                    Upstate. Pennsylvania. There is
                    even one in Louisiana.
          
                              ZAINAB
                    Louisiana? Where they had the
                    floods?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    That's so far.
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah.
          
          
          
                              MOUNA
                    Did the lawyer say anything else?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. No he didn't know anything
                    else.
          
                              MOUNA
                    No one seems to know anything. It
                    feels like Syria.

          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Mouna walks along the street. She stops at a small CLOTHING

          Suddenly Mouna appears in the doorway.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Sorry to keep you waiting.
          
                              WALTER
                    That's alright. How is he?
          
                              MOUNA
                    He says hello. He wants to make
                    sure that you are practicing your
                    drum.
          
          Walter smiles.
          
                              WALTER
                    I am. You look very nice.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You too. Should we go?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes.

                              MOUNA
                    This city is just so huge! It never
                    ends.

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter pays the Cab Driver and turns to Mouna.
          
                                WALTER
                    Ready?
          
                                MOUNA
                    For what?
          
          Walter points to the "Phantom of the Opera" marquee behind
          her.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Really? The Phantom? Are we seeing
                    it?
          
                                WALTER
                    Yes.
          
                                MOUNA
                    Now?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Is that OK?
          
                              MOUNA
                    That's wonderful. Thank you. I am
                    so excited.
          
          Walter smiles as he and Mouna walk toward the theatre.
          
          
          EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT
          
          The lights and sounds of Times Square. Walter and Mouna walk
          through the throngs of tourists after the play. Walter hails
          a cab and they jump in.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK RESTAURANT - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna both sit in a French restaurant finishing
          their salad.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I have to say that show was really
                    kind of scary.
          
                    94
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Yeah. It was kind of scary.
          
          The both smile. A WAITER approaches and picks up their
          plates.
          
                              WAITER
                    Are you finished?
          
                                 MOUNA
                    Yes.

                    How is everything?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Very good. But I think I would like
                    a glass of wine.
          
                              WALTER
                    I'm sorry. I didn't even think to
                    ask.
          
                              MOUNA
                    It's OK. It's not every night that
                    you see The Phantom.
                        (To the Waiter)
                    I'll have a cabernet.
          
                              WALTER
                    Two please.
          
                                 WAITER
                    Certainly.
          
          The Waiter leaves.
          
          
                              WALTER
                    I haven't been to theatre in a long
                    time.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Me neither. There is a place in
                    Syria called Maaloula. It is a huge
                    outdoor theater. It's beautiful.
                    We used to take Tarek there to see
                    concerts.
          
          The Waiter sets down the two GLASSES of wine.

          They clink glasses and drink.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna, I've taken a leave of
                    absence for the rest of the
                    semester.

                    Really? Why?
          
          Walter is suddenly self-conscious.

                              WALTER
                    I just thought I might spend some
                    more time in New York.
          
                               MOUNA
                    Walter, you do not have to do this
                    for Tarek.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I want to.
          
                              MOUNA
                    But you have to be in Connecticut.
                    You have your teaching. And your
                    book.
          
                              WALTER
                    It's fine really.
          
                              MOUNA
                    This is not your problem, Walter.
                    It's OK that you are busy.
          
          Her simple words strike a chord with Walter.
          
                               WALTER
                    I'm not busy. Not at all.
                        (Beat)
                    Mouna, the truth is I haven't been
                    doing any work for a long time.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You just presented your paper at
                    the conference.

          He is beginning to unravel.
          
                              WALTER
                    I didn't even write it. I just read
                    it. I've been teaching the same
                    course for twenty years. It doesn't
                    mean anything to me. None of it
                    does. I pretend. I pretend that I'm
                    busy. That I'm writing. Working.
                    But I'm not doing anything.
          
          Walter trails off.
          
                                 WALTER (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Don't be. I appreciate you telling
                    me this.
          
          The Waiter returns and pours some more water.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Walter, what would you do if you
                    didn't teach?
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't know.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I think that is exciting. Not to
                    know.
          
          Walter considers this as if for the first time. He smiles.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna, what do you do?

                    Do you mean for work?

                    Yes.
          
                              MOUNA
                    I work in a car dealership. I take
                    care of the accounting.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Really?

                    My God. Twelve-thirty! I have not
                    been up this late in a long time.
          
                              WALTER
                    I think that happens a lot in New
                    York.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you, Walter. That was a very
                    nice evening. It's the most fun
                    I've had in a long time.
          
                              WALTER
                    I told Tarek I was going to take
                    you. He was very happy about it.
          
          Mouna is touched by the comment. Her mood shifts.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Good night, Walter.
          
                              WALTER
                    Good night.
          
          And with that she turns and walks into her bedroom.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Walter wakes up. He checks his watch. He notices that his
          phone is blinking. A message. He picks it up and listens to
          it.
          
                       98
          
          
          
                               WALTER
                    Damn it!
          
          He throws open the door and hurries into the...
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mouna is sitting at the table.
          
                              WALTER
                    There's a message from Tarek.
                    Something's wrong.
          
                              MOUNA
                    What did he say?
          
                              WALTER
                    Just that they were moving him. He
                    didn't know what it meant.
          
          Without another word, Mouna is up and putting on her coat.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK TAXI - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna ride in the cab. Walter is on the phone.
          
                               WALTER
                    Well when do you expect him back?
                    Can you have him call me the minute
                    he is? It's an emergency. Thank
                    you.
                         (He hangs up.)
                    He's still in court.
                         (To the CAB DRIVER)
                    Can you hurry please?
          
                              MOUNA
                    I hate this feeling.
          
          
          EXT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna get out of the cab. Walter rushes in. Mouna
          waits outside.
          
          
          INT. QUEENS DETENTION CENTER - LATER
          
          Walter walks up to the guard booth.
          
                      99
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    Hello. I'm here for bed 38. Tarek
                    Khalil.
          
          The MALE GUARD checks the computer screen. Walter waits.
          
                              MALE GUARD
                    He is no longer with us.
          
                              WALTER
                    What does that mean?
          
                              MALE GUARD
                    I'm not sure.
          
                              WALTER
                    You're not sure? Was he moved to
                    another facility? Another state?
                    What?
          
                              MALE GUARD
                    I don't know. I just know that this
                    detainee is no longer in the
                    facility.
          
                              WALTER
                    Well can you ask someone who does
                    know?!
          
                                MALE GUARD
                    Hold on.
          
          The Guard picks up the phone and dials. He has a long
          conversation that Walter cannot hear.
          
          There are a few other visitors in the waiting room. They
          watch Walter.
          
                                MALE GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Sir?
          
                              WALTER
                    Yes. Did you find him?
          
                              GUARD
                    He's been removed.
          
                              WALTER
                    Removed? To where?
          
                                GUARD
                    Deported.
          
                   100
          
          
          
                              WALTER
                    What? When?
          
                              GUARD
                    He was deported this morning.
          
                              WALTER
                    He...how can that be? Is there any
                    way to contact him?
          
                              GUARD
                    I don't know. I don't think so.
          
                              WALTER
                    You don't think so? What kind of
                    answer is that?!
          
                              GUARD
                    I'm sorry, sir. That's all the
                    information that I have. Now please
                    step away from the window. You can
                    call the ICE if you have any
                    further questions. The number is on
                    the wall.
          
          Walter's wheels are spinning. He is helpless. He looks around
          the room at all of the other immigrants visiting friends and
          family members. They are watching him with blank faces.
          
                              GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Sir. Please step away from my
                    window.
          
          Walter doesn't move. He checks his watch.
          
                              GUARD (CONT'D)
                    Sir. For the last time, step away
                    from my window.
          
          Finally, Walter turns and starts to walk out of the detention
          center.
          
          He reaches the exit and then spins around and storms back
          toward the guard booth. He completely loses control.
          
                              WALTER
                        (Angrily shouting)
                    You can't just take people away
                    like that! Do you hear me?! He was
                    a good man. A good person! He had a
                    life here! You can't just take
                    away whoever you want!
                              (MORE)
          
                      101
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    It's not fair! We are not just
                    helpless children! Do you hear me?!
          
          The Guard just stares back blankly. The other visitors watch
          in disbelief. They are unaccustomed to this type of outburst
          as is Walter who now stands trembling in the middle of the
          room.
          
          It's as if something inside him snapped. Something that he
          has been holding on to for a long time. He is suddenly
          adrift. Unsure of what to do next.
          
                              MOUNA (O.S.)
                        (Gently)
                    Walter.
          
          Walter turns. Mouna is standing there. He looks at her.
          Helpless.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Walter. Let's go. There is nothing
                    we can do. Let's go.
          
          Walter looks a bit lost. He looks back at the Guard who just
          stares back at him.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Come on, Walter.
          
          She reaches out and takes Walter's hand. And then she leads
          him out.
          
          
          INT. NEW YORK TAXI - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna ride in a taxi. They are both depleted.
          Mouna shakes her head.
          
                              MOUNA
                    He did nothing wrong.
          
          She is overwhelmed by the events. She breaks down and starts
          to cry. Walter puts his arm around her.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET FAIR - DAY
          
          Walter watches as Mouna tells Zainab. Zainab buckles and hugs
          Mouna.
          
                   102
          
          
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Walter is looking out the window. Mouna walks out of the
          kitchen and turns out the light. She walks over and stands
          next to Walter.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Walter, I need to go back to Syria.
                    I should to be there for Tarek.
          
                              WALTER
                    When are you going to leave?
          
                              MOUNA
                    Tomorrow. I already bought a
                    ticket. It's best for me to be
                    there as soon as possible.
          
          Walter just looks at her. The news is piercing.
          
                              WALTER
                    You won't be able to come back
                    here.
          
                                 MOUNA
                    I know.
          
          Beat.
          
                              WALTER
                    Mouna. I'm sorry.
          
          Mouna smiles warmly.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Good night, Walter.
          
          Mouna leans in and kisses him gently on the cheek. She turns
          and walks toward her room. Walter watches her go and then
          looks back onto the street.
          
          
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - LATER
          
          Walter is lying awake in bed. There is a knock at the door.
          He sits up.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Yes.
          
          The door opens and a shaft of light cuts across the room.
          Mouna stands in the doorway.
          
                    103
          
          
          
          Walter stares at her for a moment and then turns down the bed
          sheets. Mouna walks over and lies down next time. Walter
          pulls the sheets back over her.
          
          They sit in silence for a long moment holding each other.
          
                              MOUNA
                    It's my fault. What happened to
                    Tarek. I did receive the letter
                    telling us to leave. I threw it
                    away. I never told him.
          
          Walter can only listen.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    We were here for three years by the
                    time the letter arrived. I had
                    found a job. Tarek was in school.
                    Everyone told me not to worry. That
                    the government did not care. And it
                    appeared to be true. And then,
                    after time, you forget. You think
                    that you really belong.
          
          Walter gently touches her.
          
                              WALTER
                    It's not your fault.
          
          He puts his arm around her and she collapses into him.
          
                              WALTER (CONT'D)
                    It's not your fault.
          
          They lie together.
          
          
          INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Mouna and Walter are sitting in the airport.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Have you visited your son in
                    London?
          
                              WALTER
                    No. Not yet.
          
                              MOUNA
                    You should visit him.
          
          Mouna takes a small decorative pouch out of her purse.
          
                   104

                    Here.
          
          Walter takes it and opens it. It's a WRIST BAND from Zainab's
          collection.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    Zainab and I picked it out
                    especially for you.
          
                              WALTER
                    Thank you. It's very nice.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Let me see.
          
          Mouna puts it on Walter's wrist.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I like it.
          
                              MOUNA
                    So do I. You look cool.

                    Cool?

                    Yes. You are very cool, Walter.
          
          Walter smiles. Mouna checks her watch.
          
                              MOUNA (CONT'D)
                    I should go.
          
          The both stand up.
          
          
          INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, SECURITY CHECKPOINT - LATER
          
          Walter and Mouna arrive at the security check point. Mouna
          sets down her bag.
          
                              MOUNA
                    Thank you, Walter. For everything.
          
          She leans in and they hug long and hard.
          
                              WALTER
                    I don't want you to go.
          
          Mouna kisses him.
          
                    105
          
          
          
                              MOUNA
                        (She whispers)
                    I don't want to go, habibi.
          
          Then she picks up her bag and walks off. Walter watches her
          go. She turns and waves. Walter waves back and then she
          disappears into the security check point.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
          
          Walter walks quickly along the street with his drum.
          
          
          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter approaches the subway and enters.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY STATION - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter swipes his card and walks down into the subway.
          
          
          INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Walter walks along the subway platform. He stops about midway
          and sits down on a bench.
          
          The uptown subway train enters and obscures our view of him.
          
          Finally the train pulls away. Walter is still sitting but now
          he is playing his drum.
          
          He is fully committed.
          
          Another train wipes frame.
          
          
          EXT. STREET FAIR - DAY
          
          Zainab sits behind her table, staring straight ahead. We hold
          on her for a long moment and then...

BLACK

A young man's V.O.:

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           I was born in Beaufort, North
           Carolina. A place where the air
           always smells of pine and salt and
           sea.

The voice is gentle. Slightly Southern in inflection.   A
young doctor's soothing manner.


FADE IN:


EXT. COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA (DECEMBER) (PRESENT)

A vast view of the coastline in winter -- beaches, rivers,
sea marshes, inlets -- ebbing and flowing.

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           For many, days and nights are
           spent fishing Pamlico Sound or
           crabbing the Neuse River.

The CAMERA FINDS a small coastal town, edged by a harbor
on which fishermen toil.


EXT. BEAUFORT, NORTH CAROLINA - MORNING (DECEMBER)

The CAMERA, MOVING inland, CROSSES OVER modest houses
decked with plastic rooftop Santas...

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           While the ocean may be the focus
           of daily labor, churches have
           always tried to be the focus of
           life.

And MOVES UPHILL TO...


EXT. MAIN STREET

Where fake snow is sprayed on store windows. The CAMERA
CONTINUES TO the far side of Main Street -- with its
stately homes with big lawns, flower beds, and tasteful
Christmas garlands.

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
           When I lived here, there were
           eighteen churches within town
           limits alone.

                                                       2.

EXT. FOUR-WAY STOP

From each corner, four churches face each other. The
Fellowship Hall Christian Church, the Church of the
Forgiven People, the Church of Sunday Atonement, and All
Saints Church.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          They sponsored pancake breakfasts,
          rummage sales, car washes, and
          softball games.


EXT. LANDON'S TRUCK - TRAVELING

The CAMERA FINDS and FOLLOWS a newish sport utility
vehicle with MD plates as it passes a rummage sale and a
softball game.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          You'd think that all the people
          here were friendly, welcoming,
          open-hearted...

Dr. LANDON CARTER, 33, drives the truck.


INT. CAR - TRAVELING

Landon looks urban, prosperous, well-groomed -- but
retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony. A cell
phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him.

                         ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          ... and that money or family
          background or education or luck
          didn't matter.

Landon reaches out to adjust his side mirror, revealing a
simple gold wedding band on his left hand.


EXT. STREET - TRAVELING

Landon's truck turns the corner and slows in front of the
huge Southern Baptist church.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          But they did matter. They
          mattered to everyone. Except
          Jamie Sullivan...

Landon's truck turns into a driveway just past the church
and heads for a cluster of buildings. Behind the
buildings, a cemetery.

                                                        3.

EXT. CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage -- it's a
different color than he remembers.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          ... Astronomer. Actress.
          Believer in God...

Landon hesitates a moment, then climbs out of his truck.


EXT. OLD PARSONAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Landon heads up the walk and onto the front porch.
Presses the DOORBELL. It RINGS inside. Landon is edgy,
unsettled.

                        ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
          ... Believer in me.

A nurse opens the door.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH GYM - NIGHT (NOVEMBER, 1985)

ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as
"Born in the U.S.A." Students hang. Brains, preps,
richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks.
Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted.
A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX.

Missing are the criminals...

A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING.
VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is
impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage
to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied,
feared.


INT. CAMARO

EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic
skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror.
Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.

                        LANDON
                 (impatient, edgy)
          Where is he? He's supposed to be
          here.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                              4.

CONTINUED:

                           ERIC
                    (from back seat)
             I need to whizz.

ERIC's skinny, high-energy.          A leg always jiggling.

                             LANDON
             Eric.    You're such a hummingbird.

                              BELINDA
             I wanna dance.

BELINDA is Landon's girlfriend. Richie princess, a bad-
girl pretender. Big shoulder pads. Jellie bracelet.
Swatch watch.

                              LANDON
             So go dance.

                              BELINDA
             With you.

                              LANDON
             I.    Don't.   Dance.

                           ERIC
                    (pointing, like
                     Tattoo)
             Dee plane. Dee plane.

They laugh.       Clay's by the dumpster.


EXT. DUMPSTER

CLAY, obese, wearing a too-small student monitor vest, is
dumping garbage from a trash can. A loud HONK. Clay
turns to see the Camaro, then turns back to the school,
coast clear. He quickly heaves in the empty trash can as
the Camaro pulls up.

Eric pushes a door open.       Empties fall from the back seat.
Clay climbs in.

                              CLAY
             Go go go go.

PRINCIPAL ED KELLY, middle-aged, pockmarked skin, Casio
calculator watch, exits the gym.


INT. CAMARO

Landon's looking at Kelly in the rearview mirror.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                          5.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
                    (mocking)
             Kelly. He looks like his face
             caught fire and he tried to put it
             out with a fork.

Landon inches the car forward, teasing Clay, teasing
Kelly.

                           ERIC
             He couldn't find his own butt with
             both hands at high noon in a hall
             of mirrors.

Sniggering laughter.

                           CLAY
             Go!

Landon presses the gas.    The CAR ROARS away.

                           CLAY
             Kelly's so old he --

                           LANDON
             We're done with that already,
             bonehead.

Clay smiles, good-natured.    He often misses social cues.


EXT. CAMARO - TRAVELING

Landon drops Clay's student monitor vest out onto the
road. Another car runs it over.


EXT. ROAD

Mr. Kelly walks over, picks up the vest. Shakes it.
Frustrated. Eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster.


EXT. OUTSIDE CEMETERY GATE - LITTLE LATER

Camaro is parked on the dirt access road, headlights
shining through the locked rear gate. JOHN COUGAR
MELLENCAMP's "Small Town" playing.


INT. CAMARO

Landon, Clay, and Belinda sit drinking, smoking weed.
Under the MUSIC, a CB RADIO scanner CHATS quietly.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         6.

CONTINUED:

                           ERIC (O.S.)
             So which is it?


EXT. CAMARO

Eric finishes taking a leak.

                           ERIC
                    (calling over,
                     repeating)
             Landon. To save your life, you
             have to either go deaf or go numb
             in your dick and balls.

Eric climbs back in the car.


INT. CAMARO

Landon, Belinda, Clay, Eric.

                             LANDON
             I'm thinking.

                           ERIC
             No thinking. The doctor only
             gives you three seconds to
             decide --

                           LANDON
             Could I lose one ear and one nut?

                           ERIC
             No questions, no negotiating --

                            BELINDA
                    (to Eric, annoyed)
             Where do you get these stupid
             questions -- ?

                           LANDON
             Hypotheticals --

                           ERIC
                    (to Belinda)
             I'm just wondering --

                             BELINDA
             Don't wonder.

Landon's looking out at the night.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                        7.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             Jamie Sullivan.

Everyone looks up.     Derisive laughter.


THEIR POV

A pale, contemplative GIRL, 17, is jumping down off the
gate, caught in the headlights. Wearing clothes she
probably made herself; long hair hiding her face. She
lives in her mind, not her body.


BACK TO SCENE

                            BELINDA
             Brain.

                            ERIC

             Cherry.


EXT. CAMARO

JAMIE (GIRL), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and
approaches Landon's window, her SNEAKERS CRUNCHING in the
GRAVEL. She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her
chest.

                           JAMIE
                    (to Landon,
                     tentative)
             Hey. Hi. Your lights. Any
             chance you could... turn them
             off --

                           BELINDA
                    (leaning over
                     Landon)
             God give you this road?

                            JAMIE
             No --

                           BELINDA
             Then we'll be keeping the lights
             on.


                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                              8.

CONTINUED:

                            LANDON
                    (to Jamie, seeming
                     nice)
             If you want the lights off, I'll
             turn them off.

And he does.    Darkness.

                            JAMIE
             Thank you.   Thank you so very
             much.

She backs away from the car, grateful.        From the car:

                           BELINDA (O.S.)
             I can't see a friggin' thing.


INT. CAMARO

Landon switches on the dome lights for Belinda.

                           BELINDA
                    (imitating Jamie)
             'Thank you. Thank you so very
             much.'

But Landon's looking at Jamie.     Almost counting the
seconds...


HIS POV

Jamie scaling the fence, practiced at it.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon quickly flicks the high beams.     Belinda, Eric, and
Clay snicker and snort as they see --


EXT. CEMETERY GATE

Jamie, startled, paused at the top. But instead of
looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even.
A moment later, she jumps down on the far side.
Disappears.


INT. CAMARO

Belinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing.       Landon's smiling.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

Laughter.

                            LANDON
             Right here.   With you.

He clinks Eric's raised beer. More laughter. But
Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where
he'd really like to be.

                           CLAY

                           ERIC
             'Twilight Zone,' dipshit.

                           LANDON
             Don't call him a dipshit.

                            ERIC
             You do --

                            LANDON
             And you don't.
                    (beat, re: Jamie)
             What's she doing in there?

                           BELINDA
             Nothing I'd be doing.

Laughter.    Landon kisses her.      With tongue.

A blinding white light dances through the car and settles
on Landon and Belinda's faces.

                            LANDON
             Shit!

He scrambles out of the car.


EXT. CAMARO

Landon looks up at the fence.

                                                            10.

LANDON'S POV

Jamie sitting atop, holding a large mirror, reflecting the
headlights back into the car.


BACK TO SCENE

They stare at each other.   His annoyance turns to mild
respect.

The CB RADIO comes to life inside the car.     A GARBLED
TRANSMISSION.

                          BELINDA (O.S.)
          Landon!


INT. CAMARO

Landon leaps in.    Pops out the Van Halen.

                          LANDON
          The address?!

                          ERIC
          York Ave.

Landon pops in a WHAM! tape.     AMPS it UP.   "Freedom."

                          LANDON
          What number?

Nobody answers.

                          LANDON
          Dildoes.

Landon turns the car around.


EXT. ACCESS ROAD

The Camaro fishtails away. TIRES CRUNCHING, red
taillights bouncing on the rough road. The car turns left
onto the paved road and speeds out of sight.


INT. CAMARO

Landon drives recklessly.   Rushing.   He makes a SCREECHING
turn.


LANDON'S POV - STREET AHEAD

Two fire trucks rumbling by houses, SIRENS WAILING.

                                                            11.

EXT. CAMARO

Turns right, following the fire trucks.


INT. CAMARO

Landon smiles at Belinda. She smiles back. Fun. Landon
takes a slug of beer. Turns his eyes back to the road.


LANDON'S POV - FIRE TRUCKS

make another turn. Then a flash of light, movement.         A
figure on the road.


EXT. ROAD

An old man walking his little dog.     Crossing the street.


INT. CAMARO - LANDON

turns the wheel hard.      Jams his foot on the brake.


EXT. ROAD

The Camaro swerves.     TIRES SQUEALING.   A LOUD, HEART-
SEARING THUMP.

The old man -- sideswiped, drops to the asphalt.

The CAMARO SLAMS into a light pole.     CRUNCHING METAL.
TINKLING GLASS.


INT. CAMARO

Quiet.   Landon, Eric and Clay are banged up.

                            CLAY
            Christ, man.

                            LANDON
            You okay?

                            ERIC
            Yeah.

Belinda's head leans on the dash. Her shoulders shake.
Landon, bleeding on the forehead, reaches over. Scared.

                            LANDON
            Belinda?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            12.

CONTINUED:

She lifts her head.     Looks at him.   She's laughing.   He
kicks his door out.


EXT. STREET

The Camaro crumpled into the light pole. Headlights
askew. Clay and Eric and Belinda getting out, dazed.

Landon runs to the old man. Kneels. Shakes him.       No
response. The man's TERRIER BARKS at Landon.


LANDON'S FACE

Frightened, anguished.     The real Landon showing for an
instant.

Police SIRENS WAIL in the b.g., growing LOUDER.


EXT. OLD CHEVETTE - HALF HOUR LATER

A battered Chevette steers through a working-class
neighborhood.


INT. CHEVETTE

Landon's mother, CYNTHIA, 35, drives. She's weary with
sun-worn skin, but still attractive. She wears a skimpy
black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat.

                           CYNTHIA
             What if they expel you?

                           LANDON
             Kelly wouldn't do that.

                            CYNTHIA
             Why not?

                           LANDON
             Cuz nothing happened at school.

He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile.

                           CYNTHIA
             Don't smile at me. It's not going
             to get you out of this.

                            LANDON
             Why not?   It always has before.

                                                          13.

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - MONDAY (7:59 AM)

By daylight, a modern brick and glass structure.


INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - 8:05 AM

Mr. Kelly gestures for Landon to sit.   Landon doesn't.
His forehead still shows a bruise.

                        MR. KELLY
          I had hopes for you.

                        LANDON
          Like I'd grow up to be president,
          another Reagan.

                        MR. KELLY
                 (not laughing)
          Like you'd make it to June. Even
          cutting half your classes, you
          have a B- average.

                          LANDON
          I'm no dummy.

                          MR. KELLY
          That's right.    You just act like
          one.

On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out
of the Camaro.

                        LANDON
          Those aren't mine.

                        MR.KELLY
          They came from your car.

                        LANDON
          I wasn't the one drinking.

Kelly holds up the police test finding.

                        MR. KELLY
          Your blood alcohol level. Maybe
          you were legally in the clear, but
          I make the rules here.

Landon scowls, knows he's defeated.

                        LANDON
          You expelling me?

                          MR. KELLY
          I am.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                         14.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             Now I can do what I want.

                           MR. KELLY
             That's right.
                    (sarcastic)
             The world is your oyster.


EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MINUTES LATER

Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous
political prisoner. Freedom. He struts through the
courtyard. Not a care in the world.


EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - HOUR LATER

Landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled Camaro. A
neighbor kid, JOSH, 12, watches from across the street, on
his way to school.


EXT. CAMARO - MINUTES LATER

Landon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath,
the body, the paint. A discouraging mess.


INT. CARTER HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Landon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door.

                            LANDON
             Mom.   I need a ride.


INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM

Dark. She wears a black eye-shield.      Her waitress uniform
hangs over a chair.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (sleepy, annoyed)
             I'm not getting up to drive you
             somewhere.
                    (beat)
             What're you doing home?


EXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Landon lifts the garage DOOR.

                                                        15.

LANDON'S POV - INSIDE GARAGE

A murky place.   Filled with old tools and junk and a grim
old bike.


EXT. MINI-MALL - AUTO PARTS SHOP - LITTLE LATER

Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his
bike. No way to carry. He looks around. The bus stop.
A bus approaching.


EXT. UNDER CAMARO - LATER

BANGING, RATCHETING, CLINKING. Landon's working hard.    A
BOOM BOX playing SIMPLE MINDS' "Alive and Kicking."


LANDON'S POV - HIS MOTHER'S LEGS

and worn terry slippers appear.

                        CYNTHIA (O.S.)
          I want to talk to you.

He pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out.


EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY

The mangled front bumper's on the ground. Cynthia stands
there in her bathrobe. Upset. Landon's almost too much.

                        CYNTHIA
          You're not hanging round here all
          day.

                        LANDON
          I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my
          car --

                        CYNTHIA
          You don't need a car you can't
          drive for a month. Go see Marvin.

                          LANDON
          'Bout what?

                          CYNTHIA
          About a job.

Landon ignores her.    Slides back under his car.

                                                        16.

EXT. UNDER CAMARO

                        CYNTHIA (O.S.)
          He's going to try you as assistant
          manager.
                 (beat)
          You could be manager someday.

Landon can't believe this.


EXT. DRIVEWAY

Landon slides back out.

                        LANDON
          I'm not working there.

Cynthia sets her jaw.   He knows that look.


INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - LUNCH HOUR

Landon is sweating, scouring pots. A crooked cap on his
head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. He's
making some headway; only two more to wash.

MARVIN, the owner, walks over. Beer belly, greasy hair.
Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's
sink. Landon glimpses his future.


INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OUTER OFFICE - EARLY AFTERNOON

Landon paces, jumpy. Kelly's secretary, MISS TARBOX,
quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer.

                        LANDON
          Who's he in with?

                        MISS TARBOX
          He'll be with you when he's
          available.

The door to Kelly's office opens. Jamie Sullivan exits
with her father, the tall stern REVEREND HEGBERT SULLIVAN.
Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by.

                        LANDON
                 (joking)
          You expelled, too?

Nobody laughs or even smiles.

                                                        17.

INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Mr. Kelly makes a note in Jamie's file.

                        MR. KELLY
          Finding the real world to your
          liking, Mr. Carter?

                        LANDON
          I want to come back.

                         MR. KELLY
                  (looking up,
                   surprised)
          Back?   Were you ever really here?

They both know Kelly has the upper hand.   Kelly leans back
in his chair, relishing it.

                        LANDON
                 (mumbling)
          I want to graduate.

Kelly studies Landon, the boy who can't get out of his own
way.

                        MR. KELLY
                 (thinking aloud)
          You could grace our hallowed halls
          again, if, while you're here, you
          make a sincere effort to be part
          of our little school community --

                         LANDON
                 (relieved)
          I'd do that --

                        MR. KELLY
          How would you do that, Mr. Carter?

Landon shrugs, clueless.

                        MR. KELLY
                 (smiling)
          Shall I give you a few ideas?

                           LANDON
                    (smiling, too)
          Please.

                        MR. KELLY
          Besides attending all your regular
          classes, I'd like you to help our
          janitorial staff after school --

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                         18.

CONTINUED:

                            LANDON
             For pay?

                           MR. KELLY
             For the inner satisfaction it will
             bring.
                    (beat)
             Saturday mornings, I'd like you to
             tutor disadvantaged students at
             our sister school --

                           LANDON
                    (joking)
             I'm as underprivileged as they
             are --

                           MR. KELLY
             The fact that you attend this
             school makes you privileged.

His tone quiets Landon.

                           MR. KELLY
             Finally, I'd like you to join the
             drama club. Rehearsals are
             Tuesday and Thursday evenings.

                           LANDON
                    (grumbling)
             I'd work backstage or something?

                           MR. KELLY
             Or something. They're doing a
             play for the holidays.

                           LANDON
             When do I get time for me?

                            MR. KELLY
             You don't.   That's the point.

Landon's not happy, but he'll work with this.     As he heads
for the door:

                           MR. KELLY
                    (softer, trying to
                     reach him)
             Landon, none of us faculty see you
             the way you see yourself.
                    (beat)
             Some of us remember how your
             father --

                           LANDON
             Then you remember more than I do.

                                                          19.

CLOSE ON BROOM

pushing gum wrappers under a radiator.


INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL

Landon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open
house. A dozen nerds, including Jamie Sullivan (wearing
her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits. Students
wander in, listen, look.

                        JAMIE
                 (answering question)
          -- Saturn's 15 degrees to the
          right of red Antares and much
          brighter.

To her small audience, she holds up a contraption made
from a wire coat hanger.

                        JAMIE
          This is a very simple device made
          from a coat hanger, plastic wrap
          and typewriter correction fluid.
          Does anyone know what it is?

No one does.

                        LANDON
                 (barely audible)
          A star frame.

But Jamie hears.   She regards him a moment, then keeps
going.

                        JAMIE
          This is a star frame.

Clay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at
Jamie.

                        JAMIE
          A star frame will help you locate
          stars and planets with your naked
          eye --

                        CLAY
                 (scoffing, setting
                  her up)
          -- Did God create the sun?

                                                             20.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (taking him seriously)
             Yes, God created the universe and
             all its physical laws. Even
             Einstein said it's a miracle that
             our world is comprehensible --

                           ERIC
             -- If God can do all that, why
             can't he get you a new sweater?

Landon laughs loudly.    Members of the club look at him.

                           LANDON
             That was a joke. Laugh.

Jamie smiles.    She can laugh at herself.     And she finds
Landon funny.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN - EVENING

Landon washes up while his mother sets the table.      The
MICROWAVE HUMS in the b.g.

                           CYNTHIA
             Your father dropped off an extra
             check.

                           LANDON
             I don't want his money.

                           CYNTHIA
             It could help with a new car --

                           LANDON
             -- I like the car I have.

He picks up the envelope with wet hands. Without looking
inside, rips it in half. Cynthia smiles, quietly happy.


INT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - SATURDAY MORNING

Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing
"Karma Chameleon." Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading,
not singing. She turns around to look at Landon.    He
rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a
Sony Walkman, glum.


HIS POV

To Z.Z. TOP'S "Sleeping Bag." Out the window -- Jefferson
High School coming into view. Bars on every window,
chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass.

                                                          21.

INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - LITTLE LATER

A big room with tables and chairs but few books. Pairs of
heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks. Landon sits
with LUIS, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity. A geometry
text between them.

                        LANDON
                 (reading)
          -- 'So what is the measure of
          angle x if A and B are similar
          triangles?'

Luis is lost, intimidated.

                        LANDON
          Know what 'similar' means?

Luis shrugs. Luis looks down at the book as if for the
answer, then at Landon, hopeless. He gets up and walks
off. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie
studying him. She's at a nearby table with her student,
ISABEL.


INT. SCHOOL BUS - NOON

The DOOR SWISHES SHUT behind Landon as he hops aboard.
He's late and heads for the rear bench seat.


LANDON'S POV

Jamie sitting there.   And no vacant seats save next to
her.


BACK TO SCENE

The bus begins to roll.   Landon lurches forward.


TRAVELING - LATER

The bus is moving through Beaufort. Landon sits next to
Jamie. Putting a new tape into his Sony Walkman. His
body turned away. She's reading her book.

                        JAMIE
          You going to visit Harold?

Landon scowls.   What-who is she talking about?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           22.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             They let him out of the hospital
             yesterday. He's in a rest home on
             Oak Street.

That old man.

                           JAMIE
             He goes to my father's church.   He
             could've died --

                           LANDON
             -- This your idea of small talk?

                           JAMIE
             I don't make small talk --

                              LANDON
             -- Obviously.

                           JAMIE
             I just wanted to tell you not to
             give up. Sometimes you've got to
             back into the teaching from
             somewhere else.

If he heard her, he makes no sign.     She goes back to her
book. A long beat, then:

                            JAMIE
             What makes you volunteer?
                    (pause)
             Want to know why I tutor reading?

Not really.

                           JAMIE
             Because, growing up, books were my
             world.

                              LANDON
                     (mean)
             Were?

                           JAMIE
             You don't know me.

                           LANDON
             Your book and your brown sweater
             and your hair. What's more to
             know -- ?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                        23.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             -- I wear the sweater because I'm
             cold. I read because no one talks
             to me. My hair is my hair. What
             is it exactly that's bothering
             you?

                           LANDON
             You don't care what people say?

                           JAMIE
             You mean care what you say? I'm
             worrying about other things.

                            LANDON
             Like what?   The moons of Jupiter?

                           JAMIE
             Can't you have a normal
             conversation?

                           LANDON
             I don't want to have any
             conversation.

                           JAMIE
             Good, cuz talking to you is like
             trying to explain red to a blind
             person.

She reads again. The bus pulls to a stop in front of
Beaufort High. Belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting,
leaning on her Cabriolet. Jamie watches Landon exit the
bus.


JAMIE'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW

Landon greeting Belinda, kissing her.


INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - TUESDAY EVENING

Landon opens a side door, peers in at the Drama Club.


LANDON'S POV

A big space with a stage. MS. GARBER stands before six
geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and Jamie.

                                                       24.

BACK TO SCENE

Landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these
places? Ms. Garber looks up from her papers.

                        MS. GARBER
          We're waiting, Mr. Carter.

He slides in a row behind the others. Leans forward and
pokes a boy, EDDIE JONES. Eddie's pimply and talks with
his eyes squinched up.

                        LANDON
          What's the play?

Eddie hands him a photocopied script, The Rainmaker.

                        EDDIE
          The-the-there's this drought an'
          -- and a smooth t-t-alking guy
          comes and says he can m-make
          rain --

                        LANDON
          -- And the ugly farmer's daughter
          falls for him. I saw the movie.

                         EDDIE
          Yeah.   It's really g-g-good --

                           LANDON
          -- It blows.


ON STAGE - MINUTES LATER

Jamie and Landon sit in folding chairs, reading from
scripts. Landon's wooden, showing how lame this is.

                        LANDON
                 (as Starbuck)
          'I hope your dreams come true.'

                        JAMIE
                 (as Lizzie, sad)
          'They won't.'

                        LANDON
                 (as Starbuck)
          'Believe in yourself and they
          will. Let me ask you, Lizzie.
          Look in the mirror? Are you
          pretty --?'

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                          25.

CONTINUED:

                           MS. GARBER
             -- Landon, are you trying to be
             bad at this?

                           LANDON
             No, it just comes naturally.

Jamie smiles.    Garber taps her script -- continue.

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck)
             'It's got to be inside you. Then
             one day the mirror will be the
             eyes of the man who loves you.
             You'll look in that mirror and
             you'll be more than pretty.
             You'll be beautiful.'

Ms. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going.

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck)
             'Look at me. Tell me what you
             see!'

As Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes.

                           JAMIE
                    (as Lizzie)
             'Is it really me?'

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck, hamming)
             'Yes. You're-you're b-b-
             beautiful.'

Hoots and laughter.    Jamie looks away, humiliated.

                           MS. GARBER
             Quiet!
                    (announcing)
             Landon will play the role of Bill
             Starbuck.

Groans among the boys.    Jamie is horrified.    So is Landon.

                           LANDON
                    (to Garber)
             No way. No thanks. I can't do
             it --

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          26.

CONTINUED:

                            MR. KELLY (O.S.)
                     (offstage)
             -- You can and you will, Mr.
             Carter.

Kelly's been standing in the wings.

                           MR. KELLY
                    (warning)
             With all the sincerity and dignity
             you can muster.

Everyone stares at Landon.     He's trapped.


EXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT EVENING

Raining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands
under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for
a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind.

                           LANDON
                    (rude)
             You're like this fly, buzzing
             buzzing everywhere --

                           JAMIE
             -- This play means a lot to me.

                            LANDON
                    (snorting)
             This play -- ?

                           JAMIE
             -- I know you don't suck at
             acting.

Landon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind
him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night.

                           JAMIE
             But you have to make it a big joke
             because only dorks and dweebies
             like doing theater --

                           LANDON
             -- What are you going on about?

Pause.

                           JAMIE
             I can judge too.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          27.

CONTINUED:

He exhales, eyeing her, daring her.

                           JAMIE
             You don't care about classes or
             graduating. But you like school
             because you're popular and you
             know you'll never be on top again.

                              LANDON
             That's deep --

                           JAMIE
             -- Your act only works with an
             audience.

                              LANDON
             My act?!

She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac.     The last
car in the parking lot.

Fire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears
twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the
Pontiac backing out of a parking spot.


EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past.

                            LANDON
             A ride?!   Please!


INT. PONTIAC

Jamie turns to look at him.


JAMIE'S POV

Landon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading.

                            LANDON
                    (insincere)
             We can talk about your helping me
             with my lines.


INT. OLD PONTIAC - TRAVELING - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie's at the wheel.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            28.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             I know you don't want help.

                           LANDON
             Then we both know.
                    (beat)
             I'll point. You drive.    Faster.

He points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks.
The wet road glistens.

                           JAMIE
             We're following fire trucks?

                              LANDON
             Yeah.

                              JAMIE
             Why?

                           LANDON
                    (duh)
             Because that's where the fire is?

He fishes in his pocket for a tape. Pulls one out.      He's
searching the dash -- no cassette player.

                           LANDON
             Fire is like a living thing.
             Wild. Unpredictable.

                              JAMIE
             Like me.

                             LANDON
             No.    Not like you.

She jerks the car across the center lane. Driving on the
wrong side of the road. He grips the dash.

                              LANDON
             What the -- ?!

                           JAMIE
             So you agree you need help?


LANDON'S POV - OUT WINDSHIELD

Headlights looming, a car coming.      Closer and closer.

                                                         29.

BACK TO SCENE

                             LANDON
           Yes!

She swings the Pontiac back to the right lane. Smiling.
A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING.

                             JAMIE
           Really?

Landon drops his attitude, his act.   He toys with the
glove compartment knob.

                         LANDON
           Yeah. Kelly'll make me leave
           school if I screw up the play.

                         JAMIE
                  (to herself)
           28 and 42.

Pause.   He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested.

                         LANDON
           What's with the friggin numbers?

                         JAMIE
           28 is do something illegal.   42 is
           befriend an enemy.

                             LANDON
           I'm an enemy?

                             JAMIE
           Kinda.    Yeah.


EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM FIRE - LITTLE LATER

Landon and Jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire
and the firemen. Landon is just tolerating her.

                         JAMIE
           The reason I got the part... I'm a
           little like Lizzie. Except I
           don't worry about some man
           rescuing me.

                             LANDON
           Good thing.

If she's offended, she keeps it to herself.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             30.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             You got some kind of list?

                           JAMIE
             Are you asking to mock me or do
             you really want to know?

                           LANDON
             Maybe a little of both.

They both smile.

                           JAMIE
             I'll take a chance.

                             LANDON
             Go for it.

                           JAMIE
             It's like a to-do list, but for my
             life.

He smirks.

                           JAMIE
             If you can't imagine the future,
             you won't have one.

He lights a cigarette.       She reaches for it.

                           LANDON
                    (joking)
             Having a cigarette. 100.

She grins and takes a drag.      They share the cigarette.

                           LANDON
             So what else is on this list?

                             JAMIE
             It's private.

                           LANDON
                    (cajoling)
             You want to tell me...

She eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing
her dreams with him.

                           LANDON
                    (guessing, rudely)
             Get very wasted. Lose your
             virginity --

                           JAMIE
                    (correcting)
             Spend a year in the Peace Corps.
             Make a medical discovery --

                           LANDON
                    (contemptuous)
             Ambitious.

                           JAMIE
             Being negative's a lot more work
             than being positive.

                           LANDON
             Like you'd know.

                            JAMIE
             I do know.
                    (pause)
             Be two places at once... learn to
             hit a baseball or turn a
             cartwheel... eat breakfast with
             chopsticks...

He likes the frivolity of these.

                           LANDON
             What's... Number one?

She looks away, embarrassed.

                           JAMIE
                    (changing subject)
             If you want help with your lines,
             I have two conditions.
                    (smiling)
             You have to promise not to fall in
             love with me.

He's certain she's joking.

                             LANDON
             No problem --

                           JAMIE
             And you have to meet my father.

He looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this.

                           LANDON
             Fathers love me.

                                                       32.

CLOSE ON PARSONAGE FRONT DOOR

swinging open. Reverend Sullivan looming tall.   Ichabod
Crane in a collar.


EXT. PARSONAGE PORCH - WIDER - NEXT EVENING

Landon gives a cheery little wave. He's very sweaty.   His
bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g.

                         LANDON
          Hey.   Landon Carter.

Landon offers his hand. The Reverend shakes reluctantly,
eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans,
dirty t-shirt, aloof manner.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
                 (surprised)
          You're in the play?

                          LANDON
          Lead man.

Jamie slides out the door. She looks good in jeans and a
white t-shirt. Almost normal. In the b.g., Landon's BIKE
CRASHES over. He bounds down the porch steps.

                        LANDON
                 (explaining bike)
          They took my license for 30 days.
          But nobody's pressing charges.

The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned. Landon tries the
kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed
bush. Not the best place.

                        JAMIE
          I'll get something for us to
          drink --

                          LANDON
          Don't bother!

But she's already gone.   The Reverend gestures toward the
open front door.


INT. SULLIVAN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. Landon
pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie
with her parents. He looks up, aware that the Reverend is
studying him closely.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                            33.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             You know our planet would not
             suffer for one nanosecond if
             humans died off. But if ants
             disappeared, that would be
             catastrophic.

The Reverend waits, letting Landon suffer the silence.

                           LANDON
                    (confidence flagging)
             Apropos of nothing... so. So so
             so so --

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Let's get something straight. You
             don't know me. I don't know you.
             But I know what you're about.
                    (beat)
             Keep your distance from this
             house -- and from Jamie.

His eyes lock with Landon's. His message clear. A NOISE
and Jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all
cheerful.

                           JAMIE
             I miss anything?


INT. PARSONAGE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

Jamie washes the lemonade glasses, happy.      Her father
comes in.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             The Carter boy. Tell me about
             him.

                           JAMIE
             He wants help with his lines --

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             He was driving the car that hit
             Harold Keene --

                              JAMIE
             By accident --

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.
                    (beat)
             Is this really the best time to be
             making a new friend...?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         34.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             I'm supposed to always be alone?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             I don't want you to see him
             outside school activities.

                           JAMIE
             Fine. But I need to start
             deciding how to spend my time and
             my life.

Pause.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
                    (gentler)
             I'm sorry your mother isn't here
             to help you become a woman.

                           JAMIE
             Dad, I've become a woman without
             her. Just not a pretty one.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - ONE AM

Jamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt.


INT. HALLWAY

Jamie peers into her father's room. He's sleeping.     She
tiptoes to the staircase and down. Sneaking out.


EXT. REAR ACCESS ROAD TO CEMETERY - TEN MINUTES LATER

Landon is waiting when Jamie appears. He has scripts in
his back pocket. They smile at each other, laugh.

                          JAMIE
                    (re: her father)
             I know. Don't say anything.

                           LANDON
             He's a softy. Got him wrapped
             around my finger.

                             JAMIE
             You think so.

                             LANDON
             Know so.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           35.

CONTINUED:

She grins, skeptical.

                              JAMIE
             This way.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Jamie leads Landon toward the cemetery rear gate.

                           JAMIE
             People think I'm strange, don't
             they?

                            LANDON
                     (smiling)
             Yes.

                           JAMIE
             Because I try to be nice to
             people?

                              LANDON
             Yeah.   Maybe.    I dunno.

                           JAMIE
             Do you think I'm strange?

Pause.   Landon's caught off-guard by her frankness.

                            LANDON
             Yeah.   But that can be good.


EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT

Jamie quickly scales the fence.       Landon's right after her.

                           LANDON
             Why are we here?


INT. CEMETERY

Jamie drops down.     Takes a flashlight from her bag.

                           JAMIE
             Cuz it's dark and quiet and you
             can see into another world.

                           LANDON
                    (on top of gate)
             The world of the dead?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             36.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (being mysterious)
             Could be...

He drops down, not sure what she means.      She's already
walking away. He follows.

                           JAMIE
             My mother's buried near here.

                           LANDON
             My father's alive but it's like
             he's dead.

She looks at Landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a
storage shed. Opens the door. Enters. Returns a moment
later carrying several pieces of an odd-looking home-made
cylindrical device.

                             LANDON
             What is that?

                            JAMIE
                    (proud)
             That is my telescope.


SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

The ten-inch Dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky.
The eye-piece is at the end of the long scope; the scope
rests on a plywood base. Landon looks through the eye-
piece.


POV (THROUGH TELESCOPE) - CLOSE ON GOLDEN PLANET

a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad, flat
ring system.

WIDEN.

                           LANDON
                    (impressed)
             Saturn. Beautiful.

                            JAMIE
             Before Voyager we expected maybe a
             dozen rings --

                           LANDON
             But there are thousands of them,
             made of floating ice --

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           37.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             Maybe debris from a moon that
             broke apart.

                           LANDON
             Or building blocks for a world
             that never formed.

She looks at him.    He smiles, embarrassed.

                              LANDON
             I'm not smart.     Just a sponge.

She smiles, disagreeing, then looks through the telescope
and changes its view.

                           JAMIE
             Sometimes I come here and just
             scan the heavens.

                           LANDON
                    (joking)
             Looking for intelligent life?

                           JAMIE
             Looking for something -- someone.

Pause.   He doesn't know what to say.

                           LANDON
             Do you believe you'll see your
             mother again?

                           JAMIE
             I hope so.
                    (beat)
             I think maybe she sees me now.

Their eyes meet.     She looks away.    Changes the subject.

                           JAMIE
                    (re: telescope)
             I'm building a larger one to see
             the nucleus of Haley's Comet --

                           LANDON
             The dirty snowball at its core.

                              JAMIE
             Yeah.
                    (beat)
             I'm probably not going to be
             around next time it comes.

                           LANDON
             In 76 years, me neither.

She likes that he knows a little about astronomy. They
each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars.

                           LANDON
             You're really into God, right?

                           JAMIE
             In ten words or less?

                           LANDON
             Yeah.

                           JAMIE
             My relationship with God is my
             own.

                           LANDON
             But you think about Him -- It --
             Her.

                           JAMIE
             Don't you?

                           LANDON
             Not really.

Pause.

                           JAMIE
             When you do, how do you?

Landon could joke or he could reveal something.

                           LANDON
             Like in a church painting. I see
             this giant hovering over the
             ground. He's wearing a robe, and
             has long flowing hair, and he's
             pointing his finger at something.

                           JAMIE
             Do you ever wonder why things
             happen the way they do?

                           LANDON
             No.

             I know there's a plan for
             everyone, but sometimes I don't
             understand what the message is --
             or what the point is.

                           LANDON
             There is no point. You live.     You
             die. The end.

                           JAMIE
             Maybe we're not supposed to
             understand, but we're supposed to
             have faith that someone else sees
             the big picture.

                           LANDON
             You have to believe to have faith.

                           JAMIE
             You don't believe in anything?

                           LANDON
             The Bible. Why should I read a
             bunch of dumb stories about some
             ancient guy who supposedly worked
             miracles.

                           JAMIE
             Interpreted by another guy like my
             father.

                           LANDON
             Your father doesn't like me.

Pause.

                           JAMIE
             He doesn't trust you.

                           LANDON
             Sometimes I don't even trust me.

He sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back
pocket. He holds one out to her. A moment passes. She
takes it.

                           JAMIE
             I'm not afraid of you.

                           LANDON
             Likewise.

                                                          40.

INT. PARSONAGE - HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jamie sneaks from the stairs to her room. Shuts the door.
A light glows under the door, then goes out.


INT. REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM

He opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back
to sleep. Not suspecting. Not yet.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Dreary. Landon lies in bed, flipping the TV CHANNELS,
past "Square Pegs," "Miami Vice," MTV, to a British nature
documentary. After a moment, he searches for a pen and
paper. Titles it "Life List." Pause. He doesn't know
what to write.


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH PARKING LOT - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL)

Landon, Clay, Eric, Belinda. Eric's pickup is parked by
Belinda's Cabriolet. RADIOS ON, BLASTING the same
station, same song: JOHN FOGERTY's "Rock and Roll Girls."

                           ERIC
             Women are definitely evolving into
             men.

                           CLAY
             The moustaches on some girls.
             Unbelievable.

                           BELINDA
             Why is Jamie Sullivan staring at
             us?

They look.    Jamie's watching them.   They laugh.

                           ERIC
             She wants to jump Landon's bones.

                           BELINDA
             That is so pitiful.

                           LANDON
             She's very confused.

                           CLAY
             Deluded.

                           ERIC
             Deranged.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           41.

CONTINUED:

                            LANDON
             Demented.

                           BELINDA
             She's coming over here...

                           LANDON
             Heart be still.

They laugh more and she's there.

                           JAMIE
                    (to Landon)
             Hi.

He doesn't respond.      She shifts from foot to foot.
Confused.

                           JAMIE
             The play's going to be really
             good.

                           LANDON
                    (mocking her)
             I'm really glad you think so.

His friends snicker and guffaw.      She looks at them, then
back to Landon.

                            JAMIE
             I guess you don't want to practice
             lines tonight.

                           LANDON
             You guessed right.

She gives him a funny look and walks away.      A better
person than he and he knows it.

                           BELINDA
             That's one girl who can't take a
             hint.

                           LANDON
             Because she doesn't know what a
             hint is.

They laugh. Landon the loudest.      It feels good, but he
also feels a little... bad.


INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Cleaned up. Swept out. The Camaro is still a dented
mess. But Landon drops its hood down, wipes his hands,
and climbs behind the wheel. The ENGINE STARTS.

                                                          42.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

No posters of pop stars. Books by Houston Smith, Thomas
Merton, Alan Watts, Carlos Castaneda. Jamie studies,
listening to JONI MITCHELL's "I Wish I Had a River." The
DOORBELL RINGS.


INT. FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie opens the front door. Landon. A stern voice from
the living room. Reverend Sullivan's.

                        REV. SULLIVAN (O.S.)
          Better not be the Carter boy.

Jamie shuts the door.


EXT. SULLIVAN FRONT PORCH

Landon can't believe this.   He presses the BELL again.

                          LANDON
                   (talking to door)
          Jamie?
                 (beat)
          Open up.
                 (beat)
          Open the door. Please.
                 (long beat)
          Reverend Sullivan, I have to talk
          to your daught--

                        JAMIE
          What is your problem?

She's standing in the front yard.

                        LANDON
          You're not in a very good mood.

                        JAMIE
          You don't miss a thing.


WIDER

He steps down off the porch.

                        LANDON
          The play's in a couple of weeks.

                          JAMIE
          Yes.   And?

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                         43.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             I was hoping we could run lines
             together.

                            JAMIE
             Oh.   Just not at school...

                            LANDON
             Yeah --

                           JAMIE
             Or anywhere where people might see
             us.

                           LANDON
             Belinda's a very jealous person.

                           JAMIE
             That would be the reason.

Pause.   He thinks she might be going for this.

                           JAMIE
             So it's like you want to be secret
             friends.

                           LANDON
             That's it! Exactly! You're
             reading my mind --

                           JAMIE
             Then maybe you can read mine.

She walks up the porch steps, goes in the front door, and
opens it. Before she goes in:

                           JAMIE
             I thought I saw something in you,
             something good. But I was wrong.


INT. SULLIVAN FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie leans against the closed door, trembling, almost
crying. In the living room, her father looks up from his
reading, sees Jamie, then parts the curtains, looks out,
glowers.


REVEREND SULLIVAN'S POV - OUT WINDOW

Landon standing in the front yard, confused that Jamie
would reject his generous offer of friendship.

                                                        44.

EXT. FRONT YARD

Landon walks to his car, then yells back at the parsonage.

                        LANDON
          Why do you have to be so weird?!

The front door opens, startling Landon. It's the
Reverend. Red-faced with fury. Landon glares back, but
then climbs in his car and drives off. Ashamed.


INT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Jamie sits on the sofa.   Her father doesn't look up from
his reading.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          The first time I met him I knew.
          I'm proud of how you're handling
          yourself.

Tears well and Jamie's face cracks with guilt and
heartbreak. She leaves before her father can see her
distress.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Landon lies in bed watching another British nature
DOCUMENTARY, this one on astronomy. He reaches for his
school yearbook. Flips the pages until he finds Jamie's
photo.


CLOSE ON JAMIE'S PHOTO

She's smiling and looks almost cute. Listed under her
photo are clubs: Red Cross, Stars and Planets, Drama.
Ambition: To Witness a Miracle.


INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING

Landon and Luis sit over the geometry text. Landon has
just asked a question and Luis is shrugging sadly.
Landon's eyes wander out the window.


LANDON'S POV - BASKETBALL HOOP


BACK TO SCENE

                        LANDON
          Let's get outta here.

                                                         45.

EXT. JEFFERSON HIGH - BASKETBALL BLACKTOP - MINUTES LATER

Landon and Luis face each other across the half-court.
Landon's got a ball and is further from the basket.

                        LANDON
          You, me, and the basket. We're
          the three corners of a triangle.
          Take one step in.

Landon and Luis both step forward.

                        LANDON
          Am I at the same angle to you and
          the basket as before?

                          LUIS
          Yeah.

                          LANDON
          Are you?

                          LUIS
          Yeah.

                        LANDON
          So what did we just make?

                        LUIS
          A similar triangle?

                        LANDON
          What else? What kind of triangle
          has three sides of different
          lengths.

                          LUIS
          Scalene?

                         LANDON
          Okay.   Make me an isosceles.

Luis steps outward, directly opposite Landon.

                          LANDON
          Yes!    Two sides the same.

Landon tosses him the ball. They play. Jamie glances
over from a picnic table where she works with her student,
Isabel. Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks
back. Thoughtful. Watching her. But not staring.


INT. BOOK STORE - EVENING

Landon studies the books in the spiritual/religion shelf.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                        46.

CONTINUED:

He picks out a book, then sits in a corner.

But before he opens the text, he looks around him,
suddenly taking in all the books, all the learning, all
the knowledge that could be his.


EXT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - WEEK LATER

On the marquee: The Rainmaker. Under this, "All
Invited." Under this, a full parking lot.


INT. AUDITORIUM

A full house. Parents, teachers, students, churchgoers,
booster club and rotary members.


ON STAGE

The set is a wealthy Midwestern ranch house of the 1950s.
Eddie and two other BOYS play other characters. The
play's underway...


STAGE LEFT

Landon watches, dressed as Bill Starbuck in a nicely
fitted suit. Waiting for his entrance.


LANDON'S POV - STAGE

                           BOY #1
                    (as H.C., the father)
             'Then why don't you talk to her?'

                           EDDIE
                    (as Jim)
             'Because if we do, she'll think
             we're trying to get rid of her.'

                           BOY #1
                    (as H.C., the father)
             'She'll sure think the same if I
             do it. You're her father and
             comes a time when a father's gotta
             mention.'


BACK TO SCENE

From stage right, Jamie makes her entrance as Lizzie.   A
collective gasp from the audience.

                                                       47.

LANDON'S POV

Jamie, wearing makeup, a dress that clings, her hair
pulled back.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon can't take his eyes off her.

                         JAMIE
                  (as Lizzie)
           'Morning, Pop. Boys. I dreamed
           we had a rain, rain coming down in
           sheets! Lightning flashed,
           thunder rolled up and down the
           canyon like a kid with a big
           drum!'


AUDIENCE

Reverend Sullivan -- enraptured. Principal Kelly --
hopeful. Cynthia Carter -- uncertain. Clay, Eric, and
Belinda -- rocking in their seats, snickering.

                         JAMIE
                  (as Lizzie)
           'I know why you sent me to
           Sweetriver. Six boys in that
           family. The first three days, I
           stayed in my room.'

                         BOY #2
                  (as Noah, the
                   brother)
           'What'd you do that for?'


BACK OF AUDITORIUM

A well-dressed man, DR. JONATHAN CARTER, Landon's father,
slips in and takes a seat a couple of rows behind Cynthia.

                         JAMIE (O.S.)
                  (as Lizzie)
           'I knew what I was there for and
           they knew it, too!'


BACK OF AUDITORIUM - LATER

Dr. Carter hangs on every word. Others sit on the edge of
their seats. Even Clay, Eric, and Belinda. Belinda leans
forward to take a photo.

                                                       48.

BELINDA'S POV THROUGH CAMERA LENS

As she ZOOMS -- Landon and Jamie on stage, growing larger.


ON STAGE

Landon, Jamie, and the three boys.


ON STAGE - LANDON

is Starbuck.

                         LANDON
                  (as Starbuck,
                   genuine)
           '... You'll look in that mirror
           and you'll be more than pretty.
           You'll be beautiful. Look at me.
           Tell me what you see!'

Jamie looks. She sees something in his eyes she hasn't
seen in them before. Love.

                         JAMIE
                  (as Lizzie, choked
                   up)
           'Is it really me?'


LANDON'S POV

Jamie, her face lovely. Her eyes shining, radiating,
looking directly at him.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon is dumbstruck.

                           LANDON
                    (as Starbuck,
                     heartfelt)
           'Yes.
                  (beat)
           You're beautiful.'

Landon changes the line and nails it. Surprising himself.
Surprising her. They both know it's sincere. A moment
passes. Her stomach churns with anticipation.

He leans in. She closes her eyes. They kiss. Gently,
genuinely. When Jamie opens her eyes, they are filled
with tears.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           49.

CONTINUED:

The curtain crashes down.    End of act two.

CLAPPING from the other side of the curtain. Landon tries
to meet Jamie's gaze. But she's looking at the floor.


AUDIENCE

Principal Kelly, pleased. Cynthia Carter, proud. Clay
and Eric, surprised. Reverend Sullivan, frowning,
concerned. Belinda's face is cold, hard.


EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - HOUR LATER

Landon runs out, looking for his friends.      Mr. Kelly
shakes his hand, then deals with parents.


LANDON'S POV

Belinda getting into her car.


WIDER

                           LANDON
             Belinda!

Belinda stops.

                           BELINDA
             What?!

She waits.    Landon struggles with what to say.

                           BELINDA
             That's what I thought!

Landon watches her START her CAR, back from a parking
space --

                           DR. CARTER
             Landon.

Landon turns.    His father is standing on the curb.

                           DR. CARTER
             Fine performance.

                           LANDON
             Who invited you?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                50.

CONTINUED:

                             DR. CARTER
             Ed Kelly.    I thought we might get
             a bite --

                             LANDON
             Not hungry.

Landon moves toward his Camaro.

                          DR. CARTER
             Landon! Please. Don't walk away
             from me.

                           LANDON
             Like you walked away from us?

Landon opens his car door and gets in.         Not forgiving.


INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING

Landon waits by Jamie's locker.       The BELL RINGS.   No
Jamie.


INT. CAFETERIA - NOON

Landon walks along the lunch line, looking.        No Jamie.


INT. LIBRARY - LATER

Many many books. Landon cruises the stacks. No Jamie.
Belinda, sitting at a table with a girlfriend, sees Landon
and turns away. He doesn't pursue it.


EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - DUSK

Eric and Clay watch Landon hammer out dents in the Camaro.
They're smoking, sharing some beers. Josh, the neighbor
kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over.

                           ERIC
                    (contemptuous)
             She's like some Puritan.

                             LANDON
             She's not.    She's got her own
             ideas.

                             CLAY
             Mutant ideas.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             51.

CONTINUED:

                             LANDON
             Maybe to you.

Eric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her?

                            ERIC
             Belinda's telling everyone that
             kiss was real.

                             LANDON
             It was.

Eric and Clay smirk in disbelief.

                           ERIC
             And that you're scamming on Jamie
             Sullivan.

                           LANDON
                    (not denying it)
             Scamming's a strong word.


INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING

Landon's waiting when Jamie approaches her locker. Her
hair pulled back. She looks good in a simple, fresh way.

                           LANDON
             You weren't in school yesterday.

                           JAMIE
             I went to the doctor with my
             father.

                             LANDON
             He okay?

                           JAMIE
             Healthy as can be.

Pause. She doesn't help him.          She opens her locker, gets
what she needs.

                           LANDON
             You were great the other night.

                            JAMIE
             Thank you.   So were you.

Pause.   He tries to touch her hair.       She ducks.

                           LANDON
             I haven't been nice to you.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           52.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             You're hardly nice to anyone.

                           LANDON
                    (sincere)
             I'm sorry.

                           JAMIE
                    (walking away)
             I wish I could believe you.


INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

Jamie sits alone, reading, wearing her old brown sweater.
Landon walks by Clay and Eric at a table.

                           ERIC
             Landon!

                           LANDON
             Later.

Puts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits.      Making a
public statement.

                           JAMIE
             People can see.

                           LANDON
             And that would ruin your
             reputation how?

She goes back to her book.    Ignoring him.

                          LANDON
                    (re: her book)
             What's that?

She doesn't look up.    Shows him the spine:     The Scarlet
Letter.

                           JAMIE
             I'm reading all the novels on Mr.
             Rothberg's best American authors
             list.

                           LANDON
             How many books are there?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             53.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (annoyed)
             A hundred. Then there's his
             classics list. And his European
             list.

Landon realizes this is why she's always reading.

                           LANDON
             That on your 'Life List.'    To read
             all those books?

She doesn't deny it.       He just dives in.

                          LANDON
             Jamie. Maybe I want to try being
             positive.

She looks up.    Examines his face for the truth.

                           LANDON
             Maybe I miss doing that dumb play
             with you.

Students seated near them have overheard.      Whisper.

                           LANDON
             Maybe you inspire me.

                           JAMIE
             That sounds like horseshit.

                             LANDON
             Which part?

                             JAMIE
             All of it.

                             LANDON
             It's not.

                             JAMIE
             Prove it.

She picks up her books and tray.      Everyone is watching.

                             LANDON
             I just did!


EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTER SCHOOL

Landon follows Jamie out of the building.      Catches up.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             54.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             Jamie --

                           JAMIE
             You lack honor. You lack
             compassion. You lack honesty.
             You lack humanity.

She heads to the old Pontiac.       Landon jogs after her.

                          LANDON
             Okay. Maybe some of that is
             true --

                           JAMIE
             You don't know the first thing
             about being someone's friend --

                           LANDON
             I don't want to be just your
             friend --

                           JAMIE
             You don't know what you want --

                           LANDON
             You don't either. Take a look at
             yourself. Maybe you're scared
             that someone might actually like
             you --

                           JAMIE
             And why would that scare me?

                           LANDON
             Because then you couldn't hide
             behind your books and your
             telescope and your sweater and
             your God.

She gets into her car. Slams the door.        STARTS the
ENGINE. She recognizes the truth.

                           LANDON
             But the real reason you're scared?
             You like me!

She drives off. Clay and Eric, watching, guffaw at
Landon's spectacle.

                           LANDON
             If you were really my friends,
             you'd be helping me, not running
             me down.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          55.

CONTINUED:

                           ERIC
             The only one running you down is
             you.


EXT. BRIDGE OVER INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY - NIGHT

Landon sits alone. Legs dangling over. Lighting and
dropping matches into the black beyond his feet. His body
caught in the occasional sweep of car headlights.

Nearby, an abandoned car.     A rusty old Yugo.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN - NIGHT

Landon comes in from outside. Is surprised to find
Cynthia sipping tea, wearing her uniform.

                           CYNTHIA
             Out with Belinda?

                            LANDON
             That's over.   Way over.

                           CYNTHIA
             I can't know things if you don't
             tell me.

Pause.

                           LANDON
             Dad came to the play.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (surprised)
             You saw him?

                           LANDON
             We talked. He wanted to get a
             bite -- after. I said no.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (disbelief)
             After he moved out, I invited him
             to every practice, every game,
             every parent-teacher conference
             you ever had. He didn't show, not
             once.

                           LANDON
             He wants to show now.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           56.

CONTINUED:

                           CYNTHIA
             You going to let him? You going
             to reward him by being the son he
             was never man enough to be a
             father to?

Landon doesn't answer.

                              CYNTHIA
                    (angry)
             You do that.


INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCIENCE LAB - NEXT AFTERNOON

The door is open to a lab where Jamie and the Star Club is
meeting. Landon mops, working hard, while listening in.
Inside, Jamie ignores him.


Mr. Kelly watches from near the trophy case.      Almost
approving.

                           MR. KELLY
             Mr. Carter. Don't wear a hole in
             that one spot there.

Landon grins and moves on. Behind Landon's back, Mr.
Kelly peeks into the science lab. Sees Jamie. Looks back
at Landon. Wonders.


EXT. JEFFERSON HIGH - SATURDAY (DECEMBER)

Landon parks his Camaro.       It's shiny and buffed and
perfect again.


INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER

A Christmas party for the tutors and tutored. A ROCK 'N'
ROLL CHRISTMAS CD plays. A raffle ticket box by the door.
A sign reads: "Win Movie Tickets."

Landon enters, buys a ticket, then takes off his leather
jacket. Underneath, a nice shirt and tie.


LANDON'S POV

Across the room -- Jamie, looking pretty in a dress,
laughing with her student, Isabel. Mr. Kelly talking with
MR. REGINALD ADAMS, principal of Jefferson High.

Luis runs over, diverts Landon's attention.

                                                          57.

FRONT OF ROOM

Mr. Adams goes to a microphone.      Taps it.

                           MR. ADAMS
             Everyone? Quiet please. As you
             all know, we're here to celebrate
             the holidays and to raise money to
             buy books for our library. The
             book drive is being led by
             Beaufort High's Jamie Sullivan.

Applause. This is new. Landon looks at Jamie, who's
smiling. She steps to the microphone.

                           JAMIE
             Thank you for buying tickets.
             We've raised two hundred and
             eighty-five dollars.

More applause.    She steps down.


LANDON AND LUIS

Off to one side.

                           LANDON
                    (to Luis)
             About enough to buy maybe five
             volumes in a set of encyclopedias.

Luis smiles.    Jamie overhears.

                             JAMIE
             It's a start.

                           LANDON
             Yeah, with a finish in about a
             decade.

She smiles.    He looks at her.

                           LANDON
             So you're talking to me?

                           JAMIE
             When I have something to say.

He smiles.

                           LANDON
             What's number one on your list?

She shakes her head.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           58.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             My number one would be getting out
             of Beaufort.

                           JAMIE
             Getting out won't be your problem.
             It'll be figuring out what you
             want when you get somewhere.

She walks away.

                           LANDON
             What does that mean?!

                           JAMIE
                    (turning back)
             It means you can do anything.

Landon smiles, not sure why she believes in him.


EXT. CARTER HOUSE - CHRISTMAS EVENING

Hanging on the front door:       a simple evergreen wreath with
a plaid bow.


INT. CARTER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Dark save for a gilded fake tree lit with tiny blinking
lights and the glow of Cynthia's cigarette in the dark.

                          CYNTHIA
             Landon! Come enjoy the tree!
             Landon?!

Landon comes down the stairs. Sits on the sofa.       Wearing
another good shirt. She tries to reach out.

                              CYNTHIA
             You look nice.     I should have
             dressed.

                           LANDON
             You're fine like that, Mom.

                           CYNTHIA
             There's hot cider in the kitchen.

                              LANDON
                       (not moving)
             Thanks.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          59.

CONTINUED:

                           CYNTHIA
             I haven't seen Clay or Eric
             lately.

                            LANDON
             Me neither.

                           CYNTHIA
             No great loss --

                           LANDON
             I need to go out.

Pause.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (hurt)
             To see your father?

                            LANDON
             No.   I won't be long.

He senses her hurt, but leaves anyway.


INT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

A Christmas tree with large colored lights stand in a
corner. Jamie and her father playing cards. The DOORBELL
RINGS. Then urgent BANGING.

                            JAMIE/REV. SULLIVAN
                    (recognizing)
             Landon Carter.


EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Landon slides his backpack off his shoulder.      Pulls out a
shopping bag. Holds it out to Jamie.

                           LANDON
                    (awkward)
             It's a present. Take it.

She does. She opens the bag, pulls out a beautiful pink
sweater. She's overwhelmed.

Without a word, just a happy smile, Landon hops down the
steps toward his car. Reverend Sullivan appears in the
doorway.

                           LANDON
                    (calling back)
             Merry Christmas! And to all a
             good night!

                                                       60.

INT. PARSONAGE - JAMIE'S ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Jamie hums to herself as she brushes her hair. She's
wearing the new sweater. Her father KNOCKS. Enters.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           What's Landon Carter up to?

                           JAMIE
                    (innocent)
           Up to?

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           I thought we had rid ourselves of
           his disagreeable companionship.

                         JAMIE
           Dad, why don't you get to the
           point where you get to the point.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           Why is he giving you a gift?

Jamie doesn't answer.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           Did you give him a gift?

                            JAMIE
           No.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           I saw the way he looked at you.
           The way he kissed you.

                            JAMIE
           It was a play.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
                  (unconvinced)
           Boys like him have --
           expectations.

                         JAMIE
           I have expectations, too.

Pause.   He's feeling her grow up, grow away.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
           I'm not changing the rules.

                         JAMIE
           I haven't asked you to.

They eye each other.    He's losing her.

                                                         61.

INT. RETIREMENT HOME - HALLWAY - LATER THAT EVENING

A nurse points Landon toward a patient room.     He carries a
battered liquor-store box.


INT. PATIENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A TV flickers. Landon comes in. Opens the box.      Pulls
out the evergreen wreath with the plaid bow.

                       LANDON
          For me. Christmas is all about
          the smells.

Landon leans the wreath in the window. HAROLD KEENE --
the old man from the accident, watches from his bed,
baffled.

                        LANDON
          Pine's my favorite. That and
          cider with cloves.

Landon pulls a Thermos from his coat pocket.     Unscrews the
cap. Finds a drinking cup. Pours in cider.       Offers
Harold the cup.

                           HAROLD
          Who are you?

                           LANDON
          Landon Carter.     I was driving the
          car that --

                           HAROLD
          You.

                           LANDON
          Me.

Harold takes the cup, looks Landon over.    Landon appears
genuinely contrite.

                        LANDON
          I'm very sorry --

                        HAROLD
          What kind of a man are you, son?

Pause.

                        LANDON
                 (honest)
          I don't know that I am -- a man.
          Yet. I'm working on it.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             62.

CONTINUED:

Pause.

                           HAROLD
             I've worked on it my whole life.

Harold reaches under his pillow.         Pulls out a small bottle
of liquor. Tops off his cider.

                           HAROLD
             Get yourself a glass.

                           LANDON
             No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits
             for the drive home.

Harold nods, liking Landon.

                           HAROLD
             You'll sit a while.

                              LANDON
             I will.


EXT. RURAL ROADS - LATER THAT NIGHT

Landon speeds, the windows open, WIND WHIPPING, DIRE
STRAITS BLASTING. The Camaro turns and brakes and turns
again, kicking up gravel, raising hell. The car slides to
a stop.


INT. CAMARO

Landon turns OFF the RADIO. Sits still. Wipes the
rearview mirror clean, spotless. Unties the dangling
plastic skeleton and pockets it.


EXT. USED CAR LOT - NEXT MORNING

Colorful banners and flags flap in the brisk WIND.        Landon
talks with a used car SALESMAN.

                              SALESMAN
             Eight hundred.

                           LANDON
             It's got a new V-6 and
             transmission. Alloy wheels.
                    (beat)
             Twelve hundred.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           63.

CONTINUED:

                           SALESMAN
             Nine-fifty.

                           LANDON
             New paint. Extra chrome.     Not a
             scratch anywhere.

                           SALESMAN
             The interior is --

                           LANDON
             Reconditioned. Completely. Be a
             collector's someday. Twelve
             hundred.

They look at the Camaro.    Shining in the sun.

                           SALESMAN
             You can't expect me to pay you for
             your -- attachment to that car.

Landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then
adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old.

                          LANDON
             I don't. I expect you to pay me
             for yours.

The Salesman looks from Landon to the car. He pulls a wad
of cash from his pocket. Wearily counts out twelve bills.
Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then
walks away.


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - FRONT LAWN - NEXT MORNING

The marquee reads, "HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"


EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

One car. An old station wagon.        At the parking space, a
sign: "School Principal Only."


INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE

Kelly looks up from paperwork.

                           MR. KELLY
             Landon?

Landon drops a folded wad of hundreds on the desk.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          64.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             For Jefferson High. For books.

                           MR. KELLY
                    (suspicious)
             Where did you get -- ?

                            LANDON
                    (angry)
             It's mine to give. I didn't steal
             it.

                           MR. KELLY
             I didn't say you did.

But his tone implied it and Landon's already gone. Kelly
is immediately sorry. He goes to his window and sees
Landon pedal away on the old bike.


EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY

Landon watches a tow truck lower the abandoned Yugo. When
the car is down, he sees Jamie standing on the sidewalk.


EXT. FOOT OF DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Landon faces Jamie.

                           LANDON
             Hey.

                           JAMIE
             I heard what you did.   Thank you.

He nods, but quickly changes the subject.

                           LANDON
                    (re: the Yugo)
             She great or what?

                           JAMIE
             Why are you doing all this?   To
             impress me?

                           LANDON
             No.
                    (beat)
             But are you -- impressed?

She smiles.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           65.

CONTINUED:

                             JAMIE
             Like fire.

                             LANDON
             What?

                             JAMIE
             You.

She heads for her father's old Pontiac.

                           LANDON
             New Year's Eve. Would you go out
             with me?!

She stops.    Turns around.    Surprised.

                             JAMIE
             Yes.    But not as a date date.

                             LANDON
             Why not?

                           JAMIE
             I'm not allowed to date.

She smiles and gets in the car.


EXT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - NEXT AFTERNOON

Landon follows signs for the church office.


INT. HALLWAY BY REVEREND SULLIVAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Landon looks into the Reverend's office.


LANDON'S POV

Reverend Sullivan is sitting behind his desk, examining
legal-looking documents and records. He takes his glasses
off, rubs his eyes.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon knocks.       The Reverend looks up, furrows his brow.

                           LANDON
             Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you
             something?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           66.

CONTINUED:

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Does it have to do with Jamie?

                           LANDON
             Yes, sir.

The Reverend makes a small motion and Landon enters.


INT. REVEREND'S OFFICE

Landon doesn't sit.

                           LANDON
             I'd like to take Jamie to dinner
             on New Year's Eve.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             That won't be possible.

He looks back to his papers.    End of conversation.

                           LANDON
             I'm sorry I haven't always treated
             Jamie the way -- I should have.
             She deserves better.

Reverend Sullivan glances up.       As if surprised Landon is
still there.

                           LANDON
             I care for her.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             I don't want to see her hurt.

                           LANDON
             I wouldn't do that --

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             This week.

                           LANDON
             Ever again.

The Reverend looks out the window. A gray day, cold,
bitter, stark. He considers his options.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Have her home by one. And drive
             carefully.

                                                           67.

EXT./INT. YUGO (CARTER DRIVEWAY) - FEW DAYS LATER

Landon's under the Yugo's hood.     Josh, the kid from next
door, is in the driver's seat.

                        LANDON
          Start the engine.

Josh turns the key. Nothing happens.     Under the hood,
Landon changes something.

                           LANDON
          Again.

Josh tries the engine again.    Still no go.   Landon changes
something else.

                           LANDON
          One more time.

Josh tries one more time. The ENGINE ROARS, then DIES,
then amazingly STARTS again. It's running. Landon high-
fives Josh, then sees an old station wagon turn in.


EXT./INT. STATION WAGON - MOMENTS LATER

Kelly hands a paper to Landon.

                        MR. KELLY
          Your grades for fall semester.
          They're -- good.

                        LANDON
                 (incredulous)
          You came here to give me my report
          card?

                        MR. KELLY
          I've seen students with records
          like yours go to J.C. for a couple
          of years, then transfer to a good
          college.

Landon understands what Kelly is implying.

                        MR. KELLY
          I'd gladly write you a letter of
          recommendation.

                           LANDON
          Thank you.

                        MR. KELLY
          You're welcome.

They shake hands.

                                                      68.

INT. LANDON'S BATHROOM - NEW YEAR'S EVE

Landon, dressed with care, faces the mirror and wet combs
his hair.


INT. FLAUVIN'S - HOUR LATER

A seafood joint on the waterfront. Quaint, not fancy.
Twinkle lights illuminate Jamie's face. Landon finds her
lovely. Jamie picks.

                        JAMIE
          I can't believe you asked my
          father's permission.

                        LANDON
          I wanted this to be a date.

She watches Landon, happy, then perplexed.


JAMIE'S POV

Landon wolfing down his food.


BACK TO SCENE

                        JAMIE
          Is there a rush?

                        LANDON
          I have to get you home by one.

                        JAMIE
          It's only 7:30.

                        LANDON
          We're going somewhere. After.
          And no. I didn't ask your father.


INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Landon drives. The CARS' "Tonight She Comes" PLAYS.   He
belches loudly, dramatically.

                        JAMIE
          Excuse you.

                        LANDON
          Your turn.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                          69.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (laughing)
             No.

                           LANDON
             I know you want to.

She grins.    And tries.   A small burp.

                           LANDON
             Bring the air all the way up from
             your stomach.

He belches again.    Just as loud.   She tries again,
laughing.


EXT. YUGO

Landon steers the car into a parking lot for a miniature
golf course with a castle-shaped video arcade and Little
League diamond. A family entertainment center.


INT. YUGO

Jamie sees where they are.

                           LANDON
             Before we do this.

                           JAMIE
             We're doing something -- ?

                           LANDON
             Before we do this, I just want to
             say that a good life's gotta be
             about more than achieving stuff --
             like on your list.

She waits for more.

                            LANDON
             It's about working with what you
             already have -- right now -- at
             your fingertips -- you know,
             spontaneously.

                           JAMIE
             What are you talking about?

                           LANDON
             That little bit of larceny in your
             heart.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          70.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             Excuse me?

                           LANDON
             Fun.


INT. BATTING CAGE - NIGHT

Jamie's in the cage with a helmet on.    A machine tosses
balls. Landon coaches from outside.

                           LANDON
             Swing! Keep your bat parallel to
             the ground. Follow through.
             Follow through!

Jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. The balls
keep coming. She ducks out of the way and grasps the
fence and leans in. Landon leans in on his side. They'd
be embracing if the fence weren't there.

In the b.g., kids from their school.    Giggling,
whispering.

Landon looks over at them.

                           LANDON
                    (to Jamie)
             Let's go.


EXT. HIGHWAY - TRAVELING - NIGHT

The YUGO ROARS down the asphalt.    A sign for the
approaching state line whips by.


INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Jamie and Landon.    With STEVIE NICKS' "Talk to Me" ON the
RADIO.

                           LANDON
             The cells in our bodies are always
             changing. In six or seven years
             all your cells have changed. You
             could be like a completely new
             person from the inside out.

                           JAMIE
             That what's happening to you, only
             faster?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           71.

CONTINUED:

He grins.    Pulls the car over.

                            LANDON
             Get out.   Come on.

He leaps out, leaving the headlights on.


EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Landon takes Jamie's hand and pulls her toward some
invisible place.

                           JAMIE
             Where -- what -- are we -- ?

He keeps tugging her.     She follows him.   Laughing.

                           LANDON
             Stand right here.

                            JAMIE
             Where?

He leans down and lifts one of her feet a foot from the
other. He notices a large bruise on her leg. She brushes
her dress down.

                           JAMIE
             You're acting like a crazy person.

                           LANDON
             You're straddling the state line.
             You're in two places at once.

She's thrilled at his solution to her wish.       He walks to
the shoulder of the road.

                           LANDON
             Repeat after me.

Huh?   He does a cartwheel.    She laughs.

                            JAMIE
             I can't.

                           LANDON
             I'm gonna teach you.


EXT. BEACH (NEUSE RIVER) - LATE NIGHT

A starry night with a bright moon. Glimmering silver
water. Jamie and Landon walk onto a dock. DISTANT
FIREWORKS BOOM.
                                             (CONTINUED)

                                                            72.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             It's places like this that make me
             certain there's a God.

                           LANDON
                    (surprised)
             You're sometimes not sure?

                             JAMIE
             I'm sure.    Pretty sure.

They reach the end of the dock. She turns to face the
WIND. It blows her hair. She turns his face the same
way.

                           JAMIE
             It's like the wind. I can't see
             it but I feel it.

He closes his eyes.       Feeling the wind.   Opens them again,
rejecting the idea.

                           LANDON
             We can measure wind.

                            JAMIE
             Uncertainty makes you
             uncomfortable.

                           LANDON
             What do you actually know with
             religion?

                              JAMIE
             Wonder.     Beauty. Joy.
                       (beat, quieter)
             Love.

She's embarrassed.       She tries to avoid implying anything.

                           JAMIE
             My mother told me God is love, so
             when you're feeling love, you're
             feeling God.
                    (beat)
             I think talking about these things
             -- threatens their very beauty and
             mystery.

Her tone is matter-of-fact, but Landon's got a serious and
tender look on his face. He touches her hair.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                         73.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (almost a whisper)
             I don't understand...

                           LANDON
             Maybe you're not supposed to.

He moves closer.

                           LANDON
             I might kiss you.

She looks down.    Shy.

                           JAMIE
             I might do it wrong.

                           LANDON
                    (tenderly)
             Not possible.

He touches her neck, her cheek, her mouth. Then leans in
and kisses her. A tender, soft kiss. He pulls away.
They look at each other a moment.

                           LANDON
             I love you, Jamie.

There, he put it out there, risked looking and feeling
foolish. Not the old Landon. Jamie looks away. Mixed
emotions. Happy and sad.

                           LANDON
                    (gently)
             Now's when you say something.

                           JAMIE
                    (overwhelmed)
             I can't.
                    (beat)
             I can't -- explain.

She turns back to him, her eyes shining.     She touches his
face and they kiss again, deeply.

But after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his
shoulder. Smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof,
staring at the water. He pulls away slightly to study her
face. He touches her cheek and brings her back from
wherever she's been.

                           JAMIE
             You make me feel...

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             74.

CONTINUED:

                             LANDON
                      (hopeful)
             Loved?

                             JAMIE
                      (smiling)
             That.    And less strange.

Tears run down her cheeks. Landon wipes them away with
his thumbs, attributing them to happiness.


EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - LATER

Landon follows Jamie up the steps. The lights in the
living room are on. THROUGH the windows, they can see her
father taking down the Christmas tree.

                              JAMIE
             Be very quiet.

He pulls her to him.      Kisses her.     The front door opens.

                            REV. SULLIVAN
                    (embarrassed)
             Hello, Landon.

Landon and Jamie separate, but Landon keeps an arm over
her shoulder.

                              LANDON
             Hey, Reverend.

Reverend Sullivan studies the two young people.

                           LANDON
                    (whispers to Jamie)
             Happy New Year.

And he goes. Jamie walks by her father and into the
house. Not saying anything. He watches her. What has he
allowed?


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

Landon and Jamie head into school.        Landon nods to
Belinda, others. They glare back.

                           LANDON
                    (to Belinda and
                     others)
             What's your damage?

                                                        75.

INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Landon and Jamie arrive at his locker.    It's been kicked
in.

                           LANDON
          Assholes.     This happen to you?

                           JAMIE
          Twice a year.

Bang, bang, bang. Landon kicks in every locker in his
row. A dozen in all. Jamie watches, a little frightened
by his anger. But then he turns to her and grins.

                        LANDON
          Now they all match.


INT. CAFETERIA - NOON

Landon eats alone, ignored by Eric and Clay. Jamie
approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful.

She hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that Landon's
being diminished, ostracized. She thinks he doesn't see
her. But as she turns to leave, he pulls a chair out for
her and smiles. She sits. Landon sees her face.

                           LANDON
          What's wr--?

                        JAMIE
                 (choked up)
          The Challenger exploded.
          Principal Kelly's about to make an
          announcement.

The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM CRACKLES.    Landon takes Jamie's
hand as the room hushes.

                           LANDON
          Come on.

                           JAMIE
          Where?

                        LANDON
          Away from here.


EXT. FIRE TOWER (CONSERVATION LAND) - STAIRS - HOUR LATER

Landon leads Jamie up, round and round, to the top of the
tall steel tower.

                                                            76.

EXT. TOP OF TOWER - VIEWING AREA

They exit the staircase to a small 360 degree overlook.
Jamie's amazed at the view.

                        JAMIE
          How do you know this place?

                        LANDON
          Before the divorce. My father
          used to take me here. Fire
          spotting was his summer job.

They look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets
sky.

                         LANDON
          From here he proved to me the
          earth isn't flat.
                  (beat)
          On rainy days, we'd be above the
          clouds.

                        JAMIE
          What would you do up here?

                          LANDON
          Look.   Talk.   Not talk.

He pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket. They sit
and he starts to shuffle. Not too well. Jamie takes the
deck. Shuffles like a card shark.


EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT (FEW DAYS LATER)

Jamie is already waiting when Landon's Yugo pulls up.       He
gets out, walks to her, they kiss.

                        LANDON
          What'd you tell your father?

                         JAMIE
          The truth.   I just left you out of
          it.

She climbs up and over the wall.      He follows.


EXT. INSIDE CEMETERY - MINUTES LATER

Jamie fits the pieces of her telescope together.

                        LANDON
          When did you build this?

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            77.

CONTINUED:

                              JAMIE
             I was twelve.

Landon shakes his head, amazed.

                           JAMIE
             It's not that complicated.

Landon doubts this.

                           JAMIE
             It's an alt-azimuth design with
             one parabolic mirror and one
             secondary flat one.

                           LANDON
             Where's the one you're building?

                           JAMIE
             In my back yard.
                    (pause, embarrassed)
             I lied before. It's hardly
             started. But when it's done, it
             will have twice the power of this
             one --

                              LANDON
             Wait, back up.     You lied?

                              JAMIE
             Kinda.   Yeah.

He grins, loving her even more.

                           JAMIE
             So what do you want to see?

                              LANDON
             Mars.

                           JAMIE
             Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
             A.M. --

He opens his backpack.        Pulls out the contents.

                           LANDON
             A Thermos of hot coffee.       A
             blanket. Socks.

                           JAMIE
             You planned this --

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             78.

CONTINUED:

                             LANDON
             Hoped for it.

Pause.

                           JAMIE
             Are you trying to seduce me?

                             LANDON
             No.   Why?   Are you seducible?

                            JAMIE
                     (firm, but smiling)
             No.

                           LANDON
             That's what I thought.

He reaches back into his backpack.      Pulls out a second
blanket.

                           LANDON
             Ergo, a second blanket.   One for
             me, one for you.

He hands her one.     She takes it, smiling, reassured.

                             JAMIE
             Ergo?

                           LANDON
                    (slightly embarrassed)
             What about your father?

                           JAMIE
             I'm always home by midnight and
             he's always asleep.


INT. PARSONAGE - REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT

Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed.      His feet find slippers
on the floor.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Reverend Sullivan, wearing a robe, enters quietly.
Checking on his daughter. Her bed is empty.


EXT. STREET TO ACCESS ROAD - LATER

The old Pontiac slows.

                                                      79.

INT. OLD PONTIAC

Reverend Sullivan looks down the access road to the rear
cemetery gate.


REVEREND'S POV

The Yugo parked by the gate.


BACK TO SCENE

The Reverend struggles with what to do. After a moment,
he decides not to interfere; he'll pick his moment. He
keeps driving.


INT. CEMETERY

Jamie and Landon are looking at the heavens through the
telescope.

                           LANDON
          Where's Pluto?

                        JAMIE
          In Virgo, but it's about 1000
          times too faint to see.

                        LANDON
          What's the best thing I can see
          tonight?

                           JAMIE
          Me.

He draws her close, they kiss. She shyly pulls away.
Their hands still touching until she looks again into the
telescope eyepiece.

                        JAMIE
          The second best thing is Jupiter.

She swivels the telescope into position for Jupiter and
steps aside so he can look. But he picks up the
flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket.

                        LANDON
          Can you locate XXI5639I?

                           JAMIE
          Sure.

She takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope.

                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                              80.

CONTINUED:

                            JAMIE
             Here.   Why am I looking at this
             star?

                            LANDON
             Because I had it named for you.     I
             know it's not an official
             designation --

She couldn't be happier.     She reaches for his hand.

                           JAMIE
             It's wonderful. I love you.

It's the first time he's heard it. He pulls her into his
arms. They kiss. Passionately. She starts to object.

                            LANDON
                     (respecting her
                      boundaries)
             Okay.   I'm stopping.

And he does.    They snuggle.   Silence, then:

                           LANDON
             What's number one?

Long pause.

                           JAMIE
                    (very shy)
             In April when the dogwoods and
             wisteria are blooming... Get
             married.

He doesn't make fun.     He strokes her hair.    Kisses her
forehead.


INT. KITCHEN - 5 AM

Landon enters from outside. Cynthia, still in her
waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking
coffee.

                           CYNTHIA
             A late night or an early morning?

                           LANDON
                    (honest)
             Late night.
                    (smart-aleck)
             You?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           81.

CONTINUED:

                           CYNTHIA
             Were you with Jamie?

                           LANDON
             Yeah.

                           CYNTHIA
             You sleeping with her?

Landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer.

                           CYNTHIA
             I was cleaning yesterday.   I found
             this.

She pulls Landon's Life List from her pocket.      Landon is
horrified. She reads it.

                            CYNTHIA
             Scuba dive. Touch a moon rock.
             Learn to read Egyptian
             hieroglyphs. Go to college?
                    (pause)
             She talking to you 'bout this
             stuff?

Landon doesn't answer. She puts the list on the table.
Smoothes it. Gently discouraging.

                           CYNTHIA
             Honey, some of this is...
             farfetched. You take after me.
             People skills and common sense.
             Good dependable qualities.

                           LANDON
             I could take after Dad, too.

                          CYNTHIA
             You do. You're handsome and
             charming.

                           LANDON
             I meant he's a doctor.

                           CYNTHIA
             That's eight years of school and
             training -- after college. And
             all that doesn't necessarily make
             you a better human being.

                           LANDON
             I could do it if I tried.   Even
             Kelly thinks so.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          82.

CONTINUED:

                           CYNTHIA
             That'd be something.

She doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to
be practical and realistic.

                           CYNTHIA
             But if it doesn't happen, grab for
             something within reach. Life's
             tough enough without causing
             yourself disappointment --

                           LANDON
                    (angry now)
             Whatever my life is, I'm going to
             be friggin' sure I'm never
             disappointed --

                           CYNTHIA
                    (honest)
             Disappointment isn't something
             anyone plans for.
                    (quieter)
             It catches you by surprise.

Long pause.    They are both sorry to have raised their
voices.

                           CYNTHIA
             Have I told you how proud I am of
             you -- ?

                           LANDON
             Mom, great. But what I want is
             for me to be proud of me.


INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN DINING ROOM - EVENING

Landon eats dinner with Jamie and Reverend Sullivan.
Silence, then:

                            REV. SULLIVAN
             Landon.   You're not the quiet
             type.

                            LANDON
             No.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             So talk to us about something.

                           LANDON
             Like what, sir?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           83.

CONTINUED:

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You decide.

Landon searches his mind for just the right subject.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             How about your family?

                            LANDON
             Okay.  Sure.
                    (beat)
             My grandfather. When he was
             seven, he shook the hand of an old
             guy, a war vet or something, who
             had once shaken President
             Lincoln's hand.
                    (pause)
             Made a big impression on him.

Reverend Sullivan looks at his daughter.       She's nodding,
interested.

                           LANDON
             My cousin Mike. He's from a big
             family. He's the fifth kid. He
             heard that every fifth child in
             the world is Chinese. So he
             thought he was.

Jamie smiles.

                           LANDON
             We didn't tell him any different
             for years --

                            REV. SULLIVAN
                    (getting to the
                     point)
             Your parents are divorced?

                           LANDON
             Since I was five. My mom's a
             cocktail waitress.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             How do you -- the two of you --
             get by?

                           LANDON
             Materially or spiritually?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
                    (surprised)
             Either. Both.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           84.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
                    (honest)
             I don't know. We used to try to
             believe in each other.

His eyes meet the Reverend's.      The Reverend's got to
respect him some.


INT. SULLIVAN KITCHEN - NIGHT

Reverend Sullivan looks out the window into the back yard.


HIS POV

Jamie showing Landon the junk pile that will become her
newer, larger telescope. They are laughing, jostling each
other, comfortable, happy.


INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Reverend Sullivan and Jamie put the dishes away.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You and the Carter boy. Want to
             catch me up on recent
             developments?

                           JAMIE
             You're asking if we're involved?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             I'm asking how much.

                           JAMIE
             Dad --

                            REV. SULLIVAN
             It's time to tell him.
                    (pause)
             It would be the right thing.

She turns to him, upset.    Her anger spilling out.

                           JAMIE
             Maybe. But that's not the real
             reason. You think if I tell,
             he'll disappear and that's what
             you want! Me all to yourself!

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           85.

CONTINUED:

                            REV. SULLIVAN
                     (calm, stung)
             No.   I want what's best for you.

                           JAMIE
             This -- him -- Landon -- is what's
             best for me!

                             REV. SULLIVAN
             You're sure?    You're sure you can
             trust him?

He's playing to her old insecurities.      She's not one
hundred percent sure.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
                    (gentler)
             Isn't it better to know?

Their eyes meet.     She knows he's right.


EXT. MOVIE THEATER - EVENING (EARLY FEBRUARY)

Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Three Amigos! on the marquee.

Landon and Jamie exit as Belinda and a new boyfriend buy
tickets. Clay and Eric and a crowd behind them.

                             LANDON
             Hey, Belinda.

She takes her boyfriend's arm, turns away, snubbing him.

                             LANDON
             Clay, Eric.

Eric says something inaudible and the whole crowd sniggers
and laughs. He's become Landon. Landon reddens, now
realizing for certain that he's become a Jamie Sullivan.


EXT. SIDEWALK (DOWNTOWN BEAUFORT) - MOMENTS LATER

Landon and Jamie walk.       The theater in the b.g.

                           JAMIE
                    (re: his status)
             From citizen high to citizen low.

                             LANDON
             I don't care.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            86.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             Care, but just don't let it get to
             you. It gives them power.

                           LANDON
             That what you do?

                            JAMIE
             Yes.   I try to keep my power.

He's impressed with how she manages.

                           LANDON
             One of your secrets.

                           JAMIE
                    (serious)
             Yes, one of many.

He doesn't notice her tone.


INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT

WHITNEY HOUSTON's "How Will I Know?" ON the RADIO. Jamie
flips the RADIO OFF. She's got something on her mind.
Landon notices only that she seems a bit remote.

                           LANDON
             You're worried about your college
             applications.

                           JAMIE
             I'm not applying to college.

                           LANDON
                    (stunned)
             But you said --

                           JAMIE
             No, you assumed.

He looks at her, questioning.       She's looking out her
window.

                           LANDON
             You're going to take a year off?
             Join the Peace Corps -- ?

                            JAMIE
             No.

                           LANDON
             What are you going to -- ?

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              87.

CONTINUED:

                              JAMIE
             Pull over.

                              LANDON
             Where?   Why?

                            JAMIE
             Pull over.   Now. Please.

Tears are running down her face.        He pulls the car over.


EXT. WOODS BY SIDE OF ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie gets out of the car.       Landon quickly follows.

                              LANDON
             Jamie --

                              JAMIE
             I'm sick.

                           LANDON
             Then I'll take you home.      You'll
             feel better tomorrow.

He tries to take her arm. She shakes off his hand, steps
back. Wanting to be heard and understood.

                          JAMIE
             Landon. I'm sick -- with
             leukemia.

Landon tries to say something.         Nothing comes out.   His
soul numb.

                           JAMIE
             I found out last winter. I'm not
             responding to treatment anymore.

His face crumples with pain and anguish.

                           LANDON
             Why didn't you tell me?

                            JAMIE
             The doctors said to do everything
             the same as long as possible.
                    (pause)
             I didn't want anyone being --
             weird around me.

                              LANDON
             Including me?!

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            88.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             Especially you.
                    (long beat)
             God gives me an illness, then you.
             A cruel joke.

She gets in the car. Slams her door shut.       He stands
there, not knowing what to do.


EXT. YUGO - TRAVELING - LATER

Landon pulls up in front of Jamie's house.      A long quiet
ride.

                           LANDON
             I'm not letting you die.

Jamie just looks at him.    Feeling sorry for him -- what he
wants doesn't matter.


INT. SULLIVAN KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT

The Reverend and Landon drink coffee.

                            REV. SULLIVAN
             It's her decision and she's
             decided not to tell people -- at
             least for now.

                           LANDON
             How -- how long does she have?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Two, three months. Maybe less.
             Maybe more.

                           LANDON
             So you've given up.

Reverend Sullivan hears the challenge in his voice.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Her doctors have. Jamie and I.
             We're still praying for a miracle.

                           LANDON
                    (disdainful)
             Praying.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Landon. We've lived with this for
             over a year now and --

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                      89.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             If there is a God, how could he
             let this happen??!!

It's a long answer and by the time the Reverend opens his
mouth to explain, Landon's out the door.


EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Moonless dark. Few cars. The YUGO RIPS down the road.
Landon opens a map over the steering wheel. Turns on the
dome light. Looks at the return address on an old letter.


EXT. CITY STREETS (RALEIGH) - 3 A.M.

Landon's Yugo winds through city streets.


EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD (RALEIGH) - MINUTES LATER

Mansions. Big lawns. The Yugo slows as Landon leans
forward to read a street sign. His face is tear-streaked.
He flicks his headlights to bright, then low again.

The car turns left.


EXT. DR. CARTER'S HOME - MINUTE LATER

Large new colonial. Landon slams his car door and stands
in the street. Staring at his father's house. He heads
up a flagstone path for the front door.


EXT. FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER

Landon RINGS the resounding DING-DONG BELL, then bangs on
the heavy wood door. Grief-stricken.

                           LANDON
             Dr. Carter!... Carter!... Dad!
             Please!! I have to talk to you!!


INT. DR. CARTER'S HOME

Elegant, thick carpets. Dr. Carter, putting on his robe,
parts the silk drapes in the upstairs hall.

                                                         90.

DR. CARTER'S POV

His son standing on the front lawn.     Distraught, tearful.

                           LANDON
          Open the door!     Please!!


EXT. DR. CARTER'S HOME

Landon backs away from the house. Angrily kicks over a
decorative planter. Is halfway to his car when Dr. Carter
opens the door and comes out.

                           DR. CARTER
          Landon!

Landon doesn't hear.

                           DR. CARTER
          Landon!!

Landon turns around. Sees his father. Breaks down,
sobbing. His father goes to him. Hugs him, a big bear
hug.

                        LANDON
          You have to save her!

                         DR. CARTER
          Landon, who?   Is your mother all
          right?

Lights pop upstairs.

                        LANDON
          It's Jamie -- my girlfriend -- she
          has cancer -- you have to come
          look at her -- right now!

                        DR. CARTER
                 (calm, trying to
                  diffuse)
          It's the middle of the night --

                        LANDON
          I don't give a shit what time it
          is!

Landon pulls away.   Angrier.

                        DR. CARTER
          Landon, I'm a cardiologist, not an
          oncologist --

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             91.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             You're a doctor, aren't you?!!

He waves his father off, dismissing him.

                            DR. CARTER
             Landon!   I'll look into it!!

But Landon hasn't heard. He's in his car. Dr. Carter
watches his son's car move away, regretful.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN - DAWN

Landon quietly shuts the back door.        Exhausted.   Starts
making coffee. Cynthia appears.

                           CYNTHIA
             Your father called.

No response.

                           CYNTHIA
             Jamie's a patient at his hospital.
             He's having a colleague look at
             her chart this morning.

Long pause.

                            CYNTHIA
             I'm sorry.   I didn't know.

                           LANDON
             I didn't know either.


EXT. PARSONAGE - EARLY MORNING

The Yugo parked in the driveway. The morning paper lying
on the grass. Landon paces in front of the front porch.
Incapable of ringing the bell, lacking the courage,
lacking the right words.

Upstairs, the curtains move.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM

Jamie looks out the window.


JAMIE'S POV

Landon pacing, talking to himself.

                                                        92.

BACK TO SCENE

She starts to raise the window, to say something, to help
him, but then lets the curtain drop. She needs for him to
decide, for him to be ready to face this with her.

The sound of a CAR.   She looks out the window again.


JAMIE'S POV

The Yugo driving away.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Landon lies on his bed in the dark. The PHONE RINGS.
Landon stares at his extension. The RINGING STOPS. A
voice from downstairs.

                        CYNTHIA (O.S.)
          It's your father.

Landon picks up his phone.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - TWO MINUTES LATER

The door to Landon's room is ajar. Cynthia waits outside.
Listening. Hearing nothing. She pushes the door open.


CYNTHIA'S POV

Landon sitting on his bed.   Deflated.

                        LANDON
          He can't do anything.


BACK TO SCENE

Cynthia is pained to see his suffering.

                        CYNTHIA
          If it's incurable --

                        LANDON
          I told him to leave me alone.

                         CYNTHIA
          Landon --

                        LANDON
                 (re: Jamie)
          It was the only thing I've ever
          asked him!

                                                        93.

INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - EVENING (NEXT DAY)

Landon's still in bed. Facing the wall.     Cynthia KNOCKS.
Enters with a plate of food.

                        CYNTHIA
          I brought some dinner.

No response.   She leaves the tray and goes.


INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Jamie and her father eat dinner.   Jamie is red-eyed,
heartbroken.

                        JAMIE
                 (not sure at all)
          He'll call.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          I wanted to think he'd changed.

                          JAMIE
                  (angry)
          No you didn't.
                  (beat)
          But he did change. Just not
          enough.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          Jamie, you're not mad at me.
          You're mad at Landon --

                        JAMIE
                 (furious)
          I am mad at you! And at Landon!
          And the universe! And God!
                 (quieter)
          I don't even know where to put all
          my anger.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          That's normal. God accepts your
          anger. He won't punish you.

                        JAMIE
          By making me ill, he is punishing
          me!
                 (quieter)
          I just don't know what for.

She flees the room.

                                                         94.

ANOTHER ANGLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Goes up the stairs.    Keeps going.   Up another flight to
the attic.


INT. PARSONAGE ATTIC - MINUTE LATER

Jamie opens a closet door. Pulls out a dress, a scarf,
jewelry, a worn book -- her mother's belongings. She
opens the book and starts to weep. Missing her mother.


FOOT OF ATTIC STAIRS

Reverend Sullivan stands, looking up at the attic stairs.
Frustrated, angry, worried.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY

Landon is still in bed. Cynthia enters.      Pulls back the
curtains. Yanks up the shades.

                         CYNTHIA
           I don't care if you don't leave
           the house. But you have to get
           out of bed.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN - FEW MINUTES LATER

Landon sits at the kitchen table.     Cynthia pours him a cup
of coffee.

                         CYNTHIA
           You and I may not be communicating
           very well right now. But let me
           be clear. Don't make this about
           you. It's about her.

Pause.   Her words sink in.

                         LANDON
           I have no idea what to say. How
           to act. What if I do the wrong
           thing?

                         CYNTHIA
                  (gently)
           Be yourself and I don't think
           there is a wrong thing.
                  (beat)
           Let Jamie take the lead. She'll
           let you know what she needs.

                                                         95.

EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - LITTLE LATER

Before Landon can ring the bell, the front door opens.
The Reverend. Landon runs past him into the house.

                        LANDON
          Where's Jamie?!

                          REV. SULLIVAN
          At school.    Where you should be.

Oh.


INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - HALF HOUR LATER

Deserted, classes are meeting. Landon runs, sliding to a
stop at one classroom door. Looks in, keeps going, stops
at another. Searching.


This is JAMIE'S POV from the top of the hallway.


JAMIE

She stands, holding her books, watching him, unsure.


LANDON

finally feels her gaze, turns to look.


JAMIE

turns away, still angry and disappointed.


LANDON

runs to her.

                          LANDON
          Jamie!

He catches up to her.


JAMIE AND LANDON

face each other.   Neither sure what to say.

                          LANDON
          I'm so sorry.    I'm a coward --

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                      96.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
             I should have told you sooner --

                           LANDON
                    (guilt-ridden)
             I made you do too many things,
             kept you up all night --

                           JAMIE
             No. The drugs just stopped
             working. If anything, doing
             things I love kept me healthy
             longer.

Pause.

                           LANDON
             Are you frightened?

                           JAMIE
             All the time.
                    (beat)
             I feel like I have no one.

She means not even God and he gets this.

                            LANDON
             You have me.

He hugs her close, rocking her, comforting her and
himself.

                           JAMIE
             Help me live until I die?

                            LANDON
             I will.


INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - EVENING (MID-FEBRUARY)

A small group of students sit on stage reading from Our
Town, rehearsing. Jamie and Landon sit together in the
third row, holding hands. Landon glances at her, realizes
she's asleep. Pulls her sweater over her.


INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING

Landon sits with Luis; Jamie at the next table with
Isabel. She looks pale. He catches her eye. They both
smile, a little sadly, then turn back to their students.

                                                           97.

INT. YUGO - TRAVELING

Landon drives them home from Jefferson High.      No music.

                          LANDON
            They're going to build a tunnel
            under the English Channel.
            They're calling it The Chunnel.

No response.

                           LANDON
            You hungry?

                           JAMIE
            Nope.

                          LANDON
            Anything you want.

                           JAMIE
            Nothing.

He reaches into a cooler on the floor of the back seat.

                         LANDON
            Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt?     You
            like yogurt.

                          JAMIE
            I used to like yogurt.

He places a red heart-shaped box in her lap.

                          LANDON
                   (apologetic)
            Not very original. Happy
            Valentine's Day.

He grins.   She looks crestfallen, feels terrible.

                          JAMIE
            I didn't even think about it.

He takes a chocolate.     Pops it in his mouth.   Grins.

                           LANDON
            There.   You gave me a chocolate.


LANDON'S POV (THROUGH JAMIE'S TELESCOPE) - VAST STAR
FIELD

PULL BACK to reveal...

                                                           98.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Jamie and Landon are looking at stars.      A long quiet
moment.

                          LANDON
            What are you thinking?

                          JAMIE
                   (honest)
            That I want you to take me home.

                            LANDON
            Now?    We just --

                          JAMIE
            I don't want to come here anymore.

She begins taking the telescope apart.      Depressed.


EXT. CEMETERY GATE - HALF HOUR LATER

Jamie looks at the high fence, weary, then reaches into a
pocket for a key. Unlocks the gate. Swings the gate
open. Landon's astonished.

                          LANDON
            You have a key?

                           JAMIE
            Yeah.  I've just never needed it.
                   (pause)
            Will you talk to my father?

                          LANDON
            I've talked to your father.

                          JAMIE
            That's what I mean.

Their eyes meet.     Her look is serious.


EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - NEXT DAY

Reverend Sullivan is up a ladder. Cleaning a gutter.
Landon stands below, a few feet away, gathering his nerve.
He walks over.


ON LADDER

The Reverend is busy ignoring Landon standing below.       A
long beat, then:

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           99.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
                    (calling up)
             Sir. Being ignored is beginning
             to feel preferable to being
             noticed.

The Reverend looks down.

                            LANDON
             I'll be honest. I don't know if I
             can pray, but I can do just about
             anything else.

Neither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the
house and walk over.


ON GROUND

Landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend
better.

                           LANDON
             Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie
             needs. I'm here.
                    (beat)
             I could start by driving her to
             school --

                           JAMIE
             I'm not going back to school.

Landon and her father both turn to her.      Pale, wane.   They
understand what she is saying.

                           JAMIE
             You can tell anyone you want.   I
             don't care.

She goes into the house. Landon and Reverend Sullivan
look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. That didn't
sound like her.


INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING

Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out
Jamie's locker.

Students stare as he carefully places her things,
including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag. They part
and hush as he passes by. News travels fast. Clay and
Eric step forward.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            100.

CONTINUED:

                              CLAY
             Hey.   Landon.

                           ERIC
             We heard 'bout Jamie Sullivan.
             She --

                           LANDON
                    (fierce)
             Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.

                             ERIC
                      (misunderstood,
                       genuine)
             No.    Hey. We're sorry, man!

Landon turns back. Surprised.        Inspects Belinda.   Eric.
Clay. Others. No one speaks.

                           LANDON
             Too late and not enough.

He pushes past Belinda's new boyfriend, heading for the
office.


INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - DAY

Mr. Kelly and Landon.

                           LANDON
             I know it means not graduating,
             but I need to be excused from all
             school acti--

                           MR. KELLY
             You're excused.

Landon heads for the door.

                              MR. KELLY
             How is she?

Landon can't answer.       Too emotional.

                           MR. KELLY
             You will graduate.

Landon looks up, astounded.

                           MR. KELLY
             If I have to tutor you myself.

Landon nods, accepting, appreciative.

                                                         101.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - LATER

Landon puts away the contents of the shopping bag.
Jamie's in bed, wearing the sweater.

                        JAMIE
          Yesterday I felt sick, horrible.
          Today I feel like riding my bike.
          Or dancing.

He turns on the CLOCK RADIO next to her bed. Finds a
WALTZ. Offers his hand. Pulls her out of bed. She's in
pajamas.

                        JAMIE
          You know how to waltz??

                        LANDON
                 (bashful)
          I was going to fake it.

                        JAMIE
          I always fake it.

So they waltz, faking, stumbling and laughing, holding
each other.


INT. PARSONAGE - STAIRCASE - SAME TIME

Reverend Sullivan hears the MUSIC and LAUGHTER.   He
frowns, afraid for Jamie's health.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM

Jamie grips Landon's arms, seems to slip, suddenly too
exhausted to carry her weight. Landon picks her up,
gently carries her back to bed. Settles her in.

                           LANDON
          How you doing?

                          JAMIE
                   (murmurs)
          Tired.

Landon sits on her bed. Strokes her hair. They look at
each other. Landon reaches for her hand. When he looks
at her face again, she's asleep.


EXT. LANDON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - ANOTHER DAY

Landon's sitting on his childhood tree swing, twisting
side to side. Pensive. His mother comes out of the
house.
                                              (CONTINUED)

                                                           102.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             Time seems to be slowing down and
             speeding up at the same time.

She reaches to put a hand on his shoulder.       He lets her.


EXT. CEMETERY - EARLY MARCH

The rear gate is open. A caretaker waits while Landon
carries pieces of the older telescope to his car. A tall
pile of parts is already at his car.

Eric and Clay drive up in Eric's pickup.    Gravel flying.
MUSIC BLASTING.


INT. PICKUP

Eric and Clay spy Landon.


EXT. CEMETERY

Landon freezes, not sure what to expect.


EXT. PICKUP

The truck makes a circle around Landon, then stops. The
MUSIC QUIETS. Eric and Clay jump down. A long tense
moment, then:

                           ERIC
             Hey.

                           LANDON
             Hey.

Without a word, Clay walks to the Yugo, lifts the heaviest
telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup.
Eric follows suit.


EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - LATER

Landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how
they fit together. They are like a map for how to build
the bigger one.


EXT. PARSONAGE DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY

Landon unloads an impossibly large round cardboard
concrete form-tube from his car. Carries it around the
house toward the back yard.

                                                         103.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Jamie wakes from a nap. She looks thinner, grayer. She
hears HAMMERING. She hauls herself up and to a window.


JAMIE'S POV

Landon working on the new telescope.    He looks up at her
window. Sees her there. Smiles.


BACK TO SCENE

Reverend Sullivan comes in to check on Jamie.    She's
standing at the window.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          What's that boy doing?

She turns to look at him and collapses into his arms.


INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT

Jamie lies in bed, eyes closed. Hooked to monitors,
pumps, an IV drip. Landon holding her hand. Reverend
Sullivan talks quietly with a doctor. Hearing bad news.


EXT. HOSPITAL - DAWN

The sky is pink. A squirrel runs along a telephone wire.
The Yugo is the only car in the visitor lot.


INT. PATIENT ROOM

Landon, in yesterday's clothes, dozes lightly. Jamie
moves and he starts, fully awake. She opens her eyes.

                        LANDON
          You okay?

She nods. Sleepy. Closes her eyes again. He rests his
head on her shoulder and weeps. Her eyes open, then close
again. There's nothing to say.


INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE JAMIE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Reverend Sullivan looks through the window in the door at
the scene within. He hesitates, then pushes the door
open.

                                                           104.

INT. PATIENT ROOM

Reverend Sullivan enters.

                         REV. SULLIVAN
          Landon.   You go on home.

                           LANDON
          I'm not tired.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          I need to be with her.

There's only one chair.    Landon nods and goes.

The Reverend sits, closes his eyes a moment.   When he
opens them, she's looking at him.

                           JAMIE
          Dad.

He kisses her forehead, then sits back.

                           JAMIE
          So serious.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          Jamie, God is not punishing you.
          No God I know wants anyone to be
          sick or feel pain or suffer.

Pause.

                        JAMIE
          When Mom died you told me God
          wanted her more, loved her more --

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          I was wrong. Nobody could have
          wanted or loved your mother more
          than we did. Not even God.

He lets this sink in.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          God loaned you to me, entrusted
          you to my care. I'm failing you.

She looks away, agreeing without saying so.

                        REV. SULLIVAN
          Jamie. I make you the same
          promise that God does.
                 (beat)
          I will always be with you.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          105.

CONTINUED:

She sits up and embraces him. He wraps his arms around
her. Tight. She closes her eyes, tears welling, never
wanting to let him go. Her father.


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH SCHOOL - HOUR LATER

On the marquee on the front lawn: "WELCOME HALEY'S
COMET." The Yugo parks in the b.g.


INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

Landon picks up a pile of books and assignments.
Looks through them, then eyes Miss Tarbox.

                           LANDON
             Where's Jamie's book?!

                           MISS TARBOX
             That's everything Mr. Kelly gave
             me.

                           LANDON
                    (insistent)
             The next book on that list!   The
             Old Man and... and...

                            MISS TARBOX
             The Sea.

                            LANDON
             Yeah.   I need it today!

Mr. Kelly steps out of his inner office.      Sees Landon's
anguished face, his exhaustion.

                           MR. KELLY
             I'll drive a copy over to her.

Landon nods his appreciation.


INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY

Jamie looks smaller. Her eyes have blue circles beneath.
The Hemingway novel on the bedstand. Belinda pushes the
door open. Peeks in. Not sure she is welcome.

Landon is sitting in a chair.     He sees her, motions for
her to come in. Quietly.

                            BELINDA
             She asleep?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              106.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             I'll tell her you were here.

Pause.   Awkwardness.

                           BELINDA
             Give her this, okay?

She hands Landon a small photo album.

                           BELINDA
             Pictures from the play.   Jamie
             looks pretty --

                           LANDON
             I'm sorry about how we --

                             BELINDA
                      (conciliatory)
             No.    You're with who you should
             be.    It's like she chose you.

                           LANDON
                    (agreeing)
             And I have no idea why.

                             BELINDA
             I do.

She hugs him quickly, then leaves.       Landon goes to the
window, looks out.


SAME SCENE - HOURS LATER

The sky is grayer, darker.      Landon is still at the window.
Jamie wakes.

                             JAMIE
             Hi.

He goes to her side.

                             LANDON
             Hey.

He kisses her.

                           JAMIE
             I have something for you.

She reaches under her pillow for the worn book from the
attic. She offers it to Landon.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                           107.

CONTINUED:

                           JAMIE
                    (smiling)
             Don't worry. It's not a Bible.

He takes it.

                           JAMIE
             My mother made it for me before I
             was born.
                    (beat)
             It's got quotes from famous
             people. Her favorite lines from
             books. Her thoughts.

Landon looks at a page.

                           LANDON
                    (reading)
             'What is a friend? A single soul
             dwelling in two bodies.'
             Aristotle.

                            JAMIE
             Lower.   Same page.

                           LANDON
                    (reading)
             'Find out who you are and do it on
             purpose.' Dolly Parton.

A bookmark falls out.     He studies that page a moment.


CLOSE ON PASSAGE

from Corinthians.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon reads it.

                            LANDON
             'Love is always patient and kind.
             It is never boastful or
             conceited -- '

                           JAMIE
             That was read at my parents'
             wedding.

He takes her hand.     Holds it.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           108.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             How're you doing?

                           JAMIE
                    (looking away)
             Better. I was really angry.

                              LANDON
             I know.

                              JAMIE
             It's gone now.

                           LANDON
                    (gently)
             Because you have hope that you'll
             get better?

                              JAMIE
             No.
                     (pause, shrugging,
                      accepting)
             Maybe I believe God has a bigger
             dream for me than I had for
             myself.
                     (beat)
             Maybe I believe the journey, the
             big adventure, never ends...

He kneels on the floor.       Puts his head on her pillow next
to hers.

                           JAMIE
             Maybe I believe God sent you to me
             because I am ill. To help me
             through.

He touches her face tenderly.

                           JAMIE
                    (almost whispering)
             I want to go home.

Pause.   He gets her meaning.

                            LANDON
                    (trying not to
                     break)
             I'll talk to your father.

                            JAMIE
                    (looking away)
             It's not that simple.
                    (pause)
             It costs money to do this at home.

                                                       109.

INT. CARTER LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Cynthia pacing, talking on the phone, worried.   The front
door is wide open.

                        CYNTHIA
                 (into phone)
          ... He doesn't talk to me, maybe
          not to anyone, except Jamie...

She stands in the doorway and looks out.


CYNTHIA'S POV

Landon in his car in the driveway.


INT. LANDON'S CAR

Landon just sits.    Exhausted, despondent.


INT. CARTER LIVING ROOM

Cynthia pacing.

                        CYNTHIA
                 (into phone)
          ... I've never asked you for
          extra. But we need it now... as
          soon as possible...


INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - ANOTHER AFTERNOON

Jamie's breathing is shallower. Landon's reading her The
Sheltering Sky. He pauses, looks up. Isabel, Jamie's
student, is standing in the doorway. Jamie sees her too.
She smiles weakly.

                            JAMIE
          Isabel?

                            ISABEL
                    (shy)
          Hi.

Isabel comes in. Landon offers her the book. She takes
it and keeps going from where Landon left off. Stumbling
but reading. Jamie grins.

                        JAMIE
          Who's been working with you?

Isabel looks shyly at Landon. Jamie shakes her head,
amazed. Landon nods to Isabel and she begins reading
again.

                                                         110.

EXT. CARTER BACK STEPS - THAT NIGHT

Landon quietly opens the back door to the kitchen.


HIS POV

Cynthia sits at the table with Dr. Carter, his father.

                        CYNTHIA
          Sit with us a minute.


INT. CARTER KITCHEN

Landon enters, but doesn't sit.

                        LANDON
                 (to his father)
          What are you doing here?

                        CYNTHIA
          He wants to talk to you.

                         LANDON
                 (to his mother)
          Now it's okay?

                        CYNTHIA
          Landon. You have two parents.
          We're both here for you even --

                         DR. CARTER
          -- even if we're not here for each
          other anymore.

Landon is listening.

                        DR. CARTER
          I want to do this. Please let me.

He holds out a check.   For a lot of money.   Landon takes
it. Grateful.

                        LANDON
                 (quietly, to both
                  parents)
          Thank you.


INT. PARSONAGE - JAMIE'S BEDROOM - DAY

A smaller Jamie lies in a hospital bed, seemingly asleep.
Hooked to an IV. Bottles of pills. Landon dozes in a
comfortable chair. A nurse sits in a corner, reading.

                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                            111.

CONTINUED:

Eric and Clay stand in the doorway, not sure what to do.
Jamie opens her eyes, smiles.

                           JAMIE
             Don't wake Landon.

They tiptoe in.    Stand on either side of her bed.

                           JAMIE
             Do I look scary?

                              ERIC
             Not too bad.

                              CLAY
             You all right?

A dumb question but she handles it well.

                           JAMIE
                    (smiling)
             Things could be better.

Awkward pause.

                           CLAY
             We thought you'd be asleep --

                           JAMIE
                    (trying to help)
             I don't know what to say either.

Clay hands her an envelope.

                              JAMIE
             What is it?

She pulls out a stack of worn bills.

                            CLAY
             For the book drive.      Landon told
             us about it --

                           ERIC
             We told everyone at school.

Jamie takes their hands, holds them. Thanking them
silently. Her eyes shining with tears.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Landon sits at his desk, sketching the larger telescope,
making a few computations.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           112.

CONTINUED:

A library book on Haley's Comet is open.      A stack of
similar books by his elbow.

Cynthia enters wearing her waitressing outfit.

                              CYNTHIA
             What can I do?

He shrugs.    Tears fill his eyes.

                           LANDON
             Everything's being done but it's
             not enough. I have to find
             something -- more.

                           CYNTHIA
                    (gently)
             Landon, honey. There's nothing
             more.

                           LANDON
             I don't mean about Jamie being
             sick. I mean about Jamie and me.

                           CYNTHIA
             Be with her when she wants.    Make
             sure she never feels alone.

Landon thinks his mother is also talking about herself.

                           LANDON
             Mom, I'm not going anywhere.   Not
             yet anyway.

Pause.

                           CYNTHIA
             When you are ready, I want you to
             feel free to go.

They embrace.


INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATER

Landon opens Jamie's mother's book.     A photo of Jamie
falls out -- one taken by Belinda.


CLOSE ON PHOTO

Jamie, beautiful, smiling at the audience.

                                                       113.

LANDON

considers the photo, finds a page to tuck it into.


CLOSE ON HANDWRITTEN JOTTING

"For Landon" above some underlined text, a Psalm from the
Bible.

                        LANDON
                 (reading aloud)
          'I cry to you my Lord, my rock!
          Do not be deaf to me, for if you
          are silent, I shall go down to the
          pit like the rest. Hear my voice
          raised in petition as I cry to you
          for help, as I raise my hands, my
          Lord, toward your holy of holies.'

Landon knows Jamie underlined this for him.


INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Landon tears down the steps. Past his mother to the front
door. He's out the door before she even turns around.


INT. PARSONAGE - REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT

Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed. His feet find slippers
on the floor. He looks haggard, his hair thinner, his
face defeated.


INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The Reverend, wearing his robe, checks on his sleeping
daughter. The night nurse nods as he tucks in blankets.

A SOUND. Then another. Reverend Sullivan goes to the
window. Parts the drapes. Looks out.


HIS POV

A dozen flashlights in a big circle. Landon in the
middle, working feverishly on the new telescope.


EXT. BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

The back porch light comes on. Reverend Sullivan steps
out onto the back porch. Landon looks up.

                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                          114.

CONTINUED:

                            LANDON
                    (flushes, almost
                     manic)
             I have to finish it tonight.

Without a word, the Reverend turns around and goes back
inside. Leaving the porch light on. Landon goes back to
work.


EXT. BACK YARD - MINUTES LATER

Reverend Sullivan comes out. Dressed. He carries two
mugs of coffee and a brightly burning kerosene camp
lantern. Peace offerings.

He walks over, sets down the lantern, hands Landon a mug.
Ready to work.

                           LANDON
             I've almost finished the rocker.
             Did she order mirrors?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             In there.

As they walk to the garage.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You have materials for the side
             bearings?

                           LANDON
             I'm using an old phonographic
             turntable.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             For the focuser?

                           LANDON
             A chrome-plated brass pipe from a
             drain line.

The Reverend nods, impressed.    He yanks the garage door
up. Goes in.

                           LANDON
             You know about this stuff?

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             I helped Jamie with the first one.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         115.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
                    (surprised)
             I thought she built it herself.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             She did. But hardly anyone does
             anything truly alone.

The Reverend carries out a large cardboard postal package.
Landon takes it as the Reverend lowers the garage door.

                           LANDON
                    (serious)
             I need to do this alone.

Reverend Sullivan searches Landon's face for a long
moment, understanding, then turns and heads for the back
door.


INT. CHURCH - REVEREND'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING

Landon stands in the doorway. The Reverend is wiping his
glasses, his face, maybe of tears. He sees Landon.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You finish?

                            LANDON
             A few minutes ago. I have to ask
             you something.

Long pause.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             When I was seventeen, I was sent
             up for a year for stealing a car.
                    (beat)
             Sometimes I still feel that boy
             inside me and I don't like him.
                    (beat)
             But I like you.

The Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand.     Landon takes
it. The two men shake. Allies now.


INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING

Jamie opens her eyes. But can barely keep them open.
Groggy from pain medication. Landon's standing there.
Showered, clean clothes.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              116.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             We're going out.

He starts helping the nurse disconnect her IV.

                           JAMIE
             Can I -- go out?

                           LANDON
             You'll be fine for a few minutes.

Jamie looks at the nurse.    Uncertain.     The nurse nods.


EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF - NIGHT

Landon carries Jamie out a large attic window. The
finished large telescope is set up. Pointing at the sky.
She's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket.

                           JAMIE
                    (grateful, touching
                     it)
             It's beautiful... Thank you.

But she looks at the lights of the house and streets
around them.

                           JAMIE
             I don't know what we'll be able to
             see... Help me stand.

He checks his watch.

                           LANDON
             Wait a sec.

As she turns to him, questioning, the neighborhood
suddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every
nearby house are switched off.


EXT. DOWN STREET

Neighbors step outside.    Hold up binoculars.


EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - PARKING LOT

Members of the Star Club and other students look through
traditional telescopes.

                                                         117.

EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF

Jamie hugs Landon in gratitude.

                         LANDON
           We have five minutes.

Jamie, tears streaming, braces herself against Landon and
she peers into the telescope eyepiece. She pulls back,
wipes her eyes, then looks again. She swings the
telescope into the correct position.


HER POV THROUGH TELESCOPE

Haley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and
streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's
hazy head and long tail.

                         JAMIE (O.S.)
           The comet of the century...


BACK TO SCENE

She steps back so he can see. He looks quickly, then
moves aside so she can keep looking. She's completely
engrossed. A long, quiet moment, then:

                           LANDON
           You love me?

She leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes.

                         LANDON
           Will you do something for me?

                           JAMIE
           Landon.    I can't even do for
           myself.

                         LANDON
           But if you could, you would?

                           JAMIE
           Yes.

His throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear,
sadness, and love.

                         LANDON
           Will you marry me?

HER FACE

Illness, happiness, disbelief.

                                                          118.

EXT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - EARLY APRIL

A sea of pink, purple, and white blossoms.    Dogwoods,
wisteria, azaleas, and roses blooming.


INT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH

Bursting with everyone who knows Jamie and Landon -- every
kid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda;
teachers, including Ms. Garber; Mr. Kelly; Luis and Isabel
and others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation;
Cynthia Carter; Dr. Carter's new wife and their two kids;
neighbors; hospital staff and home nurses.

Landon stands with his father by the altar.

The "WEDDING MARCH" begins...

The double doors at the back of the church open. Everyone
turns to look at the bride. Gasps of joy and sadness.


LANDON'S POV - JAMIE

Flanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan. She's wearing
her Lizzie dress from the play. It hangs loosely, but
still becomes her. She's a beautiful bride.


BACK TO SCENE

Landon swells with pride.

Jamie smiles. Then, leaning on her father, she slowly
makes her way down the aisle.

In the pews -- few dry eyes follow her.

Jamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath.     A
moment later, she and her father continue.

A long, difficult walk.    A walk to remember.


AT ALTAR

The nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father
near.

Applause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side.

Jamie sits.   Exhausted.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                         119.

CONTINUED:

Landon kneels to be the same height as Jamie in her chair.

Pause.   Dr. Carter kneels.   Showing solidarity with his
son.

Reverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's
cheek. Trying to keep his emotions in check.


LANDON AND JAMIE'S POV

Reverend Sullivan towering over them.


BACK TO SCENE

Reverend Sullivan kneels, too.

Jamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's
hand in her left. Linking the three together.

The congregation silences.

Reverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible.     Struggling.

                            REV. SULLIVAN
             As a father, I'm supposed to give
             away my daughter. But I can no
             more give Jamie away than I can
             give away my heart. But I can let
             another share in the joy she has
             given me. May God's blessings be
             with you both.

He reaches out, offering a hand to Landon.     Completing the
circle.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Landon, repeat after me. Do you
             take...

As words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged, the
CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the faces of those at the altar --
Jamie, Landon, Dr. Carter.

TO the first row of the congregation -- Cynthia Carter,
Josh, Eric, Clay.

Then BACK row by row as the Reverend begins reading a
passage from the book Jamie's mother made for her. His
voice soft and melodious, like a poet reading his own
work.

                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              120.

CONTINUED:

                           REV. SULLIVAN (O.S.)
             'Love is always patient and kind.
             It is never jealous. Love is
             never boastful or conceited. It
             is never rude or selfish. It does
             not take offense and is not
             resentful. Love takes no pleasure
             in other people's sins, but
             delights in the truth. It is
             always ready to excuse, to trust,
             to hope, and to endure whatever
             comes...'

And the CAMERA MOVES OUT the double doors to find...


PARSONAGE

in a different season.      Winter.

UP the front steps and INTO...


LIVING ROOM (PRESENT DAY)

As it is now, in present day.

The nurse disappears, leaving Landon Carter, 33, waiting.
Looking at a framed photo of Jamie as Lizzie in The
Rainmaker...

The nurse returns, helping an old man as he shuffles in.
Reverend Sullivan. He's stooped, thin, balding. His skin
parchment thin.

The two men embrace.       Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You've been well?

                             LANDON
             Yes.   You?

                             REV. SULLIVAN
             Getting by.

Pause.   Why is he here?     The Reverend waits.

                           LANDON
                    (fumbling)
             I'm -- I'm returning something.

He twists the ring on his finger.      Removes it.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               121.

CONTINUED:

                           LANDON
             This belongs to you.

He gives his wedding ring to the Reverend.          Pause.   Landon
searches for something meaningful to say.

                            LANDON
             She taught me -- everything.     She
             saved my life.

The Reverend turns away, overcome with sadness.         Realizing
now why Landon has come.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             You're marrying again.

                             LANDON
             Yes.

                           REV. SULLIVAN
             Jamie wanted that. She told me.

Landon is grateful to know this.       He makes a move to go.
Then turns back.

                           LANDON
             I'm sorry she never got her
             miracle.

                             REV. SULLIVAN
             She did.    It was you.

Landon, deeply touched, embraces the old man again.
Warmly, fully. Two men still grieving, saying good-bye.

                           ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
             Jamie once said when you're
             feeling love, you're also feeling
             God.


EXT. NEUSE RIVER - THAT AFTERNOON

Landon walks alone.      His hair and clothing tousled by a
steady gentle wind.

                           ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
             She made me a believer. In love.
             In life. In the journey that
             never ends...

Landon stops.       Faces the wind.   Lets the air swirl over
him.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         122.

CONTINUED:

                           ADULT LANDON (V.O.)
             ... And in the mystery of all
             things you can't see but feel
             everywhere around you...

He closes his eyes.    She's there...

                                                 FADE OUT.

          EXT. SPACE
          
          FADE IN:
          
          Stars.
          The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays.
          
          "Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers..."
          
          More stars.
          Distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas...
          A single planet.
          Drab and brown.
          Moving towards it.
          Pushing through its polluted atmosphere.
          
          "...Close your eyes and see it glisten..."
          
          
          EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - CONTINUOUS
          
          A range of mountains takes form in the haze.
          Moving closer.
          The mountains are piles of TRASH.
          The entire surface is nothing but waste.
          
          "...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air..."
          
          A silhouetted city in the distance.
          What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash.
          Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high.
          Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues.
          They go on for miles.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH
          
          "...Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile..."
          
          Something moving on the ground far below.
          A figure at the foot of a trash heap.
          A SMALL SERVICE ROBOT diligently cubing trash.
          Rusted, ancient.
          Cute.
          Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting.
          
          Mini-shovel hands collect junk.
          Scoop it into his open chassis.
          His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste.
          A faded label on his corroded chest plate:
          "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E)
          
          Wall-E spits out a cube of trash.
          Stacks it with the others.
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          Something catches his eye.
          Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack.
          A hubcap.
          The sun reflects off it.
          Wall-E checks the sky.
          
          ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON
          
          The sun sets through the smoggy haze.
          
          "...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --"
          
          He places the hubcap in his compactor.
          Presses a button on his chest.
          The song stops playing.
          The end of a work day.
          
          Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back.
          Whistles for his pet COCKROACH.
          The insect hops on his shoulder.
          They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK
          
          Wall-E travels alone.
          Traverses miles of desolate waste.
          Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather.
          
          Passes haunting structures buried within the trash.
          Buildings, highways, entire cities...
          Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO.
          "Buy N Large"
          "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation!
          The corporation ran every aspect of life.
          There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate.
          
          CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over.
          Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!"
          The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!"
          A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile.
          
          Wall-E's old treads are threadbare.
          Practically falling apart.
          Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach.
          He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS.
          Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own...
          
          
          EXT. DESERTED STREET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Wall-E now sports the newer treads.
          Rolls past a SERIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS.
          The solar-powered ads still activate when he passes them.
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
          
                                     BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                               (Ad #1: BNL logo over trash)
                        Too much garbage in your face?
                               (Ad #2: starliner in space)
                        There's plenty of space out in space!
                               (Ad #3: starliners take off
                                from Earth)
                        BNL starliners leaving each day.
                               (Ad #4: WALL-E units wave
                                goodbye)
                        We'll clean up the mess while you're
                        away.
          
          
          EXT. EDGE OF THE CITY
          
          Wall-E drives down a deserted overpass.
          Activates an even LARGER HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARD.
          
          CLOSE ON BILLBOARD AD
          
          Shows off a CITY-SIZED LUXURY STARLINER.
          Depicts passengers enjoying all its amenities.
          
                                     BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        The jewel of the BNL fleet: "The Axiom".

                        "The Axiom". Putting the "star" in
                        Executive Starliner.
          
          The BNL CEO appears at the end.
          Waves goodbye as the Axiom takes off.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Because, at BNL, space is the final "fun"-
                        tier.
          
          The holographic billboard powers off.
          Reveals the AXIOM'S DESERTED LAUNCHPAD in the distance.
          The mammoth structure sits across the bay.
          Now empty and dry. A polluted, dead valley.
          
          ON COLLAPSED BRIDGE RAMP
          
          Near its edge rests a WALL-E UNIT TRANSPORT TRUCK.
          A giant child's Tonka Truck left to weather the elements.
          A "Buy N Large" logo on its side.
          Wall-E approaches the rear of the truck.
          
                                                                     4.
          
          
          Pulls on a lever.
          The back lowers.
          Wall-E motors up the ramp.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
          
          Open racks for storing WALL-Es line both walls.
          KNICKKNACKS OF FOUND JUNK littered everywhere.
          The tired robot removes his newfound treads.
          Ahh... Home.
          
          Wall-E motors down the center aisle.
          Flicks on an ancient BETAMAX PLAYER.
          Jury-rigged to an iPod.
          Pushes in a cassette labeled, "Hello Dolly!"
          The image is very poor quality.
          Actors sing and dance to Put On Your Sunday Clothes (POYSC).
          The same song Wall-E worked to.
          
                                        WALL-E
                         [Hums POYSC]
          
          Wall-E opens his cooler.
          Newfound knickknacks.
          Pulls out the hubcap from his chest.
          Looks back at the TV.
          Mimics the dancers on the screen.
          Pretends the hubcap is a hat.
          
          Continues to unpack:
          A spork.
          A Rubik's Cube (unsolved).
          A Zippo Lighter.
          
          He presses a BUTTON by the rack of shelves.
          They rotate until an empty space appears.
          His new items are lovingly added to the shelf.
          The Zippo joins a pre-existing LIGHTER COLLECTION.
          
          A new song, It Only Takes A Moment, plays on the video.
          Wall-E is drawn to it.
          Presses his "Record" button.
          
          ON TV SCREEN
          
          Two lovers sing gently to one another.
          They kiss...hold hands...
          
          Wall-E tilts his head as he watches.
          Curious.
          Holds his own hands.
          
                                                                    5.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E motors outside.
          Turns over his Igloo cooler to clean it out.
          Pauses to take in the night sky.
          STARS struggle to be seen through the polluted haze.
          Wall-E presses the "Play" button on his chest.
          The newly sampled It Only Takes A Moment (IOTAM) plays.
          
          The wind picks up.
          A WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
          He looks out into the night.
          A RAGING SANDSTORM approaches off the bay...
          
          Unfazed, Wall-E heads back in the truck.
          IOTAM still gently playing.
          
          ...The massive wave of sand roars closer...
          
          Wall-E raises the door.
          Pauses.
          WHISTLES for his cockroach to come inside.
          The door shuts just as the storm hits.
          Obliterates everything in view.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - SAME
          
          Wall-E alone in the center of his shelter.
          Unwraps a BNL SPONGECAKE (think Twinkie).
          Lays it out for the cockroach to sleep in.
          It happily dives in.
          
          Wall-E collapses himself into a storable cube.
          Backs into an empty shelf space.
          Rocks it like a cradle...
          ...and shuts down for the night.
          Outside the wind howls like the Hounds of Hell.
          
          
          INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
          
          Wall-E's CHARGE METER flashes "WARNING".
          He wakes. Unboxes.
          Groggy and lifeless.
          Stumbles outside.
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK
          
          The morning sun.
          Wall-E fully exposed in its light.
          His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield.
          A solar collector.
          
                                                                  6.
          
          
          
          His CHARGE METER chimes full.
          Solar panels fold away into hiding.
          Wall-E, now awake, collects his lunch cooler.
          Heads off to work.
          ...and accidentally runs over the cockroach.
          Horrified, Wall-E reverses.
          
          Reveals the FLATTENED INSECT under his tread.
          The cockroach simply pops back to life.
          No biggie. Ready to go.
          Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute.
          
          
          EXT. WALL-E'S WORK SITE - THAT MORNING
          
          A SERIES OF "WALL-E AT WORK" MOMENTS:
          
          - CU of Wall-E's hands digging into garbage.
            CU of trash being scooped into his chest compactor.
            A cube lands by the cockroach.
          
          - Wall-E discovers a BRA in the garbage.
            Unsure what it's for.
            Tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses.
            Tosses it in his cooler.
          
          - Wall-E finds a set of CAR KEYS.
            Presses the remote lock.
            Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS.
          
          - Plays with a paddle ball.
            The ball keeps smacking him in the face.
            He doesn't like it.
          
          - Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE.
            Throws out the ring. Keeps the case.
            The jewel case drops into the cooler, then...
            ...A RUBBER DUCKY...
            ...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL...
            ...An OLD BOOT...
            ...A TROPHY...
          
          - Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
            Activates it.
            FOAM blasts in his face.
            It's tossed far, far away from his cooler.
          
          - Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid.
            Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself.
            Now what?
          
          - CU on fridge door.
            A WELDING BEAM moves down its center.
            It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES.
          
                                                                        7.
          
          
           The door falls apart in two pieces. Reveals...
          
          ...a SMALL PLANT
          
          in its early stage of growth.
          Wall-E is entranced.
          Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it.
          
          CLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER
          
          Wall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot.
          Dusts dirt off the leaves.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - DUSK
          
          Robot and faithful cockroach return home.
          Wall-E stops short of the threshold.
          Stares at the ground.
          Continues staring.
          
          A RED DOT
          
          quivers on the dirt.
          A single laser point of light.
          Wall-E moves to touch it...
          
          ...The dot races along the ground.
          
          Wall-E drops his Igloo.
          Chases after the dot.
          
          
          EXT. EMPTY BAY
          
          The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse.
          He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice
          
          MANY LASER POINTS
          
          coming from every direction.
          All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain.
          Triangulating towards a center.
          
          Wall-E's dot suddenly stops.
          Slowly he reaches for it.
          Can't grab it. Just light.
          ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him.
          The ground shakes.
          Wall-E becomes confused.
          
          Doesn't see above him.
          The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover.
          A noise. Building.
          
                                                                  8.
          
          
          Rocket engines.
          Wall-E senses he should look to the sky.
          
          Now THREE SUNS are descending on him.
          
          Wall-E runs for it.
          An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path.
          A second column of fire.
          A third.
          Trapped.
          
          Wall-E cubes the ground beneath him.
          Working fast.
          Noise deafening.
          Heat rising.
          Digs in just as a tide of flame carpets the ground...
          
          ...Then suddenly quiet.
          Smoke clears.
          
          CLOSE ON THE SCORCHED EARTH
          
          Wall-E's head rises out of the dirt.
          Glows red hot from the heat.
          Trembles with fright.
          Everything in shadow.
          Something very big looms over him.
          Wall-E climbs out of his hole.
          Bangs his head on metal.
          
          WIDE on a massive SPACESHIP.
          Rests ominously in the empty bay.
          
          A PORTAL on its underside opens.
          Frightened, Wall-E tries to hide.
          Nowhere to go.
          He places a SMALL ROCK on his head. Boxes up.
          
          A DEVICE lowers to the ground on a long stem.
          Scans the surface.
          
          Wall-E creeps closer for a better look.
          The device unfolds.
          Wall-E boxes up again.
          
          A CAPSULE descends from a chute in the stem.
          ROBOT ARMS emerge from the device.
          Place the capsule on the ground. Press buttons.
          The capsule falls away in sections, to reveal...
          
          ...a PROBE ROBOT.
          
          It hovers gracefully above the ground.
          White. Egg-shaped.
          
                                                              9.
          
          
          Blue-lit eyes.
          Female.
          Eve.
          
          Wall-E is transfixed.
          Inches closer.
          Watches Eve from behind the device.
          Tilts his head.
          Time stops.
          She's the most beautiful thing he's ever seen.
          
          Eve hovers over the ground.
          A BLUE RAY emits from her front panel.
          Fans out 180 degrees.
          Scans random objects and areas.
          
          The device rises back into the ship.
          Exposes Wall-E.
          He rushes for cover behind the nearest rock.
          Never takes his eyes off Eve.
          Watches her float away from the ship.
          ...from the ship?
          The ship!
          
          Engines roar back to life.
          Wall-E digging furiously.
          The rocket takes off.
          
          Smoke clears.
          Again, a red hot Wall-E peeks out from the ground.
          Looks for Eve.
          She is watching the ship rise into the clouds.
          Waits until it is completely out of sight...
          
          ...then Eve rises high up into the air.
          
          She flies around the bay.
          Soars like a graceful bird.
          Does loops in the sky.
          Zooms right past Wall-E's rock.
          He is hypnotized.
          
          Eve descends gently to the ground...
          Wall-E sneaks up closer.
          Hides behind another boulder.
          Slips.
          Makes a NOISE.
          Instantly, Eve whips around.
          Her arm converts into a LASER CANNON.
          Blasts Wall-E's boulder to smithereens.
          
          ...Smoke clears...All quiet.
          
          Eve, now cold and dangerous.
          
                                                                   10.
          
          
          Scans the area.
          No sign of life.
          All business again.
          Hovers away to probe more of the planet.
          
          ON OTHER SIDE OF BOULDER CRATER
          
          Wall-E boxed up behind what little remains of the rock.
          Trembles uncontrollably.
          
          
          EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH - DAY
          
          Eve wanders through the pillars of cubed trash.
          Scans random areas.
          Wall-E spies from the shadows.
          Too frightened to approach.
          She moves on. He follows.
          
          
          EXT. TIRE DUMP - DAY
          
          Eve probes a mound of tires.
          Wall-E hiding nearby.
          He flinches at the sight of
          
          HIS COCKROACH
          
          innocently approaching Eve from behind.
          She spins around.
          Blasts the insect.
          Wall-E is gut-punched.
          
          The cockroach climbs out of the smoking crater.
          Unscathed. Still curious.
          
          Eve finds the insect intriguing.
          Lowers her arm.
          The end separates into individual hovering sections...
          
          ...A HAND.
          
          She lets the insect crawl up her arm.
          Wiggles into her workings.
          It tickles.
          
                                       EVE
                          [Giggles]
          
          Wall-E relaxes.
          CHUCKLES privately.
          
          Eve sonically picks up Wall-E's location.
          Locks onto him.
          
                                                                   11.
          
          
          Arm converts to laser cannon.
          Fires rapidly.
          Quick glimpses of Wall-E dodging the blasts.
          Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him.
          
          Wall-E now exposed.
          Nowhere to hide.
          Boxes himself up. Shakes uncontrollably.
          Eve holds her fire.
          
                                     EVE
                               (electronic hums)
                        [Identify yourself.]
          
          She slowly approaches Wall-E's box.
          Keeps her gun trained on him.
          
                                     EVE
                               (electronic hums)
                        [Repeat. Identify yourself.]
          
          Wall-E peeks out from his box.
          Doesn't understand a thing she says.
          Doesn't care.
          Can't believe she's real.
          The cockroach climbs down her gun arm.
          Jumps onto his master.
          
          Eve scans Wall-E.
          A RED LIGHT appears on her chest.
          Buzzes "negative".
          He's not what she's looking for.
          She retracts her gun arm.
          Hovers off.
          Wall-E watches her go. Lovestruck.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        [Sigh.]
          
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. ABANDONED BNL SUPERSTORE - NEXT DAY
          
          LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "LA VIE EN ROSE" PLAYS
          
          Eve scans through the market.
          Wall-E follows from a safe distance.
          A stray puppy-dog.
          
          Eve glances over at him.
          Wall-E panics.
          Bumps into a RACK OF SHOPPING CARTS.
          Creates an avalanche.
          
                                                                      12.
          
          
          They chase him down a flight of stairs.
          Wall-E reaches the exit doors.
          Won't open!
          Carts pig pile on top of him.
          
          
          EXT. BNL REFINERY - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E perched on the roof.
          Patiently watches Eve fly.
          She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight.
          
          Eve comes in for a landing below.
          Shuts down for the night.
          Wall-E waits.
          Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape.
          Accidentally trips. Tumbles to the ground.
          Eve doesn't wake.
          Wall-E creeps up to her.
          Opens his arms wide...
          ...and measures her.
          Turns to a pile of trash.
          Splits open his eyes. Begins welding something...
          
                                                              DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. BNL REFINERY - NEXT MORNING
          
          Eve powers up again.
          Does a double take.
          A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her.
          She hovers away, unimpressed.
          Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES.
          Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration.
          They roll on top of him.
          
          SONG ENDS
          
          MONTAGE OF EVE SEARCHING
          
          - Scans a car engine.
            Negative.
            Slams the hood shut.
          
          - Scans a Port-A-Potty.
            Negative.
            Slams the door shut.
          
          - Scans an Apollo capsule.
            Negative.
            Slams the hatch shut.
          
          - Scans a FREIGHTER HOLD.
          
                                                              13.
          
          
           Negative.
           Slams the lid shut.
          
          
          EXT. DERELICT SHIPYARD - DUSK
          
          Eve hovers over the freighter.
          Frustrated.
          Not finding what she's looking for.
          Wall-E eavesdrops from afar.
          
          Eve flies past the ship's CRANE MAGNET.
          Gets stuck.
          Wrestles to free herself.
          Furious, she BLOWS UP THE ENTIRE SHIP.
          The reaction startles Wall-E.
          
          Eve slumps down against a dredged anchor.
          She gives up.
          Concerned, Wall-E cautiously approaches.
          Sits at the other end of the anchor.
          Both robots stare silently at the fiery wreck.
          Then...
          ...slowly, very slowly, Wall-E inches towards her.
          Musters the courage to speak, when --
          She suddenly turns to him:
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [So what's your story?]
          
          Wall-E falls backwards with surprise.
          Me?
          Eve scrolls through a variety of languages:
          
                                     EVE
                               (German)
                        [Directive?]
                               (Japanese)
                        [Directive?]
          
                                     WALL-E
                        [Huh?]
          
                                     EVE
                               (Swahili)
                        [Directive?]
                               (English)
                        Directive?
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh, I understand that!]
          
                                                          14.
          
          
          
                                       EVE
                        Directive?
          
          Wall-E eagerly turns to some nearby trash.
          Scoops it into his compactor.
          Proudly spits out a cube.
          Points to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (struggles to speak)
                        Di...rec...t--
          
                                       EVE
                        Directive?
          
          Wall-E nods.
          
                                       EVE
                        Classified.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh. Sorry.]
          
          She scans his CHEST LOGO.
          
                                       EVE
                        Name?
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (struggles again)
                        W-wally? ...Wall-E.
          
                                     EVE
                               (smooth; almost perfect)
                        Wwww-aaaa-leee...
          
          Wall-E nearly melts.
          She says his name so beautifully.
          Moves closer.
          
                                       EVE
                        Wall-E.
                                 (giggles)
                        Eve.
          
          Wall-E tries to repeat it:
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eeee...?
          
                                       EVE
                                 (slower)
                        Eve.
          
                                                                 15.
          
          
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eeeaaah?
          
                                     EVE
                        Eeeve. Eeeve.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Eee--vah!
          
          She giggles again.
          Wall-E likes making her giggle.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Eee-vah! Ee --
          
                                       EVE
                        Eve.
          
          The wind kicks up.
          The WARNING LIGHT sounds on Wall-E's chest.
          He moves to grab her.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        (Gasp!) Eee-vah!
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!]
          
          She draws her gun on him.
          Doesn't understand the danger.
          The sandstorm rushes up behind her.
          Too late.
          Wall-E collapses into a box.
          The storm hits full force.
          Eve is instantly lost, disoriented.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E? Wall-E?
          
          WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust.
          Calmly takes Eve's hand.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The back door lowers.
          A rush of wind and sand.
          Wall-E pulls Eve inside. Closes the door.
          She coughs up dust.
          
          Wall-E hits a switch...
          Strings of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS fill the space.
          His racks of oddities painted in colored light.
          
                                                                   16.
          
          
          An air of enchantment.
          Eve is taken aback.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Come on in.]
          
          She drifts through the sea of knickknacks.
          Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH.
          Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down.
          He is compelled to show her everything.
          Hands her an eggbeater...
          ...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)...
          ...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)...
          ...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)...
          ...his Hello Dolly tape.
          Curious, she begins unspooling the tape.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (loud beeps)
                        [My tape!!]
          
          He grabs it back. Protective.
          Inserts it carefully into the VCR. Please still work.
          The movie eventually appears on the TV.
          Plays a clip of POYSC.
          Wall-E is relieved.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [What do you think?]
          
          Mimics the dancing for Eve.
          Encourages her to try.
          She clumsily hops up and down.
          Makes dents in the floor. Rattles everything.
          Wall-E politely stops her.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [How `bout we try a different move?]
          
          Spins in a circle. Arms out.
          Eve copies.
          Spins faster, and faster...
          Too fast.
          Accidentally strikes Wall-E. He flies into the shelves.
          
          Eve helps him up from the mess.
          Wall-E's LEFT BINOCULAR EYE falls off.
          Dangles from two wires.
          Eve GASPS with concern.
          Wall-E placates her.
          
                                                                      17.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [It's fine.]
          
          Feels his way to the rack of shelves.
          Rotates them until...
          ...SPARE WALL-E PARTS appear.
          Replaces his broken eye with a new one.
          Eve is relieved.
          
          She eyes his LIGHTER COLLECTION.
          Flicks open a Zippo. Ignites a FLAME.
          Wall-E freezes.
          He had no idea it could do that.
          Moves closer to inspect it...
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          It's the closest he's ever been to Eve.
          She remains focused on the lighter.
          Wall-E stares up at her.
          ...The tiny flame flickering between them...
          ...The Hello Dolly video plays IOTAM in the background...
          Suddenly, he is moved to express his love.
          Musters the courage to open his fingers...
          ...Timidly reaches his hand out to hers...
          
          -- Eve turns and looks at him.
          
          Wall-E instantly chokes.
          Pulls his hand back.
          Eve becomes intrigued with the TV.
          Scans the image of the lovers singing IOTAM...
          Wall-E watches her.
          His infatuation still palpable.
          Then he remembers...
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          He rushes to his shelves.
          Eve watches him rummage through junk.
          A drum falls down on his head.
          She giggles, charmed by it all.
          Something about Wall-E...
          
          She is drawn back to the lovers on TV...
          ...then the lit Zippo lighter in her hand.
          A tap on her shoulder.
          She turns to find Wall-E holding something.
          
          The plant.
          
          Eve immediately locks onto it.
          
                                                                    18.
          
          
          Drops the lighter.
          In a flash...
          ...her chest opens...
          ...a TRACTOR BEAM snatches the plant away...
          ...stores it inside her...
          Then she shuts down completely.
          Only a SINGLE GREEN LIGHT pulsing on her chest.
          
          Wall-E is stunned.
          What'd I do?
          Waves his hand in front of her face.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          Knocks on her chest plate.
          No response.
          Wall-E panics.
          Gently shakes her.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          Still no response.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah? ...Ee-vah?!
          
          CAMERA MOVES IN on the blinking green light...
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
          
          The morning sun.
          Wall-E places Eve in his charging spot.
          Aims her hovering form to face the sun.
          Waits.
          
          MONTAGE OF WALL-E TRYING TO REVIVE EVE:
          
          - Several hot days pass with Wall-E holding vigil in the heat.
          
          - A THUNDERSTORM approaches on the horizon.
            Wall-E holds an UMBRELLA over Eve.
            Gets struck by lightning.
            Holds up another umbrella.
            Gets struck again.
          
          - A SANDSTORM blows through.
            Wall-E pops out of a dune on the truck's roof.
            Lifts up an UPSIDE-DOWN BARREL that protected Eve.
          
                                                               19.
          
          
          
          - Wall-E pries open a panel on Eve's chest.
            Reveals her pulsing BLUE HEART-BATTERY.
            Attaches JUMPER CABLES to his own HEART-BATTERY.
            Tries to connect the other end to hers.
            An automatic defense system blows him off truck.
          
          - Wall-E & cockroach take Eve for a walk.
            Pull her along on a LEASH OF CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.
          
          - Wall-E gives Eve a boat ride on a LAKE OF SLUDGE.
            Uses an industrial tire as a boat.
            Rows like a gondolier with a road sign.
          
          - Wall-E sits by the empty bay with Eve.
            Watches the SUNSET.
            Burns "WALL-E + EVE" on a public trash can.
            Tries to pull out her hand to hold it.
            It snaps back into place, trapping his hand.
          
          END OF MONTAGE
          
          
          EXT. ROOF OF WALL-E'S TRUCK - NIGHT
          
          Wall-E has set up the TV on the roof.
          The blank Eve floating next to him.
          Tries unsuccessfully to play PONG with her.
          Still no response.
          Finally, he gives up.
          
                                        WALL-E
                           [defeated sigh]
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - NEXT MORNING
          
          Wall-E loads up his cooler.
          Checks on Eve one more time.
          Still nothing...
          Heads off to work, defeated.
          
          
          EXT. WORK SITE - LATER
          
          Wall-E simply going through the motions.
          No spirit in him at all.
          Stops.
          Pulls out the Zippo lighter.
          Flicks it a few times.
          A RUSH OF WIND blows out the flame.
          Distant rumbling.
          Wall-E looks in the direction of his home.
          A BRIGHT GLOW is lowering down through the clouds.
          
                                                             20.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Oh no.]
          
          
          EXT. TRASH ALLEY - DAY
          
          Wall-E racing as fast as he can.
          The cockroach clings onto him for dear life.
          
          
          EXT. TRUCK - DAY
          
          The RECON SPACESHIP towers over his truck.
          A ROBOT ARM cherry-picks Eve from the roof.
          Lifts her up and into the ship's cargo hold.
          Wall-E racing in the distance.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        EE-VAH!! EE-VAH!!
          
          Reaches the end of the collapsed bridge ramp.
          Forced to watch Eve disappear into the ship.
          The cargo doors slam shut.
          
          The first of the THREE ROCKET ENGINES powers up.
          Wall-E heads down a hill of rubble to the ship.
          Notices his cockroach tagging along behind him.
          Leads it back to the top of the hill.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Stay.]
          
          The insect mopes.
          Droops its little antennae.
          Wall-E motors back down to the rocket...
          
          BASE OF RECON SHIP
          
          The engines blast a WALL OF SMOKE.
          Preparation for launch...
          
          
          INT. RECON SHIP
          
          Eve is secured into a slot.
          Joins a ROW OF OTHER EVE PROBES.
          All dormant.
          Only Eve flashes a GREEN LIGHT.
          The CAMERA DRIFTS BACK out a window...
          
          OUTSIDE THE SHIP
          
                                                                    21.
          
          
          
          ...where Wall-E steadily climbs up the side.
          The ship's engines ignite.
          Wall-E clamps his hands tight to a metal support.
          The rocket takes off into space.
          
          
          EXT. TOP OF HILL
          
          The cockroach watches his master go.
          
          
          EXT. RECON SHIP
          
          The spaceship roars through the sky.
          Wall-E tightens his grip, battling the G's.
          He looks ahead. SCREAMS.
          
          HUNDREDS OF BNL SATELLITES
          
          litter the outer atmosphere.
          The ship bursts through the layer.
          
          
          EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The recon ship breaks free of the planet.
          Its boosters shut down.
          Wall-E takes in the sudden QUIETNESS OF SPACE.
          Looks back at his planet.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Oooh...
          
          Weightlessness takes effect.
          Wall-E almost floats away.
          Grabs hold of the ship.
          Knocks on a WINDOW near Eve.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        E-vah!
          
          No response. She remains shut down.
          Wall-E points out at the stars.
          It is the most spectacular light show possible.
          And Wall-E has a front row seat.
          
          MONTAGE OF CELESTIAL SPECTACLES
          
          - The ship flies past the MOON.
            A BILLBOARD stands next to the abandoned APOLLO MOON ROVER.
            "BNL Outlet Coming Soon."
          
          - The ship passes by the SUN.
            Wall-E pops open his solar panels.
          
                                                                     22.
          
          
           Instantly recharges.
          
          - The ship cruises alongside SATURN'S OUTER RINGS.
            Wall-E runs his hand through the tiny particles of ice.
          
                                                            DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. RECON SHIP - DAYS LATER
          
          A DUMBBELL NEBULA slowly twists in space.
          Wall-E is mesmerized by it.
          Leads his eye to a LIGHT, growing in the distance ahead.
          A planet?
          No. A starliner.
          Gigantic in size.
          
          The "AXIOM".
          
          The now tiny recon ship heads straight for it.
          
          
          INT. DOCKING BAY
          
          TWO TUG-ROCKETS guide the ship in.
          It locks into GIANT BRACES fixed on the deck.
          The impact knocks Wall-E off.
          He lands in the scaffolding of the front brace.
          
          Suddenly the entire dock comes to life.
          Robotic arms and service robots of all types appear.
          ...Rise from the floor...
          ..Lower from the ceiling...
          It's a cacophony of automation.
          They all attend to the ship.
          
          EVE
          
          and four other probes slide out of the ship's side.
          Suspended in a horizontal rack.
          Wall-E is surprised to find her facing him.
          She remains shut down.
          Just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them.
          
                                       WALL-E
                         Ee-vah... ?
          
          A SQUAD OF CLEANER ROBOTS emerge onto the dock.
          A small roller BRUSH-BOT (M-O) leads.
          
                                      M-O
                                (beeps)
                         [Hold up.]
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
          Waits for the FLOOR LINES to appear.
          Depict their exact path of action.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Okay. Go.]
          
          They file out on the line.
          
          A crane-bot lowers Eve from the rack.
          M-O and his cleaning crew stand ready.
          M-O scans Eve.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Scan reads: "%16 Foreign Contaminant."
          
          M-O is disgusted.
          Revs his brush roller. Moves in for the clean.
          A VACU-BOT follows after him.
          Then a SPRAY-BOT and BUFFER-BOT finish off.
          
          The cleaning crew waits for probe #2.
          Wall-E studies the routine.
          Figures out a way to climb down to Eve.
          When the crane returns, Wall-E poses as probe #3.
          The crane grabs him instead.
          
          M-O turns around to clean the next probe.
          Wall-E is lowered in front of him.
          Boxes up.
          Confused, M-O scans him.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Scan reads: "%100 Foreign Contaminant."
          M-O is horrified by such filth.
          A RED SIREN LIGHT rises from his head.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Oh, no, no, no. This is all wrong.]
          
          He scrubs Wall-E full force.
          Wall-E's front panel pushes him away.
          Confused, M-O moves to clean him again.
          Wall-E backs away.
          Leaves a DIRT TRAIL.
          M-O curses:
          
                                     M-O
                        [You made the floor all dirty! Stop it!]
          
                                                                    24.
          
          
          M-O furiously scrubs the floor.
          Wall-E peeks out, amused by this neurotic little guy.
          
          ON FAR WALL
          
          Two STEWARD ROBOTS come out of the wall.
          Act like hovering caution signs.
          A small robot (GOPHER) shoots out a PNEUMATIC TUBE.
          He bears epaulet like shoulders and a siren for a face.
          Gopher beeps an ELECTRONIC ORDER for the Stewards to follow.
          
          BACK ON M-O AND WALL-E
          
          M-O just finishes cleaning the floor.
          Wall-E is fascinated.
          Impishly makes another mark.
          M-O compulsively cleans it. Can't resist.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Look, it stays clean. You got that?]
          
          Wall-E wipes the bottom of his tread on M-O's face.
          M-O loses it.
          Scrubs his own face.
          
          Gopher and his steward escort arrive.
          The cleaning crew stand at attention.
          Wall-E boxes back up with the probes.
          
          Gopher begins scanning each probe.
          Moves down the line.
          Scans Wall-E...moves on to the next probe...
          Stops -- Wait a minute.
          Turns back.
          Wall-E is gone.
          Gopher shrugs it off. Proceeds...
          Reaches Eve.
          Doesn't notice Wall-E hidden behind her.
          Gopher scans her BLINKING PLANT LIGHT --
          
          The entire dock goes to "Code Green"!
          
          Alarms sound.
          Green lights flash.
          All automation stops.
          
          In rapid succession...
          ...A HOVER-TRANSPORT glides up to Gopher...
          ...A crane-bot loads Eve...
          ...Curved energy bands lock her down...
          ...Gopher assumes the driver's seat...
          
          It's all moving too fast for Wall-E.
          Suddenly Eve's transport heads for the ELEVATOR.
          
                                                                    25.
          
          
          
                                      WALL-E
                          Ee-vah!
          
          Wall-E chases after them.
          Grabs onto the back of the transport.
          They disappear into the elevator.
          
          The cleaning crew files out.
          Follow their lines back to their hold.
          M-O stops short.
          Notices Wall-E's FILTHY TRACKS crossing his path.
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY
          
          Reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT"
          
          The tracks lead to the elevator.
          M-O's neurosis takes over.
          Must clean dirt.
          He makes a radical decision and...
          ...jumps off his line.
          Starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR
          
          Gopher waits patiently as the floors pass.
          Wall-E hidden behind the transport.
          Peeks at Eve.
          Pets her blank faceplate.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (quiet beeps)
                          [It'll be okay, Eve.]
          
          The ELEVATOR DOORS suddenly open.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS
          
          DOZENS OF ROBOTS speed along a multi-lane passageway.
          All following glowing lines on the floor.
          Wall-E's head whipsaws back and forth.
          Tries to process it all.
          Doesn't notice Gopher's transport merge into traffic...
          ...without him!
          
          Wall-E shrinks from the high-speed traffic.
          Timidly attempts to merge.
          Sticks out one tread...
          -- Instantly causes a ROBOT PILE-UP.
          Wall-E boxes up. Guns it.
          Weaves across all the lines on the floor.
          Bounces off robots like bumper cars.
          
                                                                     26.
          
          
          Barely able to navigate the chaos.
          Takes refuge in the middle of an INTERSECTION.
          Scans for Eve...
          
          ON WALL-E'S POV DISPLAY
          
          ...a PAINT-BOT paints a wall sign...
          ...A GARBAGE-BOT dumps trash into a wall chute...
          ...Down the hall, Eve's transport glides up a ramp...
          
                                     WALL-E
                        EE-VAH!
          
          Wall-E chases after them.
          
          
          INT. UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Wall-E flies up the ramp.
          Nearly collides with a merging HOVER CHAIR.
          It blocks his way.
          Wall-E gains alongside it, and discovers
          
          A HUMAN PASSENGER
          
          sitting, reclined, in the chair.
          He is large, round and soft - like a big baby.
          Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit.
          The chair seems to be steering itself.
          Guided by floor lines, just like the robots.
          Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision.
          A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face.
          He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen:
          
                                     PASSENGER #1
                        Well, I've been in my cabin all morning
                        so let's hover over to the driving range
                        and hit a few virtual balls into space.
          
                                     PASSENGER #2 (ON SCREEN)
                        Nah, we did that yesterday. I don't want
                        to do that.
          
                                     PASSENGER #1
                        Well then what do you want to do?
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He looks over his shoulder.
          Passenger #2 is floating right next to them.
          Isolated in his own hover chair.
          Also in a red jumpsuit. Also a big baby.
          
                                                                       27.
          
          
          
                                     PASSENGER #2
                        I don't know. Something.
          
          Both humans are totally unaware of the other's presence.
          They all exit the hallway. Merge into the...
          
          ECONOMY CLASS COURTYARD
          
          Wall-E is in awe.
          Hundreds of floors of GUEST ROOMS rise on all sides.
          THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS fill the giant space.
          All reclined and riding on hover chairs.
          MULTIPLE FLOOR LINES guide their chairs in all directions.
          
          Humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes.
          Absolutely no reason to ever get up.
          No purpose.
          Every one of them engrossed in their video screens.
          Cocooned in virtual worlds.
          Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS.
          The controls allow them to steer...
          ...order food...
          ...play games...
          ...and most of all...
          
          ...CHAT MINDLESSLY with other passengers:
          
          The CHATTER is deafening.
          No one notices Wall-E at all.
          He drives into the endless human traffic.
          
                                     MISC. FEMALE PASSENGER
                        Bot, over here!
          
          A DRINK-BOT floats over to a passenger.
          Puts a fresh drink in her open hand.
          Wall-E flows with the traffic into a LARGE TUNNEL.
          
                                     MISC. PASSENGERS
                        I can't hear you...I'm in a tunnel.
                        You're breaking up...Oh, okay. You're
                        back. I can hear you now...
          
          They spill out into the BRIGHT LIGHT of the
          
          MAIN CONCOURSE (COACH CLASS)
          
          A city-sized, mall-like environment.
          All under a GIANT DOME.
          The ceiling simulates the sun and sky.
          A BNL LOGO (w/ time & temp) appears on the FACE OF THE SUN.
          
                                                                    28.
          
          
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Buy N Large. Everything you need to be
                        happy. Your day is very important to us.
          
          Wall-E is gobsmacked.
          A PASSENGER (JOHN) hovers up alongside him.
          Tries to hand off his empty drink cup to Wall-E.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey, Drink-bot.
          
          Wall-E shies away.
          John reaches farther out with the cup.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Here, take the cup. Take the cup -- Whoa!
          
          Reaches too far.
          John falls to the floor.
          Flails like an upside down turtle.
          Unable to stand on his baby legs.
          
          Instantly, SIRENS.
          Wall-E watches TWO STEWARDS arrive.
          Block John's accident.
          EMERGENCY LINES appear on the floor.
          Redirect the hover chair traffic.
          John reaches out for assistance.
          Nobody notices. Just drive past.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Stewards? Hello? Uhh, help.
          
                                     STEWARD
                        Please remain stationary. A service-bot
                        will be here to assist you momentarily.
          
          Suddenly John begins to rise.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Uhh...Hey! What's going on?
          
          Wall-E lifting him up from behind.
          Loads him back onto his chair.
          John doesn't know how to react.
          Wall-E waves hello.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Wall-E!
          
                                       JOHN
                        Uhh... John.
          
                                                                       29.
          
          
          
                                          WALL-E
                           Ee-vah?
          
                                          JOHN
                           Uh no, John.
          
          Wall-E scans the concourse.
          Spots Eve's transport about to board a MONORAIL.
          He races after them.
          Abandons the stunned John.
          
                                          WALL-E
                           Ee-vah!

                                  (small wave)
                           Bye...Wall-E.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          It pulls out of the station.
          Wall-E leaps on.
          Barely catches the last car.
          It glides down the concourse.
          
          
          INT. "ALL DAY" CARE CENTER
          
          A NANNY-BOT supervises a group of TODDLERS.
          All wearing matching BNL ONESIES.
          Motionless in their HOVER RINGS.
          They stare at educational programming on their holo-screens.
          
                                        NANNY-BOT
                           "A"! "A" is for "Axiom", your home sweet
                           home. "B"! "B" is for "Buy N Large", your
                           very best friend...
          
          OUT THE WINDOW
          
          Wall-E's monorail glides past.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          Wall-E takes in the overstimulating scenery.
          Dozens of THEMED FOOD RESTAURANTS whizz by.
          Each specialty is served in the same JUMBO PLASTIC CUP.
          
                                        SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                           Mmmmm! Time for lunch in a cup.
          
          Wall-E now notices his fellow passengers.
          They all slurp from similar cups.
          
                                                                    30.
          
          
          Next, the monorail passes a BEAUTY SALON.
          BEAUTICIAN-BOTS primp and style passengers.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Feel beautiful.
          
                                     BEAUTICIAN-BOTS
                               (pre-recorded lines)
                        ...It's the new you...Oh stunning...You
                        look great...I know honey...Ahh. Men...
          
          They pass through the FASHION DISTRICT.
          ENORMOUS BILLBOARDS hawk the latest color schemes.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Attention, Axiom shoppers. Try blue! It's
                        the new red!
          
                                    MONORAIL PASSENGERS
                        Oooohh...
          
          Passengers next to Wall-E press their chair buttons.
          Their JUMPSUITS change from RED TO BLUE.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Whoa.
          
          Their monorail speeds into a glass tunnel.
          
          INSIDE THE TUNNEL
          
          Wall-E looks past a PASSENGER (MARY) next to him.
          Spots Eve on the other side.
          Wall-E tries to sneak behind Mary.
          But her chair moves backwards.
          Smashes Wall-E against the back wall.
          No way getting past her.
          Wall-E politely tries to get Mary's attention.
          She's oblivious.
          Chats incessantly on her holo-screen:
          
                                     MARY
                        Date?! (derisive snort) Don't get me
                        started! Every holo-date I've been on has
                        been a virtual disaster! If I could just
                        meet one who wasn't so superficial. There
                        are no good men out there!...
          
          Wall-E tries to fold back her speaker headrest.
          Accidentally breaks it off.
          
                                     MARY (CONT'D)
                        ...I know! I know `cause I've scrolled
                        through them all -- (Gasp) What the --?
          
                                                                    31.
          
          
          
          Mary's chair shorts out.
          ...holo-screen shuts off...
          ...jumpsuit defaults back to red...
          For the first time Mary has an unobstructed view.
          Her eyes slowly dilate.
          It's as if she's seeing the world for the first time...
          
                                     MARY
                               (mesmerized)
                        Huh... ?
          
          Her gaze falls on Wall-E.
          He waves politely.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Wall-E.
          
                                        MARY
                               (beat)
                        M-mary.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Ee-vah.
          
          He points to Eve on the other side of Mary.
          Gestures he'd like to get by.
          She is slow to understand.
          
                                     MARY
                        Huh? Oh, uh, sure go ahead.
          
          Mary moves her hover chair back.
          Wall-E rolls over to Eve.
          Pats her protectively.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Ee-vah...
          
          
          INT. AXIOM/LIDO DECK - DAY
          
          The monorail emerges into "First Class."
          A vast, circular plaza of pools.
          Surrounded by a ring of high rise apartments.
          Hundreds of passengers lounge poolside.
          All serviced by their personal UMBRELLA-BOTS.
          
                                       POOLSIDE PASSENGER
                                 (claps; umbrella-bot opens)
                        Shade.
          
          ON MONORAIL
          
          It stops at the BRIDGE PLAZA.
          
                                                                     32.
          
          
          The base of the Axiom's Bridge Tower.
          The passengers exit.
          Follow their respective lines.
          Gopher drives Eve (and Wall-E) towards the tower.
          Pass over a GIANT BNL LOGO on the plaza floor.
          
          ON MARY
          
          She is the last to exit the car.
          Doesn't follow any lines.
          Excited by her newfound awareness.
          Looks out on the Lido Deck as the monorail pulls away.
          
                                     MARY
                        I didn't know we had a pool!
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE LOBBY
          
          Eve's transport enters the cavernous hall.
          A lone TYPING-BOT is stationed at the far end.
          A bridge elevator behind him.
          Blocked by a force field gate.
          
          The transport pulls up to the typing-bot.
          Gopher BEEPS.
          The typing-bot responds by typing.
          Slowly. One...button...at...a...time...
          
          Finally, the gate lowers. Elevator doors open.
          The typing-bot watches the transport enter the elevator.
          Notices Wall-E hiding at the back.
          Wall-E gives it a FRIENDLY WAVE as the doors close.
          The elevator shoots up to the bridge.
          
          The typing-bot looks at its hand.
          Mimics Wall-E's waving gesture.
          Huh. Never done that before.
          Tries it some more...
          
          INSIDE THE ELEVATOR
          
          Wall-E looks out on the descending Lido Deck.
          Marvels at it all.
          His view suddenly goes dark.
          The elevator doors open on...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The large circular room is dimly lit.
          Windows to SPACE on one side, a LIDO DECK view on the other.
          A massive console wraps around its entirety.
          Covered in buttons. A sea of thinking lights.
          
                                                                     33.
          
          
          A CAPTAIN'S WHEEL automatically steers.
          
          Gopher drives into the middle of the room. Beeps.
          Suddenly the wheel disengages.
          The autopilot (AUTO).
          A single camera eye lights up its center.
          A periscope stem connects Auto to the ceiling.
          Slides along rails up to Gopher, who salutes.
          Auto eyes Eve. Scans her.
          Wall-E sneaks back into the shadows.
          
          Auto detects Eve's plant light.
          Goes still...
          Begins computing rapidly.
          The number "A113" flashes on his lens.
          An ELECTRONIC EXCHANGE begins between Auto and Gopher.
          
          Wall-E watches the interchange. Nervous.
          Without warning, Auto heads in his direction.
          Wall-E boxes up.
          A CIRCULAR SECTION OF FLOOR lights directly below him.
          Irises open, like a trapdoor.
          
          Wall-E drops...
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          ...and hits the floor hard in the room below.
          Someone stirs, then resumes SNORING.
          
          Auto lowers through the portal.
          A CLOCK ALARM BUZZER activates.
          
                                        AUTOPILOT
                           Captain. You are needed on the bridge.
          
          Shoots back up. The portal closes.
          Wall-E peeks out of his box.
          
          ON WALL-E'S POV
          
          PAN across the nautical-themed cabin.
          One wall lined with PORTRAITS OF FORMER CAPTAINS.
          Their years of service listed below.
          The autopilot in the background of each picture.
          Each generation of Captain more devolved than the other.
          From human to gelatinous blob.
          We stop on the FINAL PORTRAIT.
          A blobby Captain.
          It looms above the actual CAPTAIN, snoring in bed.
          
          He reaches out in his sleep to quiet the snooze alarm.
          Smacks Wall-E's box by mistake.
          
                                                                    34.
          
          
          Activates the POYSC SAMPLE.
          It plays loud.
          The Captain sits straight up, half-awake:
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          -- All hands on deck!!
          
          Wall-E is frantic to turn off the music as...
          ...PREP ROBOTS burst from the cabinetry...
          ...a BEAUTICIAN-BOT, MASSAGE-BOT and WARDROBE-BOT...
          ...The Captain's bed automatically raises...
          ...Forms into a hover chair...
          The robots rapidly massage, brush, primp and dress him.
          
                                       BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                                 (pre-recorded)
                          Morning! Just a trim?
          
          Wall-E blends in with the primping.
          Uselessly wiggles the Captain's toes.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          (Giggles)
          
          Lines light on the floor.
          Lead his chair automatically to the elevator.
          Wall-E sneaks aboard just as the doors close.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Elevator doors swish open.
          The Captain still half-asleep.
          Claps his hands twice.
          
          On cue, a COFFEE MAKER rises from the console.
          Pours a cup.
          CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS on overhead speakers.
          The Captain's chair links with a LIT FLOOR PATH.
          Leads him over to the coffee.
          Wall-E stays lockstep behind him.
          Auto glides over to the Captain.
          
                                      AUTOPILOT

          Wall-E hides under the console just in time.
          
          The Captain reaches for his coffee.
          Makes a minimal effort.
          Easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward...
          ...almost there...and...he grabs the coffee.
          
                                                                        35.

          Sips his coffee.

          His chair automatically arcs along the console.
          SPECIFIC PANELS light up as he passes.

          Auto calls up a screen on the console.
          Displays the recon-ship and a flashing positive probe.
          Waits patiently for the Captain to notice.
          Finally, the Captain turns...

          ...but then notices the time.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        12:30?!
                               (disappointed sigh)
                        Auto, why didn't you wake me for the
                        morning announcements?
          
          He slingshots his chair to the Lido Deck side of the bridge.
          Wall-E nearly collides with him.
          
                                                                       36.
          
          
          Ducks back under the console.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do
                        on this ship.
          
          Grabs a large dial.
          TIME OF DAY ICONS surround it.
          Cranks it from mid-day back to sunrise.
          
          OUT ON LIDO DECK
          
          - The FAKE NOON SUN reverses at high speed to a SUNRISE.
          - Passengers' LUNCH CUPS switch to BREAKFAST CUPS.
          - Poolside passengers' umbrella-bots close up.
          
          An ANNOUNCEMENT WHISTLE BLOWS over the intercom.
          A SECTION OF SKY DOME becomes a JUMBOTRON SCREEN.
          Displays a live video feed of the Captain.
          The image also shows up on every passenger's CHAIR SCREEN.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (ON INTERCOM)
                               (unmotivated)
                        Well, good morning everybody, and welcome
                        to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As
                        always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and
                        sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's
                        log is showing that today is our 700th
                        anniversary of our five year cruise.
                        Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be
                        proud to know that 700 years later we'd
                        be...
                               (deflates)
                        ...doing the exact same thing...they were
                        doing...
          
          Cut to VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AXIOM LIVING.
          The listening passengers look just as bored as the Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (INTERCOM)
                               (snaps out of ennui)
                        SO! Be sure next mealtime to ask for your
                        free...
                               (hard to pronounce)
                        ...septuacentennial cupcake -- in a cup.
                        Also today we have, uh...uh...Hey, Auto,
                        what's that flashing button?
                               (mic feedback whine)
          
          BACK ON THE BRIDGE
          
          The Captain stares at a FLASHING BUTTON on the console.
          It bears the same PLANT ICON as Eve's display.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
          
                                    AUTOPILOT (O.S.)
                        Captain?
          
          The Captain turns to Auto.
          For the first time he notices Eve. Finally.
          Auto hovers over her. Salutes.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Probe One has returned positive.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                        Positive?
          
          Auto re-activates Eve.
          She wakes.
          Rises to salute the Captain.
          
          Across the room, Wall-E watches with sheer joy.
          She's okay!
          He is compelled to head straight for her...
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        But...no probe's ever come back
                        positive...
                               (looks at flashing button)
                        ...before.
          
          The flashing button is practically calling to him.
          Can't resist. Presses it.
          Instantly SHADES close on all the windows.
          The room goes dark.
          
          ...Wall-E is forced to hide under the console again...
          
          A LARGE HOLO-SCREEN appears right above him.
          Pre-recorded footage of the BNL CEO plays:
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Greetings and congratulations, Captain!
                        If you're seeing this, that means your
                        Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,
                        or...
                               (air quotes)
                        ..."EVE" probe, has returned from Earth
                        with a confirmed specimen of ongoing
                        photosynthesis!
          
          The Captain stares slack-jawed at the screen.
          Wall-E sneaks under the console towards Eve...
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        That's right, it means it's time to go
                        back home!
          
                                                                     38.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (nervous)
                        Home? W-w-we're going back?
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Now that Earth has been restored to a
                        life-sustaining status, by golly, we can
                        begin "Operation Recolonize"!
          
          A section of the console illuminates.
          An ancient, dusty MANUAL slides out...
          
          ...into a passing Wall-E's hands.
          
          Wall-E immediately boxes up.
          Holds the manual over his head.
          The Captain mistakes Wall-E for a book podium.
          Grabs the manual. Blows dust off the cover.
          It reads: "OPERATION RECOLONIZE".
          Below the title, the same PLANT ICON from Eve's display.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Simply follow this manual's instructions
                        to place the plant in your ship's holo-
                        detector, and the --
                               (bad edit)
                        -- Axiom -- will immediately navigate
                        your return to Earth! It's that easy!
          
          ON VIDEO SCREEN (DURING SPEECH)
          
          An animated diagram depicts a stage below the ship's bridge.
          The symbol of a HOLO-DETECTOR rises up.
          A STICK FIGURE places a plant inside the machine.
          A STARLINER ICON flies back towards Earth.
          
          The Captain listens closely to the instructions.
          Wall-E paying attention as well.
          
                     CAPTAIN                          WALL-E
          Huh?                               Huh?
          
          Wall-E notices he has a clear shot to Eve.
          Heads in her direction.

                        Now, due to the effects of micro-gravity,
                        you and your passengers may have suffered
                        some slight bone loss. But I'm sure a few
                        laps around your ship's jogging track
                        will get you back in shape in no time.
          
          The Captain looks at his VESTIGIAL LEGS.
          
                                                                   39.

                        If you have any further questions just
                        consult your operation manual. See you
                        back home real soon.
          
          The transmission ends.
          The Captain examines the manual.
          Holds it out in front of him.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (reads; to himself)

                        Manuel, relay instructions. Manuel?
          
          Auto intervenes.
          Clips the corner of the cover with his handle...
          ...and simply opens the book.
          The Captain is both fascinated and intimidated.
          Lifts the cover with his own fingers.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wow... Will you look at that?
          
          ON EVE
          
          Wall-E taps her shoulder.
          Not now Wall-E -- Double take!
          
                                    EVE
                        Wall-E?!
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (tiny wave)
                        Ee-vah!
          
          Eve is in a state of disbelief.
          Shoves Wall-E into the shadows under the console.
          
                                     EVE
                               (hushed; angry)

          Makes a flurry of clandestine gestures at him.
          Wall-E just stares at her.
          Smitten.
          
                                                                      40.

          ON THE CAPTAIN
          
          He manages to turn to the FIRST PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS.

          The bridge suddenly jumps to life.
          Green lights flash.
          A LARGE DEVICE appears from the ceiling...
          ...Scans the entire room...
          ...Identifies Eve...
          ...Rides along the ceiling rails...
          ...Stations itself directly above Eve...
          ...Arms unfold. Position her...
          ...A VOICE ARM swings into the Captain's face:

          A BUTTON-PUSHING ARM lowers.
          Presses a sequence of buttons on Eve...
          Her chest lights up.
          The doors open.
          The Captain winces...
          
          ...and nothing is inside.
          
                                        CAPTAIN

                           Plant. Right. Right. Where is it?
                                  (checks manual)
                           Maybe we missed a step. Show me how you
                           change the text again...
          
                                                                    41.
          
          
          
          Auto and the Captain turn away. Re-read the manual.
          Eve is stunned.
          Searches her chest cavity for the plant.
          Then she remembers...
          
                                     EVE
                        Plant! Wall-E...
                               (turns on him)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Wall-E flinches. Surprised by her anger.
          Eve opens Wall-E's chest. Empty.
          Picks him up. Scans the floor.
          Nothing.
          
                                     WALL-E

          Wall-E scared of her.
          Starts searching.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                        Why don't you scan her to be sure.
          
          Eve jumps back to attention.
          Auto slides up to her.
          Scans her chest cavity.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Contains no specimen. Probe's memory is
                        faulty.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        So, then...we're NOT going to Earth?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                               (shakes his wheel)
                        Negative.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        So, uh, I guess things go back to normal,
                        huh?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Correct, Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (privately relieved)
                        Well, false alarm!
          
                                                                    42.

                        False alarm.
          
          Instantly the plant retrieval device retracts.
          Exits back into the ceiling.
          The shades rise.
          Lights go back on.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        The probe must be defective. Gopher, send
                        her to the Repair Ward.
          
          Eve turns.
          Excuse me?
          Gopher hops to attention.
          Traps Eve in his SUSPENSION BEAM.
          Loads her back onto the transport...
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Have them run diagnostics on her. Make
                        sure she's not malfunctioning -- EEYAH!!
          
          ...and reveals WALL-E.
          Everyone stares at him.
          Long awkward pause.
          Wall-E innocently motors over to the Captain.
          Shakes his hand.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Wall-E.
          
          Leaves a CLUMP OF DIRT in his palm.
          The Captain stares at it.
          Turns to Auto.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Have "Wall-E" cleaned.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The elevator opens.
          Gopher's transport drives out.
          Both Eve and Wall-E strapped on it with energy bands.
          The typing-bot has now mastered waving.
          Waves an enthusiastic goodbye.
          Wall-E tries to get Eve's attention.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vah?
          
          She gives him the cold shoulder.
          Refuses to speak to him.
          Wall-E shrinks.
          
                                                                    43.
          
          
          The transport exits the lobby.
          
          BACK UP IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS

                        Analyze.
          
          The CLUMP OF DIRT is suspended in a beam of light.
          It rotates.
          The captain sits at his vanity console.
          ANALYSIS DATA scrolls on a HOLO-SCREEN.

                        to as "soil", "dirt", or "earth".
          
          The last word piques his interest.
          
                                    CAPTAIN

          His eyes drift to a GLOBE on his shelf.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Define "Earth"...

          Dozens of IMAGES OF LAND pop up on screen.
          Lush, green, colorful, inviting.
          He's fascinated.
          Takes it all in.

          Glued to his screen.
          Filled with ocean images.

          M-O continues to clean WALL-E'S FILTHY TRAIL.
          Oblivious to everything around him.
          Cuts through traffic.
          Robots crash into each other in his wake.
          M-O doesn't notice EVE AND WALL-E'S TRANSPORT drive past.
          They hover down a corridor, and enter...
          
          
          INT. REPAIR WARD - CONTINUOUS
          
          It's a fully automated clinic for broken bots.
          Day care for the malfunctioned.
          The REJECTS are kept in FORCE FIELD PENS.
          Dozens line the walls.
          
          Eve and Wall-E stop at the INSPECTION STATION.
          Robotic ORDERLY-ARMS activate.
          Wall-E shrinks.
          Watches them systematically check in Eve.
          Perform an I.D. scan.
          Attach a RED "DEFECT" BOOT to her head.
          A button is pressed on the boot.
          Eve goes into "sleep" mode. Lifted off the transport.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Where are you going?!]
          
          The orderly-arms now start on Wall-E.
          He escapes before they can place a defect boot on him.
          Races through the ward.
          Wall-E runs smack into a defective BEAUTICIAN-BOT.
          
                                     BEAUTICIAN-BOT
                               (pre-recorded)
                        Just a trim? Uh huh.
          
          She paints Wall-E's face with hideous looking make-up.
          Holds up a mirror.
          Wall-E gasps.
          
                                                                     45.

                        You look gorgeous.
          
          Wall-E is snatched up by an orderly-arm.
          Placed in an empty force field pen.
          Sits between a PAINT-BOT and VACU-BOT:
          ...The broken paint-bot flings paint at Wall-E...
          ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in his face...
          Across the way a MASSAGE-BOT flails wildly.
          Orderly-arms restrain him with an ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
          
          Eve slides past Wall-E.
          Carried by an orderly-arm.
          Brought into the "DIAGNOSTICS" ROOM.
          The frosted glass doors shut.
          
                                    WALL-E

          INT. DIAGNOSTICS ROOM
          
          Orderly-arms run diagnostics on a few reject robots:
          
          - An UMBRELLA-BOT flips open and overextends.
            The orderly-arms struggle to close it.
          
          - A DEFIBRILLATOR-BOT shocks a CRASH-TEST-DUMMY.
            It bursts into flames.
          
          Eve is awoken from "sleep" mode.
          A series of tests begin.
          Eve is annoyed but calm.
          It's all routine.
          An orderly-arm easily detaches her gun arm.
          
          OUT IN THE REPAIR WARD
          
          Wall-E stares at the frosted glass doors.
          Can only make out EVE'S SILHOUETTE.
          To him, her arm is being ripped off.
          
                                    WALL-E
                        Ee-vah!
          
          BACK INSIDE WITH EVE
          
          The orderly-arm tests Eve's circuitry.
          Her insides light up.
          It tickles.
          
                                    EVE
                        (Giggles)

          Next to her the UMBRELLA-BOT's mechanism SCREECHES.
          
          OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E
          
          Wall-E watches in horror.
          It looks as if Eve is being tortured.
          Mistakes the screeching for her screams.
          Wall-E struggles to free himself.
          
          INSIDE WITH EVE
          
          She is washed and scrubbed.
          A CIRCULAR BUFFER cleans between her head and body.
          It feels good.
          
          BACK ON WALL-E
          
          It looks as if Eve is being beheaded.
          He needs to stop the torture.
          Wall-E fires his CUTTING LASER at his pen's force field.
          The barrier shorts out.
          Wall-E tumbles to the floor.
          Lands on his "Play" button.
          POYSC blares across the ward.
          The Rejects all stop and stare.
          
                                       WALL-E
                          EEEEEEVAAAAHH!!
          
          Wall-E races to the diagnostics room.
          Crashes right through the glass doors.
          Finds Eve surrounded by orderly-arms.
          Grabs Eve's separated gun arm.
          Points it at the orderly-arms.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (angry beeps)
                          [Let her go, or I'll shoot!]
          
          His hands tremble, Don Knotts-style.
          Doesn't realize...
          
          ...he's holding the gun backwards.
          
          Eve slowly reaches for the weapon.
          
                                       EVE
                                 ("Put the gun down...")
                          Wall-E...
          
          An orderly lunges at him.
          Wall-E panics. Shoots!
          The gun fires backwards.
          It blasts through the repair ward.
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          Blows up the REPAIR WARD CONTROL PANEL.
          
          Wall-E shrinks.
          He knows he's in trouble.
          
                                      EVE
                        WALL-E!
          
          The smoking remains of the control panel SHORT CIRCUIT.
          ...All orderly-arms go limp...
          ...The repair ward doors open up...
          ...and all FORCE FIELDS disappear...
          
          The Rejects look at each other for a beat.
          Then CHEER wildly.
          We're free!
          
          The mob of robots all rush Wall-E.
          Lift him on their shoulders.
          Carry their hero out of the ward.
          Wall-E still holding on to Eve's gun arm.
          
          Eve watches in astonishment.
          This day just gets worse and worse.
          She flies off after them.
          
                                      EVE

          Wall-E's dropped in front of them.
          Still holds Eve's gun.
          Cowers.
          A TINY ROBOT pushes Wall-E closer.
          Show `em who's boss.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (stern)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Eve catches up to them.
          Flies over to Wall-E.
          Snatches her arm back.
          Just as she reattaches her gun...
          
          ...The steward CAMERA EYES take a snapshot of them.
          
          ALL AROUND THE SHIP
          
          Alarms sound.
          SCREENS appear, displaying EVE AND WALL-E'S IMAGE.
          She appears to brandish her gun at camera.
          Like Bonnie and Clyde.
          Their faces now on every wall...
          ...passenger's hover chair...
          ...cabin...
          ...hallway...
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue
                        robots...
          
          BACK WITH EVE AND WALL-E
          
          The stewards prepare to fire SUSPENSION BEAMS (like Gopher).
          Eve realizes what's about to happen.
          Grabs Wall-E.
          Flies over the stewards.
          
                                       STEWARDS
                        Halt. Halt.
          
          The mass of rejects take their cue.
          Robot rebellion!
          They bust through the steward blockade.
          
          ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS
          
          Robots recognize Eve and Wall-E as they fly past.
          
                                                                 49.
          
          
          Match them with the "Wanted" screens.
          Call attention to them. Point.
          Stewards in hot pursuit.
          
          Eve hides herself and Wall-E in a PORTHOLE CUBBY.
          Lets the stewards pass by.
          She glances out the porthole...
          
          ON EVE'S POV
          
          She can see the DOCKING BAY below her.
          Just under the bay doors...
          
          ...a row of EMERGENCY ESCAPE PODS.
          
          Eve gets an idea.
          Grabs Wall-E and flies down the hallway...
          
          INSIDE AXIOM ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Eve and Wall-E ride in uncomfortable silence.
          Their "WANTED" IMAGE plays on an elevator screen.
          
                                      SHIP'S COMPUTER (SCREEN)
                         Caution: Rogue robots.
          
          Wall-E points to it.
          
                                      WALL-E
                                (beeps)
                         [Hey look! We're on TV -- !]
          
          Eve aims her gun at the screen.
          Blows it to pieces.
          Wall-E shrinks into a box.
          Never mind.
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD BAY/OVER HALLWAY
          
          Dark.
          The elevator chimes.
          Eve and Wall-E step out.
          Rows of NUMBERED BAY DOORS line the hallway.
          Eve approaches "Bay #1".
          She and Wall-E enter...
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD BAY #1 - CONTINUOUS
          
          Eve navigates the dark.
          Approaches a freestanding CONSOLE.
          Fiddles with some buttons.
          
                                                              50.
          
          
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He glances down at EVE'S HAND.
          Privately intertwines his fingers.
          Maybe now is the right moment...
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (quiet)
                          Ee-vah...?
          
          FLASH!
          Banks of controls light up around them.
          
          AN ESCAPE POD
          
          is revealed at the end of the room.
          Its hatch automatically opens.
          Bathes the room with light from its lit interior.
          Eve turns to Wall-E:
          
                                       EVE
                          Earth.
          
          She points to an OVERHEAD SCREEN.
          It displays coordinates to Earth.
          
                                       EVE
                          Earth.
          
          She gestures for Wall-E to enter the pod.
          He happily complies.
          Jumps up on one of the seats.
          Pats the seat next to him.
          Aren't you coming?
          
          Eve remains at the threshold.
          Shakes her head.
          Points to her chest.
          Makes her PLANT SYMBOL glow.
          
                                       EVE
                          Directive.
          
          ...She's not going.
          
          This changes everything.
          Wall-E races out of the pod.
          Boxes up.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (beeps)
                          [Then I'm not going either.]
          
          Eve shakes her head.
          
                                                                        51.
          
          
          
                                        EVE
                                  (gentle, but firm)
                         Wall-E.
          
          Carries his box back into the pod.
          Exits.
          Wall-E follows her right back out.
          Drives behind the console.
          You can't make me.
          Eve sighs.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (frustrated)
                         Wall-E.
          
          The hallway elevator CHIMES.
          They both look up.
          Someone is coming.
          
          Eve shuts off everything.
          Lights go out. The pod closes back up.
          Both Eve and Wall-E hug the wall.
          Blend in with the other wall fixtures.
          
          They HEAR something hover into the     room.
          Can't see what it is.
          Then...
          An EPAULET ROBOT ARM rises up over     the console.
          Presses buttons.
          The pod lights up again. The hatch     opens.
          The stranger's SHADOW comes around     the console to reveal...
          
          GOPHER
          
          Eve and Wall-E look at each other.
          Gopher?
          They watch from the shadows as...
          ...Gopher enters the pod...
          ...opens his chest cavity...
          ...emits his suspension beam...
          
          ...and deposits the PLANT.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (excited whisper)
                         Plant!
          
          Gopher exits the pod.
          
          CLOSE ON EVE
          
          She keeps her eyes on Gopher.
          Watches him return to the console.
          She turns to speak to Wall-E --
          
                                                              52.
          
          
          He's gone.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (whisper)
                        Wall-E?
          
          Wall-E is inside the pod.
          Picks up the plant.
          Proudly shows it to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (loud whisper)
                        Ee-vah!
          
                                       EVE
                                 (louder whisper)
                        Wall-E!
          
          Too late.
          Gopher hits a button.
          The pod door shuts on Wall-E...
          
          ...and launches into space.
          
          Gopher shuts off the room.
          Exits.
          
          Eve leaps out of the shadows.
          Looks out the POD BAY WINDOW.
          Wall-E's pod rapidly shrinking in the distance.
          The plant icon on Eve's chest glows.
          She rushes to a narrow SERVICE AIRLOCK.
          Enters it like a phone booth.
          
          OUTSIDE THE AIRLOCK
          
          Eve bursts out into space.
          Rockets after Wall-E.
          
          
          INT. ESCAPE POD
          
          Wall-E plastered against the back of the pod.
          It suddenly reduces speed.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Cruising speed.
          
          He drops to the floor.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        You are now free to move around the
                        cabin.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          
          Wall-E fumbles to get his bearings.
          Peers out the rear hatch window.
          Sees the Axiom receding from view.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Yikes!]
          
          He clambers up into the pilot's seat.
          Pulls back hard on the throttle.
          Nothing happens.
          Looks down at the console.
          A SELF-DESTRUCT DIAL is counting down:
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Twenty seconds till self-destruct...
          
          Uh oh.
          Wall-E frantically hits the SELF-DESTRUCT button.
          No change.
          Pushes every button on the console.
          Everything activates:
          ...Lights flash...
          ...Oxygen masks drop...
          
          OUTSIDE THE POD
          
          ...Windshield wipers activate...
          ...Flares fire off...
          ...Parachutes deploy...
          
          BACK INSIDE THE POD
          
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Ten seconds till self-destruct...
          
          Wall-E panics.
          Looks for a means of escape.
          Spots the hatch.
          Grabs the pod's FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
          Shoots himself to the door.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER
                        Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
                        three, two...
          
          Pulls on the EMERGENCY EXIT LEVER.
          The hatch won't open!
          
          ON EVE
          
          She races through space after him.
          Suddenly, in the distance, the POD EXPLODES.
          
                                                                 54.
          
          
          Eve is gut-punched.
          
                                     EVE
                        No, no, no...
          
          She flies towards the debris field, when --
          
          Wall-E whizzes right past her.
          
                                       WALL-E
                        Ee-vaaaaaah!
          
          He holds the FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
          Uses it as a form of propulsion.
          Eve is consumed with relief.
          Chases after him.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He points the extinguisher the other way.
          Attempts to fly back over to her.
          It's hard to steer...
          
          ...They rocket right past each other again...
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Stay there! I'll come to you!]
          
          Eve waits.
          Wall-E finally has the hang of steering.
          Fires short bursts.
          Very slowly...makes his way...to Eve.
          Gets extinguisher foam in her face.
          She giggles.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               ("Look what I've got")
                        Ee-vah...
          
          He opens his compactor door.
          Pulls out the PLANT, still in the boot.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (Gasp!)
          
          ON EVE'S DISPLAY POV
          
          ...Sensors zero in on the plant...
          ...Confirm its authenticity...
          ...A MAP OF THE AXIOM appears...
          ...Draws directions to the bridge...
          ...A command flashes: "DELIVER TO AXIOM SUPERIOR"...
          
                                                           55.
          
          
          
          Eve is ecstatic.
          She snaps the plant up with her tractor beam.
          Seals it safely in her chest.
          Then scoops up Wall-E in her arms.
          Spins him around.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E! (Laughs)
          
          Wall-E can't believe his luck.
          Rests his head on her shoulder.
          Bliss.
          
          Eve stops spinning.
          Leans her head against his.
          A tiny ARC OF ELECTRICITY passes between them.
          A "thank you" kiss.
          
          Wall-E's METER spikes.
          He floats circles in space.
          
                                    WALL-E
                              (swoons)
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Come on. Time's a wastin'.]
          
          She reaches for his hand.
          Wall-E shakes his head.
          Holds up his extinguisher instead.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [I can fly myself.]
          
          Kicks on the extinguisher.
          Spins in a pirouette...
          ...and flies away.
          Eve giggles.
          Chases after him.
          
          BING CROSBY'S "STARDUST" PLAYS
          
          The two fly around the stern of the ship.
          Wall-E does a few barrel rolls.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [Try that.]
          
          Eve giggles.
          Matches him move for move.
          
                                                                   56.
          
          
          The pair fly between the BOOSTER ENGINES of the ship.
          Weave in and out of the rocket flames.
          Bank up along the ship's port side.
          Execute a double helix in perfect unison...
          
          
          INT. AXIOM'S OBSERVATION DECK - SAME
          
          Passengers hover down the hallway.
          All focused on their private screens.
          No one looks out at the stars.
          
          ...except for MARY.
          
          She has pulled over to the side.
          Stares wistfully out the DECK WINDOW.
          
                                      MARY
                               (sigh)
                        So many stars.
          
          Spots EVE & WALL-E dancing among the stars.
          
                                     MARY
                        Oooh...
                               (recognizes Wall-E)
                        Hey, that's what's his name --
          
          She backs up to wave hello.
          Bumps into JOHN'S HOVER CHAIR.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey! What the --
          
          Mary leans over to his armrest.
          Turns off his holo-screen.
          Points out the window.
          
                                     MARY
                        Look! Look at THAT!
          
                                     JOHN
                               (disoriented)
                        Wha...huh?
          
          Wall-E flies past the window.
          A wave of recognition hits John.
          He comes to life, as if wakened from a long sleep.
          
                                     JOHN
                        Hey... I know that guy! It's, uh...
                               (snaps fingers)
                        Wall-E! Hey Wall-E! It's your buddy, John!
          
                                                                       57.
          
          
          
                                     MARY
                        Right, Wall-E! Hi Wall-E!
          
          They both wave until Wall-E's out of sight.
          John absentmindedly lowers his hand to his armrest...
          
          ...and touches Mary's hand.
          
          Both turn towards each other.
          They make eye contact for the first time.
          Awkward beat.
          
                                       JOHN
                        Hi.

                        Hi.
          
          OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E AND EVE
          
          They soar across the Axiom's bow.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          Auto busy operating the ship.
          Doesn't see Eve and Wall-E outside the window.

          INSIDE THE CONCOURSE
          
          The sky dome fast-forwards to evening.
          PAN OVER to the top of the bridge tower.
          The windows of the Captain's quarters are dark.
          Only the FLICKERING GLOW OF A HOLO-SCREEN lights the room.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (V.O.)

          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT - SAME
          
          The Captain is still engrossed in his Earth research.
          MULTIPLE IMAGES litter the screen.
          Crops, farms, a barn, etc....
          An IMAGE OF PEOPLE SQUARE DANCING pops up.

                        "Hoedown" - a social gathering at which
                        lively dancing would take place.
          
          An aperture opens in the ceiling above.
          Auto lowers down to face the Captain.
          
                                                                     58.

                               (points to images)
                        These are called "farms". Humans would
                        put seeds in the ground, pour water on
                        them, and they'd grow food, like, pizza --

                        (annoyed grunt)
          
          Auto rises back up to the bridge.
          The aperture shuts. Lights out.
          The Captain glares at the ceiling.
          Then whispers conspiratorially to the computer.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Psst! Computer.

                        Define "dancing".
          
          BACK OUTSIDE THE AXIOM
          
          Eve and Wall-E descend along the starboard side.
          Spiral gracefully around one another.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        "Dancing" - A series of movements,
                        involving two partners, where speed and
                        rhythm match harmoniously with music.
          
          Wall-E's extinguisher runs out of foam.
          He lets it float freely out into space.
          Eve catches him in her arms.
          Wall-E croons.
          
          SONG ENDS
          
          Eve scans the Axiom for a way in.
          Notices SPARKS.
          Down on the ship's lower hull...
          
          CLOSER ON LOWER HULL
          
          A REPAIR-BOT (BURN-E) welds an antenna.
          Eve and Wall-E fly into the open hatch behind him.
          It shuts.
          Burn-e bangs on the closed door.
          Stuck outside.
          
                                                                    59.

                          The Lido Deck is now closing...The Lido
                          Deck is now closing.
          
          The last few passengers exit the pool area.
          All wearing the same color blue uniforms...
          
          ...except TWO RED ONES still in the pool.
          
          CLOSE ON FEET
          
          They ripple the surface of the pool.
          John and Mary float over the water's surface.
          Splash one another playfully.
          
                                       JOHN
                          Hey now. Stop that...
          
                                       MARY
                          Make me (giggles).
          
                                       JOHN
                          I didn't know we had a pool.
          
          A LIFEGUARD-BOT (glorified megaphone) lowers from its tower.
          Reprimands them from the pool's edge:
          
                                       LIFEGUARD-BOT
                          No splashing, no diving.
          
                                       JOHN & MARY
                                 (annoyed)
                          Ahh! Go on!
          
          John splashes the robot.
          It shorts out.
          
          ON UPPER DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E sneak onto the deck.
          Hide between a ROW OF TOWEL CARTS.
          Eve peeks through the towels.
          Surprised to discover TWO STEWARDS.
          On duty in front of the bridge lobby entrance.
          No way in.
          
                                                                    60.
          
          
          
          A TRASH-BOT passes.
          Dumps its load down a nearby TRASH CHUTE.
          Eve keys in on the chute.
          It runs all the way up the tower...
          
          ...to the bridge.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          He stares at EVE'S HAND.
          Time to seize the moment.
          Hits the PLAY BUTTON on his chest.
          It Only Takes a Moment plays from his scratchy speaker.
          Puts his hands together...
          
          Eve whips around.
          What's that noise?!
          Wall-E holds his hands up to Eve...
          
                                        WALL-E
                           E-vah --
          
          Eve immediately shuts off his music.
          Shoves his hands down.
          
                                        EVE
                                  (hushed hums)
                           [Stop it! They'll hear us!]
          
          She places a stack of towels on his head.
          Gestures for Wall-E to stay put.
          Points to her PLANT LIGHT.
          
                                        EVE
                           Directive.
          
          Before Wall-E can even protest she is gone.
          Zooms silently across the Lido Deck.
          Up into the trash chute.
          
          CLOSE ON EARTH
          
          It sits in space.
          The AXIOM glides towards it.
          Something's not right.
          We reveal the CAPTAIN'S FINGERS holding the ship...

          The Captain sits by his window to space.
          Holds a toy AXIOM MODEL over his GLOBE OF EARTH.
          
                                                                      61.

                          Yeah, Captain! [crowd cheers] Captain
                          we're home! It's so beautiful! [crowd
                          cheers]...No it's nothing. I was pleased
                          to do it. It's all about you people --
          
          ON TRASH CAN
          
          NOISES. Eve bursts out from it, like an angel.
          Blows the lid off.
          The Captain is stunned by this vision.
          She opens her chest to reveal...
          
          ...the plant.

                          How...? How'd you find it?!
          
          Eve hovers over to him.
          Salutes.
          Formally presents him the plant.
          He takes it in his hands.
          Still potted in the old boot.
          Gazes at it in wonder.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          We can go back home...for the first time!
                                 (laughs)
                          What's it like now?
          
          Eve shrugs.
          Doesn't know how to answer.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          No, no! Don't tell me! I want to see for
                          myself!
          
          He turns to his console.
          Hits a button.
          A CYLINDRICAL DEVICE rises from a panel.
          The Captain sticks it to the side of Eve's head.
          A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN projects from the device.
          Plays back images of her time on Earth.
          
          A COLLAGE OF IMAGES rapidly scroll past.
          All displayed from Eve's POV:
          ...Being delivered to Earth...
          ...Flying above the devastated landscape...
          ...Blowing up a rock...
          ...Scans of numerous trash locations...
          
                                                                 62.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Wait...that doesn't look like Earth...
                        Where's the blue sky...
          
          He looks over to his computer screen.
          The BEAUTY IMAGES OF EARTH still on display.
          Compares them with what plays on Eve's screen.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...Where's the grass?
          
          His face drops.
          Slumps in defeat.
          The dream is over.
          
          ON EVE'S HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN
          
          The HELLO DOLLY clip of POYSC plays...
          It stirs the Captain out of his funk.
          He looks up at the screen.
          Leans in for a closer look.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...I know that song...
                               (observes the dancers' feet)
                        And they're... dancing. Yes, dancing!
          
          A rueful smile grows on his face.
          He looks down at
          
          HIS FOOT
          
          It's tapping in time to the music.
          His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands.
          He lifts it up.
          Makes the boot dance.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        ...You made it somehow, eh little guy?
                        You didn't give up, did you?
          
          As if in response, the plant wilts slightly.
          A leaf drops.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (Gasp!) Oh no, no --
                               (remembers)
                        Wait a minute.
          
          The Captain urgently hovers across the room.
          Eve left alone.
          Her recorded memories continue playing...
          
          ...The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment.
          
                                                          63.
          
          
          Eve recognizes the music.
          Watches the lovers on screen hold hands.
          Something familiar about the gesture...
          Looks at her own hands.
          Slowly, she interlocks her fingers...
          ...Eve's eyes go wide.
          This is what Wall-E was trying to say to her.
          
          Her memories continue on the screen:
          ...a tap on the shoulder...
          ...Wall-E presents her the plant --
          ...The screen goes BLACK!
          
          Then...
          
          ...SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE initiates.
          
          Wall-E's vigil for Eve plays out:
          ...protecting her from the rain...
          ...the sun...the sandstorm...
          ...keeping watch night and day...
          ...trying to jump start her heart...
          
          ON EVE
          
          Amazed at Wall-E's selfless dedication to her.
          Realizes the meaning of Wall-E's love.
          
                                        EVE
                               (soft)
                        Wall-E...
          
          She looks at her hands again.
          
          MATCH CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF WALL-E'S HANDS
          
          Still waiting between the towel racks.
          Rehearses holding out his hand to Eve.
          
                                     WALL-E
                        Ee-vah... Ee-VAH...? EEE-vah...
                               (gives up; beeps)
                        [I'll never get it right.]
          
          Becomes impatient.
          Sneaks his way over to the GARBAGE CHUTE.
          Sticks his head in.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        EE-VAHH?!
          
          No answer.
          The chute has an endless drop.
          Wall-E climbs in.
          
                                                                     64.
          
          
          Holds himself spread eagle to stay in place.
          Carefully inches his way up to the Captain's quarters...
          
          OUT ON THE UPPER DECK
          
          A monorail pulls up.
          M-O steps off.
          Still hot on Wall-E's trail.
          Scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby.
          Then notices Wall-E's FRESH TRACKS...
          
          ...leading to the trash chute.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Ah-hah! Gotcha!]
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          The Captain at his wet bar.
          Waters the plant in the sink.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        There you go little guy. You came a long
                        way for a drink of water... Just needed
                        someone to look after you, that's all --
          
          He is struck with a notion.
          Stares out the window at space for a beat.
          Sees HIS REFLECTION holding the plant.
          Glances at his EARTH GLOBE.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (to himself)
                        We have to go back.
          
          Activates his chair's call button.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, come down here!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT (ON SPEAKER)
                        Aye-aye, sir.
          
          Eve is still watching Wall-E's vigil on the screen:
          ...playing Pong...
          ...Wall-E etches their names in a heart...
          Eve is lost in the moments.
          So touched.
          
                                     EVE
                               (smitten)
                        Wall-E...
                                     (MORE)
          
                                                                    65.
          
                                       EVE (CONT'D)
                                 (remembers)
                        Wall-E!
          
          He's still waiting for her.
          She turns to leave and finds
          
          AUTO
          
          lowering in front of her.
          Auto spots the plant in the Captain's hand.
          "A113" flashes on Auto's lens.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, Eve found the plant. Fire up the
                        Holo-detector.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Not necessary, Captain. You may give it
                        to me.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (not listening)
                        You know what? I should do it myself.
          
          Heads for the elevator.
          
                                       AUTOPILOT
                        Captain!
          
          Auto shoots back upstairs.
          Pops out another APERTURE in front of the elevator.
          Blocks the Captain.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, I insist you give me the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Auto, get out of my way.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, we cannot go home.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        What are you talking about? Why not?
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        That is classified. Captain, give me the
                        plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (holds plant out of reach)
                        What do you mean, "classified"? You don't
                        keep secrets from the Captain!
          
                                                                   66.
          
          
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Give me the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Tell me what's classified!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        The plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Tell me, Auto! That's an order!
          
          It's a stare down.
          Beat.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Aye-aye, sir.
          
          Auto rises back into the ceiling.
          Lowers down over the vanity console.
          High speed button pushing.
          A NEW BNL VIDEO MESSAGE appears.
          Labeled: "TOP SECRET: FOR AUTOPILOT EYE ONLY".
          The BNL FANFARE plays.
          Cut to the BNL CEO at the podium.
          Haggard. Nervous.
          Wears an emergency oxygen vest.
          The fanfare plays too long.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                               (to O.S.)
                        Just cut it off, will ya?!
                               (music stops; forced chuckle)
                        Hey there, Autopilots! Uh, got some bad
                        news. Operation Cleanup has, uh, well...
                        failed! Wouldn't you know, rising
                        toxicity levels have made life
                        unsustainable on Earth.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Unsustainable? What?
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Darn it all, we're going to have to
                        cancel Operation Recolonize.
                               (dons his life vest)
                        So just, uh...just stay the course.
                        Rather than try to fix this problem,
                        it'll just be easier if everyone remains
                        in space.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (offended)
                        Easier?
          
                                                                    67.
          
          
          
                                     CEO ADVISOR (O.S.)
                        Mr. President, sir, it's time to go.
          
                                     BUY N LARGE CEO
                        Alright, uh...uh...I'm giving override
                        directive: "A113". Go to full autopilot.
                        Take control of everything! And do not
                        return to Earth!
                               (ready to run)
                        Repeat! Do not return to Earth!
                               (throws on his gas mask; to
                                camera crew)
                        Now let's get the heck out of here.
          
          The CEO races out of the room.
          The message cuts out.
          
          Auto turns to face the Captain.
          The Captain shakes his head in disgust.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Now, the plant.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        No, wait a minute. Computer, when was
                        that message sent to the Axiom?
          
          The paused image on the holo-screen highlights.
          Data begins to calculate on the screen.
          We see YEARS SCROLL RAPIDLY BACKWARDS.
          It stops on "2110".

                        Message received in the year 2110.

                        That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!!
                        Auto, things have changed! We've got to
                        go back!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Sir, orders are: "Do not return to

                                     CAPTAIN
                        But life is sustainable now! Look at this
                        plant, green and growing! It's living
                        proof he was wrong.

                        What?! It's completely relevant!
                               (points out to space)
                        Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And
                        it's in trouble! I can't just sit here
                        and...and...do nothing! That's all I've
                        done! That's all anyone on this blasted
                        ship has ever done...NOTHING!!

                        On the Axiom you will survive.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE!
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Must follow my directive.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        DAAAARGH!!
          
          The Captain turns away in frustration.
          His eyes catch sight of the CAPTAIN PORTRAITS.
          Notices AUTO in every one of them.
          Looking over all their shoulders.
          A little closer every generation.
          The Captain slowly looks over his shoulder...
          ...and Auto is right behind him.
          The Captain looks at the plant in his lap.
          His countenance grows determined.
          He rights his hat...
          ...turns to face Auto...
          ...and gives the most authoritative order of his career:
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are
                        going home today!
          
          Auto slides into his face.
          Makes the Captain flinch.
          No more Mr. Nice Robot.
          Auto emits an ELECTRONIC COMMAND.
          
          GOPHER
          
          shoots out of a pneumatic tube.
          Salutes Auto.
          Eve immediately remembers him from the Pod Bay.
          She BEEPS a warning to the Captain.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Gopher?
          
          Gopher activates his suspension beam.
          
                                                                     69.
          
          
          Snatches the plant away from the Captain.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Hey! That's my plant. This is mutiny!
                                  (to Eve)
                           Eve, arrest him!
          
          Eve draws her GUN ARM. Points it at Gopher.
          The robot raises his epaulet arms.
          Don't shoot!
          She opens her chest cavity.
          Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Eve, you are to put this plant straight
                           in the Holo-detector.
          
          Gopher slowly advances towards Eve.
          But then tosses the plant across the room...
          
          ...down the TRASH CHUTE.
          
                                           CAPTAIN
                           No!
          
                                           EVE
                                  (hums)
                           [Oh no!]
          
          It's over.
          The plant is gone.
          But in that frozen moment...
          
          ON TRASH CHUTE
          
          ...THE PLANT suddenly reappears.
          Rises like a ghost, up from the chute.
          Wall-E's head follows.
          Unawares of the plant resting on his head.
          
                                           WALL-E
                           Ee-vah?
          
                                           CAPTAIN & EVE
                           WALL-E!!
          
          Wall-E straddles the top of the lip chute.
          The plant drops onto his chest.
          Wall-E looks at it with surprise.
          
                                        WALL-E
                                  (beeps)
                           [Hey, the plant.]
          
                                                                    70.
          
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN & EVE
                        Wall-E! The plant!...[Toss it! Over here!]
          
          Wall-E is slow to understand.
          Finally picks up the plant.
          Anticipates to throw it, when...
          ...Auto lowers right in front of him, trying to block.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        Give me the plant.
          
          Eve moves to help Wall-E.
          But Gopher traps her in his suspension beam.
          
          Wall-E dodges Auto's multi-arm advances.
          Defiantly tosses the plant into his chest.
          Slams it shut.
          
                                     WALL-E
                               (beeps)
                        [You can't have it!]
          
          Auto flips open one of his handles.
          Produces a TASER...
          
          ...and ELECTROCUTES Wall-E.
          
          Wall-E's chest circuitry blows out.
          He wheezes...
          ...then drops lifelessly down the chute.
          
          Eve screams.
          Gopher floats her trapped form over to Auto.
          The button on her DEFECT BOOT is pressed.
          She shuts down.
          
          INSIDE THE GARBAGE CHUTE
          
          Gopher's ray holds Eve over the opening.
          Drops her down the chute.
          She bangs against the sides as she tumbles.
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          Gopher salutes Auto and exits.
          Auto turns to the Captain.
          He is in shock.
          
                                     AUTOPILOT
                        All communications are terminated. You
                        are confined to quarters.
          
          The power shuts off in the room.
          Auto rises back up through the ceiling...
          
                                                                     71.
          
          
          
          DOWN SHOT THROUGH BRIDGE FLOOR APERTURE
          
          The Captain looks up.
          Shakes his fist in fury.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                         NO! MUTINY! MUTINY! MUTINEEEEE!!
          
          The aperture closes TO BLACK.
          
          Beat.
          
          ON EVE'S POV
          
          Black.
          The word "REBOOT" suddenly flashes.
          Her view comes into focus.
          Scans around. Disoriented.
          
          
          INT. GARBAGE DEPOT - SAME
          
          Eve lies in a seemingly endless WAREHOUSE OF TRASH.
          Trash, slime, and robot parts everywhere.
          Piles dumped from a variety of CEILING CHUTES.
          
          Eve looks down.
          COMPUTER MICE crawl over her.
          One of them has crawled over her REBOOT button.
          Switched her back on.
          
                                      EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          A warning alarm sounds.
          Eve spots a PLATFORM, loaded with GIANT TRASH CUBES.
          It slides into an AIRLOCK.
          Inner shield doors lock and seal.
          
                                      SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                         Caution: Activating airlock
                         disposal...Activating airlock disposal.
          
          The exterior hatch flies open.
          The vacuum of space instantly sucks out the cubed trash.
          
          Eve begins to panic.
          Calls out again:
          
                                      EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          Suddenly, her area is flooded in light.
          She flinches at the sight of
          
                                                            72.
          
          
          
          TWO GIANT COMPACTOR ROBOTS
          
          as they rumble up behind her.
          Headlights for eyes.
          They bear a slight resemblance to Wall-E.
          "WALL-A" emblazoned on their fronts.
          Each grab a ton of trash at once.
          Eve is swept up with the junk.
          Compact it. Spit it out...
          
          ...Eve now trapped in the side of a giant cube.
          
          Her cube is picked up.
          Transported to a waiting platform.
          Stacked with other massive cubes.
          Eve discovers...
          
          ...Wall-E trapped in the cube next to her.
          
                                       EVE
                        Wall-E!
          
          He groans.
          Not doing well.
          
          Again the alarms kick in.
          The platform slides on rails...
          ...across the safety line...
          ...into the airlock...
          ...the inner shield doors begin to close...
          
          INSIDE THE AIRLOCK
          
          Eve needs to act fast.
          Her gun arm stuck inside the cube.
          Struggles to activate it...
          ...It cocks.
          BLASTS herself free.
          Flies over to Wall-E.
          He's stuck deep in the cube...
          
          BACK IN THE GARBAGE DEPOT
          
          M-O suddenly drops from a ceiling chute.
          Lands in a pile of trash.
          Covered with filth.
          
                                     M-O
                        [Primal scream.]
          
          ON M-O'S DISPLAY POV
          
          Piles of trash everywhere.
          The airlock doors closing in the distance.
          
                                                                73.
          
          
          ZOOMS IN and locks on Wall-E.
          His screen reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT".
          
                                       M-O
                                 (beeps)
                          [I have you now!]
          
          M-O speeds towards the airlock.
          
          ON EVE
          
          Tugs on Wall-E.
          Desperate to free him.
          He's slow to pull loose...
          
          ...THE GAP in the doors narrows...
          
          ...Eve's never going to make it...
          
          ON M-O
          
          Racing towards the doors.
          He's almost at the airlock...
          The doors SLAM tight against his roller arms.
          M-O is stuck.
          
          The exterior hatch opens:
          ...Eve yanks Wall-E free...
          ...The trash flies out into space...
          ...She flies against the force...
          ...Fights to reach M-O...
          ...Grabs onto his roller...
          
          INSIDE THE GARBAGE DEPOT
          
          The WALL-As notice M-O stuck in the door.
          Slam the EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF BUTTON for the airlock.
          The exterior hatch closes.
          
          Eve and Wall-E fall to the ground in a heap.
          Safe.
          M-O still stuck in the door.
          Shaking uncontrollably with fear.
          
                                       M-O
                          Whoa.
          
          MOMENTS LATER
          
          The WALL-As light up a SMALL WORK SPACE.
          Eve props Wall-E up against some trash.
          He's barely functioning.
          Fades in and out of consciousness.
          Just his red "warning" light flashes on his meter.
          
                                                       74.
          
          
          
                                     EVE
                               ("Stay awake.")
                        Wall-E...
          
          Eve gently opens his chest cavity.
          Examines the damage.
          Carefully pulls out his CIRCUIT BOARD.
          Charred. Shorting out.
          Irreparable.
          She flies off into the depot.
          Searches for a new circuit board.
          
          M-O dutifully cleaning Wall-E.
          Finishes up.
          His DISPLAY POV reads: "All clean."
          M-O closes up. Satisfied.
          Wall-E feebly offers his hand in gratitude.
          
                                          WALL-E
                                 (weak)
                        Wall-E.
          
          M-O stares at the filthy hand.
          Cleans it.
          Then shakes.
          
                                          M-O
                        M-O.
          
          They sit in awkward silence for a beat.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (Really?)
                        M-O?
          
                                          M-O
                        M-O.
          
                                       WALL-E
                                 (Got it.)
                        M-O.
          
          Eve returns with FOUND CIRCUIT BOARDS.
          Shows each one to Wall-E.
          Will any of these work?
          He shakes his head with a frail "no."
          
          Wall-E opens his compactor.
          Pulls out the plant.
          
                                      WALL-E
                               (weak)
                        Di...rec...tive.
          
                                                                   75.
          
          
          
          Eve holds the plant.
          Her "RETURN TO AXIOM SUPERIOR" flashes in her display.
          She considers it for a moment...
          ...then tosses the plant to the floor.
          I don't care about the plant anymore.
          She holds her hand out to him.
          
                                        EVE
                        Directive.
          
          Wall-E struggles to lift his hand to Eve's.
          He reaches out...
          
          ...and bats her hand away.
          
          Surprises Eve.
          Wall-E pushes past her.
          Crawls over to the discarded plant.
          Gives it back to Eve.
          
                                        WALL-E
                               (weak)
                        Errr.....
          
          Eve can't make out what he is saying.
          Wall-E fumbles around his box.
          Pulls out...
          ...the Zippo lighter.
          Lights it.
          Eve stares at the flame.
          
                                        EVE
                        Earth?
          
          Wall-E nods.
          
                                        WALL-E
                        Earth.
          
          He moves his binocular   eyes up and down.
          Like the time he fixed   his broken eye.
          You can fix me, Eve.
          With spare parts in my   truck.
          The truck that is back   on...
          
                                     EVE
                        Earth! Earth!
          
          Her eyes light up.
          She understands!
          No time to lose.
          She scoops him up...
          
                                                                   76.
          
          
          
                                         WALL-E
                          M-O?
          
                                         M-O
                                   ("I'm comin'!")
                          Wall-E!
          
          M-O rushes over to Wall-E.

          Hangs onto his IGLOO LATCH with his roller.
          Eve raises her gun arm...
          ...Blasts a HOLE IN THE CEILING.
          Takes off with the two of them.
          Up through the garbage chute.
          The WALL-As wave goodbye.
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - NIGHT
          
          A steward moves down the hall.
          Siren wailing.
          Scans for rogue robots.
          Eve and Wall-E's "Warning" image on his display screen.
          He stops in front of...
          
          A YELLOW LINE
          
          painted haphazardly on the floor.
          Follows it to a STORAGE CLOSET door.
          
                                         STEWARD
                          Wrong.
          
          The steward opens the closet.
          Inside, a PAINT-BOT hides his head in the corner.
          The yellow line leads straight to his rear brush.
          The Steward apprehends him with his SUSPENSION BEAM.
          
          Suddenly, everything begins to shake.
          The steward looks around, confused.
          A JET ENGINE NOISE builds.
          Seems to be coming from...
          
          ...the hallway TRASH CHUTE.
          
          Eve, Wall-E & M-O burst out from it.
          The paint-bot recognizes Wall-E.
          Beeps the POYSC song.
          Our savior has arrived!
          The steward's alarm goes haywire.
          
          ON STEWARD'S POV DISPLAY
          
          He takes a snapshot:
          Eve, holding Wall-E, holding the plant...
          
                                                                 77.
          
          
          ...and Eve is aiming her gun straight at camera.
          
          ANGLE ON STORAGE CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The terrified steward is thrown in.
          
                                     STEWARD
                        Please hold. We are currently having
                        technical difficul -- !
          
          Eve locks the door on him.
          The trio take off down the hall.
          The freed paint-bot gives chase.
          Cheers POYSC as he follows.
          Wall-E, only half-functioning, gets an idea.
          Presses his PLAY BUTTON.
          POYSC BLARES through the hallway.
          
          ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS
          
          REJECTS come out of hiding as they hear the music.
          Parade after Eve and Wall-E.
          Hum POYSC.
          All following the pied piper.
          
          ON SCREENS AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          Eve and Wall-E's "Wanted" image instantly circulates.
          Alarms sound.
          Alert screens pop up around the sleeping ship.
          
                                     SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.)
                        Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue
                        robots...
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          Auto observes the same "Wanted" image.
          
                                     AUTO
                        Not possible.
          
          Raises a screen showing a DECK PLAN OF THE AXIOM.
          It highlights Eve and Wall-E's location.
          Auto activates every steward on the Axiom.
          
          ON VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE AXIOM - NIGHT
          
          Stewards eject from their wall stations.
          Like ATMs jumping to life.
          Race in the direction of Eve.
          Carelessly knock over stray passengers in their way.
          
                                                                    78.

                        ...Caution: Rogue Robots...
          
          BACK ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Auto watches the deck plan display.
          Monitors the progress of all the stewards.
          The CAMERA DROPS THROUGH THE FLOOR, down to...
          
          THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          The Captain, still trapped.
          Rams his hover chair against the locked elevator door.
          Has no effect.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                               (hoarse; exhausted)
                        Mutinyyy...Mute...neee...This is your
                        last chance...Auto...You hear

                        robots...
          
          A flashing light catches his attention.
          Outside his window.
          He looks up on the SKY DOME...
          A GIANT "WANTED" IMAGE of Eve and Wall-E, holding...
          
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        The plant!
          
          The Captain's eyes light up.
          Glances down at the OPEN MANUAL on the floor.
          "Plant icon + Holo-detector icon = Earth"
          He is filled with renewed determination.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        (Laughs) We'll see who's powerless now.
          
          Lays flat in his chair.
          Floats under his VANITY CONSOLE like a grease monkey.
          Pulls off the underside panel.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        Ah-Ha!
          
          Yanks out a bundle of wiring.
          Cross-connects two wires.
          The console powers up...
          
                                                                     79.
          
          
          
          
          INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNELS - NIGHT
          
          Eve zooms through the hallways.
          A BAND OF REJECTS track behind them.
          They reach an intersection when...
          
          ...The CAPTAIN'S FACE appears on holo-screens all around
          them.
          
                                     CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Testing, testing... Is this thing on?
          
          ALL AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          All screens display the Captain's live feed.
          He's absolutely everywhere.
          A few stray passengers are still up.
          Watch their screens in confusion.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
          
          Auto watches the Captain on the holo-screen.
          Furiously tries to shut off the intercom.
          
          BACK ON EVE AND WALL-E
          
                                     CAPTAIN (OVER INTERCOM)
                        Psssst! Hey! Hey! This is the Captain I'm
                        locked in my room. Eve, Wall-E, bring the
                        plant to the Lido Deck. I'll have
                        activated the holo-detector. Now hurry!
                        Auto's probably going to cut me off --
          
          The screens all go dead.
          Eve and Wall-E look at each other with determination.
          They're about to continue on when...
          
          A WALL OF STEWARDS block their path.
          
                                    STEWARDS
                        Halt.
          
          Dozens of them stand in a row.
          Eve fires her gun. Destroys a steward.
          Another one quickly takes its place.
          Traps her arm with its SUSPENSION BEAM.
          She can't shoot.
          The stewards advance, when suddenly...
          
          ...the Rejects charge the stewards:
          
          ...The beautician-bot deflects rays with her mirrors...
          ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in their faces...
          
                                                                      80.
          
          
          ...The defib-bot shocks them with her paddles...
          ...The umbrella-bot opens up...
          ...Shields the others from the attack...
          
          BEHIND THE UMBRELLA-BOT
          
          A weak Wall-E activates his welding beam.
          Shorts out the Massage-bot's ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET.
          It goes berserk.
          Leaps at the entire army of Stewards.
          Robot parts fly everywhere.
          Eve and Wall-E can't watch the carnage.
          
          BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS
          
          He sets Eve's CYLINDRICAL DEVICE on the floor behind him.
          It projects her stored memories.
          
          UP ON THE BRIDGE
          
          Auto watches steward blips disappear from his screen.
          A MESSAGE SCREEN pops up.
          It's the Captain.
          
          ...and he's holding the plant?
          
                                       CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN)
                          Ha, ha! Look what I got, Auto!
          
          Auto's single lens irises wide.
          
                                       AUTO
                          Not possible.
          
                                       CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN)
                          That's right! The plant! Oh, you want it?
                          Come and get it, Blinky!
          
                                      AUTO
                          No.
          
          
          INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME
          
          The Captain   hovers in front of Eve's memory screen.
          It projects   a STILL IMAGE OF WALL-E HOLDING THE PLANT.
          The Captain   blocks the camera's view of Wall-E.
          Pretends to   be holding the projected plant himself.
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                          Ha ha!
          
          HEARS AUTO coming.
          Turns off the vid-com.
          
                                                                      81.
          
          
          Yanks his bundle of wires out of the wall.
          The room goes dark again.
          
          CLOSE ON CEILING
          
          The aperture opens.
          Auto lowers into the dark.
          Cautiously searches the empty room...
          
                                       AUTO
                          Captain? Captain...?
          
          ON AUTO'S POV
          
          PANS across the portraits of other captains...
          ...past our present Captain...
          ...The eyes in the portrait dart nervously...
          -- wait a minute.
          
          The Captain lunges at him.
          Grabs Auto by the steering wheel.
          Hangs onto it like Cap'n Ahab in a gale.
          His lower extremities of no use.
          
                                       AUTO
                          Let go. Let go.
          
          Auto panics.
          Zips back up through the hole in the ceiling.
          The Captain gets stuck between floors...
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          What too heavy for ya, huh?!
          
          UP ON THE BRIDGE
          
          ...Auto tries to pull free.
          The Captain won't let go.
          Auto ends up yanking him through.
          The Captain rides Auto like a bucking bronco.
          Auto swings violently back and forth.
          
                                       CAPTAIN
                          You're not getting away from me, one-eye!
                          -- OOF! -- Is that all you got?!
          
          Gopher drops out of his pneumatic tube.
          Sees the Captain fighting Auto.
          Charges at the Captain...
          
          ...who kicks him straight out the window...
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
                                                                      82.
          
          
          
          Gopher plummets...
          ...his SHADOW growing over the POOL...
          ...and smashes in a heap on the cement.
          The end.
          
          ON WALL-E AND EVE
          
          We PAN OVER the smoking wreckage of the stewards.
          The massage-bot floats above it all.
          Pants like a wild beast.
          One steward still twitches.
          The massage-bot crushes him with one blow.
          
          Eve grabs Wall-E and the plant.
          They take off for the Concourse Level.
          M-O and the Rejects follow behind.
          
          ON THE BRIDGE
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           That's it!...A little closer!
                           Must..press...button.
          
          The Captain reaches his one free hand out for...
          ...the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                           Gotcha! Ha ha!
          
          His hand slams down hard on it.
          KLAXONS sound all over the ship.
          
          VARIOUS ANGLES AROUND THE AXIOM
          
          ...Floodlights kick on everywhere...
          ...The LIDO DECK POOLS automatically cover up...
          ...Stray PASSENGERS pause to take in the alarms...
          ...SPACE-LIFE PRESERVERS burst from their hover chairs...
          ...Inflate around their necks...
          ...GREEN LINES appear on the floors...
          ...SLEEPING PASSENGERS are involuntarily led out of their
          cabins...
          ...Every hover chair follows the illuminated lines...
          
          The procedure is completely automated.
          The passengers are all confused.
          Helpless to stop it.
          
          
          INT. LIDO DECK
          
          The passengers glide in by the thousands.
          Form concentric circles over the closed-up pools.
          Fill the multi-storied balconies on all sides.
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
          
          ON JOHN AND MARY
          
          They arrive together at the Lido Deck.
          Mary notices a group of toddlers scared and crying.
          A NANNY-BOT tries vainly to placate them.
          
                                      NANNY-BOT
                         Remain calm. Remain calm.
          
          CLOSE ON BRIDGE PLAZA
          
          The BNL LOGO on the floor rotates.
          A large cylindrical device rises from the stage...
          
          ...The ship's HOLO-DETECTOR.
          
          JUMBOTRONS activate on the dome.
          Show the bridge.
          Everyone can see the Captain wrestling Auto.
          He tries to speak to them during the fight:
          
                                      CAPTAIN
                                (strained; in command)
                         Ladies and Gentlemen! This is your
                         Captain speaking! We're having a slight
                         malfunction with the Autopilot! Please
                         remain calm!
          
          The passengers get caught up in the conflict.
          Treat it as if it were a televised fight.
          
          ON THE REAR OF THE DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E fly out of the transport tunnel.
          Make a beeline for the holo-detector.
          Ready and waiting for the plant...
          
          ...almost there...
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
                                     AUTO
                         Enough.
          
          Auto furiously spins his wheel.
          Throws the Captain to the floor.
          The entire ship lists dangerously to one side.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
          Eve and Wall-E slam into the holo-detector's side.
          Wall-E drops the plant.
          It tumbles off the bridge plaza.
          Eve is forced to set Wall-E down.
          
                                                                    84.
          
          
          He clings to the holo-detector.
          She flies off to retrieve the plant.
          
          The hover chairs stay locked on their lines.
          Passengers all slip off their chairs.
          Their uniform color defaults back to RED.
          Slowly slide across the deck.
          And for the first time...
          ...all of humanity reaches out to one another.
          CLOSE UPS of hands holding hands.
          
          Everyone piles up on the listing side.
          The plant is buried underneath the mass of humanity.
          Eve searches desperately amongst them.
          
          ON JOHN & MARY
          
          They hang together off their chairs.
          CRYING TODDLERS just above them.
          The kiddies slip out of their hover rings.
          Mary GASPS in horror.
          Yells to John:
          
                                        MARY
                           John, get ready to have some kids!
          
          They purposefully let go of their chairs.
          Grab hands, forming a human chain.
          Catch the toddlers.
          All slide together down the Lido Deck.
          The TODDLERS GIGGLE the whole way down.
          They land at the bottom, next to Eve.
          
          An empty monorail car tips off the upper deck...
          ...lands on the pool level.
          It begins sliding down the Lido Deck.
          Smashes vacant hover chairs in its wake.
          
                                           MARY
                                  (Gasp)
                           LOOK OUT!
          
          Eve looks   up. Sees the Monorail sliding towards them.
          She stops   the car before it hits.
          Struggles   to hold it up.
          Can't let   it crush the passengers below her.
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          Auto keeps the ship tilted.
          Glides over to the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON.
          Switches it off.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
                                                                       85.
          
          
          
          The holo-detector begins to lower back into the floor...
          Wall-E is still hanging onto it.
          Barely functioning.
          He uses all his strength...
          
          ...and wedges himself under the UPPER LIP of the detector.
          
          Stops it from disappearing into the floor.
          The pressure squeezes Wall-E into a box.
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          The holo-detector button buzzes and flashes.
          Something's wrong.
          Auto calls up a LIDO DECK SECURITY CAMERA VIEW.
          Discovers Wall-E wedged in the device.
          
                                    AUTO
                           No.
          
          Auto presses down on the "off" button.
          
          ON WALL-E
          
          The holo-detector's hydraulics fight against him.
          Wall-E desperately fights to hold it up.
          Begins slowly to expand himself...
          
          ...and push the holo-detector back up!!
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          The Captain watches Wall-E's heroic rise on screen.
          Auto flips out his TASER.
          Jams it into the "off" button.
          Short circuits it.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                           NO!!
          
          BACK ON WALL-E
          
          The holo-detector reverses full force.
          Crushes Wall-E.
          We can't tell if he survived the crush.
          
          Eve calls out for him.
          Trapped, holding up the monorail car above the passengers.
          
          BACK ON BRIDGE
          
          The Captain watches Wall-E being crushed.
          That's it.
          He braces his arms against the floor...
          
                                                                 86.
          
          
          ...and rises up on HIS OWN TWO FEET...
          
          ON JUMBOTRON SCREEN
          
          The passengers collectively GASP.
          Their Captain is standing...
          ...and walking himself up the railing...
          ...towards Auto!
          They CHEER!
          
          ON BRIDGE
          
          Auto hears the distant cheering.
          Wonders what's up.
          
                                       CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                           Auto!
          
          Auto whips around.
          Shocked to see the Captain standing (albeit wobbly).
          Finds himself face to face with him.
          Auto flips out his TASER.
          Rushes at him.
          The Captain grabs it. They wrestle.
          The taser ARCS in the Captain's face.
          He flinches. Looks up.
          Sees a CONTROL PANEL high up on Auto's column...
          
          ...and smirks.
          
          The Captain looks Auto in the eye.
          Raises a finger up to the control panel...
          ...to the "AUTOPILOT" BUTTON...
          ...and flicks the switch to "MANUAL".
          
                                        CAPTAIN
                                  (grits his teeth)
                           Auto, you are relieved of duty.
          
                                       AUTO
                           Noo --
          
          Auto is instantly turned off.
          The Captain smiles triumphantly.
          Grabs the wheel with both hands.
          Makes the ship level again.
          
          ON LIDO DECK
          
          The passengers all spill across the deck.
          Shaken but OK.
          Eve sets the monorail down.
          Rockets over to the holo-detector.
          
                                                                     87.
          
          
          
          Wall-E is pinned under the lip of the holo-detector.
          Eve tries to lift it up.
          It won't budge.
          She looks back to the crowd.
          
                                     EVE
                        PLANT! PLANT!
          
          ON M-O
          
          He searches the crowd for the plant.
          Humans begin to stand for the first time all around him.
          Through his POV he spots the plant mixed in among them.
          "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT" flashes on his display screen.
          
          ON EVE
          
          She fights to keep the machine from crushing Wall-E further.
          
                                      M-O (O.S.)
                        Ee-vah!
          
          M-O holds the plant up from across the Lido Deck.
          The vacu-bot shoots it into the hands of a passenger.
          Humans and robots form an impromptu fire line.
          Toss it up to Eve on stage.
          She shoves the plant into the device.
          The detector instantly scans the plant.

                        Earth.
          
          Slowly, the holo-detector rises...
          Wall-E topples out from underneath.
          Badly crushed and leaking oil.
          Eve GASPS in horror.
          M-O and the Rejects avert their eyes.
          Passengers recoil as well.

          It converts into a GIANT STAR CHART.
          Rapidly plots a course for Earth.

          Eve lifts Wall-E up.
          No sign of life.
          
                                      EVE
                        No! WALL-E!!
          
                                                                    88.
          
          
          
          M-O's head drops in despair.
          The passengers witness grief for the first time.
          Begin to have new feelings of their own: sadness, sympathy.
          Mary begins to cry.
          Buries her head in John's shoulder.
          
                                        MARY
                           Oh no! Wall-E...

          The ceiling countdown hits "0:00."
          
          
          EXT. AXIOM
          
          The ship jumps to light speed.
          
          BACK INSIDE
          
          The passengers and robots are thrown off their feet.
          Everyone holds on to one another.
          
          
          INT. BRIDGE
          
          The Captain struggles to keep control of the steering wheel.
          Fights the G-forces.
          
          
          INT. LIDO DECK
          
          Humans and robots hang on for dear life.
          John and Mary cling to each other and the babies.
          
          ON EVE
          
          She holds tightly to Wall-E.
          Still calling out his name.
          No response.
          
          ON SPACE
          
          The Axiom zooms through hyperspace.
          
          
          EXT. EARTH - HILLSIDE - DAY
          
          The cockroach waits obediently on the hill.
          Exactly where Wall-E told him to stay.
          His antennae twitch with boredom.
          
                                                                     89.
          
          
          
          A RED DOT
          
          appears on the ground.
          The cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside.
          The ground begins to shake.
          Daylight dims.
          The insect looks to the sky.
          
          ON CLOUD COVER
          
          A DARK PATCH grows behind the clouds.
          Blots out the sunlight.
          The Axiom's keel breaks through.
          Its shadow swallows up the entire landscape.
          
          The cockroach senses his master's return.
          HUNDREDS OF RED DOTS rush past him.
          He eagerly chases after them.
          
          ON AXIOM
          
          The city-size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky.
          Pushes back the clouds to the horizon.
          
          
          EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF BAY - AXIOM PORT
          
          The CIRCLE OF DOTS triangulate over the abandoned berth.
          Converge over the port's LANDING SHAFT.
          Thousands of feet deep.
          The ship's keel descends into it.
          The earth shudders.
          Trash towers tumble in the distance.
          
          ...Then all is quiet.
          
          ON BELLY OF THE AXIOM
          
          A ROW OF GIANT DOORS open on the side of the ship.
          MULTIPLE GANGWAYS automatically extend.
          Connect with BUILT-IN TERMINALS on the port.
          
          The Captain walks out gingerly.
          Holding the boot w/ plant.
          The other passengers step out on their own legs.
          Wobble like toddlers.
          They squint up at the harsh sunlight.
          A commotion is heard from the back.
          Somebody trying to push through.
          
          EVE
          
          appears out of the crowd.
          Cradles a BOXED UP WALL-E in her arms.
          
                                                                      90.
          
          
          M-O and the Rejects follow behind her.
          They rush across the gangway.
          
          The cockroach meets up with Eve.
          Climbs up onto Wall-E.
          Doesn't understand why his master isn't responding.
          Eve urgently scans the landscape.
          Locks on to WALL-E'S TRUCK in the distance.
          She takes to the air.
          M-O and the Rejects chase after her down the gangway.
          
                                     M-O
                               (beeps)
                        [Eve! Wait!]
          
          The Captain respectfully removes his hat.
          Good luck, friend.
          
          
          INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK
          
          The interior is dark and still.
          Suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens.
          Eve flies inside with Wall-E.
          Sets him on the floor.
          
          She scans the rotating shelves at high speed.
          Grabs a CAR JACK.
          Ratchets up Wall-E's crushed body...
          
          QUICK SHOTS
          
          ...SPARE PARTS being grabbed by Eve...
          ...Frantically installs the new parts into Wall-E...
          ...Her arms a blur of precision in motion...
          ...Replaces his damaged CIRCUIT BOARD. The final piece...
          ...She opens his new solar panels...
          
          ...and BLASTS a hole in the ceiling with her gun.
          
          OUT ON THE EMPTY BAY
          
          The rejects stop.
          See the roof of Wall-E's truck explode.
          Oh no.
          
          BACK IN THE TRUCK
          
          A shaft of sunlight beams down on Wall-E.
          Eve holds her breath, watches...
          Waits...
          
          ...Beep...
          ...Beep...
          
                                                                       91.
          
          
          
                                     WALL-E (O.S.)
                        (Apple "reboot" SFX)
          
          Wall-E's meter fully charges.
          His head slowly rises from his box.
          Blinks.
          The cockroach hops with joy.
          Eve is relieved.
          
          ...She holds out her hand to him.
          
                                     EVE
                               (with love)
                        Wall-E...
          
          Wall-E gives her a blank stare.
          He turns away from Eve. Motors out the truck.
          She grabs him.
          Turns him back around.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (It's me!)
                        Eve!
          
          Wall-E just stares.
          Doesn't seem to know who she is.
          
                                      EVE
                               (hums)
                        [Here, look at these.]
          
          She grabs the RUBIK'S CUBE and LIGHT BULB from the shelf.
          The light bulb glows in her hand.
          She gives them to Wall-E.
          No reaction.
          
                                       EVE
                                 (Remember?)
                        Wall-E?
          
          Wall-E looks blankly at the junk on the shelves.
          
                                        EVE
                               (hums)
                        [I know!]
          
          She hovers over to the video player.
          Plays HELLO DOLLY.
          Looks back to see if it has any effect.
          
          Wall-E is over at the shelves.
          Has scooped all his prized possessions into his compactor.
          Crushes them into a cube.
          Eve is gut-punched.
          
                                                                 92.
          
          
          Wall-E motors outside.
          Runs over the cockroach on his way out.
          The insect pops back to life.
          Watches his friend in shock.
          
          
          EXT. WALL-E'S TRUCK - DAY
          
          Wall-E rolls up to a nearby trash pile.
          Scoops up trash. Spits out a cube.
          Eve hovers over to him.
          Still in disbelief.
          
                                    EVE
                              (somber)
                        No.
          
          Wall-E continues to stack his cubes.
          She stops him.
          Lifts his head. Stares into his eyes.
          Nobody home.
          Eve presses his "play" button.
          Nothing but STATIC.
          Eve begins to panic.
          Shakes him.
          
                                     EVE
                        Wall-E...Wall-E! WALL-E!
          
          No response.
          He's gone.
          She hovers in silence next to him for a long time...
          
          Finally, Eve grasps Wall-E's hand.
          Forces his fingers to interlace with hers.
          Holds him close one last time.
          Leans her head against his.
          Hums softly.
          
                                       EVE
                        [Hums IOTAM]
          
          She touches her forehead to his.
          Goodbye Wall-E.
          A TINY SPARK between them.
          
          Eve turns to hover away.
          Jerked back.
          Her fingers caught between his.
          She checks his eyes again.
          Nothing.
          
          But then...
          
                                                                   93.
          
          
          ...a tiny SERVO NOISE.
          She looks down at their hands.
          
          CLOSE ON WALL-E'S FINGERS
          
          They start to move.
          Slowly close around Eve's.
          
          She looks back at his face.
          Wall-E's eyes gradually come into focus.
          His brows raise...
          
                                       WALL-E
                         Ee-vah?
          
                                       EVE
                         Wall-E!
          
          He notices their hands entwined.
          His dream come true.
          
                                      WALL-E
                                (amazed)
                         Ee-vah!!
          
          She giggles.
          
          INSIDE THE TRUCK
          
          The "Hello Dolly" tape reaches the finale of IOTAM.
          
          "And that is all that love's about..."
          
          BACK OUTSIDE
          
          Eve and Wall-E stare into each other's eyes.
          M-O and the Rejects finally reach the truck.
          They begin to celebrate.
          Wall-E's alive!
          Then M-O realizes they need privacy.
          Herds the Rejects O.S.
          
                                      M-O
                         Go! Go, go go!
          
          Wall-E and Eve's foreheads touch.
          Together now and ever more.
          
          "...and we'll recall when time runs out..."
          
                                                           DISSOLVE TO:
          
          CLOSE UP OF THE PLANT
          
                                                                  94.
          
          
          
          Newly planted in the earth.
          Small hands water it gently.
          PULL OUT to reveal it surrounded by kids.
          The Captain instructs them.
          John and Mary help unload equipment from the Axiom.
          Robots and passengers stream off the ship.
          
                                     CAPTAIN
                        This is called "farming"! You kids are
                        going to grow all kinds of plants:
                        vegetable plants, pizza plants!
                               (laughs)
                        Ahh, it's good to be home...
          
          The CAMERA PULLS OUT from the Axiom...
          ...over the bay...
          
          "...That it only took a moment..."
          
          ...past Wall-E & Eve holding hands in his truck...
          ...over M-O and the Rejects cleaning outside...
          ...Through the trash towers of the city...
          ...past a FIELD OF PLANTS, sprouting from its peak...

          EXT. MODERN CIRCUS GROUNDS - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT

          An upstate New York town. A CIRCUS is being dismantled...The
          Big Top falls and is gathered up by workmen...Trucks are
          being loaded with animals.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          AN ELDERLY MAN , JACOB JANKOWSKI - 93 year old - stands
          alone, with a walker in the middle of the empty parking lot.
          His shirt is stained with sweat - as if it took great effort
          for him to get there. As he watches the Circus disappear,
          Jacob looks lost, bewildered and fragile.
          CHARLIE, 50's circus manager, and RUSS, a tattooed teen with
          rings through his eyebrows, approach him with a wheelchair.

                         CHARLIE
          Excuse me sir, can we help you?
          (No reply from Jacob)
          Did you miss your ride?

                         JACOB
          I missed the Spec.

                         RUSS
          The what?

                         CHARLIE
          Yes, I'm afraid you did. Can we
          call someone for you?

                         JACOB

                         (SAD)
          Where'd it all go?

                         RUSS
          He's seriously old.

                         CHARLIE
          Did you come with the folks from
          the retirement home?

                         JACOB
          No, I came on my own.

                         CHARLIE

                         (IGNORING HIM)
          Let's go inside and we can call
          them to pick you up.
          Charlie motions for Russ to get Jacob in the wheelchair.
          Jacob resists.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         JACOB
          No, I told ya, I came on my own and
          I'm not going back. Get your hands
          off me.

                         RUSS
          (as if talking to a child)
          It's OK. We're gonna call the home
          so they can come pick you up.

                         JACOB

                         (SUDDENLY LUCID)
          Why don't you pick some of those
          rings out ya head maybe you won't
          be so stupid, ya dumb little shit.

                         RUSS
          Woah! The language. Uncalled for.

                         CHARLIE
          Sir, we need to get you out of this
          parking lot. My trucks have to come
          through here. Please...
          He offers the wheelchair. Jacob relents and sits.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          I got it Russ. Take the walker.
          Finish closing up the ticket booth.
          Russ takes the walker and exits as Charlie wheels Jacob.

                         JACOB
          In my day, they had old timers in
          the ticket wicket and freaks like
          him in the sideshow. Damn kid
          didn't even know what the Spec was.

                         CHARLIE
          You sound like you know circuses.
          Charlie checks his watch, impatient to get Jacob home.

                         JACOB
          I should. I was on two.

                         CHARLIE
          (Calling OS to Trucks)
          Malcolm, tell them to come through!
          (Patronizing, to Jacob)
          Two circuses. Wow, that's
          something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         JACOB
          Ringling, of course, but that was
          later...

                         CHARLIE
          I'll need your name when I call the
          home.

                         JACOB
          ...First one was called Benzini
          Brothers Most Spectacular Show ...
          Charlie suddenly stops upon hearing that name.

                         CHARLIE
          What?...Wait a minute! Did you say
          you were with the Benzini Brothers?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          What years?

                         JACOB

          1931.

                         CHARLIE
          "31?...You're saying you were there
          for the---?

                         JACOB
          I was in the middle of it.

                         CHARLIE

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          I don't believe this. After the
          Hartford Fire and the Hagenback-
          Wallace Wreck, that's the most
          famous circus disaster of all time.

                         JACOB
          I remember it like yesterday...
          Better - cause I don't remember
          yesterday.

                         CHARLIE

                         (EXTENDS HAND)
          Charlie O'Brien the third.

                         JACOB
          Jacob Jankowski the only.

                         CHARLIE
          Mr. Jankowski, I would be honored
          if you would have a drink with me
          in my trailer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

          INT. CHARLIE'S TRAILER -CIRCUS GROUNDS - TWILIGHT

          A bottle of expensive, Laphroaig scotch sits on the table.
          Charlie pours them each a shot. Jacobs drinks. It feels good.

                         JACOB
          (to the Scotch)
          Ah, I remember you...Camel would've
          loved this stuff.

                         CHARLIE
          Camels drink scotch?
          Jacob laughs, shaking his head No. Charlie pours another;

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          You really got here on you're own?

                         JACOB
          The Great Escape! But I got lost.

                         CHARLIE
          I should call the home, let them
          know where you are.

                         JACOB
          I don't know why they call it a
          "home". You don't know anybody
          there. They fill you so full of
          drugs, you don't care...Five kids
          and not one has a place for me
          since their mother died. They take
          turns visiting me on weekends. They
          forgot whose turn it was today so
          nobody showed up..

                         (BEAT)
          I had a life, ya know. A big
          life...It isn't right.
          Charlie empathizes. Pours another. Changes the subject.

                         CHARLIE
          So, how did the Benzini Brothers
          stampede start? The story is two
          guys got thrown off the train and--

                         JACOB
          No point in telling a story if all
          you want to know is the end.

                         CHARLIE
          Sorry. From the beginning.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         JACOB
          Now, let's see...the beginning...
          Well, everything began the same day
          everything ended...Ha, isn't that
          how it always works?...

          INT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - JACOB'S BATHROOM - 1931 - MORNING

          A mirrored medicine cabinet closes revealing the reflection
          of JACOB JANKOWSKI - 23 years old, handsome, full of energy.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          It was a big day. My final exams.

          INT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

          Jacob bounds down the stairs and into the kitchen.
          JACOB'S MOTHER AND FATHER are finishing up breakfast. The
          Father tunes a Philco Radio while smoking a pipe...The Mother
          pours coffee wearing a cardigan sweater and pearls.
          Late for class, Jacob grabs a piece of bread and bacon and
          downs a coffee as his mother sweetly scolds him in POLISH...
          His father says something supportive in POLISH as well. Jacob
          thanks him in POLISH. He kisses his mother and exits.

          EXT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - ITHACA NY - 1931 - MORNING

          A simple, clapboard house in a middle class neighborhood.
          Jacob runs out, passing his father's sign on the front lawn:

          E. JANKOWSKI
          Doctor of Veterinary Medicine

          EXT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - 1931 - ITHACA, NY - DAY.

          The beautiful campus of Cornell University. Jacob runs.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          After six years of dissections,
          castrations, foalings and shoving
          my arm up a cow's ass more times
          than I cared to remember, I was
          finally going to graduate Cornell
          in Veterinary Science. I was summa
          cum laude...ha,ha and the oldest
          male virgin on campus.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

          INT. CORNELL UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL, 1931 - ITHACA, NY - DAY

          Jacob sits beside a beautiful Blonde who distracts him with
          her legs. She notices him staring, crosses her legs and
          smooths her skirt.
          VETERINARY SCIENCES FINAL EXAMS is written on the board of a
          Lecture Hall. The Proctor announces from his desk.

                         THE PROCTOR
          You may begin.
          Jacob, the Blonde and fifty other students open their exam
          booklets and begin under The PROCTOR's supervision.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I had my whole life planned. I knew
          exactly where it was taking me...
          And then, with the opening of a
          door, it all vanished.
          The Lecture Hall door opens and DEAN WILKINS enters. The Dean
          walks to the Proctor and they confer privately. Then:

                         THE PROCTOR
          Mr. Jankowski? May we have a word?
          Fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at Jacob, who looks up.

          EXT. LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          Jacob steps outside with Dean Wilkins.

                         DEAN WILKINS
          Jacob, it's your parents. I'm
          afraid there's been a car accident.

          INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - ITHACA HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Jacob walks down a dimly lit hall with a Police Chief and a
          Chaplain to the Morgue led by a Nurse. We follow them inside.

          INT. CORONER'S MORGUE - ITHACA HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          The room is windowless and bare except for TWO GURNEYS, each
          with a sheet-covered body. A CORONER stands between them.
          Jacob sees a steel table upon which lay his parents
          belongings; wedding rings, pearl necklace, his father's pipe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         CORONER
          Are you ready?
          The Chaplain places a comforting hand on Jacob's shoulder.
          Jacob nods. The Coroner exposes first Jacob's father, then
          Jacob's mother. We see only Jacob's expression:

                         CHAPLAIN
          Is there any other family to call?

                         JACOB
          No. Just me.

          INT. EDMUND HYDE LAW OFFICES - DAY

          Jacob, in a black suit. Mr. Hyde is seated opposite him.

                         HYDE
          I know this is difficult for you,
          but there's been no mistake. The
          house and all their assets,
          including your father's practise,
          are now property of the bank in
          default of the mortgage.

                         JACOB
          But I'm telling you, my father put
          away every penny he ever earned.
          They owned that house outright. Why
          would he have a mortgage?

                         HYDE
          My guess is because he let people
          pay him in beans & eggs or whatever
          they had, instead of money.

                         JACOB
          And so he's penalized for not
          turning away people who couldn't
          afford his help? He was a doctor.

                         HYDE
          Yes, I know, he was a very good man
          but in banking terms, in the
          reality of what makes this world
          actually function, he was an
          irresponsible man. I'm sorry, but
          you oughta to know the truth. This
          Depression is going to last for a
          long while..

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         HYDE (CONT'D)
          ..And the only ones who will be
          standing at the end of it, are the
          ones who fight to take what they
          need to survive. Everyone else is
          going to disappear. Don't make the
          same mistakes as your father.
          Jacob is disturbed by this description of his father.

          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - OUTSIDE ITHACA, NY - DAY

          Jacob in his black suit walking home..looks up ahead to see:

          EXT. JANKOWSKI HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          All the family possessions are on the lawn being scoured over
          by strangers: father's Philco radio, mother's jewelry...A
          foreclosure sign hangs beside his father's business sign:

          JACOB (V.O.)
          Things happened so fast, my head
          was spinning. And that mortgage...I
          just couldn't figure it out.
          A DELIVERY TRUCK pulls up at the curb. It is met by A BANK
          REPRESENTATIVE, who receives a package and carries it to
          Jacob, meeting him halfway.

                         BANK REPRESENTATIVE
          This just came for you, Jacob.
          Whatever it is I'm going to have to
          include in the bank's report of
          assets. Sorry. You OK?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          I also have documents to sign..
          The Bank Representative continues MOS as Jacob opens the
          package,

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I didn't believe the lawyer or the
          bank. My mother worked. They had
          savings. We were never broke. So
          why would they need a mortgage?
          And then it hit me...
          Jacob opens the package revealing a BRAND NEW SIGN, reading;

          E. JANKOWSKI AND SON

          DOCTORS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          They did it to pay for my Ivy
          League education.
          For a moment Jacob can't move. This thought stuns him. With
          his house being picked apart and the Bank Representative
          speaking about papers, Jacob can't take it any longer. He
          drops the sign and walks away. The Bank Rep calls after him:

                         BANK REPRESENTATIVE
          Jacob? Jacob they need these signed
          by the end of the business day.
          Jacob walks away from the Bank Rep, pulling off his tie and
          tossing it. He is crying - the reality finally hitting him.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I walked and I kept on walking...
          It's a strange feeling becoming an
          orphan the same time you're
          becoming a man...To have this
          freedom to be anything you want at
          the same time everything you were
          is taken away. So I just walked
          ...Then all of a sudden, I stopped.

          EXT. A CLEARING NEAR A STREAM - OUTSKIRTS OF ITHACA - NIGHT

          Jacob stands with his feet in a clear stream. He is no longer
          crying. There are dense woods, pitch black, all around him.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          Like I'd been sleepwalking and I
          woke up. I had no idea where I was.
          Jacob can hear the buzz of insects, the glow of fireflies and
          the cries of distant animals in the woods. It unnerves him.
          Far off beyond the dense woods Jacob sees A MOVING FLICKERING
          LIGHT - like a distant, silent star moving past the trees.
          The Light is moving around the woods until it curves towards
          Jacob's direction. He hears a distant CLANK-CLANK...
          Curious, Jacob puts his shoes on and walks back to a gravel
          path that leads to TRAIN TRACKS just as:

          THE MASSIVE TRAIN ENGINE EXPLODES INTO VIEW PASSING HIM.
          Jacob is so close, he is hit by a wall of wind that nearly
          knocks him down. It is dark and the train is moving fast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          What is it inside of us makes us
          decide to grab onto life again and
          again, no matter how many times it
          abandons us without a second
          thought?...What is it makes us
          hungry for more of the same?
          Somebody smart should figure that
          one out.
          Jacob makes his decision: He runs parallel to the
          train...stumbling over gravel, pitching forward and losing
          his balance, recovering, then running faster, scanning for
          something to grab hold of to hoist himself up. He sees:
          AN OPEN STOCK CAR IS THREE CARS BEHIND HIM...As it catches up
          to him, he lunges forward, reaching for the iron grab hold
          and flings himself upward. He clings on with his left leg,
          elbow and chin. His right hand clings to the grab hold. With
          his left hand, he claws the floorboards of the stock car, but
          the aged wood scraps off under his fingers. His right leg is
          dangling, beneath the train itself, dangerously close to the
          tracks. Jacob is slipping...slipping...
          With everything he's got, Jacob makes one final "life or
          death" effort, managing to get his left knee up over the
          edge. Using foot, knee, chin, elbow and fingernails, he
          scrapes his way inside the stock car and lies panting...

          INT. STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          A dim light barely illuminates the interior. Jacob breaths a
          brief sigh of relief and accomplishment when suddenly: A HUGE

          HAND CONNECTED TO A EVEN LARGER ARM COMES OUT OF THE

          DARKNESS, GRABBING JACOB BY HIS COLLAR, HOISTING HIM UP.
          Jacob swings at this Brute with his free arm but it's blocked
          easily, as the Brute moves him to the open car door.

          OLD TIMER (O.S.)
          Oh, don't go messin with Blackie.
          Throwing people off of trains is
          one of the perks of his job.
          Jacob can now see THREE MEN playing cards by a kerosene lamp.
          ONE MAN HAS A RIFLE, aimed at Jacob. Another, A SHRUNKEN,
          STUBBLE FACED OLD TIMER, drinks out of a jug...
          Blackie holds Jacob out on the edge of the open stock car, as
          trees slam against the train almost cutting Jacob's face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         BLACKIE
          We don't need no bums on this train
          brother. You can get off right now
          and keep running.
          Old Timer rises with a lantern and hobbles on one bad leg,
          inspects Jacob and his nice suit with the lantern...

                         OLD TIMER
          Now everybody calm down here. Grady
          put that damn rifle away. BLACKIE
          LET'IM GO...And I mean on the
          inside of the train!
          Jacob struggles as Blackie pins one arm behind him.

          OLD TIMER (CONT'D)
          I'm tellin ya, ya can't red light
          him, we don't need that trouble.
          Look at them clothes - he's no bum.
          Blackie scans Jacob's clothes, then tosses him inside the
          train and returns to the card game. Jacob pants, relieved.

          OLD TIMER (CONT'D)
          Don't be sore kid. It's more like a
          reflex with Blackie. I'm Camel..And
          that there's Grady. And Bill.

                         JACOB
          Jacob. Jankowski. Nice to meet you.

                         CAMEL
          You're pretty young for the rails.
          You running from something boy? You
          on the lam?

                         JACOB
          No. Nothing like that.

                         CAMEL
          Where you headed?

                         JACOB
          I don't know.

                         CAMEL
          Hungry? Outta work?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          No shame in it. What can you do?

                         JACOB
          About anything I guess.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Camel gives him the once-over look then offers the jug.

                         CAMEL
          We land in Deposit in the morning.
          We'll find you some work. And if
          you're still alive by the end of
          it, I'll get you some food and take
          you to Uncle August.
          Jacob drinks and chokes on the liquor.

                         JACOB
          Who's that?

                         GRADY
          August Rosenbluth...Lord and Master
          of the Known and Unknown Universes.
          Ringmaster Extraordinaire.
          Jacob looks baffled. Camel laughs as he drinks more;

                         CAMEL
          Oh kid, don't tell me you didn't
          notice?
          Grady and Bill laugh though Blackie remains un-amused.

                         BILL
          Ha, he really don't know.

                         CAMEL
          HA! You didn't just jump a train
          boy. You jumped the Flying Squadron
          of the Benzini Brothers Most
          Spectacular Show on Earth...
          You done landed your ass on a
          circus, kid!
          PRE-LAP: The Circus Train brakes screeching to a halt!

          INT. STOCK CAR - DEPOSIT, NY - DAWN.

          Jacob is rolled awake as the train stops. He is disoriented
          as Blackie, Grady and Bill jump out through the open stock
          car door. Camel is fast asleep, drunk from the jug.

          EXT. CIRCUS TRAIN/CIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT, NY - DAWN.

          The Train has stopped adjacent to a huge grassy lot. Beyond
          it, the scattered buildings of Deposit, NY backlit by dawn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          Jacob jumps out of the stock car, in awe of what he sees::
          Hundreds of dirty, unshaven men pouring out of the train
          like ants on candy. The wagons of the train are painted
          scarlet red with gold trim and sunburst wheels. Emblazoned on
          each wagon; BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH.
          Jacob wanders as the Circus is being created: Canvas tents
          are raised, the Big Top laying sprawled on the ground. Men
          standing over seams, lacing pieces together...Eight man
          sledge teams pound stakes into the ground at breakneck
          speed....Teams of men are raising enormous poles with their
          combined weight, chanting: Pull it! Shake it! Break it!
          Again!...Now down stake it!...Several teams horses pulling
          wagons are charging right for Jacob..
          Jacob jumps out of the way, nearly being run down. He is out
          of place...in the way of this finely tuned machine.
          Jacob ducks into a LARGE TENT for safety.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

          Jacob enters. A stillness takes the place of the chaos
          outside: The translucent tent is as tall as the sky. It has
          barely been set up - just the tent and:

          THE ANIMALS.
          Jacob is in awe. Camels, llamas, zebras and horses stand
          behind low ropes slung between iron stakes, some with their
          heads in mounds of hay.....Two giraffes stand within a chain-
          link fence....lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, bears, chimps
          and an Orangutan.
          The animals stop moving, as if to give Jacob an
          acknowledgement. Jacob responds with a nod or a smile.
          The Orangutan is stretching it's arm outside it's den for
          something out of reach. Jacob tries to understand.

                         JACOB
          What is it? What do you want?
          The Orangutan strains its arm. Blinking at him. Pointing.
          Jacob looks around and sees A HALF SQUASHED ORANGE on the
          ground in front of the cage. He picks it up.
          Jacob opens the den and hands the Orangutan the orange. She
          takes it and sets it on the floor of her den. She returns and
          reaches out for Jacob again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Jacob hesitates, not knowing what she wants. But deciding to
          trust her, Jacob extends his hand to hers.
          The Orangutan wraps her long fingers around Jacob's hand and
          holds it for a beat, looking to his face. Jacob returns the
          gaze, realizing she is thanking him. He is touched.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          You're welcome, ma'am.
          The Orangutan lets go and returns to the orange in her den.

          CAMEL (O.S.)
          What the hell you doing in here?
          Get outta there!! You ain't a
          menagerie man. Only menagerie men
          is allowed in there.
          Jacob runs out to Camel.

          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

          Camel escorts Jacob through the grounds to a baggage car.

                         CAMEL
          Gonna try to get you set up with
          Crazy Joe.

                         JACOB
          Do I call him Crazy Joe?

                         CAMEL
          It has been said Crazy Joe went to
          prison for killing a man who spit
          into the wind and hit the back of
          Joe's neck. So no, I would not call
          this man Crazy Joe to his face.
          Camel and Jacob walks on to an open stock car door, where
          CRAZY JOE stands - a burly man, missing three fingers.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)
          Hey Joe! I got a First of May here.
          Think you can use him?
          Crazy Joe scans Jacob, shoots an oyster of dark brown tobacco
          juice then disappears back inside. Camel tells Jacob;

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)
          You're in, kid.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

          INT/EXT. BAGGAGE STOCK CAR - DEPOSIT, NY - MORNING

          Jacob and another Young Man, WADE, with their shirts off, are
          shovelling tons of horse manure. Jacob is queasy, blinking
          from the stench. The Young Man doesn't seem bothered.

                         JACOB
          I've never seen so much manure!

                         WADE
          Baggage stock horses. They pack'em
          in 27 a car.

                         JACOB
          How do you stand the smell?

                         WADE
          What smell?

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT, NY - MORNING

          Jacob and several other Flying Squadron men struggle to pull
          on cables hoisting up the canvases on the Big Top. It takes a
          tremendous effort. Jacob uses every bit of strength.
          When the Big Top is raised, Jacob can't help but be impressed
          with the accomplishment as the local townsfolk (rubes) cheer.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - DAY

          Jacob struggles to shovel LLAMA manure out of the menagerie.
          He checks his hands - they are blistered and bleeding.

          EXT. SIDESHOW TENTS - MIDWAY - DEPOSIT, NY - AFTERNOON

          CECIL, THE BARKER, is "speechifying" from a platform beside
          the sideshow entrance, strutting back and forth, as a crowd
          gathers... Jacob and other working men, including Wade, are
          positioned around the perimeter of the crowd.

                         WADE
          When Cecil gives the signal ya
          gotta push the rubes in towards the
          entrance but without them catching
          on or else they'll be a fight.
          Jacob, Wade and the other men position themselves equidistant
          around the perimeter of the crowd facing Cecil.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          When Cecil pulls his ear (the Signal)...Jacob and the other
          men move forward, inching the crowd into the sideshow tents.

          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - DAY

          Jacob shovels YAK manure more easily having taped his
          blistered hands.

          EXT. BARBARA'S SHOW TENT - DEPOSIT, NY - LATE AFTERNOON.

          Grady hands Jacob a long lead pipe.

                         GRADY
          Stand inside the tent and smack the
          sides with this when you see a head
          trying to peek in without paying.
          Jacob follows Grady into the tent...

          INT. BARBARA'S SHOW TENT - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON.

          Jacob enters and is paralyzed by what he sees:
          Camera angles behind BARBARA - a topless woman on stage alone
          in front of rows of ogling men - as she maneuvers her breasts
          in circles flipping the tassels attached to them...The men
          hoot and holler for more as Barbara smiles encouragingly,
          hiding her routine boredom.
          Jacob is paralyzed by the sight of a naked woman.
          Grady frantically motions for Jacob to snap out of it and use
          the pipe at the heads sneaking under the tent to peek in...
          Startled out of his enthrallment, Jacob lifts the pipe too
          quickly and hits his own forehead. OW!..then proceeds to do
          his job, banging the heads thru the flaps.

          INT. CIRCUS GROUNDS/MENAGERIE TENT - DEPOSIT, NY - TWILIGHT

          Jacob shovels ZEBRA manure, no longer affected by the scent.
          By this point, the menagerie tent has been fully installed:
          Ten chandeliers hang and twinkle from the roof illuminating
          the a gloriously bannered candy stand in the tent's center.
          Jacob hears someone entering the menagerie. He turns to see;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          Behind the rows of beautiful black and white horses, Jacob
          catches flashes of pink sequins...pink tights...pink sequined
          gloves of a WOMAN caressing and whispering to them.
          She is MARLENA. Her shimmering eyes and hair. Her porcelain
          skin. Her pink sequins make her glisten and sparkle...
          Jacob is spellbound as he watches Marlena's gift with horses;
          Marlena uses signals with her whip or clicking sounds with
          her tongue to communicate with the horses: they line up at
          her subtle command, they raise their hooves, they bow down to
          her, rise up on their hind legs...
          She clicks her tongue and one White Silver Maned Horse lifts
          a hoof for her to inspect. She clicks for him to take a step.
          Jacob notices the Silver Maned Horse walks tenderly on the
          foot. He decides to help....Approaching the shimmering
          Marlena, Jacob looks like he's been shovelling shit all day.

                         JACOB
          Excuse me, ma'am? Hi. I'm Jacob.
          Marlena doesn't respond. She looks at him with suspicion.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          May I? He may be foundering.
          Marlena nods. Jacob also clicks his tongue as he glides his
          hands up Silver Star's fetlock. To Marlena's surprise, the
          horse trusts Jacob, lifting its hoof. Jacob examines it.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          He should be all right for tonight.
          But I'd put him on stall rest as
          soon as possible.
          He clicks his tongue and eases the hoof down. Marlena looks
          both impressed and insulted. Jacob smiles. Marlena does not.
          She clicks and assembles her horses in formation, then leads
          them out of the menagerie....Jacob looks after her adoringly.

                         WE PRE-LAP:

          diving into a tank of water...it is truly spectacular:

          JACOB (V.O.)
          You never saw anything like it. You
          could hardly take it all in without
          fearing you might go blind from the
          shine. From one kind of world too
          hard to bear came some kind a
          heaven no one knew existed.
          End on Jacob seeing: Marlena gloriously atop her horses who
          form a tableau, as a curtain of sparks falls behind them.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT, NY - MIDDLE OF NIGHT

          The Big Top drops. Poles topple. Horses, men and equipment
          dismantle the great city of tents.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          And then just as quickly, heaven
          was packed away and gone.

          INT. PERFORMER'S CAR - TRAIN EN ROUTE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

          As the train travels, a worn out Jacob sits cramped under a
          bunk beside A CONTORTIONIST taking up little space. Jacob
          voraciously eats a plate of food Camel snuck in for him.

                         CAMEL
          You like the food? You deserve it.
          You done good, I hear..

          19.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)

                         (JACOB CHOKES)
          ..Woah, you better take a breath
          before it all comes back up on ya.
          Here. Have a hit of Jake.
          He offers Jacob his "Jake". Jacob drinks and chokes.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)
          It's an acquired taste. Now get
          yourself outta there. I'm gonna
          take you in to see August.
          As Jacob squeezes out, the Contortionist unwinds himself and
          takes up more space.

                         JACOB
          But it's the middle of the night.

                         CAMEL
          Only time circus people live - when
          they don't have to work. Come on...

          INT. SLEEPING CARS/ PLATFORM - TRAIN - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

          Camel leads Jacob through various sleeping cars, revealing
          the lowly conditions of life on the road...wooden bunks, no
          private space, one bathroom for a dozen to share.

          THROUGHOUT THIS NARRATION WE JUMP CUT INTO VARIOUS CARS:
          - The Musicians Car: Men smoking, cleaning
          instruments...looking at Jacob with suspicion and wry humor.
          The Trumpet Player plays TAPS. Jacob doesn't understand why.

                         CAMEL
          I got a son about your age. Lives
          outside of Reading, PA. Haven't
          seen him for years. Fix your shirt
          there.
          Jacob shoves in his shirt. Camel smiles. He likes the kid.
          - The Clown Car: Clowns without make-up reading or playing
          cards. They look at Jacob as if he were walking the last
          mile. One Clown waves goodbye.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)
          Remember, when you meet August let
          him do the talking and don't ever
          mention Ringling. He hates them
          bastards worse than the Depression.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          - Barbara and the Coochie Girls Car; Girls in various forms
          of undress, negligees, sheer robes. Barbara exits a bathroom
          and bumps into Jacob, who fumbles seeing her half-nude;

                         BARBARA
          How's your pipe, kid?
          Camel leads the slack-jawed Jacob away.

                         CAMEL
          Night ladies.

          BARBARA AND GIRLS
          Night Camel.

          INT. PERFORMER STATEROOM CARS - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          Slightly more upscale and private quarters with a passenger
          aisle outside individual doors and windows.

                         JACOB
          Hey Camel - who's that woman who
          works the horses?

                         CAMEL

                         (STOPS)
          Now stop right there. That's
          Marlena. She don't talk to nobody
          and you don't talk to her. And
          don't mention her to August. Ain't
          no right way to talk about
          somebody's wife and make it sound
          like a compliment.

                         JACOB
          Wife?
          Camel takes this opportunity to drink some Jake and ask:

                         CAMEL
          Look, kid, before we do this, I
          gotta ask... ..I ain't tryin to
          know your business but I do know
          you ain't been on the road too
          long. You're too clean, your
          clothes too nice and you don't got
          a possession on you. See, a man on
          the road collects little things.
          It's not a big life I can tell ya.
          So before you start, I ask: if you
          got any kind of life to go back to,
          that's what you should do.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
          Jacob stops. He tries to not sound emotional when he says:

                         JACOB
          I don't.
          Camel studies him, as if understanding what isn't said.

                         CAMEL
          I am sorry to hear that.
          They move on.

          EXT. AUGUST'S PRIVATE CAR PLATFORM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          They reach a platform facing the fanciest car yet. Standing
          upon it is an enormous, muscular BALD MAN, EARL...

                         CAMEL
          This here's Earl. He's gonna take
          you in. Earl, this here's Jacob.

                         JACOB
          (shakes hands w/Camel)
          I don't know how to thank you.

                         CAMEL
          HA! You may not want to after you
          been on a show long as I have. Good
          luck to ya, kid.
          Camel exits OS. Alone with Earl, Jacob asks:

                         JACOB
          Do I look OK?

                         EARL
          Very nice.
          Then, with one hand Earl slides back the door and with the
          other hand, violently grabs Jacob by the neck and throws him
          head first into the car.

          INT. AUGUST'S PRIVATE CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob falls into Uncle August's opulent private car, with
          wood panelling, cushioned furniture and chandeliers.
          Sitting at a table playing cards are CECIL the Barker,
          DIAMOND JOE (menagerie and ring stock), MR. ERWIN (talent
          booker), CRAZY JOE (baggage stock) and, with his back to us
          in a high wing back chair, (UNCLE) AUGUST ROSENBLUTH.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.
          Earl shoves him against the wall, dangling him off the floor.
          As August speaks to Jacob, all we see is the back of his head
          and smoke from his cigar as he plays cards throughout...

                         AUGUST
          What's this?

                         EARL
          That stowaway the old drunk took
          under his wing. College boy.
          Jacob tries to explain but Earl bangs him against the wall.

                         AUGUST
          (to the game)
          I'll see your three and raise you
          five...

                         (TO JACOB)
          I don't believe I've had the
          pleasure.

                         JACOB
          Jacob Jankowski, sir.

                         AUGUST
          And what is a "Jacob Jankowski" and
          why he is on my train?

                         JACOB
          Just looking for work, sir.

          MR. ERWIN
          Can you fly? Set yourself on fire?

                         JACOB
          No sir.

                         AUGUST
          Ever worked a show, son?

                         JACOB
          No sir.

                         AUGUST
          Ever been to a show?

                         JACOB
          Yes sir...
          Jacob, sensing where this is going, gets August's attention;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Ringling Brothers.
          August stops playing cards. The others react with sudden
          apprehension. Earl casually shakes his head to warn Jacob.
          August finally rises and turns to Camera: handsome,
          charismatic, fiercely intelligent...matinee idol looks that
          mask a darker nature.

                         AUGUST
          Ringling, you say?

                         JACOB
          Yes. But it was terrible.

                         AUGUST
          Really? Have you seen our show?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          What was your favorite act?
          Jacob sees a CIRCUS POSTER with Marlena and her Horses.

                         JACOB
          The uh...the one with the black and
          white horses. And the girl in pink.

                         AUGUST
          Ah, our Star Attraction. Well, I
          believe we're looking for a boy to
          carry water for the elephants,
          aren't we Diamond Joe?

                         DIAMOND JOE
          We don't have an eleph-

                         AUGUST
          Shut-up.

                         JACOB
          I would do that, sir. I'd like to
          work with the animals.
          August and the others chuckle. Jacob doesn't understand why.
          August crosses to Jacob, as he ridicules:

                         AUGUST
          And you'd carry water for
          elephants? Ha, ha...you have any
          idea how much water an elephant
          drinks, kid? College! Pfft! Never
          met a college man yet who knew his
          own ass from shinola.

          24.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

                         (MORE SINISTER)
          You eat my food and you ride my
          train like you're entitled to
          survive. But you see, nothing
          survives here without my
          permission...Maybe if you tell me
          you're nothing, I'll let you stay,
          although my bet is you won't last.
          Jacob refuses to let August demean him. He stays silent.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          You smell like every kind of shit.
          Why would a college boy want that?

                         JACOB
          Times are hard for everybody...And
          I guess because ... out of all the
          dirt and sweat and shit and working
          with fellas you don't want to be
          caught dead meeting in the
          daylight, comes...so much beauty.
          We think August and the men are moved by Jacob's words.

                         AUGUST
          That's beautifully put.

                         (THEN:)
          Toss him off, Earl. And make sure
          you see the red light before you
          red light him.
          As Earl drags Jacob in tow, August derides him to the others;

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Another sonny boy mad at mommy and
          daddy for paying the bills. Sounds
          like he studied poetry.

                         CRAZY JOE
          I got no use for people who rhyme.

                         JACOB
          (shouts as he is dragged)
          It was veterinary science! And I
          can tell you one thing - that Star
          Attraction horse of yours won't be
          walking in a few days let alone
          performing center ring!!
          August stops and turns.

                         AUGUST
          Earl wait!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.
          Earl stops with Jacob. Now all the men are intrigued...

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Veterinary science?
          (Earl stops with Jacob)
          May I ask what school?

                         JACOB
          Cornell.

                         AUGUST

                         (IMPRESSED)
          You're a Cornell graduate?
          Jacob lies and nods...August wonders whether to trust Jacob.

                         DIAMOND JOE
          Marlena did want a vet to take a
          look at Silver Star. They cost.

                         CECIL
          He worked the rubes for me this
          afternoon. Pretty good.

                         CRAZY JOE
          He shovelled horse shit. Don't make
          him a horse doctor.
          August looks reluctant. Until Jacob caps it:

                         JACOB
          I hear Ringling has its own vet.
          The other men can't believe Jacob spoke up like this. But it
          amuses August, who faces him and smiles;

                         AUGUST
          All right, Cornell. Come with me.
          August leads Jacob out.

          EXT. PLATFORM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          August and Jacob exit onto the platform.

                         AUGUST
          Are you sure-footed, Jacob
          Jankowski?

                         JACOB
          I believe so.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         AUGUST
          Good.
          Without missing a beat, August leans forward, catches hold of
          something around the side of the car and disappears.

                         JACOB

          JESUS CHRIST!
          The train jerks a curve. Jacob almost falls.

          AUGUST (O.S.)

          COME ON THEN!
          Jacob looks up to see:
          August is on the roof of the train: his face moonlit, his
          hair blowing wildly in the wind...He points downward.
          Jacob, none too pleased, advances to the edge of the platform
          as the train speeds by, and looks where August is pointing;
          He can see the edge of a thin iron ladder. He wipes his hands
          on his thighs. Focuses. Then leaps...
          Jacob's right hand meets the ladder. His left grasps wildly
          until it ensnares the other side. His feet jam into the
          rungs. Jacob climbs to the roof.

          EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          August gives Jacob a hand up and they sit cross legged.

          POV; THE LENGTH OF THE TRAIN AHEAD OF THEM STRETCHES LIKE A

          GIANT SNAKE MOVING IN THE NIGHT, BENDING ROUND A CURVE.

                         AUGUST
          It's a breath taking sight, isn't
          it? Always gets me.

                         (THEN:)
          I can't get a new Liberty Horse mid-
          season. So you make sure this horse
          performs and the job's yours. Nine
          bucks a week. If you cross me, I'll
          feed you to my meat eaters and
          there won't be a trace left of
          you...
          Jacob hangs on every word. August smiles;

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          You do right by me, Jacob
          Jankowski...I'll show you what it's
          like to travel every inch of this
          country, every inch of this world,
          and be welcomed home in every
          street, be loved in every
          town...I'll give you a life most
          suckers can't dream of.
          Jacob is mesmerized by August. August stands and tap dances
          across the roofs. Jacob has no choice but to follow...
          The two men dance and leap atop the train from car to car
          across the moving train...Jacob grows increasingly confident
          and euphoric following August's exultant lead.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          August drops into the Ring Stock Car followed by Jacob. On
          one side is a line of Marlena's Black and White Show Horses.
          The other side, there is a makeshift door.
          August kicks through the door, revealing a small room;

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          This makeshift room is lit by a kerosene lamp on a crate next
          to a cot, propped up by a wall of trunks.
          A DWARF "KINKO" (WALTER) is reading on his cot. He has red
          hair. He and August greet each other with polite disgust...

                         AUGUST
          Kinko.

                         KINKO (WALTER)
          August.

                         AUGUST
          This is Jacob. He's going to bunk
          with you a while.

                         JACOB
          How do you do?

                         KINKO (WALTER)
          What is he?

                         AUGUST
          I said his name is Jacob.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         KINKO (WALTER)
          I asked what, not who.

                         AUGUST
          He's going to help out in the
          menagerie.

                         KINKO (WALTER)
          A menagerie man? Performers don't
          bunk with working men.
          There's a growl from his loyal Russell terrier, QUEENIE.

                         AUGUST
          Well there are performers..
          (his hand indicates high

                         STANDARD)
          And then there are performers..
          (his hand indicates lower
          "Kinko" standard)
          Considering we used to keep the
          goats in here, I'm sure Marlena's
          horses out there object to now
          sharing their quarters with you. Of
          course I can always change that and
          send you back to a bottom bunk with
          the other kinkers who sorely miss
          your sunny personality and
          affectionate camaraderie.
          (Kinko knows this threat)
          This gentleman is the show's new
          veterinarian - Ivy League no less -
          which puts him a good deal higher
          than you in my estimation. Perhaps
          you'd like to offer him your cot.
          As the kerosene lamp light flickers in August's face, Kinko
          knows he has no choice. August smiles and turns to leave.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          I'll find you in the morning. Sleep
          well, Cornell.
          August exits....Jacob is left staring at resentful Kinko and
          Queenie, who snarls at him. Jacob tries to be friendly:

                         JACOB
          A Jack Russell. They're very smart.

                         KINKO (WALTER)

                         (CALMLY)
          Queenie attack.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Queenie jumps at Jacob, growling, hunch backed. Jacob is
          pressed against the wall. Kinko returns to his book.

          KINKO (WALTER) (CONT'D)
          You're not getting the cot.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - LIBERTY, NY - DAWN.

          Jacob is washing himself with dirty water out of a bucket
          beside Camel. Camel starts hitting his leg. He laughs:

                         CAMEL
          Ha, this gam of mine keeps falling
          asleep on me. Pretty soon the only
          place for me is going to be selling
          tickets but I'm too ugly for that.

          AUGUST (O.S.)
          Jacob!
          Camel straightens up when August appears, clearly on his
          guard. He turns his back to continue washing.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          We can do better than this for our
          new vet. I'll arrange for you to
          start getting your own water bucket
          like the performers and bosses. Two
          buckets per person. Come...
          August walks away as Jacob hurries to follow...

                         JACOB
          See ya Camel.

                         CAMEL
          (sips his Jake)
          Yeah, take care kid.

          INT PERFORMER'S TENT - LIBERTY, NY - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT
          August and Jacob enter a more upscale tent where male
          performers are washing from personal buckets of water.

                         AUGUST
          You'll need new clothes too. I'll
          set you up with the Monday Man.

                         JACOB
          Monday Man?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         AUGUST
          What day of the week did your
          mother hang out the wash to dry?

                         JACOB

                         (REALIZING)
          He takes other people's clothes?

                         AUGUST
          It's the Depression, Cornell. Where
          have you been? Oh right - Cornell.
          Kinko is bathing with his two buckets when August snatches
          one of them away.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Here, use Kinko's second bucket for
          now.

                         (TO KINKO)
          You barely use up one.
          Kinko fumes. Jacob tries to placate.

                         JACOB
          August, it's all right, I'll--

                         AUGUST

                         (IGNORES HIM)
          If you need a razor, there are some
          back there with my name on them.
          August walks away. Jacob follows August away from Kinko.

                         JACOB
          August..
          When August stops, Jacob is caught off guard...

                         AUGUST

                         (SINCERE)
          It's good to have an educated man
          like you around. I need one other
          sane individual in this operation.

                         JACOB

                         (COMPLIMENTED)
          Thank you for everything, August.
          August pats his back and exits. Jacob heads for the bucket.

          AUGUST (O.S.)
          Ah...Jacob?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         JACOB

                         (STOPS)
          Yes, August?

                         AUGUST
          The horse.
          August wants Jacob to follow him to the horse. Jacob thought
          he was going to bathe.

                         JACOB
          Oh! Yes...The horse.
          Jacob follows behind August's commanding stride.

          EXT. RING STOCK CAR - LIBERTY, NY - MORNING

          Diamond Joe and GREG, a ring stock man in overalls, are
          leading the Marlena's horses out of the ring stock car...

                         AUGUST
          I'm sure it's nothing serious.
          Don't tell my wife I said this but
          she coddles them too much. She has
          a particularly strong affection for
          Silver Star. I don't encourage it.
          It's unhealthy to love an animal
          that much...Here she is.
          Marlena runs up to them, still in her bed clothes/robe.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Darling, meet Jacob Jankowski,
          Benzini Brothers own veterinarian.

                         JACOB
          It's a pleasure to meet you.
          Marlena barely acknowledges Jacob - keeping their previous
          meeting a secret (for which Jacob is grateful). August puts
          his arm around her and they kiss.

                         AUGUST
          Last stall. Lead the way, doc.
          They enter the ring stock car...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - LIBERTY, NY - MORNING

          Jacob, Marlena and August arrive at the stall to see Silver
          Star is laying down. He is breathing heavily, his rib cage
          rising and falling. Jacob immediately senses the worst.

                         AUGUST
          Jesus, Marlena, he wasn't this bad
          in the show.
          Jacob moves to examine the horse, but he flinches in pain.
          Marlena takes over, by sitting besides Silver Star's head,
          and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby.
          Jacob registers Marlena's soothing effect causes Silver Star
          to relax...his breathing grows calmer. So Jacob begins to
          examine him as Marlena watches protectively.
          Jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock. He
          lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and forefinger
          on the back of the fetlock. He looks at the sole of the hoof,
          which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge.
          Jacob's expression tells us this is a bad sign.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Is that the problem?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          Do you need any hoof testers?
          Diamond Joe has them...

                         JACOB
          Not yet.

                         AUGUST
          Well, how are you going to fix it?
          Marlena looks at him coolly, expecting an explanation. Jacob
          doesn't want to tell her the truth.
          Jacob looks to August and rises, leaving Marlena with the
          horse. Jacob pulls August away to whisper.

                         JACOB
          I didn't want to say anything in
          front of... Mrs. Rosenbluth...he's
          already foundering.

                         AUGUST
          English.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         JACOB
          This horse isn't getting back on
          his feet, August. If there was
          anything I could do, I would but
          we're going to have to put him
          down...I'm real sorry.
          Beat. August's stares at Jacob - or rather, stares through
          him. A dead stare that lasts just a beat or two too
          long...And then just as suddenly, the look is gone:

                         AUGUST
          I know you are. Come with me.
          August exits. Jacob doesn't know what this means. He follows.

          EXT. COOKHOUSE TENT - LIBERTY, NY - TWILIGHT

          TWO BUCKETS FILLED WITH PUTRID MEAT. Flies buzzing on top.
          Diamond Joe finishes filling the buckets as August grabs one.

                         AUGUST
          Joe, bad report for Silver Star I'm
          afraid. Jacob here says there's no
          hope. We're going to have to put
          him down...
          Diamond Joe registers a concerned, anxious look to Jacob.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ...So I need you to round up Pete
          and Greg, get a wagon and a harness
          stretcher. He has to be hauled.

                         DIAMOND JOE
          A harness what?

                         AUGUST
          Jacob and I'll take care of the
          cats. We'll meet you back at the
          stall.

                         (TO JACOB)
          Grab the other bucket, will you?
          Diamond Joe seems uneasy about this as we follow August and
          Jacob, who comments on the putrid meat.

                         JACOB
          August, this stuff has gone off. Do
          the cats really eat this?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         AUGUST
          No, they really love goats.
          (Jacob looks to him)
          We're all out of goats.

          EXT. CAT CAR - MOMENTS LATER - LIBERTY, NY - TWILIGHT

          Jacob waits with the buckets outside the car. August is
          inside unlocking the padlocks, then reappears and jumps out.

                         AUGUST
          Go ahead. They get a bucket each.
          Apprehensive, Jacob hops up. August hands him the buckets.

          INT. CAT CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT

          The cat dens have two compartments: to the left is a pair of
          lions. To the right, a tiger and a panther. All are massive.
          As soon as Jacob appears, they lift their heads ominously.
          August has unlocked the dens but left the padlock hanging on
          the cage bars. The animals can smell the buckets now. They
          growl. Jacob is a bit unhinged:

                         JACOB
          What do I do, just open the door
          and toss it in?

                         AUGUST
          Unless you think a formal sit-down
          is appropriate.
          Jacob approaches the tiger first. The six hundred pound cat
          rises then roars, his massive head hitting the cage and
          rattling the lose padlock. Jacob freezes.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Why don't you start with Rex...
          that's him on the left.
          August is pointing to one of the lions - with a ratty mane
          and visible rib cage. Smaller than the tiger, Jacob has a bit
          more nerve. He reaches for a bucket...August suddenly shouts,
          unnerving Jacob even more:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

          WAIT!

                         (JACOB JUMPS)
          Not that one, that one.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          He points to a difference bucket. Jacob can see no difference
          between them, but no matter. He lifts the bucket and
          approaches the lion's cage. Rex, the lion, lunges at the den
          door. Jacob freezes.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          What's the matter? Didn't they
          cover this in school?
          August is having a grand time. Jacob smirks. Rex is rubbing
          his mangy coat against the cage bars.
          Jacob fumbles, removing the padlock and laying it at his
          feet. He lifts the bucket and waits. When Rex turns away from
          the cage door, Jacob swings it open. But before he can spill
          out the contents of the bucket:
          Rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on Jacob's arm. JACOB
          SCREAMS. The bucket drops, spilling the entrails inside which
          cause Rex to release Jacob's arm and attack the food.
          Jacob slams the cage shut and checks to see if he has an arm.
          He does but it is dripping with saliva and as red as if he'd
          dipped it in boiling water. But no skin is broken.
          August is hysterically laughing. Furious, Jacob storms off;

                         JACOB
          What the hell is wrong with you?
          You think that's funny?

                         AUGUST

                         (LAUGHING)
          Yes I do! Aw Jacob wait! Don't be
          sore! I was having a little fun!

                         JACOB
          FUN! I could have lost my arm!

                         AUGUST

                         (LAUGHS)
          Rex hasn't got any teeth...
          Jacob feels more foolish and walks away, when, just as
          quickly, August's tone of voice turns darker:

          AUGUST (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Jacob..
          Jacob stops and turns. August isn't laughing any more. He has
          that sniper's stare of August's darker side...August moves
          towards Jacob, almost menacingly, as he speaks;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ..people want their money back when
          the Star Act on the poster isn't in
          the ring! A Star Attraction keeps a
          circus alive. Without it, animals
          eat that and men eat nothing. It
          takes time to find and train
          another horse so without Silver
          Star, I have no Star Act.

                         JACOB
          I don't know how he's been
          performing August, but you don't
          have a Star Act now. That horse
          can't walk and if he does you'll
          lose him. He's in a lot of pain.

                         AUGUST
          Like this?
          August squeezes Jacob's sore arm from Rex's attack. Jacob
          cries out in pain as August holds his grip yet speaks calmly;

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          We always have choices, Jacob - a
          choice between our pain and someone
          else's. That horse was performing
          before you came and he will
          continue to perform until he drops
          dead. I'm telling you to keep it
          alive and that's what you'll do or
          you'll be red lit like anyone else
          who doesn't obey the law here.
          Every nation has it's own laws
          under God, Jacob. You left America
          the second you jumped my train. I
          like you. Believe me, I do. I'm
          only thinking of your future.
          August lets go of his arm and walks away. Jacob is angry.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT

          Angry, Jacob inspects his arm - swollen and red from Rex's
          mouth. He hears: O.S. murmuring coming from Silver Star's
          stall. He approaches to find Marlena sitting at Silver Star's
          head, stroking his nose and humming the lullaby.
          Marlena strokes Silver Star as Jacob appears. And Marlena
          speaks to him for the first time;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         MARLENA
          Tell me the truth. What's wrong
          with him?
          Jacob hesitates before answering, then:

                         JACOB
          The connective tissues between the
          hoof and the coffin bone are
          compromised and the coffin bone
          rotates toward the sole of the
          hoof. If he keeps walking, it'll
          puncture through...He's in a lot of
          pain.

                         MARLENA
          And if he rests?

                         JACOB
          You'll lose him anyway. I'm sorry.
          Marlena breaths in this bad news and braces herself, tears
          welling up in her eyes.

                         MARLENA
          Then you have to put him down.
          Jacob is impressed by her...and a little surprised.

                         JACOB
          It's the right thing to do.

                         MARLENA
          But August won't let you.

                         JACOB
          (Beat. Then:)
          If I'm the show's vet then it's my
          decision, isn't it?

                         MARLENA
          But August won't like it.

                         JACOB
          Then it'll be my last decision.
          Marlena is impressed by Jacob. And surprised. She doesn't
          quite know what to make of him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

          EXT. STOCK CAR - LIBERTY, NY - MOMENTS LATER - TWILIGHT

          A determined, pent-up Jacob marches towards Bill and Grady
          who are taking a break, smoking. Camel is drinking Jake...

                         CAMEL
          Hey kid. What are you doing on the
          wrong side of the tracks?

                         JACOB
          I need a gun.

                         CAMEL
          It can't be that bad...
          They laugh but Jacob insists boldly.

                         JACOB
          I need a gun! Or a rifle! Now!
          Grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle.
          Jacob takes it and marches back. They watch him, curiously.
          Jacob passes Blackie on the way and boldly ignores his
          intimidating stance....Performers and workmen sense a drama
          brewing and follow Jacob to see what is happening.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT

          Jacob jumps into the Ring Stock car with the rifle as Kinko
          exits his room with Queenie. Queenie growls.

                         KINKO
          What do you think you're doing?

                         JACOB
          Shut-up! Both of you!
          Jacob continues on to Silver Star and Marlena.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          You should go.

                         MARLENA
          No. I'll keep him calm.
          Jacob respects Marlena's fortitude...Jacob raises the rifle
          and aims, trembling...Stoic Marlena, tears in her eyes, turns
          her face away...Jacob pauses, upset...then...shoots.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          Jacob's distraught expression tells us everything as the
          rifle slides to his side. He looks to Marlena. This is their
          first moment of intimacy. She rises and takes the rifle from
          his grip. She sees his arm bruised from the cats. She seems
          to know what it means. She offers a respectful farewell.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I'll be sorry to see you go, Mr.
          Jankowski.
          She exits O.S. with the rifle.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - LIBERTY, NY - LATER - EVENING.

          The yaks are motionless. Flies buzz around their head and
          ears. Jacob swats them away...The Polar Bear is on his
          stomach, breathing heavily. Jacob smooths his coat....Jacob
          leans down and hoists a bucket of ice, scattering the ice
          near the polar bear who rolls closer to it.
          Jacob sees Rex, lying on his side in his cage, panting with
          thirst. He brings a bucket of water to Rex's cage and opens
          it. Rex gets to his feet but this time Jacob doesn't flinch.
          He isn't frightened. He gives Rex the bucket of water. Rex
          drinks as Jacob strokes his mane, which Rex allows...

                         JACOB
          Friends now?
          August calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle. He walks
          to the center and stops, staring at Jacob.
          Jacob goes about caring for the animals - moving from one to
          the next - trying not to be unnerved by August's presence.
          Then August does a surprising thing: He sits in the center of
          the menagerie, crossed legged, with the rifle beside him.

                         AUGUST
          You've got a gift for them. Like
          Marlena with horses. It's God-
          given. I can always spot it.
          Jacob takes Bobo out of his den. Bobo hugs him tightly. He
          continues on as he replies;

                         JACOB
          My father used to say that to me.

                         AUGUST
          He must have been a wise man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          This stops Jacob. Beat. He turns to August.

                         JACOB
          How is Marlena?
          August tilts his head curiously, with a smile.

                         AUGUST
          You're a genuine curiosity Jacob
          Jankowski. What am I to do with
          you? ... I threaten to throw you
          off a moving train, feed you to my
          lions and you go ahead and shoot my
          star horse anyway. So I think -
          Jacob's an educated man. For Jacob
          to disobey me and shoot that horse,
          that horse must have been in pretty
          bad shape. Perhaps bad enough to
          injure my Marlena during the show.
          And so I think Jacob Jankowski
          might be a valuable person to have
          around.

                         JACOB
          Tell Diamond Joe the animals need
          more water when the humidity's this
          bad if I don't see him before I go.

                         AUGUST
          You're not going anywhere. You
          belong here. These animals..they've
          been waiting for you.
          Jacob doesn't know whether to believe him or not. Then:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          But don't ever disobey me like that
          again. I'll give you this one. I'll
          call it "respect"...Next one I call
          "betrayal". Understood?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          I do thank you though. You and
          Silver Star solved a much bigger
          problem for me.
          August pulls a pack of Camels from his pocket.

                         JACOB
          What problem?
          August lights, inhales, blows smoke then:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         AUGUST
          The cats. You see, meat eaters are
          always more valuable to a circus
          than hay burners. And you saw what
          we had to feed them.

                         JACOB
          What does Silver Star have to do
          with the cats?

                         AUGUST
          We should have just enough food for
          them to get us to the next show,
          thanks to you. Of course Marlena
          won't speak to me for a day or two
          but she'll come around...So, I was
          right. You are a valuable man.
          As he walks away, rifle over his arm, Jacob is unnerved;

                         JACOB
          August, what did you do? August?

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - EN ROUTE TO GOSHEN - MORNING

          Queenie sleeps. Kinko reads comic book porn inside a book of
          Aristotle's Poetics. Jacob sits on his bed thinking.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I couldn't stop thinking about
          Marlena. I didn't see her for three
          days. Our shows were cancelled and
          we kept moving because, word was,
          August found a "dead one"...
          The train wheels screech as it begins to stop. Jacob rises
          and looks out of open train car doors..

          EXT. FOX BROS CIRCUS GROUNDS - GOSHEN, NY - MORNING

          The train is pulling into the site of a "ghost town"
          abandoned circus; a dilapidated Big Top, broken wagons and
          tents, desolate performers walking about idly or sitting in
          the shade.

          INT/EXT. RING STOCK CAR - GOSHEN, NY - MORNING

          As the train pulls into Goshen, performers stick their heads
          out the window to see....Jacob sits in the open stock car
          with Kinko and Queenie:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         JACOB
          Why are we stopping?

                         KINKO
          August loves his sideshow freaks.
          There's a guy with this outfit who
          has a parasitic twin growing out of
          his chest. He dresses it in a tiny
          tuxedo and black patent leather
          shoes. No talent but a real money-
          maker with the rubes. Calls himself
          the Man and a Half. Goddamn
          August'll pay him double what he
          pays me just for the irony.

                         JACOB
          What happened to this circus?

                         KINKO
          Went belly up. Pretty common
          nowadays. Circus bosses see the end
          coming and they'd pull a runner
          with all the money. Menagerie
          belongs to the town now. August can
          get anything he wants for a song.
          Jacob and Kinko watch August striding through the grounds as
          desperate performers hopeful for work rush up to him.

                         KINKO (CONT'D)
          Most of them will never belong to
          another show. And they know it.
          August is helped by Earl, who pushes the performers aside so
          August can head straight for the Goshen TOWN OFFICIALS,
          standing beside an Oldsmobile. They exchange greetings.

          EXT. FOX BROS CIRCUS GROUNDS - GOSHEN, NY - LATE MORNING

          Crazy Joe is organizing the Flying Squadron to take whatever
          parts of the Fox Circus remains that they can use.
          Jacob is checking baggage stock horses when he sees:
          Marlena sitting alone outside her stateroom. He walks to her.
          Just as he reaches her, Marlena turns to him, looking as if
          she hadn't slept in days. Before they can speak, they hear:

                         EARL

          MARLENA! JACOB! AUGUST WANTS YOU!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

          EXT. FOX BROS CIRCUS GROUNDS - GOSHEN NY - NIGHT


          A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE IS POPPED OPEN...
          A deliriously happy August is walking and holding the
          champagne, pouring glasses held by Earl who then hands one
          each to Marlena, Jacob, Diamond Joe and Crazy Joe as they all
          walk towards the Fox Bros. Menagerie Tent.

                         AUGUST
          We have a new star!

                         DIAMOND JOE
          The Man and a Half?

                         AUGUST
          Nah, lousy Ringling got here first.
          But we got better! A bull!

                         JACOB
          A bull?

                         AUGUST
          A bull elephant! Her name is Rosie,
          she's fifty-three and she's
          brilliant. The best bull they had.
          I'm going to come up with a whole
          new Star Act around her and
          Marlena..

                         (TO MARLENA)
          You can ride her in the Spec from
          now on, since we have no Liberty
          Horse.
          August smiles at Marlena who looks back contemptuously, upset
          about Silver Star. August ignores her. Jacob notices the
          exchange between them.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          (Pours himself a glass.)
          ...Our own bull! Ringling can't
          hold that over us now. I'm
          renovating an entire car just for
          her.

                         CRAZY JOE
          Just for the elephant! But the
          bunkers are at capacity! I've got
          roustabouts three to a bunk.
          August tosses off this concern.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         AUGUST
          We'll find places for everyone. And
          when our new star sells tickets,
          we'll buy another car! We're a show
          to be reckoned with now!

                         (TOASTS)

          ...TO THE BENZINI BROTHERS MOST

          SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH!

          INT. FOX BROS. MENAGERIE TENT - GOSHEN NY - NIGHT

          CAMERA POV: Dozens of Benzini Brothers work men are
          dismantling and taking what they need...As our characters
          walk through, this crowd of working men in constant motion
          part the way to reveal:
          ROSIE THE ELEPHANT: She is gargantuan. Ten feet tall at the
          shoulder. Her skin is mottled and cracked from the tip of her
          trunk down to her feet. Only her ears are smooth. She has
          deeply set, amber eyes with extremely long lashes. She stands
          tall behind a rope, chained to a stake in the ground.
          Jacob, Marlena, August, Diamond Joe and Greg observe her.

                         JACOB
          She has such long eye lashes.

                         DIAMOND JOE
          She's a hundred if she's a day.
          We're lucky if she can move.

                         AUGUST
          Darling, what do you think? She's
          magnificent, isn't she?
          Marlena keeps her rage silent, but it is all the more potent.
          August decides to ignore it. Jacob keeps his eyes on Rosie
          but feels the tension between them.
          ROSIE'S CARETAKER approaches: filthy shirt behind suspenders.

          ROSIE'S CARETAKER
          You the bull man?

                         AUGUST
          No.
          (Refers to Diamond Joe)
          This is my menagerie man.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

          ROSIE'S CARETAKER
          Where's your bull man? Ya got no
          bull man, I gotta tell the township
          or else they can't sell her to ya.
          August grabs Jacob's arm and shoves him forward;

                         AUGUST
          Here he is. He's my bull man..
          Rosie's Caretaker looks at the surprised Jacob, then:

          ROSIE'S CARETAKER
          All right. See this animal...this
          here's the stupidest Goddamn animal
          on the face of God's good
          earth....Here's your bull hook.
          You're gonna need it.
          He tosses A BULL HOOK - a wooden rod about three feet long
          with a four inch metal pick coming off the end - to Jacob.

                         AUGUST
          I don't believe it. The mayor said
          she was the best bull you had.

          ROSIE'S CARETAKER
          If she was the best bull, why is
          she the only one left? You think
          you're the first show to turn up
          picking on the bones?
          August is annoyed. As the Caretaker gathers his things:

          ROSIE'S CARETAKER (CONT'D)
          Some elephant tramp who dropped
          dead in Genesee sold her for a song
          which still ain't no bargain cause
          she ain't done a damn thing since
          but eat everything in sight.
          (Starts to walk away)
          Well, good luck to ya. And if I
          don't ever see another dumb bull in
          my life it'll be too soon.

                         (SPITS)
          Rosie pulls her trunk from the trough. She lifts, aims, and
          blasts the Caretaker with such a force, his hat sails off his
          head in a stream of water.
          Jacob, August, Diamond Joe and Greg bite their lips from
          laughing. Marlena just stares into Rosie's eyes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          The Caretaker stops, his hair and clothes dripping. He
          doesn't turn, just stands still for a moment - then moves on.
          August's enthusiasm is slightly dampened.

                         AUGUST
          Joe, you and Greg come with me. We
          have to find a car to renovate.

                         (TO JACOB)
          See what you can do with her.
          They exit. Jacob and Marlena are left alone with Rosie as
          Flying Squadron men continue to work in the tent. There is an
          awkward pause between them...then:

                         JACOB
          Mrs. Rosenbluth, I hope I'm not
          speaking out of turn here but - but
          I had no idea they were going to do
          that to Silver Star.

                         MARLENA
          I know....Thank you.
          This relaxes Jacob, but he senses she is still sad.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          And please, call me Marlena. I'm
          not a snob like everybody thinks.
          Jacob smiles. He faces Rosie and tries to cheer Marlena up.

                         JACOB
          Hello Rosie, I'm Jacob Jankowski.
          This is Mrs. Marlena Rosenbluth.
          Can you say Mrs. Marlena
          Rosenbluth?
          Marlena smiles as she watches Jacob stroke Rosie's hide.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          You're a beauty, huh. Skin's a
          little dry, you oughta take care of
          that. First thing you notice about
          a woman's age is her skin.
          Rosie lifts her trunk and begins to explore Jacob's body.
          Marlena giggles. Jacob plays it up to make her laugh.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Are you flirting with me young
          lady? I usually like to make the
          first move...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          (Her trunk taps his head)
          I like to get to know a girl
          first...take her out. Meet her
          folks...
          (Her trunk goes lower)
          Of course, aggressive women can be
          a nice change...
          (She tickles him)
          Jacob and Marlena laugh, her mood lightened because of Jacob.

                         MARLENA
          I think you two are engaged.
          They laugh. Jacob is thrilled to have this effect on Marlena.
          A HARMONICA PLAYS A TUNE in the distance. They turn towards
          the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent.
          All the workmen have left.
          Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them.
          There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the
          three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk. Her hand and Jacob's
          come very close to overlapping. When their eyes meet, one of
          them quickly averts their glance...There is clearly a growing
          attraction between them. But it's uncomfortable.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I think Rosie likes music. That
          harmonica song is lovely.

                         JACOB
          I'm confessin that I love you.
          Marlena stops, her face flushed by Jacob's "confession".

                         MARLENA
          What?

                         JACOB
          The name of the song. "I'm
          Confessin' That I Love You."

                         MARLENA
          (overlaps, realizing)
          --"Confessin' that I love you."
          Beat. Jacob tries not to laugh. They return to stroking
          Rosie, trying not to look at each other.

                         JACOB MARLENA
          Louis Armstrong. Right.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - GOSHEN, NY - LATE AFTERNOON.

          Jacob enters. Kinko is on his bed reading his "Aristotle" but
          quickly shuts the book. Queenie growls at Jacob.

                         KINKO
          Queenie stop.
          Queenie stops. Kinko returns to his book. Jacob sees a NEW
          BED ROLL AND PILLOW, upon which sits a LETTER. He reads it:

          "MR. & MRS. AUGUST ROSENBLUTH REQUEST THE PLEASURE OF YOUR

          COMPANY IN STATEROOM 3, CAR 48, FOR COCKTAILS AND SUPPER.
          Jacob looks up to find Kinko staring at him.

                         JACOB
          What is it?

                         KINKO
          It's trouble, that's what. Not that
          I give a damn, but you're playing
          with dynamite with those two and
          you're gonna blow all of us up.
          August is the meanest sonofabitch
          I've ever met.

                         JACOB
          I admit he has his moments of
          insanity but he's really a very
          generous, charming guy.

                         KINKO
          You don't get it, do you? When
          August feeds your arm to a lion -
          that's the real August. The one
          who's generous and charming -
          that's the insane August.
          They hear a fight outside the car. They move to investigate:

          INT/EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON.

          Jacob and Kinko look out of the open ring stock car to see:
          August is standing before A MAN who is being held by
          Blackie's Men and punched by Blackie himself. The Man is
          bleeding and bruised. Various other performers and working
          men also watch the brutality;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         KINKO
          Six men got red lit last night.
          Cancelling shows and that damn
          elephant cost August. He needed to
          clean house to save on payroll...
          It's a lousy day when an animal
          gets paid and men don't.

                         JACOB
          Why are they beating him?

                         KINKO
          He hid one of the men who was
          supposed to be tossed. Word was the
          train was over a trestle instead of
          land. Nobody comes back from that.

                         THEY HEAR:

                         AUGUST
          Get rid of him. He comes back on my
          property, you can shoot him.
          August walks away, with Earl and his men in tow. Blackie and
          his men drag the beaten Man away. As they turn, Jacob
          recognizes the Man;
          It is WADE who worked Jacob on his first day.

          INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - GOSHEN, NY - NIGHT

          August, wearing a tuxedo, opens the door on the platform.

                         AUGUST
          JACOB! Come in, come in!
          Jacob enters their Stateroom which takes up half the car,
          with an additional room, cordoned off by a velvet curtain.
          The main room is paneled in walnut and outfitted with damask
          furniture, a dinette and a Pullman kitchen.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Darling, our guest has arrived.
          Jacob's eyes go wide upon seeing Marlena who appears looking
          radiant in a rose silk, off the shoulder evening dress.

                         MARLENA
          I'm so glad you could come. Would
          you like a beer? Or champagne?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         JACOB
          I'm not dressed for champagne.

                         AUGUST
          We can fix that, can't we darling?
          August winks at Marlena who giggles at their secret as August
          ushers Jacob to the velvet curtain...

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          We're celebrating our new star,
          Rosie. My plan is to have the act
          ready for the Manhattan/Jersey show
          so she can start selling tickets.

                         (BEAT)
          Unfortunately we had to let some
          men go last night...
          Jacob listens to how August will explain this:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ...I don't like doing it, not one
          bit. But to keep hard working men
          working, I had to get rid of lay-
          abouts and thieves who are dead
          weight. If I had the funds to pay
          them all I would, but times being
          as they are...I regret it though.
          Jacob believes him. August turns to him, with cheer:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          So tomorrow, my faithful bull man,
          we begin! But tonight - we dine!!
          Tonight, we all deserve champagne!
          August whisks the velvet curtain aside:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Ta-dah!
          A tuxedo for Jacob, who smiles, impressed.

          MONTAGE: A PERIOD SONG COVERS THE IMAGES TAKING US OVER THE

          COURSE OF THE EVENING ALONG WITH JACOB'S NARRATION:
          - Three white-gloved waiters remove the domes off of silver
          platters revealing oyster bisque, prime rib, boiled potatoes,
          asparagus in cream.
          - Marlena's dress barely covers her shoulders, exposing her
          porcelain skin and the curves of her breasts. Jacob can
          barely keep his eyes off of her during dinner...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.
          - Jacob is wiping his plate clean as August proudly offers
          more. Marlena laughs at Jacob's embarrassment when he
          realizes his plate is clean...
          - Wine is poured over and over...as the evening continues.
          - August is at the center of conversation entertaining
          Marlena and Jacob. They are drunk from the wine!

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Jacob, I want to apologize to you,
          in front of my darling Marlena so
          she can witness how truly sorry I
          am for any bit of nastiness between
          us...Running this show, the many
          pressures...It can get the best of
          me sometimes I'm afraid.

                         MARLENA
          People don't realize how much
          August does holding everything
          together. How difficult it is in
          these times. The whole company is
          like a family to him.

                         AUGUST
          Thank you my love.
          He kisses her hand then turns to Jacob;

          AUGUST (CONT'D)
          From now on I shall trust your
          judgement in all things
          veterinarian. Please say you accept
          my apology.
          Jacob is enamoured with August again, especially seeing
          Marlena smiling in agreement.

                         JACOB
          Of course I do, August. You've been
          nothing but swell to me.

                         AUGUST
          Good man!

                         (SINCERE)
          I could truly use a friend I can
          trust.
          Jacob once again beams at the compliment as August pours more
          wine. But Jacob feels a twinge of guilt. He stands to make a
          dramatic statement. August and Marlena look up to him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         JACOB
          I have to tell you something. You
          may not trust me after you hear it.
          August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          I never took my final exams at
          Cornell. I'm not a real vet.
          Beat. Then August and Marlena burst into laughter at the dire
          earnestness with which Jacob made his statement.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          But it's true. I never got my
          degree. I'm not a licensed vet.
          They laugh even harder.

                         AUGUST
          BAH! A worthless piece of paper
          from the ivy bush league! Of course
          you're a vet. You have the gift.
          You're idealism is just so...sweet.
          When are you going to learn that
          the rules written of, by and for
          these united states of suckers do
          not apply to us.

                         JACOB
          Not about this, August.

                         AUGUST
          All right, let me ask you - do you
          honestly think this is the most
          spectacular show on earth?

                         JACOB
          (Beat. Then laughs)
          No.

                         AUGUST
          No. It's nowhere near. Lucinda, our
          Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds. Four at
          the tops. And you really think the
          Tattooed Man got tattooed by
          headhunters in Borneo? He's from
          Pittsburgh. Took him nine years to
          ink himself. And you know what I
          did when the hippo died? Swapped
          out her water for formaldehyde and
          kept showing her. For two weeks, we
          travelled with a pickled hippo..

          53.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          (Jacob & Marlena laugh)
          ..The world is run on tricks - in
          here and out there. So trust me,
          it's having a talent that counts.
          In this world, it's all that's
          real. Look at this country, these
          dead, God awful towns we play.
          Talent and illusion bringing life
          to what is dead...Even for just a
          matinee. How wonderful is that?
          Jacob believes he's right. Marlena smiles in agreement.
          August rises to toast. Jacob and Marlena follow.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          To talent and illusion!

                         JACOB
          To Rosie!

                         MARLENA
          And Silver Star.
          August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena...

                         AUGUST
          To all we love.
          He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in
          front of a guest. Jacob downs his wine, closing his eyes.
          Suddenly, August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up to
          dance, throwing his arm around them both as we hear: Louis
          Armstrong's DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME.
          August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice,
          encouraging Jacob to join in...August is a great performer,
          filling up the space with his impersonation. Jacob can only
          laugh along.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Come on Jacob! It's customary to
          sing for your supper!
          Jacob joins in to perform with August. Marlena applauds them.
          August breaks away to dance with Marlena as Jacob sings. They
          begin to slow dance, very intimately.
          Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered
          chair, drinking more champagne. Jacob watches them dance:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          He looked like a different man when
          he looked at her. I said to myself,
          maybe love does that to a man. I
          didn't know much about it.
          Suddenly, August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively.

                         MARLENA
          Darling. Darling, please..

                         (GIGGLES)
          Gently. We have a guest.
          August stares at her. His expression darkens - locking his
          eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining
          her. Marlena smiles and strokes his face. August doesn't
          respond. He remains intense...

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Darling, what is it?
          August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete
          control, as if searching for proof of something he can't
          trust. His grip tightens, hurting her.
          Alerted, Jacob sits up, prepared to intervene...But Marlena
          shows no sign of fear. She knows exactly what to do.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          August, dear...
          She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          You don't know your own strength,
          my love.
          And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens,
          relaxes, almost into sadness...as if he's about to
          cry....Marlena senses it immediately. She whispers lovingly.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Auggie?
          August stops and eyes the bed beyond them. He leaves Marlena
          and throws himself face first on the bed.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Excuse me, Jacob.
          Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August, lifting his legs
          onto the bed, taking off his shoes. August begins snoring.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.
          Marlena smooths the hair out of his face then closes the
          curtains and returns to Jacob in the main room.

                         JACOB
          Is everything all right?
          Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there, as she
          returns to her Victrola and selects another record. She
          cranks it on and plays it low. A RUTH ETTING SONG.

                         MARLENA
          Oh yes. He's just had too much to
          drink, that's all. I hope you had a
          good time tonight. I wanted so much
          to make things up to you.

                         JACOB
          Tonight was your idea?

                         MARLENA
          Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt
          horrible about what happened. He
          really does like you Jacob. But
          it's hard for him. He's under a lot
          of pressure. He does more than
          people realize holding things
          together.

                         JACOB
          You said that.

                         MARLENA
          Well it's true...
          (Opens her arms to him.)
          One dance before you go?
          Jacob cautiously approaches. Marlena takes his hands but when
          Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against
          her bare back, he almost swoons. They slow dance. Both tipsy.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Jankowski is Polish isn't it?

                         JACOB

                         (NODS)
          Is that all right?

                         MARLENA

                         (LAUGHS)
          Yes, of course, sorry...I just
          think it's interesting. I don't
          know what I am, besides August's
          wife....I grew up in foster homes
          since I was a baby.

          56.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Kentucky, Oklahoma, Kansas,
          Texas...I must have covered a dozen
          states by the time I was 17. I'd
          make up stories about who my
          parents were...

                         (LAUGHS)
          When I was five, I pretended for a
          whole year my mother was an
          Appaloosa mare...
          They both laugh.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I did! ... and I pretended that I
          was really an Appaloosa filly...and
          that I was just dreaming I was a
          girl and one day, I'd wake up...and
          I'd run home.

                         (LAUGHS)
          Anyway, I was a lot safer inside
          those stables than I ever was
          inside those homes...
          Marlena stops, not wanting to continue. Jacob finds a new
          route for her conversation.

                         JACOB
          What happened at 17?

                         MARLENA
          There was a parade for the circus.
          At the head, there were six black
          Fresians, 17 hands high wearing red
          tassles. So proud! So beautiful.
          And August was leading them. The
          second he looked at me, the way he
          looked at me, I knew I'd never live
          with strangers again. And the way
          he talked. Told me "I'd find a home
          in every city..welcomed in every
          town...and he'd give me--

                         JACOB/MARLENA
          -- a life most suckers can't dream
          of"!

                         MARLENA

                         (LAUGHS)
          Ha, you too, huh?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          It's a wonderful lie, isn't it?

                         (JACOB NODS)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          But he said he'd make me a Star
          Attraction and he did. I'm pretty
          lucky he found me.
          Jacob, lost in her eyes and her voice, blurts out:

                         JACOB
          He was pretty lucky to find you.
          Marlena is surprised by the compliment...and endeared.

                         MARLENA
          You're sweet to say so.
          Beat. Feeling exposed, Jacob searches to change the subject:

                         JACOB
          Pretty song.

                         MARLENA
          Don't tell him what happened...
          Jacob takes this as an intimate moment between them.

                         JACOB
          Oh no Marlena, I won't ever tell.
          Marlena smiles, laughs, using Jacob's joke back on him;

                         MARLENA
          That's the name of the song. "Don't
          Tell Him What Happened To Me". Ruth
          Etting. She's one of my favorites.
          Jacob's head starts spinning. Marlena takes care of him;

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Are you much of a wine drinker?

                         JACOB
          I have no idea.

                         MARLENA
          Maybe you should go to bed.

                         JACOB

                         (NODS)
          Where's that?
          Marlena laughs. Jacob's bow tie is undone - she ties it;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         MARLENA
          Here, let me...We can't let you go
          out there all untied. A circus is a
          small town. What will people say?
          As Marlena ties his tie, Jacob's eyes simply rest on
          Marlena's face - sinking deeper in love. When Marlena
          finishes, she looks up to Jacob...She can tell Jacob is
          enamoured. She smiles warmly, touching his cheek...

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Sweet, sweet Jacob...

                         JACOB

                         (SENSITIVE ISSUE)
          I'm not that sweet.

                         MARLENA
          (Lowers her hand)
          Good night.
          Marlena turns and disappears behind the velvet curtain. Jacob
          stands still for a moment, then exits.

          EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - GOSHEN, NY - NIGHT

          A drunk Jacob sees the ring stock car door open, filled with
          people's legs hanging out and loud voices from within.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - GOSHEN, NY - NIGHT

          Jacob hops up into the car. Kinko is giving a party, with a
          bottle in his hand and drunken hospitality on his face.
          Thirty performers cram the area usually occupied by Marlena's
          horses, including BARBARA and another Coochie girl, NELL.
          Kinko and Queenie are performing tricks. Jacob watches. He
          admires the talent and humor of Kinko and Queenie's act. At
          the end, the girls laugh and applaud. Jacob joins in:

                         JACOB

          BRAVA QUEENIE! BRAVA!
          But the sound of Jacob's voice immediately makes Queenie stop
          and growl at him. Jacob stops.
          Kinko, Barbara and the Coochie girls stop laughing and stare
          the drunken young man, with his shirt out of his pants. He is
          ripe for the picking! They get an idea!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         KINKO
          JACOB MY FRIEND!! Folks, this is my
          friend and roommate Jacob. I'd like
          you all to make him feel at home!
          Kinko starts laughing uncontrollably and before Jacob can
          protest or escape, Barbara and Nell approach him, moving in
          for the kill. Blurry-eyed, Jacob staggers back but the others
          refuse to let him leave. In fact, he is picked up bodily,
          raised above their heads and transported to Silver Star's
          empty stall as Barbara and Nell disrobe him.

          IN BLACK OUT....WE HEAR A SCRAPING NOISE THEN SEE A SLIVER OF

          LIGHT AS A LID IS OPENED.

          INT. TRAIN CAR/CLOWN ALLEY CAR - EN ROUTE - MORNING

          Kinko opens the lid of a trunk, speaking to someone inside;

          JACOB (O.S.)
          Where am I?
          Kinko moves about a car filled with racks of costumes, props
          and an open trunk containing the hidden Jacob.

                         KINKO
          Where are you right now or where
          are you in an Aristotelean context
          because right now you're in a
          trunk.
          Inside the trunk, O.S. Jacob lifts his arm to Camera and
          discovers he is dressed in a red silk dressing gown...

          JACOB (O.S.)
          Where are my clothes? I'm not
          wearing anything underneath this---

                         (THEN:)

          OH MY GOD...SOMEBODY SHAVED MY...

                         KINKO
          Huh-huh.
          As Jacob struggles out of the trunk, we only see his arms.

          JACOB (O.S.)
          What the hell did I do last night?

                         KINKO
          You threw up on Barbara...And maybe
          Nell.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I feel sick.

                         KINKO
          You look a little pale.
          Kinko holds the mirror to Jacob. We see for the first time:

          JACOB'S FACE HAS BEEN PAINTED AS A CLOWN.

          INT. TRAIN CARS - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

          Jacob races through each car - past musicians, clowns and the
          Coochie Girls - clutching his robe, rubbing the make-up off.
          Along the way, the circus company taunt and tease him with
          sexy hoots and hollers. Kinko follows him, delighted.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - TUXEDO PARK, NY - MORNING

          Having cleaned up, Jacob is dressing in his own clothes.
          Kinko sits on his cot "reading Shakespeare" with a melancholy
          Queenie at his side. When Jacob scratches his shaven balls...

                         KINKO
          Your balls itchy?

                         JACOB

          YES THANK YOU!
          Pissed off, Jacob continues to dress.

                         KINKO
          It'll grow back. Aw come on, you
          still store about last night? Now I
          figure we're even. In fact, I
          probably owe you one. Feel free to
          borrow a book.

                         JACOB
          Let's just drop it.
          Kinko opens a book to read. Jacob notices Queenie's quiet.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          What's wrong with Queenie?

                         KINKO
          What do you mean "wrong"?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         JACOB
          I mean she's not hating me.
          Something's wrong.

                         KINKO
          (Concerned, pets her)
          Yeah, she's been like this all day.
          I don't know...she must have eaten
          something. She did her business and
          it was kind of...watery.

                         JACOB
          Her stool? Did you look at it for
          parasites?

                         KINKO

                         (SHAKES HEAD)
          I don't like looking at my own.

                         JACOB
          Get some honey from the cookhouse.
          And if you can find any slippery
          elm powder. But the honey should do
          it. If not, we'll check her for
          parasites.
          Jacob starts to exit. As Kinko reads his book;

                         KINKO
          Jacob?

                         (JACOB STOPS)
          Thanks.

                         JACOB
          Sure Kinko.
          He moves to exit again. Kinko never looks up from book;

                         KINKO
          Jacob?

                         JACOB
          Yeah.

                         KINKO
          My real name's Walter.
          They never look at each other but a friendship is formed.
          Jacob exits.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

          EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CIRCUS GROUNDS - MORNING

          When Jacob hops out, he sees performers and roustabouts all
          gathered by a performer train car, huddling and discussing.
          He crosses to investigate, meeting up with August Diamond Joe
          and Mr. Erwin...

                         AUGUST
          We got big trouble. Lucinda died.
          Now we've got no center ring star
          act and no sideshow star...

                         JACOB
          How did she die?

          MR. ERWIN
          I don't know where we're gonna find
          a fat lady this late in the season.

                         AUGUST
          I don't care where you find one,
          but find one.
          (To Diamond Joe)
          Better get some kind of rig set up
          to lift her out of the car. How did
          you carry Silver Star out?

                         DIAMOND JOE
          In pieces.

                         AUGUST
          Oh yes...
          (considers for a second)
          Mmmm...

                         JACOB
          August!

                         AUGUST
          No, no, of course, don't be silly!
          Right. Well, figure something else
          out Joe but get it down for the
          performance. Put her in the hippo
          tank for now.

                         (TO JACOB)
          You better start on that elephant.
          We need her performing yesterday.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

          EXT. ROSIE'S TRAIN CAR - MORNING

          Out of the darkness of her car, the enormous elephant
          emerges, being led down a ramp by Jacob.

          EXT. TRAINING RING - TUXEDO PARK, NY - LATE MORNING

          Jacob - cleaned, dressed and hung over - sits crossed legged
          in front of Rosie. The two stare at each other. Rosie's nose
          searching the ground for something to eat. Jacob, without
          energy or focus, his head pounding, orders her;

                         JACOB
          Rosie...Up.
          Rosie just looks at him without moving.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Up. Rosie. Up.
          Rosie's trunk starts to sniff around Jacob.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Rosie....Walk!...STEP!..Rosie STEP!
          Rosie's trunk investigates Jacob's body, tapping his head.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Rosie please. My hair hurts.
          Rosie's trunk snakes around him.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          No...No more Cracker Jack until you
          do something....Rosie!...
          Rosie curls her trunk around Jacob and slowly topples him
          sideways, turning him over as he weakly threatens;

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          I'm getting really mad now....I
          mean it...Rosie stop...
          Rosie gets the Cracker Jack from his back pocket...

          AUGUST (V.O.)
          You just can't get enough of
          somebody in your pants, can you?
          Jacob quickly gets up as August strides towards him;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          AUGUST (V.O. (CONT'D)
          Heard you had a rough night?

                         JACOB
          Does everybody know what happened?

                         AUGUST
          Yes.

                         JACOB
          Can somebody tell me?
          August suppresses a laugh.

                         AUGUST
          I'm opening the midway and the
          menagerie this afternoon for some
          extra cash before the show tomorrow
          night. We'll see how she does with
          the crowd. She got any skills?

                         JACOB
          Finding food? But I don't really
          know how to do this.

                         AUGUST
          Well, first of all, you can't do
          anything with a bull without the
          bull hook.
          August takes the BULL HOOK from the ground.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          It's the only way to train them.
          Watch.
          Jacob steps back.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

          UP!..UP!...COME ON UP!
          August stabs Rosie behind the shoulder..Jacob winces. Rosie
          lifts her foot a little.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)

          HIGHER UP...UP!
          August keeps jabbing her with the hook...dotting her flesh
          with blood. Jacob gets upset.

                         JACOB
          August, there's got to be another
          way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         AUGUST
          We don't have the time! She has to
          start earning her keep MOVE! UP!

          UP!!
          August stabs her other shoulder...harder...continuing to
          shout. Rosie is getting agitated...pulling away from him but
          constrained by her chain. Her eyes fearful.
          Other performers rehearsing in the area begin to watch as
          August strikes Rosie harder and harder. She begins to bleed.
          Jacob tries to stop August by going for the bull hook...

                         JACOB
          Please, August, let me try again.
          But August angrily pulls it away and turns on Jacob:

                         AUGUST
          Don't tell me my business! You
          don't want to watch this, get the
          hell out! Making love to it ain't
          going to work. Besides, from what I
          hear, you're not that good at it.

                         (TO ROSIE)

          GET UP! UP!!!
          Jacob watches, upset and furious at August's treatment.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - TUXEDO PARK, NY - LATER THAT DAY

          Rosie's flesh is dotted with wounds from August's bull hook.
          Jacob is applying zinc ointment to them.

                         JACOB
          I'm so sorry girl. Just a few more
          here. Hold still.
          The un-staked canvas flaps behind Rosie wave up with the
          breeze....Rosie's trunk rises. She smells something from
          outside the tent.
          When Jacob bends down for more ointment, Rosie tries to turn
          around but her chain is still staked into the ground. As
          Jacob straightens up, he sees:
          Rosie's trunk carefully wrap itself around the stake and pull
          it up out of the ground....She then manages to turn herself
          around, her butt to Jacob. Rosie's trunk then dives down and
          up under the canvas flaps.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Rosie?

          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT/MIDWAY - TUXEDO PARK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          A VAT OF LEMONADE LEFT ON THE CONCESSION STAND, which is in
          the process of being dismantled. Work men are carrying items
          back to the train.
          WE SEE: Rosie's trunk come out from under the canvas, her
          body hidden, searching for the lemonade.
          Jacob peers out to see: Rosie's trunk dip itself into the vat
          of lemonade and drink the entire contents.
          Jacob is amazed. He looks around: Workmen are some distance
          away loading the train. No one else sees her.
          Rosie finishes then turns back into the menagerie.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - TUXEDO PARK, NY - CONTINUOUS - DAY.

          Rosie's trunk gathers up the stake and then stakes it back
          into the ground. Jacob can't believe his eyes. He laughs.

          EXT. TRAIN - EN ROUTE T0 NEW JERSEY - DAY

          As the train travels to Weekhawken, New Jersey...Jacob is
          looking out of open car to NYC skyline across the river.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          We were on our way to the
          Manhattan/ Jersey show and Mr.
          Erwin still hadn't found a fat
          lady. Tickets sales were low. So
          August, ha,ha...August pulled a hat
          trick.

          EXT. STREET PARADE - WEEHAWKEN, N.J. - DAY

          August is sitting atop Rosie, smiling, waving his top hat,
          then forlornly placing it against his chest and lowering his
          head in respect for Lucinda. Manhattan is in the distance.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          A parade like you never saw, a
          funeral and a celebration, saying
          goodbye to one star, introducing a
          new one...playing those rubes dying
          to get a peek like he was rolling a
          coin over his finger tips...
          Rosie leads a small parade of clowns, including Walter and a
          perky, healthy Queenie down the main street. Marlena sits
          atop a Percheron, in full costume. Jacob walks astride.
          Lucinda's Wagon, carrying "the dead Lucinda", follows.

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It wasn't really Lucinda in there.
          It was Barbara in a fat suit and
          wig inside the hippo den. We buried
          the real Lucinda by the railroad
          tracks between towns. Cemeteries
          cost too much. We were the only
          family she knew.
          People line up to cheer and offer their silent respects...and
          satisfy a ghoulish fascination at the "dead" fat lady.

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          August sure was right about Rosie.
          She pulled the people right in.
          Rosie played that crowd like a pro.
          The rubes love the exotic Rosie...kids run up to pet her with
          their parents.
          As Rosie passes, we see AN OLD WOMAN standing in front of her
          green shuttered house waving with delight. We see she has a
          abundant vegetable garden which Rosie eyes covertly.

          EXT. BIG TOP - SPEC LINE UP - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - DAY

          WE HEAR: The Band playing from inside the Big Top as the
          performers and ring stock are lined up for the Grand Spec.

                         JACOB
          But as soon as the Spec started, we
          all knew it was too soon for
          Rosie's debut.
          Rosie heads the line. Marlena sits atop her, in her sequins
          and headdress, grabbing onto Rosie's leather halter.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          August stands beside with the bull hook. His face is cold and
          still. His fingers clutch and release the bull hook.
          The SPEC MUSIC begins and everyone makes last minute
          adjustments...Kinko and Queenie included....August shouts
          into Rosie's ear.

                         AUGUST

          MOVE! MOVE!
          Rosie hesitates so August strikes her right shoulder with the
          bull hook. The pain sends Rosie flying through the Big Top
          flap, causing Marlena to adeptly flatten her back atop Rosie
          so as not to hit her head on the pole that runs across the
          Big Top flap.
          Others gasp at the near accident. August is already furious.
          Jacob senses danger ahead. He follows in, curling the edge of
          the sidewall so as not to impede the Spec performers.

          INT. BIG TOP - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          Jacob watches as Rosie makes it twenty feet down the
          hippodrome track then stops.
          Without missing a beat, Marlena yanks herself upright, beams
          a smile and thrusts her hands in the air, her back arched,
          her toes pointed - as if it were all a part of the act.
          The crowd goes wild - clapping, throwing peanuts, whistling.
          Rosie only moves in fits and starts, causing the rest of the
          Spec to pass them by at times. She trots ahead of August and
          then when August reaches her she stops, making August halt
          awkwardly. August feels humiliated until:
          The crowd laughs, thinking it's the act. They applaud.
          August realizes the crowd loves it. So August, the performer,
          starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience, acting
          comically angry and frustrated with Rosie..
          But when he turns back to Rosie, he is red-faced with real
          anger, poking under her shoulders with the bull hook.
          After three stops and starts, August plunges the bull hook
          sharply into her shoulder blade...and Rosie takes off at a
          faster speed, curling her trunk in the air. The crowd cheers!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Marlena grasps Rosie's halter as they fast approach the
          dangerous pole above the entrance. If Marlena doesn't bail,
          she'll be knocked off by the pole.
          Jacob, August, the Spec and the audience watch enthralled as
          Rosie charges toward the entrance...when suddenly:
          Marlena lets go of the halter and leans hard to the left.
          Just as Rosie bolts out of the Big Top, Marlena grabs hold of
          the pole above the entrance and is left hanging there as
          Rosie exits the Big Top...
          For a moment, the audience doesn't know if this is part of
          the act. Jacob wants to run to help her...
          But Marlena quickly decides what to do; She lets go of the
          pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is
          facing the audience, still hanging from the pole.
          Her face lights up and she points to her toes. The Band
          Leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a
          drum roll. The crowd relaxes and applauds.
          Marlena begins swinging, gaining momentum as the band roll
          mounts. Soon, in one final burst of performance inspiration,
          she releases herself from the pole, sails through the air
          tucking her body into a ball, rolling twice, uncurling for
          one sideways rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her
          feet. She straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air.
          The crowd goes wild. The Band plays victory music. Coins are
          thrown from the bleachers. Even the Spec performers cheer.
          August acknowledges the audience's response by bowing as if
          it were all his creation.
          But after a moment, Jacob can see Marlena is in pain as she
          turns and subtly limps out of the Big Top. He follows her.

          EXT. BIG TOP - WEEHAWKEN NJ - DAY

          Jacob rushes to her. Marlena, in pain, collapses in his arms.

                         MARLENA
          Oh Jacob...
          August rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of
          Marlena in Jacob's arms. He immediately tenses up.

                         JACOB
          August, she's hurt.
          August takes her in his arms. Barbara appears to help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         AUGUST
          I'm here, darling, I've got you.

                         BARBARA
          Bring her to my tent, it's closer.

                         AUGUST
          Jacob, send Joe for ice. You go and
          find that Goddamn bull before we're
          run out town. And take the hook!
          August is seething, his expression cold, as he carries
          Marlena O.S. Jacob, concerned, takes the hook and runs O.S.

          EXT. OLD WOMAN'S GREEN SHUTTERED HOUSE - WEEHAWKEN - DAY

          Rosie is standing in a vegetable garden calmly feeding
          herself cabbages. The owner is the OLD WOMAN who was
          delighted by Rosie in the parade. She is now screaming
          hitting her with a small garden shovel...Jacob runs up.

                         JACOB
          I'm sorry ma'am. I'll get her.

                         OLD WOMAN
          You better before she gets at my --

          AAHHH, MY TOMATOES! YOU MONSTER!!
          Rosie has helped herself to tomatoes. Jacob steps in.

                         JACOB
          Rosie, no! Stop!
          Rosie pauses for a moment, flapping her ears at Jacob, then
          shoves a bush of tomatoes in her mouth. Jacob almost laughs.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Bad elephant, that's not nice. This
          kind lady hasn't invited you.

                         OLD WOMAN

          ARE YOU CRAZY TALKING TO AN

          ELEPHANT!? SHOOT IT! BEFORE IT EATS

          MY HOUSE! I'M CALLING THE POLICE!
          She exits into the house as Rosie wraps her trunk around
          cabbages, uprooting them, as Jacob tries to battle her trunk.
          Greg arrives with a bucket he places in front of Rosie. Her
          trunk stops fighting Jacob and sniffs inside the bucket.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         JACOB
          What's in the bucket?

                         GREG
          Gin and ginger ale. Elephants love
          booze. One whiff of this and she's
          not thinking about cabbages no
          more.
          (Bats her trunk away)
          ... moj malutki paczuszek?

                         JACOB
          Greg, right? Are you Polish?

                         GREG
          Grabowski.

                         JACOB
          Jankowski.
          Greg again pushes Rosie's trunk away from the bucket.

                         GREG
          Last show I worked, one bull faked
          a belly ache just to get the
          whiskey...Better grab the hook.

                         JACOB
          Are you a bull man? August would
          hire you in a minute.

                         GREG
          Don't want the job. Not for him.
          Besides, I'm not bull man. I just
          like big beasts.
          Jacob gets it and follows Greg who carries the bucket.

                         GREG (CONT'D)
          Is she following?
          Jacob turns around to see and sure enough:
          Rosie is leaving the garden and trotting behind to catch up
          to the bucket of gin and ginger ale. Jacob's impressed.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - TWILIGHT

          The show is still in progress - we can hear the band playing
          for the aerialist act in the background.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          As Jacob makes his way to Marlena's stateroom he crosses
          paths with August, whose face is "dark as thunder".

                         JACOB
          How's Marlena?

                         AUGUST
          A little shaky. Sore wrists.
          Bruised heel. Doc says she'll be
          fine. Did you catch the bull?

                         JACOB
          She's in the menagerie.

                         AUGUST
          Good.
          August takes the bull hook from Jacob and walks with cold
          blooded intent towards the menagerie. Jacob panics, realizing
          what August about to do. Jacob follows to stop him;

                         JACOB
          August! Wait! She was good! She
          came back on her own! Besides, you
          can't do anything now! The show is
          still going on.

                         AUGUST

                         (WALKING)
          Good. The band will drown it out.

                         JACOB

          AUGUST, NO!
          Jacob touches August's arm. August turns on Jacob with a
          murderous expression, shoving him to the ground. Jacob is
          about to get up to fight but August cautions him with the
          bull hook to stay down. August smiles slightly. Would he
          really use that bull hook on Jacob or is he kidding? Jacob
          stays down. August continues on, entering the menagerie tent.

          MARLENA (O.S.)
          Jacob!
          Jacob sees Marlena running towards him.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT

          Jacob and Marlena run across the grounds to the menagerie as
          workmen are running out of the menagerie tent, hearing August
          screaming from inside. They enter the menagerie tent to see:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT

          August is beating Rosie, who cries out with each blow. The
          animals are panicking from inside their cages - the lions
          roaring, the monkey's squealing. Marlena freezes at the
          entrance as Jacob runs to August.

                         MARLENA

          AUGUST...STOP!!!
          August turns to see her. Enraged, he stops Jacob with:

                         AUGUST
          Get her out of here! NOW!
          Jacob wants to help Rosie but can not disobey August in this
          moment. He returns to Marlena and ushers her out, as August
          continues to beat Rosie.

          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN - TWILIGHT

          Marlena and Jacob step away, hearing Rosie cry out. Marlena
          can't bear it. She grabs Jacob's hand for support. Jacob
          tentatively holds onto her waist, guiding her away. She leans
          into him. Jacob loves being this close to her.
          The screams of August O.S. pull their attention to see:
          Earl and his men physically dragging a maniacal August out of
          the tent, his bull hook and clothes bloodied by his rage. He
          is kicking and struggling against them like a madman.
          Jacob is shocked by August's behavior. But Marlena has seen
          it before. She pulls away from Jacob and exits O.S. alone.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Rosie is lying on her side, her foot still chained to the
          stake. She is quivering, riddled with bloodied holes.
          Jacob is kneeling, applying zinc ointment, not knowing where
          he can touch that won't hurt her. He is heart broken.

                         JACOB
          Rosie, what am I going to do with
          you?
          Rosie's eyes look up to him, her lashes blinking. Her trunk
          lifts and wipes at her own eye.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          Greg appears with a bucket and several bottles of whiskey. He
          begins pouring whiskey bottles into a bucket.

                         GREG
          Here this will help. Poor beast. He
          really hurt her. Told you about
          him.
          (Curses August in POLISH)
          Don't understand why a man like
          that wants to be around animals in
          the first place. He shouldn't have
          the right, if you ask me.
          Listening to Greg, Jacob gets increasingly angry. He sees the
          bull hook. He grabs it and marches out of the menagerie.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - NIGHT

          Earl's men are smoking, when one sees Jacob marching angrily
          towards August's stateroom, carrying the bull hook. Alerted;

          EARL'S MAN
          Somebody better find Earl.

          INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob reaches the platform to find the door ajar. He moves
          through it. The stateroom is in a shambles. An open suitcase
          of women's clothes lies strewn across the floor.

          AUGUST (O.S.)
          Marlena...!
          August appears from behind the curtain ; he looks
          uncharacteristically distraught...teary eyed and unkempt.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Do you know where Marlena is? Did
          she send you?

                         JACOB
          No....What happened?

                         AUGUST
          She won't speak to me...
          He can't finish. He sits, burying his head in his hands.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ...She won't let me apologize...
          She won't forgive me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Jacob is astounded by August's sad, pitiable state.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          I don't know what happens to me,
          Jacob. When I saw that bull running
          wild with Marlena, I...I lost my
          mind. But it's because I love her.
          Why can't she understand that?
          (Jacob stands coldly)
          Isn't there anyone who understands?
          (Jacob remains silent)
          Ah, it's all my fault, I know it
          is. I've spent too much money on
          that bull. I can't pay the workmen.
          Our debts are piling. We're losing
          attendance at every show. I have no
          Star Attraction. I don't know
          what's going to happen to us if
          Rosie doesn't sell tickets.

                         (CONFESSES)
          If I lose this circus, I'll lose
          Marlena - I know it.
          Jacob softens, seeing August in this helpless, humble light.

                         JACOB
          I'm sure that's not true.

                         AUGUST
          Maybe you can talk to her. She's
          tired of my apologies but, this
          pressure I'm under...Of course,
          that's no excuse for what I did...
          (Rubs the images away)
          ...I can't believe what I did. Is
          she all right? The bull. Rosie.

                         JACOB
          She'll be OK.

                         AUGUST
          Would you tell Marlena? And tell
          her...tell her I'll do anything.
          Anything she wants.

                         JACOB
          August, I can't...

                         (THEN)
          I'm sure she'll forgive you...She
          loves you...Anyone can see that.
          August wants to believe him. He seems more hopeful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         AUGUST
          Thank you. My friend.
          Jacob nods, confused, his anger diffused. As he exits;

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Jacob?
          Jacob stops and turns back as August asks:

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          What were you planning to do with
          that bull hook?
          Jacob realizes he's holding the bull hook. August smiles.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Ha. You look like me.
          Jacob looks in the mirror and indeed - with Rosie's blood on
          his open shirt, bull hook in hand - he looks like a violent
          man.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Maybe there is someone who
          understands me.
          August smiles. But Jacob is unnerved by the smile...and the
          comparison. Suddenly, Earl enters and looks around, on alert;

                         EARL
          What's going on?

                         AUGUST
          Everything's fine, Earl.
          August nods to Jacob, who pushes past Earl to exit.

          EXT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - NIGHT

          Jacob jumps down off the platform. Confused and disgusted, he
          takes the bull hook, wedges it under the train and breaks it
          in half.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

          Jacob enters to find Greg still treating Rosie.

                         JACOB
          How's she doing?

                         GREG
          Oh she's a strong one, this one.

                         (TO ROSIE)
          Jestes dobra dziewczynka
          Jacob watches as Rosie lifts her foot and Greg rubs ointment.
          Jacob sees the many empty whiskey bottles.

                         JACOB
          Is she drunk?

                         GREG

                         (LAUGHS)
          She's four tons..she'll just sleep
          good.
          (Screwing ointment top)
          Potoz noge.
          Jacob watches as Rosie puts her foot back on the ground.

                         GREG (CONT'D)
          Masz, moja piekna
          Jacob watches as Greg digs in his pocket and pulls out a
          mint, brushing off the lint. Rosie's trunk investigates, then
          nimbly plucks it out of his hand and into her mouth.

          SUDDENLY, JACOB HAS AN EPIPHANY.

                         JACOB
          Oh my God...

          An excited Jacob is leading August to the menagerie tent.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob leads August to Rosie. A curious Greg stops tending to
          Rosie. Jacob hands August a slip of paper with Polish words.

                         JACOB
          Just read those out loud. To Rosie.
          August reads the words in Polish with Jacob's help...

          Daj...daj..no-ge.
          Rosie does nothing. August looks to Jacob. Jacob is worried.
          Greg suggests, in a low whisper;

                         GREG
          Might help if he said please.

                         JACOB
          Say...Prosze Rosie daj noge.

                         AUGUST
          Pros--Prozze Rosie...daj noge.
          Rosie lifts her foot. August's eyes gleam.

                         JACOB
          Go on.

                         AUGUST
          (Reads and recites)
          Rosie...potoz noge.
          Rosie puts her foot down. August starts to understand.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          (Reads and recites)
          Do tylu, Rosie! Do tylu!
          Rosie sighs, shifts her weight, then takes a couple of steps
          backward. August is amazed. Jacob is thrilled.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          That Fox Bros bull man didn't tell
          us was the elephant tramp who sold
          Rosie to them was Polish...
          August grabs Jacob and kisses him on the mouth.

                         AUGUST
          We've got a new star!
          Greg remains cautious.

          PRE-LAP : LIVE JAZZ BAND MUSIC.

          INT. NEW YORK CITY SPEAKEASY - LATER THAT NIGHT

          The live band plays on a raised platform. The dance floor is
          jammed with couples.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Tables and U-shaped booths surround the dance floor. Tuxedoed
          bartenders serve from a wooden bar lined with hundreds of
          bottles in front of a smoky mirror.
          August, Jacob and Marlena sit in a booth. They are drunk on
          their third bottle of champagne. Marlena is wearing a
          beautiful, low cut beaded red gown. Jacob can barely keep his
          eyes off of her.
          Marlena is particularly drunk - we've never seen her this
          wild or spontaneous. She sings along with the band...she
          keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table.
          However, she is acting distant to August.
          August is happy she is having a good time. When he slides
          next to her and puts his arm around her, Marlena stiffens;

                         AUGUST
          Would you like to dance, darling?

                         MARLENA
          No, thank you.
          Awkward beat. Marlena takes her champagne glass and drinks
          the last of it. August tries to make light of it.

                         AUGUST
          We need more champagne.

                         JACOB
          I'll get it.

                         AUGUST
          No, you stay with Marlena.
          August kisses her cheek, but Marlena is clearly still upset.
          August lets her be. He exits O.S.

                         JACOB
          You ever going to let him off the
          hook?

                         MARLENA
          Hook? That's an unfortunate choice
          of words.

                         JACOB
          Rosie's going be great. He won't
          hurt her again. I know it.

                         MARLENA
          Jacob, what you know about August
          is pretty much nothing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.
          Jacob feels put down. Marlena realizes that came out too
          brusquely. She softens, and explains with vulnerability;

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          You know how many star acts we've
          had? How much money we've made and
          lost and made...? Silver Star paid
          for our new stateroom and look what
          happened to him. Everything August
          touches gets fed to the cats one
          way or another.

                         (SADLY)
          He'll never change.
          Jacob is moved. Marlena shifts gears and rises.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I want to dance.

                         JACOB
          Maybe you should wait for August.

                         MARLENA
          I want to dance now!
          She pulls him up onto the dance floor. Marlena dances light
          as air. She spins from Jacob then returns to his arms, so
          that her back is to him. Jacob's forearm is on her collarbone
          - skin to skin. Her chest rises and falls under his arm. Her
          hair under his chin, Jacob can smell her fragrance - then she
          unwinds away from, like a ribbon.
          When the music stops, everyone applauds their dance -
          including Marlena. Jacob beams. He looks up to the bar:
          August stands stock still. His eyes glaring at Jacob. The
          dark expression we've come to know. Seething with quiet rage.
          Jacob takes a step back from Marlena when suddenly they hear;

          OFF CAMERA SHOUT

          RAID!! RAAAAID!!! EVERYBODY OUT!!!
          PANDEMONIUM: Jacob is swept by a crush of bodies. People
          scream, shoving their way towards the exit. Marlena is shoved
          along with them, a few heads in front of Jacob.
          Jacob reaches through the sea of flesh and grabs a hand. By
          Marlena's expression, we know he has grasped her hand. Jacob
          scans the panicked crowd for August but all he sees are
          strangers running in every direction, people screaming..
          Jacob's hand is ripped apart from Marlena at the doorway.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY ALLEY - NIGHT

          Jacob is thrown into the alley. People are piling into cars,
          engines are starting, wheels squealing.
          Suddenly, Marlena appears, grabbing Jacob's hand. She takes
          off her shoes. They run through back streets.

          EXT. IRON FIRE ESCAPE - NEW YORK CITY ALLEY - NIGHT

          They run under a fire escape, panting, out of breath. The
          sirens and screams of the crowd are distant.

                         MARLENA
          Lord, that was close...Aw, look at
          my stockings! And they're silk too.

                         JACOB
          I wonder if August got out...
          Marlena looks up at Jacob and starts laughing hysterically,
          as if for no reason. They are both still drunk.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          ...I don't know how we're going to
          get home. I've never been in New
          York, have you?
          Marlena's laughing subsides as she gets an idea.

                         MARLENA
          I want to see the Empire State
          Building.

                         JACOB
          What...what about August?

                         MARLENA
          I don't know where he is, do you?
          And he doesn't know where we are.
          It's not our fault. Like you said,
          who knows how long it'll take us to
          get back.
          Jacob is hesitant. Marlena takes his hand and softly pleads;

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Just a few hours, Jacob. For just a
          few hours, we don't belong
          anywhere...we don't belong to
          anyone...Please.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          Jacob looks in her eyes and knows he shouldn't, but...

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I was doomed.
          He smiles. Marlena beams. They run off.

          EXT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NYC - NIGHT

          A summer storm with thunder and lightening is coming towards
          them from over the Hudson River.
          Marlena and Jacob are looking out at the expansive 1931 view
          of New York City. Other couples stroll about the sky deck.
          Marlena breathes in deeply...

                         MARLENA
          I've never seen so far. Have you?
          (Jacob shakes head)
          Look at it. As far as the eye can
          see and it's nowhere near all
          that's out there.
          Jacob notices tears in her eyes.

                         JACOB
          Are you all right?

                         MARLENA

                         (LAUGHING/CRYING)
          Yes. No. Yes, hahaha I'm fine. I'm
          a complete mess...ha...

          THE THUNDER BREAKS AND THE RAIN BEGINS TO POUR...
          Suddenly, MARLENA SCREAMS as loud as she can, startling the
          other couples. Jacob laughs. Beat of silence, then:

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          But Jacob understands; He screams and Marlena joins in.

                         JACOB MARLENA

                         AAAHAHAHAAHAAAHAAAAA AHAAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAH
          The other couples leave the sky deck to get out of the rain
          and away from "that crazy couple".
          Marlena and Jacob stop, wet, panting, laughing from the
          release. Then, looking out at the view, not at each other...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          Marlena begins to confess what she needs Jacob to know.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Jacob? I need you to do something
          for me. Promise me you will.

                         JACOB

                         (HOPEFUL)
          Anything.

                         MARLENA
          I want you to go. I want you get
          away from us, from the show. You're
          smart Jacob. You deserve better
          than us. Leave as soon as you can
          or something terrible's going to
          happen.

                         JACOB
          (surprised, confused)
          Why are you saying this?

                         MARLENA
          It's all right. No one can hear.
          We'll never get another chance to
          say it all.
          Marlena looks into Jacob's eyes and finally addresses what
          they're both thinking;

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Nothing can ever happen with us,
          you know. It's too dangerous.
          August will never let me go. You
          don't know what he's capable of.

                         JACOB
          How can you be with a man you're
          frightened of?

                         MARLENA
          I'm not. I don't have to feel
          afraid of him if I don't feel
          anything...After all these years,
          I've learned how to do it so well.
          I tell myself, "I'm managing. I can
          manage him. August loves me. Nobody
          else ever did. Who am I to say it's
          the wrong kind of love?" .. See,
          there's no place for a woman like
          me in any decent kind of world. You
          know where they found me when I was
          a baby? ...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          ...In an alley behind a whore house
          in Baltimore wrapped in newspaper.
          No one even bothered to leave a
          note...This circus, my horses -
          this is the only kind of life I can
          have.

                         (BREAKING DOWN)
          August made a woman like me a star
          attraction...I'm lucky. And I'm
          safe...And I was fine - before you
          came.
          Jacob feels sorry and hopeful at the same time...

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          There's nothing that can cause a
          woman so much trouble as a good
          man.

                         JACOB
          I'm not that good. And I don't want
          to be.

                         MARLENA
          Don't say that.

                         JACOB
          No, I don't. Good men don't wind up
          with much in the end except their
          goodness. Isn't worth much, is it?

                         MARLENA

                         (SADLY)
          See? ... Look what we've done to
          you already.
          She touches Jacob's face gently. Until this moment, they
          didn't realize how close they are to each other tracing
          Jacob's face with her hands, as he leans in closer...

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Sweet Jacob.

                         JACOB
          You deserve as good a life any
          other girl.

                         MARLENA
          Am I still a girl? I feel so old.
          They kiss. They stop and silently acknowledge where this is
          going. As they move towards a secluded spot, they continue to
          kiss in between lines;

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          This can only be tonight. We have
          to go back. Promise me you
          understand.

                         JACOB
          I understand.

                         MARLENA
          Promise me you'll suffer.

                         JACOB
          I already am.

                         MARLENA
          Promise you'll look in my eyes the
          whole time.

                         JACOB
          I promise.
          Jacob kisses her with his eyes locked onto hers...With
          Marlena's back pressed against the entrance, Jacob reaches up
          and locks the door. They sink to the ground.

          EXT. FERRY - HUDSON RIVER - NYC TO WEEHAWKEN - NIGHT

          Marlena sits inside Jacob's embrace on the ferry, her head
          leaning against his chest - their hands entwined.

                         JACOB
          If I had money, if I could take
          care of you, would we be going
          back?

                         MARLENA
          You'd have to be a Rockefeller...
          August would find me. He always
          does.

                         JACOB
          Have you tried to get away before?

                         MARLENA
          Jacob you promised. You said you
          understood it was only tonight.

                         JACOB
          I know. I do....I'm sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

          EXT. WEEHAWKEN FERRY PORT - NIGHT

          Jacob walks Marlena out of the port to a waiting cab. They
          stop a few feet from the cab. Jacob gives her all the money
          in his pockets. Marlena looks at him as if for the last time.

                         MARLENA
          Where were you when I was 17?
          Jacob smiles. They kiss not wanting to let go. Marlena pulls
          away and runs into the cab. Jacob watches it drive away.

          EXT. MENAGERIE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - PRE-DAWN.

          Jacob reaches the circus. Everyone is asleep.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - PRE DAWN.

          Jacob enters the menagerie, heading straight for Rosie. He
          gets on the ground beneath her and lies down...Rosie raises
          her trunk to allow Jacob to lie beneath her.

          SAME LOCATION - DAWN
          Jacob is asleep under Rosie when Walter wakes him up.

                         WALTER
          Why are you sleeping here?
          Somebody's looking for you.

          INT. CANVAS CAR - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - PRE-DAWN.

          Jacob and Walter enter to find Bill and Grady hiding an
          ailing Camel in a dimly lit car. Jacob kneels down to him.

                         CAMEL
          Hey kid. How nice to see ya.

                         JACOB
          Hey, Camel. What's wrong?

                         CAMEL
          I don't know, kid. Woke up a few
          days ago and my feet was all
          floppy. Jes can't feel'em right...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)

                         (CONFIDENTIALLY)
          ...It ain't just that though. It's
          other stuff too.

                         WALTER
          Like down there...man stuff?
          Camel, his eyes wide and fearful, nods slowly.

                         BILL
          What's wrong with him, doc?

                         JACOB
          I don't know.

                         WALTER
          Jamaica ginger paralysis.
          Jake leg. I've seen it before.

                         CAMEL
          No such thing. Is there Doc?
          Walter looks at Camel's empty "Jake" bottle.

                         WALTER
          The manufacturer started putting
          this plasticizer in it, or
          something, to get around
          regulations that Jamaica ginger
          extract not be sold as booze.

                         (TO CAMEL)
          You're not supposed to drink this
          stuff, ya know.

                         CAMEL
          Well what the hell am I supposed to
          drink to stop the shakes? It's
          Prohibition and I ain't no Astor.

                         GRADY
          It's OK Camel. Tomorrow's payday.
          We'll get you some moonshine.

                         BILL
          Grady don't lie to the man. If men
          were getting paid, Blackie wouldn't
          have tossed four of "em between
          Boonton and Weehawken.

                         JACOB
          Four?...Will he get better?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          Walter looks at him, his expression says No.

                         BILL
          We can't leave him here. They'll
          red light him for sure.
          Jacob understands. He gets an idea and turns to Walter.
          Walter understands and reacts with an adamant:

                         WALTER

          NO! NO!

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER - WEEHAWKEN - DAWN

          Walter is walking quickly back to the performer train. Jacob
          follows, trying to reason with him. Throughout the scene,
          they are looking out for Blackie's men and speaking low.

                         JACOB
          Walter, please. Blackie and his men
          only patrol the roustabout cars.
          They don't work the performer
          train. We can hide him easy until-

                         WALTER

                         (STOPS)
          Until when? What are we going to do
          with him? Shoot him like Silver
          Star? Because that's what he is
          Jacob. In a week, he won't be able
          to move his legs at all.

                         JACOB

                         (THINKING FAST:)
          He has a son in Pennsylvania. Near
          Reading. We're playing there in
          three weeks. That's all he needs.
          Walter doesn't want to do this, but clearly can't say no.

                         WALTER
          I was right about you. You're going
          blow us all up...August got home
          tonight before you and Marlena.
          People are talking.
          Walter stalks off leaving Jacob unhinged by the news.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          I shouldn't be a clown. I should be
          a Goddamn fortune teller.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          INT/EXT. COOKHOUSE TENT - WEEHAWKEN, NJ - MORNING

          The cookhouse tent is divided into two sections by a curtain.
          One one side: working men and the buffet table of food. It is
          made up of benches and bare wood tables with salt and pepper
          shakers.
          The other side of the curtain is filled with performers. The
          tables have a checkered tablecloth and flowers.
          Marlena is sitting alone, drinking a cup of coffee. Jacob
          approaches. He sits opposite her.

                         JACOB
          Good morning.

                         MARLENA
          Good morning Jacob, how are you?
          Marlena smiles. Jacob senses others eavesdropping...but the
          table is far enough away, so they can't be heard.

                         JACOB
          I wanted to, uh...Is there any
          chance I could speak with you
          alone?

                         MARLENA
          About what? Is something wrong?

                         JACOB
          No, I...I just wanted to...Walter
          said people are talking about what
          happened...last night...

                         MARLENA

                         (LAUGHS)
          Oh Jacob, champagne completely
          overwhelms my senses..I always feel
          the better for it when I abstain.
          All I remember is getting pushed by
          the crowd and then running and
          getting a hole in my stocking. I
          don't even know how I got home. I
          don't remember a thing.

                         JACOB
          Well, I want to apologize for--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         MARLENA
          Ha,ha Jacob, it's silly of you to
          apologize for my torn stockings.
          You weren't even there.
          Jacob is crushed by her reaction. Marlena maintains her
          upbeat facade. August enters with his tray of food and
          crosses to them. He is smiling like a man who has spent the
          night having great sex.
          August kisses Marlena right in front of Jacob. It is a long
          sensual kiss...a holdover from their night together.

                         AUGUST
          I slept like a baby after last
          night. Thank you my darling.

                         MARLENA
          August, please. We're in public.
          Jacob understands his meaning and is quietly devastated.

                         AUGUST

                         (SITS)
          Ah, nothing to be ashamed of. Man
          and wife reuniting in the most
          sacred of marriage places.

                         (BEAMING)
          My Marlena has forgiven me. All's
          well with the world again, right
          Jacob?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          That was quite an adventure last
          night. I'm glad I didn't have to
          bail you out. How did you get home?

                         JACOB
          I don't know. I just ran.

                         AUGUST

                         (EATING)
          How did you two get separated? You
          were so close on the dance floor.

                         MARLENA
          I told you, sweetheart. We got
          pushed apart by the crowd. This
          older married couple brought me to
          the ferry.

                         AUGUST
          I'd like to look them up and invite
          them to the show free of charge...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ...I'll even pay for their
          transportation. I'd pay it a
          hundred times over to anyone who
          helped my wife to safety. Thank
          goodness she had chaperones. If
          anyone had harmed her, or even
          touched her, there's no knowing
          what I might do.
          Jacob makes note of the implication. Marlena ignores it.

          EXT. TRAINING RING - ASBURY PARK, NJ - DAY

          While Jacob coaches August from the sidelines, the company of
          performers and workmen watch August command Rosie in Polish.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          ...August said he would create an
          act for Marlena and Rosie that
          would have'em line up for miles...
          August and the company are delighted when Rosie lifts her
          foot...or walks forward, then backward..

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          His accent was awful but Rosie
          obeyed without fail.
          Marlena watches, full of excitement and praise for August. He
          instructs Marlena where to stand. He commands Rosie who lifts
          Marlena up with her trunk.
          Everyone cheers and applauds. Those near Jacob pat him on the
          back, grateful that he saved the circus. Jacob smiles.

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I was finally a part of them.

          PRE-LAP - CHEERS AND APPLAUSE, AS ROSIE LIFTS MARLENA ONTO

          HER BACK AND WE CUT TO:

          INT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - ASBURY, PARK - NIGHT.


          MARLENA ATOP ROSIE IN FULL COSTUME MAKING THEIR ENTRANCE TO A

          PACKED HOUSE AS AUGUST LEADS THE WAY TO CHEERS AND APPLAUSE.
          When they enter the center ring, they stop. August gives
          Rosie the command to lift Marlena down with her trunk.
          But Rosie hesitates. August commands her again, with more
          force. But Rosie doesn't move forward...she shuffles a foot
          backwards. August grips his silver tipped cane. Oh-oh...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          Jacob and other performers watch anxiously. Will Rosie fail?
          Then August turns to the audience and mimes apologizing to
          the crowd. When he back is turned, Rosie hits his butt with
          her trunk. August freezes. The crowd laughs uproariously.
          Jacob and the others realize it's all part of the act. Walter
          slaps his back. Barbara kisses his cheek.
          August displays great performance skills. He turns to Rosie
          acting suspicious. Rosie lifts her head away, as if to say
          "It wasn't me".
          August turns back to the crowd to apologize and once again,
          Rosie flicks his behind with her trunk. This time August
          knows it her. He turns to her, tips his hat over his brow and
          shakes his finger, scolding, as if to say, "No, no, no"
          Rosie responds by waving her trunk, mocking him.
          And the crowd bursts into applause.
          August commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena with her trunk and
          places her on the ground.

          EXT. NEW EGYPT, NJ - NIGHT

          Posters of ROSIE and MARLENA highlight the act COMING SOON!
          Blackie and his men are covering up the Posters of other
          circuses and town events.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          August could have given Barnum a
          run for his money. He spent the
          payroll money on expensive posters
          promoting that act like it was
          bigger than Ringling. And we sold
          out every performance in every
          town...

          INT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - NEW EGYPT, NJ - DAY

          Marlena blows kisses to the audience. She skips theatrically
          around the ring, with Rosie trotting behind her, August
          hovering beside.
          Marlena stops and wipes her brow, feigning exhaustion, and
          sits on a small ball.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          Rosie observes her with a smile and a raised trunk. Rosie
          copies Marlena's actions, placing her enormous rear down on a
          much larger ball.
          The crowd screams with laughter.
          Marlena stands in mock outrage, wagging her finger at Rosie.
          She turns her back on her, folding her arms.
          Rosie also stands and presents Marlena with her rear end
          facing the other way. The audience loves it.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          In that center ring, Rosie became a
          guaranteed star attraction...

          INT. ROSIE'S CAR - EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob sits alone facing Rosie, in her massive stock car made
          of steel, talking to her, in Polish...

          JACOB (V.O.)
          Alone with me, telling her every
          thing I couldn't tell anyone else,
          she became the closest thing I had
          to family.

          INT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - FRIENDSHIP, NJ - DAY

          Marlena looks back and scowls. With dramatic flair, she
          raises one foot and places it on the small ball as if to say,
          "Take that, elephant!"
          Rosie, not to be out done (guided by August's Polish
          commands) curls her trunk, lifts her foot and places it on
          her larger ball.
          Marlena straightens out both arms and extends her other leg,
          like a ballerina's, toe pointed. She place the foot alongside
          the other, so that she is now standing atop the ball.
          Rosie waits a moment, then lifts her other front foot onto
          the ball.
          The crowd explodes! August pretends to be outraged with
          Marlena. But as showers of coins and money rain upon them,
          August and Marlena stand beneath showers of glittering coins.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          And August! Ha, August was a new
          man..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ELMER, NJ - DAY

          The workmen set up the circus with energy and renewed spirit.
          August treating them with pats on the back of gratitude.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          ..treating everybody first class,
          spreading the word his Rosie act
          would finally get the men paid..

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          Jacob, Walter and a Camel enjoy a card game and moonshine.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          ..And with business so strong,
          nobody was worried about getting
          tossed, so we didn't have to worry
          so much about old Camel.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - FRIENDSHIP, NJ - DAY

          August is filling a bucket with gin and ginger ale for Rosie.

          JACOB (V.O.).
          And nothing was too good for Rosie.
          When August found out she liked gin
          and ginger ale, he made sure she
          got both every day, treating her
          like some favorite child...

          INT. BIG TOP/MARLENA AND ROSIE'S ACT - SALEM, NJ - DAY

          Marlena does a double take, then lifts up her finger as if to
          say "I have an idea!". With a rising drum roll, she shuffles
          her feet atop the ball, moving herself around the ring...
          Rosie places all four of her feet onto the larger ball and
          rolls herself around the ring...Marlena and Rosie go faster
          and faster, along with the music...
          THE CROWD GOES WILD....August takes Marlena's hand and kisses
          it as they take their bows.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          But I didn't trust the new August.
          I kept waiting for the real one to
          show up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.

          EXT. ROSIE'S CAR - SALEM, NJ - MORNING

          Out of the darkness of the car, Rosie appears in the light,
          being guided down the ramp by August, who gently pets her
          trunk, whispering in her ear. Her ears flapping, she purrs
          with affection. Jacob watches.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          It was when I saw Rosie purring
          under his touch as if nothing had
          happened between them, that the
          worst thought occurred to me.

          INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          Marlena and Jacob are laughing, listening to August telling a
          story after a private dinner. Jacob glances at Marlena...

          JACOB (V.O.)
          Maybe, I was the man not to be
          trusted.
          Marlena moves to August's lap. They kiss...Jacob watches

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Marlena looked happy...And it broke
          my heart.

                         PRE-LAP AUGUST:

          AUGUST (V.O.)
          The circus is nothing without it's
          traditions..

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - SALEM, NJ - DAY

          August has gathered all the performers and trainers in a
          circle. Jacob stands in the center. Marlena beside August.

                         AUGUST
          ..It's a family. And like any
          family, when a new member is born,
          it's arrival must be greeted with
          celebration and gratitude. Now,
          we've been a little busy with sold
          out performances, thank the Gods..

                         (EVERYONE CHEERS)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ..but right now I want to take this
          moment before today's show to
          gather together..We close our
          eyes..
          Everyone closes their eyes.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ..and we thank whoever's up there
          that sends desperate men running
          for the rails..
          Everyone laughs.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ..because it was a lucky day when
          Jacob Jankowski jumped our train.
          Because of him - together with our
          beautiful Rosie and my beloved
          Marlena - we have the greatest star
          attraction in Benzini Brother's
          history. He found a way to save us
          all. And so, to officially welcome
          Jacob into the family, we open our
          eyes..
          Everyone opens their eyes.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          ..And we give him the traditional
          Benzini Brothers baptism.

          SUDDENLY, EVERY CLOWN PULLS OUT A SELZTER BOTTLE AND DOUSES

          JACOB..BARBARA AND ALL THE GIRLS THROW HALF A DOZEN PIES INTO

          HIS FACE AND BODY. OTHERS THROW CONFETTI, STREAMERS...
          Jacob is a mess, covered in pies, seltzer and confetti. The
          company breaks up with laughter, applauds and cheers...Walter
          and Barbara bring Jacob towels, embracing and kissing him.
          The rest of the company follows suit.
          August motions for Marlena, who retrieves a large mens
          clothing box and carries it to Jacob as August watches from a
          distance...The crowd parts as Marlena hands him the box.
          August watches Jacob open the box to find his own TUXEDO.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          Now you don't have to borrow mine.
          Everyone applauds, hugging and kissing Jacob:

                         JACOB
          Thank you, August.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         AUGUST
          It's from both of us.
          Jacob looks to Marlena. It is awkward between them. They
          can't kiss each other. Jacob nods and says courteously;

                         JACOB
          Thank you, Marlena.

                         MARLENA
          You're welcome, Jacob.
          As Marlena exits with the others, we discover August watching
          from them a distance;
          August's expression tells us he knows what they are hiding.

          EXT. BIG TOP - SALEM, NJ - DAY.

          Marlena and Rosie exits the Big Top. We hear tumultuous
          applause coming from inside. Jacob awaits them, as usual.
          Jacob commands Rosie, who lifts Marlena off his back and
          places her carefully on the ground. Jacob pets and commands
          Rosie to follow him, but stops when:

                         MARLENA
          I wonder if you could help me.

                         JACOB
          Sure.

                         MARLENA

                         (PROFESSIONAL TONE)
          I've planned a surprise for August.
          He's been so wonderful, don't you
          think?

                         (JACOB NODS)
          Could you make sure Rosie is staked
          in my tent after the show?

                         JACOB
          No problem.

                         MARLENA
          Thank you so much...Oh, and I'm
          sure it would be nice for August if
          you were there too.
          Marlena turns and exits O.S. Jacob isn't sure what to think.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

          INT. MARLENA'S DRESSING TENT - SALEM, NJ - NIGHT

          Rosie is staked into the grass inside Marlena's tent, happily
          occupied with a pile of watermelons.
          Marlena wears a silk beaded dress with the diamond necklace.
          There is a serving table with silver domed platters and wine
          bottles. Marlena is trying to open a champagne bottle when
          Jacob enters.

                         MARLENA
          Oh, he'll be here any second.
          Jacob, can you open this for me?
          Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork.
          Rosie's trunk is curious, inspecting the bottle in Jacob's
          hand. Jacob laughs. Marlena sees and laughs as well.

                         JACOB
          Rosie...get away....ssstop!!
          Rosie continues fooling around, causing Marlena and Jacob to
          laugh even harder when the cork pops...

          AUGUST (O.S.)
          What is this?
          Jacob and Marlena turn to see August enter, laying down his
          hat and coat, his shirt unbuttoned at the top.

                         MARLENA/JACOB

          OH!....SURPRISE!..SURPRISE!
          Jacob pours the champagne into two flutes, which Marlena
          rushes up to August, handing him a glass and kissing him.

                         AUGUST
          Did you show Jacob the opening
          night present I gave you?
          Marlena turns to Jacob and indicates the diamond necklace.

                         MARLENA
          (indicating the necklace)
          Oh. No...Do you see Jacob?

                         JACOB
          Beautiful.

                         AUGUST
          It looks stunning on you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          They kiss again. Marlena raises her glass of champagne.

                         MARLENA
          To August - an authentic miracle
          man because he made a star
          attraction out of me.

                         JACOB
          To August!
          August nods in gratitude. They tilt their glasses and drink.

                         AUGUST
          Many thanks. Forgive me for
          arriving too soon and spoiling the
          surprise.
          August takes out a cigarette and lights it.

                         MARLENA
          Don't be silly. I couldn't wait for
          you to come.

                         AUGUST
          I could go back out to give you
          more time...or better yet, yell
          RAID and clear the place out so you
          two can be alone.
          In a split second, Jacob and Marlena know the danger present.
          August gave no sign of it coming.

                         MARLENA
          What?

                         AUGUST
          I'm sorry. I'm probably wrong. I
          assumed that night after the RAID
          was the first time you two fucked,
          but obviously it's been going on
          longer than that.

                         MARLENA
          Auggie, you're being silly.

                         AUGUST
          Did you think I didn't know?

                         MARLENA
          August don't do this!

                         AUGUST
          Shut-up. SHUT UP!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          Marlena gets frightened. August saunters over to the silver
          tipped cane leaning against the flap. He picks it up as
          Marlena and Jacob remain still. Suddenly they hear:
          Rosie peeing where she is staked. She too is frightened.

                         AUGUST (CONT'D)
          How long did you think you could
          keep this from me?

                         MARLENA
          August, please, there's nothing-

                         AUGUST

          GO ON! INTERRUPT ME ONE MORE TIME!
          August swipes the tables with the cane, knocking all the
          platters and glasses to the floor.

                         JACOB
          We should go!

                         AUGUST
          WE!...So you two are a couple?

                         JACOB
          NO! I just don't think you're safe
          to be around a woman right now.

                         AUGUST
          A woman? This is not a woman. This
          is my wife you Ivy League lying
          piece of shit! Say, I bet the
          authorities would like to know you
          practise without a license.

                         MARLENA
          Auggie, please... Don't you see how
          much I love you?

                         AUGUST
          I see you. I see you too clearly.
          Always have. I have to admit that
          was a nice touch when you got back
          from the speakeasy. Being with me
          in our bed, after being with him.
          Covering your tracks. I should have
          known a whore only performs for a
          man like that when she wants
          something.

                         JACOB
          Marlena, come with me...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         AUGUST

          YOU DON'T EVEN DENY IT! LOUSY

          TRAMP!!
          Marlena drops the fluted glasses, crying:

                         MARLENA

          STOP IT!..AUGGIE STOP IT..PLEASE!
          Suddenly, he's quiet. He stands still. Marlena approaches him
          now, cautiously but tenderly.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Auggie? Are you all right now?...
          August looks at her. Marlena's expression is one of care and
          concern. Jacob watches carefully. Has it passed?
          Suddenly, August flicks his lit cigarette into Rosie's open
          mouth - Rosie reacts and Jacob moves to help her - as August
          grabs Marlena, shoving her so hard she falls against the
          table, knocking it and her to the ground. He attacks her,
          trying to rip off her diamond necklace.
          Jacob attacks August, pulling him off of Marlena.
          JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT: savagely pounding each other's faces,
          crashing against broken plates and spilled gravy, banging
          their heads viciously against the ground, rolling over each
          other as they alternately share domination...
          Marlena screams for them to stop. Rosie bellows, pulling on
          her leg chain.
          The FIGHT SPILLS OUT OF THE TENT INTO THE CIRCUS GROUNDS.

          EXT. MARLENA'S DRESSING TENT - CONTINUOUS - SALEM, NJ - NIGHT

          Jacob and August continue beating each other as they roll out
          into the crowd.
          August's madness empowers him. He manages to overpower Jacob
          in a choke hold. Jacob is losing consciousness.
          Because of Marlena's screams - Earl and his men run to the
          tent. Within seconds, they are pulling August off of Jacob.
          August gets to his feet. His cool expression is even more
          frightening as he re-enters Marlena's tent.

                         JACOB

          LET ME GO!! HE'LL KILL HER!!!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          From inside the tent, they hear a crash. Marlena screams.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)

          HE'S HURTING HER!!LET ME GO!

                         EARL
          No he won't, kid. Come on.
          Earl disperses the crowd that has gathered, which includes
          Walter, who sees Jacob's bloodied face and goes to him.
          FROM INSIDE THE TENT, THEY HEAR: Two soft thuds..then a
          louder one...Then an unnerving silence.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          See, it's over. Can we let you go?
          Jacob pants and nods. Earl and one of his men let Jacob go in
          degrees, until he is standing up. Walter holds his waist.

                         WALTER
          Come on Jacob. Walk away.
          With Walter's help, he tears his eyes from the billowing flap
          and walks away, passing rubes who watch with fascination.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - SALEM, NJ - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Walter uncorks a jug of moonshine and hands it to Jacob, who
          holds a towel to his bloody, beaten face. Jacob drinks from
          the jug, panting, until the pain subsides. Camel speaks from
          behind the trunks.

                         WALTER
          The only thing that's keeping you
          alive right now are the rubes who
          saw everything. August can't risk
          getting rid of you here. But you
          better not get back on this train
          when we leave tomorrow night.

          CAMEL (O.S.)
          What happened? Somebody turn me
          around. Share some of that jug!

                         WALTER
          Shut-up Camel.

          CAMEL (O.S.)
          Well, what the hell...!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Camel uses whatever strength his has to push aside the trunk
          and see bloody Jacob.

                         CAMEL (CONT'D)
          Jesus Christ! Who did that to you?

                         WALTER
          August.

                         (TO JACOB)
          Is it true?
          Jacob wants to deny it but his silence speaks the truth. He
          can only manage to shake his head NO...But Walter can read
          between the lines....He lowers his head in despair.
          THE TRAIN STARTS TO MOVE. All three react with surprise.

                         JACOB
          Why are we moving? We have a
          matinee tomorrow.

                         WALTER
          Something's gone wrong.
          SUDDENLY, A KNOCK ON THE DOOR. The three men immediately are
          on alert. Walter grabs his knife from beneath his pillow.
          Camel tries to shove himself behind the trunks. THE KNOCK
          COMES AGAIN as we hear:

          MARLENA (V.O.)
          Jacob? Jacob, it's Marlena.
          They breath a sigh. Jacob opens the door to reveal.
          Marlena with a black eye. Jacob rises to her.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I had nowhere to go. I
          told him I'm leaving him.

                         JACOB
          My God. Are you all right?

                         MARLENA
          Looks worse than it feels.
          (Re: Jacob's face, laughs)
          Ha, look at the two of us.
          Marlena awkwardly enters the room to Walter and Camel's
          stares. She sees the moonshine and breaks the ice.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          Can I have a swig of that?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.
          Walter throws her the moonshine. Marlena drinks like a pro.

                         WALTER
          Why is the train moving?
          Marlena sits with the jug, casually talking:

                         MARLENA
          We're being run out. Apparently,
          August was so optimistic about
          money coming in for Rosie, he
          figured he'd double down and find
          himself a new fat lady to put him
          really toe to toe with
          Ringling...So he sent Mr. Erwin
          into town who finds this rather
          large woman in a restaurant and
          offers her the job. Except, she...

                         (STARTS LAUGHING)
          ...she was the police chief's wife.
          Mr. Erwin got a left hook in the
          jaw and we got til morning to get
          out of town.
          This cracks everybody up. Laughter. A release of tension.
          But the laughter turns to quiet sadness as the reality of
          their situation sinks in....Marlena looks to Jacob and leans
          into his arms. He holds her, clearly in love, then ushers her
          out of the room for privacy.
          Walter sees what he knew all along. He kisses Queenie:

                         WALTER
          Aw girl. We're all in it now.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Marlena and Jacob exit Walter's room outside of which Marlena
          placed her small suitcase. They pass by Marlena's horses..

                         MARLENA
          Why are you hiding that roustabout?

                         JACOB
          Because Blackie and his men don't
          work the performer train and
          they'll red-light him if they find
          him. He can't work anymore.

                         MARLENA
          My God.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.
          They come upon Silver Star's stall - empty - right before the
          door to the next car. They stop.

                         JACOB
          Does August know where you are?

                         MARLENA
          No. He thinks I'm with Barbara and
          the girls. He won't go there.

                         JACOB
          He can't find you. As soon as we
          stop - before we stop - we'll jump
          off and I'll take you to a hotel in
          town.

                         MARLENA
          And after that? August has all our
          money. Where will I go?

                         JACOB
          Marlena, I'm not leaving you. We'll
          find a way together. I won't let
          you go back to him. I promise.
          Marlena smiles, needing to hear him say those words. She
          embraces him, grateful. Jacob holds her tight, assuring;

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          ..I'll call my dean at Cornell..If
          I can take my finals again, get my
          degree, I can get my license.
          They lay in the Silver Star's empty stall. Moonlit through
          the wooden slats. Making plans...

                         MARLENA
          Oh Jacob, that would be wonderful.
          You know, I bet Ringling would take
          us both then - they'd be getting a
          vet and a star attraction - that's
          a sweet deal for them. Although I
          won't be a star but I don't care.
          I'll take no billing at all...We'd
          be safe from August if we were with
          Ringling.

                         JACOB
          Don't worry about him.

                         MARLENA
          Of course, I'd have to wait a while
          until I can work again...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         JACOB
          What do you mean?

                         MARLENA
          Jacob...I'm going to have a baby.
          Jacob is stunned...then confused...

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          It's yours. Please don't ask me how
          I know...Is it all right? You can
          change your mind. I'd understand.
          Overwhelmed, Jacob keeps kissing her. Marlena lets go of all
          the anxiety she had about him. He loves her. She knows it.

                         JACOB
          Change my mind??? Oh Marlena,
          please...please be happy.

                         MARLENA
          (Cries, relieved)
          I will...I promise...as soon as I
          stop being terrified.
          Jacob kisses her. He guides her to the ground, against the
          hay. She nestles in his arms.

                         MARLENA (CONT'D)
          I'm so tired.

                         JACOB
          Rest...I've got you now.
          Marlena tries, closing her eyes.....Then, without warning;

          FROM THE ROOF, AUGUST, BLACKIE & HIS MEN JUMP IN THROUGH THE

          OPEN STOCK CAR DOOR. THEY CHARGE INTO THE ROOM CAUSING THE

          HORSES TO PANIC. THE THUGS DRAG JACOB AWAY FROM MARLENA,

          BEATING HIM. AUGUST FORCIBLY TAKES MARLENA, HITTING HER...

                         MARLENA JACOB

          DON'T HURT HIM!!!AUGUST NO!! MARLENA! MARLENA!...

          AS BLACKIE AND HIS MEN DRAG JACOB PAST WALTER'S MAKESHIFT

          DOOR, JACOB FIGHTS EVEN HARDER TO PULL THEM AWAY FROM

          BREAKING INTO WALTER AND CAMEL'S ROOM.

          FAST CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS - BRONX

          Kinko sits against the door, holding a trembling Queenie
          hearing the screams and struggle. Camel quivers in fear
          behind the trunks.

          FAST CUT BACK:

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT


          AUGUST IS DRAGGING A SCREAMING MARLENA THROUGH THE DOOR TO

          THE PLATFORM - TAKING HER THROUGH THE TRAIN BACK TO HIS CAR.

          BLACKIE BEATS JACOB WHO CRIES OUT FOR MARLENA'S SAFETY,

          HOLDING ONTO THE OPEN CAR DOORS. THE MEN BANG HIS HANDS WITH

          THEIR FISTS UNTIL JACOB LOSES HIS GRIP AND BLACK TOSSES HIM

          OFF THE FAST MOVING TRAIN.

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - GRAVEL/GROUND - NIGHT


          JACOB ROLLS DOWN THE GRAVEL. BLACKIE AND HIS MEN JUMP OFF THE

          TRAIN AND RUN TOWARDS HIM. JUST AS JACOB GETS TO HIS FEET,

          THE MEN REACH HIM - AND BEGIN TO BEAT HIM.

          WITH A SINGLE BLOW TO THE BACK OF HIS HEAD, JACOB IS THROWN

          INTO BLACKNESS.

          EXT. WOODS/STREAM - ALLENTOWN, PA - LATER THAT NIGHT

          A heavy rain pours. A bloodied, battered Jacob is semi-
          conscious face down in a stream in the woods.
          Jacob, his eyes almost swollen shut, wakes out of
          unconsciousness. He looks up through blurred vision.
          Through the trees, he can see A DISTANT FLICKERING RED LIGHT.
          He stands. His knees buckle and he crawls out to the ground.
          He stands again. And he walks out of the woods towards the
          flickering light.
          He stumbles and falls. He rises and fumbles forward...using
          all his strength to get himself out of the woods.

          EXT. CLEARING TO TRAIN TRACKS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob struggles out of the woods to a clearing. Squinting
          through the rain with swollen eyes, he sees:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

          THE FLICKERING RED LIGHT IS A SIGNAL LIGHT ON A TRAIN TRACK.
          He walks, with legs barely able to move. He climbs up the
          gravel to the train tracks and begins to walk...

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - PRE DAWN

          Jacob is walking on the train tracks in the direction of
          Marlena's train. He has walked all night and into the day.

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - A PENNSYLVANIA TOWN - DAY

          Jacob - beaten, bloodied, exhausted - looks up ahead:
          THE BENZINI BROS. TRAIN and THE BIG TOP TENTS already set up.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - A PENNSYLVANIA TOWN - DAY

          It's pre-matinee. All the tents have been set up. The rubes
          are filling the grounds. The midway is packed with people.

          EXT. TRAIN - BEHIND THE CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          Nell is sitting by an open window fanning herself from the
          heat when she sees:
          Jacob wandering behind the back of the train where no one can
          see him....Nell watches as Jacob tries to reach the train,
          then falls unconscious.
          Nell quickly brings Barbara to the window. Barbara sees Jacob
          and immediately takes charge.
          Camera tracks Barbara and the girls through the windows, as
          they walk through the car...Barbara is organizing a plan with
          the girls.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

          Nell and two Coochie Girls hold their robes closed as they
          walk among the crowd. The Coochie girls head for Blackie and
          his security men...They talk to them to distract them.
          We see Nell approach Walter in full clown make-up doing
          tricks with Queenie for the crowd. Nell whispers to Walter.
          His expression tells us what we know.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

          EXT. TRAIN - BEHIND THE CIRCUS GROUNDS - DAY

          Barbara and the Tattooed Man sneak to the fallen Jacob with a
          blanket. They turn him over, shocked by his condition.
          Jacob's eyes open - he's delirious.

                         BARBARA
          Poor Kid...Help me with him..

                         JACOB
          (delirious to Tattoo man)
          Don't you work the matinee?

                         TATTOOED MAN
          Not today. I'm fading. I gotta re-
          ink.

                         BARBARA
          Don't talk.
          Jacob nods. They cover him, pick him up and carry him off.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - TRAIN EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          Jacob opens his eyes. Walter is applying wet cloths to his
          head. Camel watches nearby. Jacob suddenly rises;

                         JACOB
          Marlena!!

                         WALTER
          Sshh. Lie back.

                         JACOB
          Where is she? Did he hurt her?

                         WALTER
          I don't know. Your pupils are two
          different sizes.
          Jacob pushes himself up onto his elbows but his world spins.

                         JACOB
          I have to get Marlena. What if he--

                         WALTER
          Jacob, look at me. You've got a
          concussion and you're on a moving
          train. There's nothing you can do.
          Marlena can handle him. She's done
          it for years...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         JACOB
          I have to get her.

                         WALTER
          Jacob, you can't.

                         JACOB
          She's going to have a baby.
          Walter is stopped. Camel shakes his head.

                         WALTER
          Does August know?
          (Jacob shakes his head)
          What have you done to us?

                         JACOB
          We're going to Ringling. Me,
          Marlena. You can too.

                         WALTER
          I'm a fifth rate clown when second
          rate circuses are folding all over
          the place. Doesn't put me on top
          of Ringling's list. They've got a
          dozen of me in the wings. I
          couldn't even go if I wanted to.
          August won't pay anyone. Says the
          show's debts have to come first.
          First time in Benzini Bros history
          performers haven't been paid.
          People are starving out there,
          Jacob. In the United States of
          America. Starving. Where am I going
          to go?

                         CAMEL
          What about family? Like my son.
          Gotta have somebody...a mother.

                         WALTER
          Not a woman I have any use for.
          She's sold me to this outfit when I
          was 13.

                         CAMEL
          She sold you?

                         WALTER
          I'm not exactly cut out for farm
          work. Don't worry about me..

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          111.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          ..If you and Marlena go, if August
          doesn't kill you first - I'll know
          what to do...I'll tell August how
          well I got to know you and how I
          can help him find you. Might even
          get myself a better room out of the
          bargain... It won't be anything
          personal, you understand.
          Beat. Each wants the other to survive at any cost.

                         JACOB
          Do whatever you have to, Walter.

                         WALTER
          You too, Jacob.
          They exchange a final look, which is a goodbye. Walter turns
          away from Jacob, holding Queenie to his chest.
          Camel looks compassionately at Jacob and says:

                         CAMEL
          Ya poor kid. The night this train
          passed ya...you shoulda kept on
          running, I guess.

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM - EN ROUTE - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Camel and Walter are snoring, asleep with their backs to
          Jacob. Queenie is asleep, nestled in Walter's arms.
          Jacob struggles to raise himself up. His world spins. He
          holds tight to the bedroll, until the spinning subsides.
          Jacob is a man with a mission. His eyes focus on: Walter's
          Knife, sticking out from beneath Walter's pillow.

          EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - EN ROUTE - NIGHT

          The train is moving fast. The rain has returned.
          Jacob is making his way towards the back of the train, as it
          moves forward. He holds the knife in his mouth...moving like
          a tightrope walker over the wet train roof, as rain pours.
          When he reaches the car's end, he takes a deep breath. With
          all his strength, he leaps across the divide between the cars
          and lands, clinging to the top rail, panting like a dog.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.
          He removes the knife from his mouth, having cut his lip. He
          licks the blood back and replaces the knife, this time
          keeping his lips retracted.

          JACOB MAKES HIS WAY ACROSS SIX CARS...LEAPING FROM CAR TO CAR

          BY LANDING ON THE ROOF, GETTING TO HIS KNEES THEN TO HIS FEET

          AND MOVING ON TO THE NEXT...


          EXT. ATOP MARLENA AND AUGUST'S STATEROOM CAR - NIGHT

          Jacob leaps to the roof of Marlena and August's car. At this
          moment, the train is making a curve.
          Jacob climbs down over the side ladder. Beyond him, we see:

          THE TRAIN IS TRAVERSING OVER A TRESTLE, FORTY YARDS ABOVE THE

          BOULDERS OF A RIVERBANK ILLUMINATED BY MOONLIGHT.
          Jacob jumps to the platform. He can see the rocky waters far
          below the trestle. He catches his breath and waits, as the
          train straightens out onto land again.
          Jacob turns the knob of the door to the stateroom, slowly,
          hearing a click, pausing, then opening it.

          INT. MARLENA AND AUGUST STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob enters the stateroom, leaving the door open. He creeps
          towards the velvet curtain which is closed. He grips the
          knife. When he reaches it, he pulls the edge and peeks
          inside.
          August is asleep on his side, his arms locked around Marlena,
          who is awake facing the curtain.
          Jacob and Marlena's eyes meet. She sees the knife in his hand
          August suddenly moves, pulls Marlena closer to his chest,
          burying his face in her neck.
          Jacob steps forward, raising the knife. His hands tremble.
          The moonlight glints off the blade, throwing off light.
          Marlena is looking up at him, tears in her eyes. She subtly
          shakes her head "NO"...She doesn't want him to do this.
          Jacob's hands are shaking now. The knife gripped in his hand.
          He wants to rescue her, he's so close. We hold the moment...
          Marlena's expression convinces Jacob not to do it...not to
          cross that line and kill August.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.
          Defeated, Jacob kneels beside her and hangs his head. Marlena
          reaches out to touch him...this time she really is saying
          goodbye. But Jacob can not bear it. He looks at her for the
          last time, then rises and exits.

          INT. RING STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Jacob returns to the ring stock car, hopping down from the
          roof. The Horses are stirring, agitated. He calms them...
          And then Jacob sees: the door to Walter's room is open. He

                         APPROACHES;

                         JACOB
          Walter? Camel?

          INT. KINKO'S ROOM/ RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob enters to find the room in a shambles. A terrible
          realization comes over him:
          Walter and Camel are gone. They have been red-lighted.

                         JACOB

          WALTER! CAMEL!!
          He finds Queenie, shaking with fear curled in a ball. He
          takes her in his arms. Jacob panics.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          No..no..no..no....!!!!
          With Queenie, he rushes back into the ring stock car...he
          checks everywhere calling out their names. He stops at the
          open stock car door. The rain continues to fall. Jacob
          collapses, holding Queenie to his chest. Tears fill his eyes
          as he tries to hold it together, looking out the moving
          train, his worst nightmare realized.

          POV; IN THE DISTANCE, THE TRESTLE THE TRAIN PASSED OVER

          JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I wanted to believe taking Walter's
          knife didn't make a difference. But
          still. I left him without a
          fighting chance. Maybe they
          survived. Maybe they were tossed
          over grassy land...I couldn't let
          myself believe what I already knew.
          Jacob falls apart, crying without shame.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING

          A sunny day. The circus is completely set up. Townsfolk,
          rubes, are already buying tickets for the matinee.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I waited almost til matinee time so
          I could let myself be seen by as
          many people from town.

          EXT. RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - ALTOONA, PA - LATE MORNING

          Jacob opens the ring stock car and jumps out, holding
          Queenie. He hasn't slept all night.
          As he walks through the circus grounds, working men like Greg
          and performers like Barbara are shocked to see him alive.
          With a fool's courage, he brazenly walks past Blackie and his
          men, cutting a path through performers and working men, right
          up to August, who stands with Earl at his side. He is dressed
          and ready for the matinee's performance.
          Jacob stops and they exchange looks. August glances at
          Queenie in Jacob's arms. He says nothing.

                         JACOB
          I'm not here to cause any trouble.
          I'm leaving.

                         AUGUST
          Funny, I thought you already left.

                         JACOB
          I'd like to say goodbye. To the
          menagerie. Just a few minutes and
          then I'll go.
          August's eyes narrow. Earl waits for the outcome.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          There's nothing more you can do to
          me. Killing me'll be more trouble
          than it's worth, now that the rubes
          have seen me. You were right about
          me from the start August, when you
          said I wouldn't last...I can't
          survive here...

                         (THEN)
          I am nothing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.
          August feels victorious and therefore benevolent.

                         AUGUST
          Earl, take him to the menagerie.
          Thirty seconds. Then escort him out
          of my circus, into Altoona. And if
          he comes back, you can shoot him,
          as that is within our lawful rights
          with regards to trespassers.
          August walks away. Earl escorts Jacob to the menagerie. On
          the way, they pass Barbara. Jacob pauses to hand Queenie to
          her. She has tears in her eyes. Jacob continues with Earl.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - MOMENTS LATER - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          Jacob enters alone. He takes in all the animals who look back
          at him. He crosses to Rosie and stands before her. Her trunk
          greets him, stroking him. He presses his head against her.
          Rosie comforts him. It makes Jacob fall apart all the more...
          After a few moments, Jacob turns and walks away. He stops in
          the center of the menagerie. He looks at each animal in their
          den - in the same way as when he first met them - this time
          saying goodbye.
          Each animal is at the front of it's den or cage, looking at
          Jacob. There is a silent exchange between them. Earl enters.

                         EARL
          Come on kid.
          When Jacob starts to exit again, something happens:

          ALL THE ANIMALS BEGIN BANGING AGAINST THEIR CAGES AND SHAKING

          THEIR BARS OR STOMPING THEIR FEET, SCREECHING OR ROARING OR

          BELLOWING, AS IF IN PROTEST OF THEIR JACOB'S DEPARTURE.
          The lock on Rex's cage busts a little as he rams against it.

          EXT. SIDESHOW TENTS/MIDWAY - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          As Earl escorts Jacob, they walk against the tide of audience
          members walking to the Big Top entrance. Earl speaks low.

                         EARL
          It's good you're going. They must
          have known you got back on the
          train last night. He tossed more
          than half a dozen working men.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          Kinkers never get tossed. Never. So
          that was meant for you.
          We hear the GOUNOD WALTZ starting in the Big Top.

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          A few of the guys that got tossed
          caught up with us again.

                         JACOB
          Walter! Is he---?
          Instantly, Earl's expression tells Jacob it's bad news.
          Jacob's breathing almost stops as he listens;

                         EARL
          Keep walking...They got tossed off
          the trestle, if you can believe it.
          Camel's head hit the rocks. He died
          right away...
          Jacob is heartbroken and dreads what he's about to hear. Earl
          pauses for a beat...this part is harder to tell:

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          ...Walter...Walter's legs were
          smashed up real bad..They had to
          leave him.

                         (BEAT)
          They don't reckon he lasted the
          night.
          Jacob is in shock. He can barely walk on...

                         EARL (CONT'D)
          The ones that came back...Bill...
          Grady.. I don't know how but, one
          way or another they're taking down
          August tonight.
          Hearing this, Jacob stops to face Earl.

                         JACOB
          Why are you telling me?
          Earl can not find the words: it's clear the killing of these
          men does not sit well with him.

          SUDDENLY, WE HEAR THE BIG TOP MUSIC COME TO A CRASHING HALT,

          FOLLOWED BY AN UNGODLY COLLISION OF BRASS THAT FINISHES WITH

          A CYMBAL'S HOLLOW CLANG.
          Earl shifts his focus - he's alarmed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Earl, what was that?
          All the performers and work men on the midway are on alert.

          WE HEAR THE BIG TOP BAND START PLAYING AGAIN...THIS TIME IT'S

          "STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER".

                         EARL
          Oh Christ! Oh Shit...
          Earl runs back towards the Big Top.

                         JACOB
          What is it?

                         EARL
          The Disaster March!
          Everyone with the show barrels towards the Big Top when Greg
          appears amongst them and calls to Jacob:

                         GREG

          JACOB! IT'S THE MENAGERIE!! THE

          ANIMALS ARE LOOSE.

          JACOB RUNS THROUGH THE PANICKED CROWD, THE GROUND RUMBLING

          BENEATH HIS FEET...THE SOUNDS OF HOOVES ON HARD DIRT.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

          Jacob shoots through the tent flap and is immediately flung
          up against the sidewall as:

          THE YAK THUNDERS PAST HIM, HIS HORN INCHES FROM JACOB, THE
          HYENA ON HIS BACK. Jacob looks to the menagerie and faces;

          A FULL FLEDGED STAMPEDE:

          - ALL THE ANIMAL DENS ARE OPEN.

          - CREATURES OF EVERY SORT...CHIMP, ORANGUTAN, LLAMAS, ZEBRA,

          LION, GIRAFFE, CAMEL AND HORSES... RUN IN A MAD TERROR AS

          THEY SCREECH, SCREAM, SWING, WHINY AND ROAR...

          - MONKEYS ARE SWINGING ON ROPES, SLITHERING UP POLES

          - THE CENTER CONCESSION STAND IS CRUSHED UNDER FOOT.

          - A TOWERING POLAR BEAR SLASHES WITH HIS SKILLET-SIZED PAWS,

          MAKING CONTACT WITH THE LLAMA, KNOCKING IT FLAT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.
          Jacob is scanning the tent for Marlena when:

          - THE ORANGUTAN RUNS THROUGH THE STAMPEDE DIRECTLY TO JACOB

          AND CLUTCHES ONTO JACOB'S LEG. JACOB MOVES TO PICK HER UP

          WHEN BOBO SWINGS FROM A ROPE AND JUMPS ONTO JACOB'S BACK.
          Jacob manages to hold Bobo in one arm and the Orangutan in
          the other as his eyes sweep the tent, searching for Marlena:
          Then Jacob sees - THE PANTHER MAKES IT'S WAY THROUGH THE

          CONNECTED WALKWAY TO THE BIG TOP AUDIENCE.

          - SECONDS LATER, AUDIENCE SCREAMS OF TERROR ARE HEARD. THE

          CROWD EXPLODES THROUGH THE BIG TOP, TRAMPLING OVER FELLOW

          AUDIENCE MEMBERS...THEY CHARGE INTO THE MENAGERIE ONLY TO

          FACE THE STAMPEDE..

          - THE MASS OF ANIMALS CHANGE DIRECTIONS AND THERE IS AN INTER-

          SPECIES FLOCK; LIONS, LLAMAS AND ZEBRAS RUNNING SIDE BY SIDE

          WITH THE CHIMPS AND ORANGUTANS..A HYENA SHOULDER TO SHOULDER

          WITH A TIGER...TWELVE HORSES AND A GIRAFFE WITH A SPIDER

          MONKEY ON IT'S NECK...THE POLAR BEAR NOW ON ALL FOURS,

          CHARGING...ALL OF THEM HEADING FOR THE CROWD OF PEOPLE...

          - THE CROWD SHIFTS, RIOTING BACK INTO THE BIG TOP. CLOGGING

          THE ENTRANCE...PEOPLE BANGING ON THE BACKS OF THOSE IN FRONT

          OF THEM..

          - THE CLOG BURSTS. PEOPLE AND ANIMALS FLEE IN EVERY

          DIRECTION...

          - A BENGAL TIGER FORCES ITSELF BETWEEN A WOMAN'S LEGS,

          SWEEPING HER TO THE GROUND...
          Searching and dodging animals, Jacob sees a flash of pink
          sequins. He sees August with Marlena standing beside him, in
          front of Rosie.

                         JACOB

          MARLENA!
          Marlena sees Jacob and makes a run for him, but August
          quickly grabs her arm and flings her to the ground. She falls
          out of view from Jacob.
          Jacob runs to them, dodging the fleeing animals, when
          suddenly: A BULL HOOK FLIES FROM OUT OF THE AIR ACROSS THE
          ANIMALS AND PIERCES JACOB'S SHOULDER. He cries out.
          Rosie cries out. She begins to stamp her feet. Marlena lies
          with her face in the dirt, crawling beneath the ropes to get
          under Rosie for safety.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          119.
          August pulls Jacob with a new bull hook, tossing him the
          ground. August glares at him, his eyes full of rage;

                         AUGUST

          YOU! YOU DID THIS!!
          He attacks but Jacob dodges the next blow, grabbing onto the
          bull hook and twisting it with such strength, it topples
          August who refuses to let it go...
          JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT SAVAGELY, AMIDST THE STAMPEDE. Like
          madmen fighting with the intention to kill.
          Jacob unleashes a rage and a strength we have yet to see in
          him, as he beats August without mercy...
          But August manages to overpower Jacob, unleashing his own
          maniacal fury. By taking advantage of the bull hook wound,
          August gets Jacob into a death grip around his neck.
          Marlena screams out, unable to help as animals stampede
          around the two men locked in combat.
          Only Rosie, who towers above them, knows what to do.
          Jacob, choking under August's grip, looks up at Rosie. She
          raises her trunk to smile at him. Jacob looks down and sees
          that ROSIE'S STAKE HAS BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND.
          Jacob fights August to breathe as Rosie reveals she is
          holding the stake loosely, resting it's end on the dirt. The
          chain still attached to her foot.
          Jacob flips himself which forces August to turn his back on
          Rosie in order to keep his grip on Jacob.
          Marlena covers her head in her arms, not wanting to see.
          Jacob can not breathe..August is squeezing the life from him

                         AS:
          Rosie lifts the stake as if it weighs nothing and brings it
          down onto August, splitting his head in one clean move. She
          continues to hold the stake until August topples forward,
          dead, his skull opened like a hardboiled egg..
          Released of August, Jacob rolls himself under the ropes just

                         BEFORE:

          A HERD OF ZEBRAS RUN PAST, CRUSHING AUGUST BENEATH THEM.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          120.
          Rosie then slides the stake back to the ground. Marlena, head
          hidden under her arms, sees nothing. The menagerie is clear
          of the stampeding animals.
          Marlena lifts her head up from beneath her arms, remaining
          under Rosie. She sees August lifeless body. She looks to
          Jacob. He rises, bloodied and beaten, but alive.
          WIDE ANGLE: The empty menagerie except for: Jacob standing,
          Marlena under Rosie and the two monkeys inspecting August's
          dead body.

          EXT. RESTAURANT - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          The polar bear is walking calmly down main street.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          It took days to round them up. Some
          we never did get back.

          INT. HOUSE - CHILDREN'S ROOM - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          Two Children are delighted that a GIRAFFE is eating from
          their second story window.

          INT. RESTAURANT - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          Camera discovers a DISHWASHER and REX THE LION, both
          quivering, huddled opposite each under beneath a sink.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          I don't know who was more scared -
          the rubes or the animals.

          EXT. NESCI BROS. TRAIN - CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          THE NESCI BROS. CIRCUS TRAIN is pulling up alongside the
          "ghost town" of the Benzini Bros - the ruins of the circus
          are highlighted by strong winds blowing up dust and dirt.

          JACOB (V.O.)
          When the Nesci Bros. Circus showed,
          we were officially belly up.
          A MAN SCREAMS after unrolling a canvas and making a discovery
          inside. A crowd forms. When Jacob reaches it, he sees:

          BLACKIE, DEAD, WITH A MAKESHIFT GARROTTE AROUND HIS NECK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          121.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - ALTOONA, PA - DAY

          DICK NESCI and the Sheriff fight with Jacob over Rosie...

                         SHERIFF
          ...These animals are now the
          property of Altoona and we're here
          to sell them to Mr. Nesci.

                         JACOB
          Not all of them! Some of these
          animals are mine, like this bull.

                         DICK NESCI
          Do you have any proof?
          Jacob is stalled. Greg appears.

                         GREG
          He's right. He's just an elephant
          tramp. The bull is his.

                         JACOB
          You don't want her anyway. She
          can't do anything. Dumb as a box of
          peanut shells.
          Skeptical, Dick Nesci steps up to Rosie.

                         DICK NESCI
          What's her name?

                         JACOB
          Gertrude.
          Jacob and Rosie exchange eye contact. Nesci is skeptical.

                         DICK NESCI
          Gertrude! Gertrude, step up! UP!
          Rosie blows and swings her trunk, throwing dirt across the
          people around her.
          Dick Nesci takes the bull hook and prods under her leg,
          ordering her UP! Rosie just swings her ears and sniffs Dick
          Nesci with her trunk. Then checks his pockets for treats.
          Jacob exchanges a look with Rosie.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          122.

          EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - ALTOONA, PA - LATER - DAY.

          Jacob is walking Rosie, holding the Orangutan, with Bobo
          atop Rosie. Through the wind and dust, they look for Marlena.

          FROM OUT OF A WALL OF WIND BLOWN DUST APPEARS MARLENA AND SIX
          OF HER BLACK AND WHITE HORSES. Marlena looks spent - shocked,
          relieved, tearful, hopeful. She reaches Jacob.

                         MARLENA
          What happens now?

                         JACOB
          I wish I knew.
          Marlena exhausted, eases into Jacob's arms. It's over.
          WIDE ANGLE: Jacob and Marlena and their animals, as the giant
          tent of the Benzini Bros. Big Top falls to the ground.

          INT. CHARLIE'S TRAILER - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT

          Jacob is finishing his story. Charlie is enthralled. The
          first bottle of scotch is gone. The second half full.

                         JACOB
          I convinced my dean to let me take
          my finals. Marlena was right. With
          my degree, our animals and
          Marlena's acts, Ringling got a
          sweet deal. Our son was born our
          first season. We named him Walter.
          He spent the first seven years of
          his life with Ringling.

                         (BEAT)
          That's why I...I just can't
          understand how he forgot to show up
          today.
          (His eyes glitter

                         CHILDLIKE)
          There was a circus in town.
          Charlie understands. He looks affectionately at Jacob.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          By the time our third son came,
          we'd had enough. Rosie was tired.
          (Charlie smiles. )
          Luckily, the vet at the Albany Zoo
          dropped dead, so I got the job.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          123.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          We bought some property so we could
          keep the horses...Rosie...then five
          kids...Bobo and that
          Orangutan...Never named that
          Orangutan. Nothing ever sounded..
          elegant enough for her. Just called
          her Ma'am.
          (Smiles with great joy)
          Man oh man that was...that was a
          life, boy, I'll tell ya...
          Charlie smiles, appreciating this old man's big life.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          And then before you know it, the
          kids are borrowing the car and
          moving out. Marlena and I on our
          own again...until she passed.
          This moment causes Jacob to pause. He still loves her.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          I never told Marlena it was Rosie
          who got August. I didn't want her
          to know. When Rosie passed on, she
          cried for days. I owe that bull my
          whole life...my kids, everything..
          A KNOCK. Charlie peeks through the window and sees a COP:

                         CHARLIE
          It's the heat.

                         JACOB
          They're here for me.
          Charlie and Jacob exchange a look. Charlie understands.

          INT/EXT. TRAILER DOOR - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

          Charlie opens the door to greet a LOCAL COP.

                         CHARLIE
          Hi Officer, can I help you?

                         COP
          Yes, I'm hoping you can. An elderly
          gentleman went missing from the
          nursing home down the street. Staff
          seems to think he came here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          124.

                         CHARLIE
          We had a lot of folks from the home
          today. But no, I haven't seen him.
          The Cop peers past Charlie and sees Jacob.

                         COP
          Excuse me, but who is that?

                         CHARLIE
          (Pause, then)
          Oh....that's my Dad.
          The Cop is suspicious. Charlie covers:

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          He can't talk. Had a major stroke a
          few years back. But he's doing
          well. Ain't ya Pop?
          Understanding the ruse, Jacob starts to play the part of a
          stroke victim: he opens his mouth, his jaw quivers. He
          reaches for his glass with a shaking arm. Charlie helps him.
          Jacob holds out his tongue like a parrot's as Charlie helps
          him drink. The Cop watches with a blank expression. Jacob
          swallows and nods speechless, smiles and manages to drool.
          Beat. The Cop wonders. Then, pulling out his card:

                         COP
          OK, well, thanks for your time.
          Here's my number in case you hear
          of anything. Sorry to bother you.
          The Cop exits. Charlie returns to sit opposite Jacob. They
          consider this unspoken proposal:

                         JACOB
          You sure about this?
          Beat as Charlie pours another shot. Then:

                         CHARLIE
          I wonder if we can get you into the
          book of records. "Oldest man who
          ever ran away with the circus".

                         JACOB
          Nah, I'm not running away. Just
          coming home.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          125.

          INT. MENAGERIE TENT - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT

          Old Jacob uses his walker to enter the menagerie. He moves to
          each animal meeting his eyes with theirs. Each animal gives
          him a look of acknowledgment.
          He comes to an ORANGUTAN...younger than the one from his
          Benzini days. Jacob stops. He steadies himself.
          Jacob lets go of the walker and reaches his arm out to the
          Orangutan's cage.
          The Orangutan studies him for a moment. Judging.
          Jacob keeps his arm extended, which isn't easy for him.
          The Orangutan then extends his hand through the bars to
          Jacob's hand.
          Jacob's fingers entwine around the Orangutan's hand. They
          hold for a moment. Jacob smiles.

                         JACOB
          Thank you, Ma'am.

                         THE END
WHITE CHRISTMAS

 
                                    "WHITE CHRISTMAS"

                                            by

                      Melvin Frank, Norman Krasna and Norman Panama

                

               FULL SHOT - REAR AREA - (DAY) - (GLASS)

               This is December 24, 1944, in the first safe area directly 
               behind the battle line, in the Italian theatre.

               In the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen 
               and artillery rumbles are heard.  The battered terrain shows 
               the effects of battle.

               In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with 
               camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage.  
               Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and 
               the ground.  A camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is 
               nearby.

               MED. SHOT - NEAR RECREATION AREA

               We can HEAR LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the men as a jeep 
               with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's 
               car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation 
               area.  A YOUNG SERGEANT is at the wheel, an ADJUTANT beside 
               him, and in the rear are GENERAL WAVERLY and GENERAL CARLTON.

               JEEP - MED. CLOSE

               As it jounces along.  General Waverly is weather-beaten and 
               weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long 
               wear.  General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean 
               and fresh from the Pentagon.

               He is staring off at the recreation area.

                                     GENERAL CARLTON
                              (To Adjutant)
                         What's this all about, Colonel?

                                     ADJUTANT
                              (Turning)
                         A little entertainment for the men, 
                         sir.  Tonight's Christmas Eve.

                                     GENERAL CARLTON
                         These men are moving up tonight.  
                         They should be lined up for full 
                         inspection!

               The jeep has come to a halt.

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                              (Eyeing him)
                         You're absolutely right.
                              (To Adjutant)
                         There's no Christmas in the Army, 
                         Colonel.

                                     ADJUTANT
                         Yes, sir.

               Waverly and the Adjutant alight from the jeep.

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                              (To Carlton)
                         There's always a slip-up or two during 
                         a change in command.  The men get a 
                         little loose.  But I know I'm leaving 
                         them in good hands.

                                     GENERAL CARLTON
                              (Stiffly)
                         Thank you.
                              (To Driver)
                         Sergeant, take me to headquarters 
                         immediately!  We'll have those men 
                         turned out on the double!

               The Sergeant looks at General Waverly.

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                         Goodbye, Sergeant.  Take the short 
                         cut.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Yes, sir!

               The jeep pulls off and makes a half circle. The Adjutant 
               makes a gesture, as if to stop it. The General stops him.

               TWO SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY AND ADJUTANT

               The Adjutant turns to him.

                                     ADJUTANT
                         That's not the way to headquarters!

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                         Joe, you know that, and I know that, 
                         but the new General doesn't know it.
                         Or he won't for about an hour and a 
                         half.

                                     ADJUTANT
                         That Sergeant'll be a private 
                         tomorrow!

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                         Yes... isn't he lucky?

               He takes the Adjutant by the arm and leads him toward the 
               recreation area.

               RAISED PLATFORM - MED. SHOT

               CAPTAIN BOB WALLACE (BING CROSBY) is wearing a makeshift 
               beard and Santa Claus hat and PRIVATE PHILIP DAVIS (DONALD 
               O'CONNOR) is in combat clothes.  They are doing a number to 
               entertain the soldiers, WHAT DOES A SOLDIER WANT FOR 
               CHRISTMAS?  During introduction, we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               5A.

               TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT

               just starting to take seats, off to one side where they are 
               not noticed by the performers.

               5B.

               GROUP SHOT - ABOUT 6 SOLDIERS

               seated in audience.  They look off, see General, start to 
               rise.

               5C.

               TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT

               The General notices them - motions for them to sit down again, 
               indicating he doesn't want attention called to himself.

               5D.

               PLATFORM - FULL SHOT

               The number concludes to applause.  Bob holds up his hand for 
               silence.  He removes his beard.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks, fellows.  I guess by now you 
                         know the Old Man's being replaced by 
                         a new Commanding General fresh out 
                         of the Pentagon... this divisions's 
                         been awfully lucky so far, but tonight 
                         they're running a special on St. 
                         Christophers at the PX... The Old 
                         Man's heading back to the rear - 
                         he's never moved in that direction 
                         in his life.  All I can say is, we 
                         owe so much to General Waverly and 
                         the way --

                                     WAVERLY'S VOICE
                              (A bellow)
                         ATTENTION!

               Automatically, Bob stiffens.  Phil does the same.

               AUDIENCE - FULL SHOT

               Every man is at attention and every head has turned to where 
               General Waverly has taken up a position near the front of 
               the platform.

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                         Captain Wallace, button your shirt.
                         You're out of uniform!
                              (Bob, grinning, hastily 
                              buttons his shirt)
                         This division is now under the command 
                         of General Harold G. Carlton, and I 
                         don't want anyone to forget it -- 
                         not that he'll let you.  He's tough -- 
                         just what this sloppy outfit needs.  
                         You'll be standing inspection night 
                         and day -- you may even learn how to 
                         march.  And if you don't give him 
                         everything you got, I may come back 
                         and fight for the enemy.  Merry 
                         Christmas!

               The boys respond with "Merry Christmas".

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                              (Embarrassed)
                         Well -- I guess that's about it - uh - 
                         uh --

               Bob, covering his embarrassment:

                                     BOB
                         Perhaps I can help you out, sir.

               He turns to the musicians, gives the downbeat.  They play 
               THE OLD MAN, which is sung by the entire outfit.

               The General stands at attention through the first chorus, 
               visibly moved.  During the second chorus he starts up the 
               aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is 
               bandaged to the knee. The Adjutant puts out his arm to help.  
               Waverly refuses. Toward the finish of the song, he turns, 
               faces the men and salutes them.  The men return the salute.  
               (This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the 
               enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.)  There is a Red Cross 
               ambulance standing by.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT - (NIGHT) - TINY CANDLE

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a hand lighting a candle on 
               a tiny makeshift Christmas tree.  We reveal a number of 
               enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench, including 
               Bob and Phil.  One of the men looks at his wristwatch.  Now 
               another does.

               CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH

               The hand is approaching midnight.

               CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER

               He is looking at his wristwatch.

               CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH

               The second hand is pointing to the hour.

               FULL SHOT OF SCENE

               This is the prearranged signal for Bob to begin singing WHITE 
               CHRISTMAS.  Phil accompanies him on a harmonica.  Toward the 
               end of the song, an enemy barrage DROWNS out the music.  A 
               shell BURSTS in the vicinity.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               Phil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel 
               burst.  This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which 
               he thinks is unnecessary.  Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look, 
               brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song 
               left off.  Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him.

               CAMERA SHOOTING UP to the sky as brilliant fireworks explosion 
               lights up the screen.  Over scene SUPERIMPOSE:

               12-A.

               INSERT - NEWSPAPER

               Headline reads: "V-E DAY!"

               As CAMERA MOVES FAST INTO headline, we LOSE the fireworks 
               display and the headline covers the whole screen.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INSERT - CHURCH TOWERS - (DAY)

               Bells are ringing for celebration of V-E Day.  CAMERA MOVES 
               INTO mouth of one bell, blacking out the screen.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BILL POSTER OF FLORIDA SHOW - (NIGHT)

               featuring names and pictures of Bob and Phil.  CAMERA MOVES 
               to a CLOSE SHOT of the picture, HOLDS for a second, then 
               suddenly the picture comes to life and we are on the stage 
               of the theatre where Bob and Phil are doing the production 
               number "BELLS".

               MED. SHOT - INT. THEATRE - AUDIENCE

               Perhaps twenty people, photographed at a slant.  They're 
               warm.  One woman has a fan, some use programs.  They are 
               enjoying the show, however.  There are some vacant seats 
               apparent.  This theatre is a modern traveling tent show, 
               such as have been playing in Florida in recent years, and 
               beyond the sides we see palm trees, characteristic of Florida.

               The curtain is down, the boys come off, the curtain goes up 
               on the next number, which is dancing.  Phil and Bob are met 
               by COOKE, the Company Manager.

               RITA, a luscious Latin type, and some of the remaining chorus 
               girls and other players ad lib, "Couldn't be cuter!"  "Great."  
               "Very funny!"

                                     COOKE
                              (To Bob and Phil)
                         New York's on the telephone.

               Bob and Phil, with Cooke, go to the backstage telephone.

                                     PHIL
                              (Into phone)
                         Hello.
                              (He listens.  To Bob 
                              and Cooke)
                         Oscar.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE

               This is the business office of Bob and Phil.  OSCAR is their 
               representative and manager, not their employer.

               He is sixty and looks competent.  He refers to a telegram in 
               his hand.  Pictures of the boys adorn the desk, and Wallace 
               and Davis sheets of previous shows are on the wall.  It must 
               be evident from their billing that the boys are important 
               stars in New York.

                                     OSCAR
                         Listen, I just heard what you're 
                         doing -- giving the cast a week off 
                         with pay for Christmas.  You don't 
                         know how touched I am.  I'm all choked 
                         up.  Between sobs, I managed to book 
                         you on the Ed Harrison show this 
                         week to take up the slack.  It'll be 
                         stealing money.

               17A.

               CLOSE SHOT - GROUP

               Phil is holding the receiver up to Bob.  Oscar's VOICE can 
               be plainly heard.

                              (Into phone)
                         We'll have to go to New York -- four 
                         days and four nights of rehearsals -- 
                         that's stealing money?

                         It is for me  -- I get ten percent.
                              (He listens for a 
                              moment)
                         Next time you guys make a charitable 
                         gesture, find out if you got with 
                         what to make it.  See you Wednesday.

               He hangs up.

               GROUP SHOT - PHIL, BOB AND COOKE

               Bob hangs up the phone.

                                     BOB
                         Well... while the cast takes it easy 
                         we'll be slaving over a hot kinnie.

                                     COOKE
                         What train do you want?  There's a 
                         one-thirty this morning but you have 
                         to sit up all night.

                                     PHIL
                         Let's get out tonight.

                                     BOB
                         Okay.

               The boys walk to their dressing room.  A group of the chorines 
               come flying by, toward the dressing rooms, with squealing.  
               They make quite a picture from the rear, bouncing and all.

                                     PHIL
                         What are we going to do until one-
                         thirty?

                                     BOB
                         We'll eat dinner.

                                     PHIL
                              (Looking at the 
                              retreating bouncing)
                         Eat, eat  All you think of is your 
                         stomach!

               Rita shows up in front of Phil.

                                     RITA
                              (Eagerly)
                         You said you had something to rehearse 
                         with me after the show.  What is it?

               Phil evidently was trying to hide this from Bob and is self-
               conscious at being caught.

                                     PHIL
                         It's a kind of new dance number.

                                     RITA
                              (Eagerly)

                         He isn't.  Some business has come 
                         up.  See you in a week.
                              (He pulls Phil away)

               The boys are now finishing their dinner.  Bob is facing the 
               orchestra, Phil would have to turn to see it.  The MUSIC 
               plays, the boys eat.  The table is close to the bar.  On two 
               stools sit JUDY and BETTY.  Betty is wearing her glasses and 
               examining some railroad tickets that have just been handed 
               her by the bartender.  Phil is not paying attention to his 
               eating, he is entranced with Judy's pretty legs draped over 
               the bar stool.  Bob cannot see the girls and is not even 
               interested enough to turn around.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY

               On her part, Judy is not absorbed in the tickets, but is 
               unobtrusively sizing up Phil.

               Bob notices Phil's absorption.

                         Have you ever considered laying off 
                         the female sex for awhile?

                         tidbits during the season.  You were 
                         man enough to give me your hand on 
                         it.

               Betty looks from the tickets and sees that Judy is covertly 
               eyeing Phil.  She leans forward.

                                     BETTY
                              (Quietly)
                         Ahem.
                              (Judy's eyes are toward 
                              Phil.  A little louder)
                         Ahem!  All right dear, relax.

                                     JUDY
                         He's awful cute.

                                     BETTY
                         So was the one in Kansas City, and 
                         the one in Canton, Ohio, and the one 
                         in Waco, Texas.

                                     JUDY
                              (Mock seriousness)
                         Canton, Ohio wasn't so much.

                                     BETTY
                         One of these days you're going to 
                         meet somebody extra cute and the 
                         next performance I'll be doing a 
                         single.

                                     JUDY
                              (Sincerely)
                         Nobody'll ever be cute enough to 
                         break up this sister act.

               Phil is still fingering the card.

                                     PHIL
                         I haven't much luck with sister acts.  
                         They're all alike.  Shall I tell you 
                         what these two are like?

                         Four feet two inches tall.  Pudgy.  
                         Round races.  Have big bows in their 
                         hair.  Always smiling.
                              (He parodies a smile)
                         Lots of teeth.  Sister acts have 
                         more teeth than anybody else.  Two, 
                         three hundred teeth at a time.  The 
                         American Dental Association is 
                         investigating it.

               There is a drum roll from the orchestra.  Betty takes off 
               her glasses and puts them in their case, on the bar.  The 
               bandleader's voice announces:

                                     BANDLEADER
                         Ladies and gentleman, the Stewart 
                         Sisters!

               The audience applauds politely while the girls start toward 
               the platform,  Phil reacts in surprise to the new development.

               23-A.

               PLATFORM - FULL SHOT

               Betty and Judy do their number: "SISTERS".  As they take 
               their bows --

               Phil pretends to recognize Judy.

                         Say, Dolores!  That's Dolores!

                                     BOB
                         Who?

                                     PHIL
                         Remember that girl I told you about 
                         who got sick in St. Paul?  That's 
                         her!  The girl in the oxygen tent!  
                         I told you about her!  The road 
                         company of "Student Prince."  The 
                         whole company went to church and 
                         prayed for her!  It was the most 
                         touching thing I've ever seen in 
                         show business.

                                     (HE GETS UP.)
                         I'll bring her over.

               He goes, Bob watching, disgusted.  NOVELLO, the owner of the 
               Waterfront Inn, comes up.

               MED. SHOT - BOB AND NOVELLO

               Novello evidently knows Bob.

                         Didn't you get your dessert yet, Mr.

                         I'm not having any, but I think my 
                         partner's lining up some pastries 
                         now.

                         Sure wish I could afford to book you 
                         boys here.

                         We saw your show at the matinee, and 
                         we liked it very much.

                         We're booked in Vermont.

                         Vermont?  What's there?

                                     BETTY
                         Snow.  We spent last Christmas in 
                         South Carolina, the year before in 
                         Hawaii.  They didn't seem like 
                         Christmases.  There ought to be snow.  
                         This one's going to be real white.

                                     BOB
                         Well, it's the way you've been raised.  
                         If you saw a lot of snow when you 
                         were a kid you miss it more around 
                         Christmas. There's a lot of snow 
                         around St. Paul.

                                     JUDY
                         Is that where you come from - St. 
                         Paul?

               It dawns on him, slowly.  He shows no emotion.

                                     BOB
                         No.  You come from St. Paul.

                                     JUDY
                         I come from Canton, Ohio.

                              he knows)
                         I'd like to ask you something.  Were 
                         you ever in an oxygen tent?

                                     JUDY
                         Oxygen tent?  Oh no!

                         Were you ever in a road company of

                         No.  Why?

               Bob looks at Phil.  The rules are clear between them.

               Bob puts his hand out.  Phil takes it.  They shake.

                                     BOB
                         Very good.

                         What I admire are the details, the 
                         invention, the little lies all around 
                         the big one.  It takes talent.

                                     PHIL
                         Oh, it's nothing.

                                     BOB
                         Don't say that.  Don't belittle 
                         yourself.  Credit where credit is 
                         due.  You did it fine.

               They move toward the dance floor.

                                     BOB
                         Want to make sure they keep dancing.

                                     BETTY
                         Stop worrying.  He won't get any 
                         place with her.

                         I'm positive.  I trained her myself.

                         She's in the ring with the champ, 
                         though.  You've heard of Alcoholics

                         Well, you keep an eye on him, and 
                         I'll keep an eye on her.

                                     BOB
                         Fine. We can make out the probation 
                         report together.

               The orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song.  (To 
               be decided upon.)  The vocal is shared by Bob, Betty, Judy 
               and Phil, individually.  Toward the end of the vocal Phil 
               dances Judy out to the terrace overlooking the water.  This 
               blends into their dance.  The staging of the number should 
               reunite the four principals by the end of the number.  The 
               audience applauds and they all go back to their booth.

                                     JUDY
                         They're both very cute, aren't they?

                                     BETTY
                              (Hiding her real 
                              interest)
                         Both?

                                     JUDY
                         Uh huh.

                                     BETTY
                         Which one do you like best?

                                     JUDY
                         I like them both.

                                     BETTY
                         You can't have both.  There's a law.

                                     JUDY
                         Oh, we'll never meet them again, 
                         what does it matter?

               The men are now up to them and help them into the booth.

               Bob does not sit.

                                     BOB
                         Judy, you made even him look good.

                                     JUDY
                              (Pleased)
                         You're very flattering, but he was 
                         doing all the leading.

                                     BETTY
                              (Fair)
                         You dance very well together.  If I 
                         say it.

                                     PHIL
                              (Sitting)
                         Lightest girl I ever saw.  Floats 
                         like a bubble.  One big bubble.

                                     BOB
                         All right, bubble lover, stand up!

                                     PHIL
                         What for?  I just sat down.

                                     BOB
                         La train.  At one-thirty, and we 
                         have to pack.

                                     PHIL
                         Train?

                                     BOB
                         You know, choo choo.  Goes on tracks.
                              (Train whistle noise)
                         Wo woo.

                                     PHIL
                         Oh no!

                                     BOB

                         Can't we go tomorrow?

                                     BOB
                         The train goes tonight.
                              (Phil looks 
                              disconsolately at

                         Say goodbye to the lady bubble, 
                         because we're going to have to run 
                         for it now.

                                     PHIL
                         Lady bubble, I have an idea we're 
                         going to meet up again sometime.

                                     JUDY
                         We might, we're on the same train.

                                     PHIL
                         No.

                                     JUDY
                         Yes.

                                     BOB
                              (Pulling Phil away)
                         No.

               As they start off, Novello enters to the girls, agitated.

                                     NOVELLO
                         The sheriff is here! He's in my 
                         office!

                                     JUDY
                         The sheriff!

                                     NOVELLO
                         He's got a warrant to arrest you!

               Bob has stopped.  He looks at Phil, suspiciously.

                                     BOB
                         I thought we watched you every minute.

               Phil holds up his hand in "Scout's honor."

                                     PHIL
                         Never stopped dancing.

               Bob turns back to the table.

                                     BOB
                              (To the girls)
                         Can we help?

                                     JUDY
                              (Fearful)
                         I've never been arrested!

                                     PHIL
                         There's nothing to it!

                                     BOB
                         Don't get panicky!

                                     NOVELLO
                         Yes, don't get excited, you still 
                         have to give your show!
                              (Apologetically)
                         He's not going to arrest them until 
                         after the show!

                                     BOB
                         That's considerate!  How'd you arrange 
                         that?

                                     NOVELLO
                         I'm a taxpayer here!  You better go 
                         in and change, girls!  You haven't 
                         much time!

               The girls start off, confused.  Novello, Bob and Phil follow.

                                     BOB
                         May I enquire what you are being 
                         arrested for?

                                     BETTY
                         The owner of the hotel we were at 
                         says we dropped a cigarette on his 
                         rug and burned it.

                                     JUDY
                         We couldn't have dropped a cigarette 
                         because we don't smoke.

                                     BETTY
                         He wants two hundred dollars, but 
                         it's just plain stealing.

                                     JUDY
                         We left the money for our bill in an 
                         envelope on the bed.

                                     BETTY
                         Then we dropped the bags out the 
                         window and checked them at the depot.

                                     JUDY
                         What are we going to do now?

                                     NOVELLO
                         You have to give another show.

               He leaves them, as Bob and Phil look unpleasantly after him. 
               They have reached the wings.

                         Kind of old fashioned, isn't it?
                         I thought that went out with the 
                         Cherry Sisters. We'll have to do 
                         something.

                         Got a flash?

                         A glimmer.  Have to stir it around a 
                         little.

               The girls have opened the door to their dressing room.

                                     JUDY
                         We wouldn't want you boys to get

                         the same cell.

               Novello is with the SHERIFF and the LANDLORD.  The Sheriff 
               is a husky fellow. At the moment he's eating an eclair and 
               coffee, from Novello's desk.  The Landlord glares at him.

                                     LANDLORD
                         That's the second dessert you've 
                         had, Sheriff!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Real good, too.

                                     LANDLORD
                         I haven't got all night to wait here 
                         while you eat free food!  You've got 
                         your warrant, arrest those girls!

                                     SHERIFF
                              (Displeased)
                         Now, we agreed to let them finish 
                         their show first.

                                     LANDLORD
                         I didn't agree!
                              (To Novello)
                         That was his idea!

                                     NOVELLO
                         I've got some rights, too.  You don't 
                         get those girls until after they've 
                         done their number!

                                     LANDLORD
                         Well, how long is it going to take?

               Novello puts his hand up, listening.

                                     NOVELLO
                         Wait a minute! That's their music!

               He gets up, opens the office door, and we HEAR their entrance 
               music, as before, and the Orchestra Leader's voice, "The 
               Stewart Sisters."

               We faintly HEAR the applause.

                         They're clapping! It's over!  Arrest 
                         them!

               The Sheriff gets up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Ma, unhook my bra!

               The office door opens behind them, which they do not see. 
               The Sheriff steps out, followed by the Landlord and Novello.

               There is a plaque attached to the key in the lock.  The

                         through the window.

               The landlord is delighted.

                         If they make a break for it, shoot 
                         'em!

               MED SHOT - EXT. CAFE - (NIGHT) - SHERIFF

               The Sheriff walks around the corner of the cafe, and a police 
               car awaits, with cop at the wheel.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Just a minute, Hank, couple of 
                         customers coming up.

                                     HANK
                         Okay, boss.

               The Sheriff continues to the window of our dressing room.

               MED CLOSE SHOT - DRESSING ROOM WINDOW

               It opens.  The Sheriff watches it.  Out comes Phil's legs, 
               meaning to get out backwards.  The Sheriff applies both hands 
               and pushes back.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Back you go, boys!

               He pushes Phil in.  Nimbly, he raises himself in.

               MED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM

               The Sheriff is in the room.  He looks coolly at the boys, 
               who are now in their own clothes.  He stares at them.  They 
               stare at him.  Recognition comes all at once.

                                     PHIL

               They all throw their arms around each other, pounding 
               violently.  'No!  Wow!  You dirty skunk!  You grave robber!'

                                     PHIL
                              (Unbelieving)

                         After I got out of the army I sat 
                         down and figured it out!  Who never 
                         got in trouble in the army?  The 
                         M.P.'s!  They were the ones who 
                         arrested you!  So I came back here 
                         and ran for Sheriff!

                         A civilian M.P.!  If the fellows 
                         ever saw you now!  They'd skin you 
                         alive!

                         climbed up -
                              (As he says 'Danny 
                              Beasly' he recalls 
                              Danny is dead)
                         - the tower of the City Hall and 
                         rang the bell by swinging on the 
                         clapper?  He couldn't hear anything 
                         for two days.

                         make it.

                         You can say that again.  Say I'm 
                         supposed to arrest a couple of dames!  
                         A fellow swore out a warrant!

               He starts with his red lights going, his siren screaming, 
               and tires grinding.

               MED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM

               The Sheriff watches them go, pleased.  A pounding on the 
               door recalls the Landlord, and he frowns.  He strides to the 
               door, takes out his key and opens it.

               MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR

               The Landlord and Novello are looking out the window at the 
               departing police car, the noise having distracted them from 
               the door pounding.  The siren is still heard, retreating.  
               The Sheriff snaps his cigarette at their feet.  They turn to 
               him, faces alight.

                              gently, and starts 
                              him out)

               He protests, 'What - !' 'But!'  Novello is openmouthed.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               The girls are on the observation platform.  The police car 
               screams to a stop.  The boys fly out, with bags, and just 
               make the train, the girls pulling them aboard.

                         week up in Vermont.

               Bob looks from him to Judy, whose expression is almost 
               pleading.

                         of days.  Don't you want me to enjoy 
                         the winter sports?

               MED. SHOT - INT. TRAIN

               All but Phil are half dozing.  One or two other people are 
               seen in the background, asleep.  There is an air of peace 
               and quiet in the car, as the music underscoring continues.  
               Their faces are occasionally streaked with light flashes 
               emanating from the surrounding countryside.  Phil turns to 
               the side of the car and sees a bill poster showing a copy of 
               a winter scene from the Grandma Moses collection, advertising 
               Vermont.  CAMERA PULLS UP TO scene, the music swells and we 
               DISSOLVE to a similar landscape in stylized concept.  This 
               is the WINTER FANTASY production number.  At the end of the 
               fantasy we hear the Conductor's voice, "Pine Tree.  Pine 
               Tree, Vermont."

               Our foursome is just getting off the train.  They are the 
               only ones.  They are looking about, puzzled.

                         This isn't a southern Vermont?

                         There has to be snow!  This place is 
                         advertised as America's Snow

               The other three bus drivers are disappointed.

               The bus goes by an incongruous skating rink, with water 
               instead of ice.  Signs indicate the direction of the sun 
               scorched toboggan slide.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               The bus winds around another turn in the beautiful green 
               surroundings and we pass a ski lift and a ski jumping 
               platform.

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               MARTHA, a sixty year old spinsterish woman, good of heart, 
               forbidding exterior, is occupied at the desk.

               The door opens and a pretty fifteen year old, SUSAN, carrying 
               the mail, walks toward her.

                                     SUSAN
                         Mail, Martha.

               She puts the mail on the desk.

                                     MARTHA

                              through it)
                         What's the weather forecast down at 
                         the Post Office?

                                     SUSAN
                         Awful.  Fair and warmer.

                                     MARTHA
                         If we don't get snow soon we can 
                         turn this hotel into a haunted house.  
                         We haven't had a guest for three 
                         weeks.

                                     SUSAN
                              (As Martha keeps 
                              searching through 
                              the mail)
                         What are you looking for?

                              (Not finding it)
                         Your grandfather's written Washington 
                         asking if he can get back in active 
                         service.  I think he wants to fly 
                         jets.

                                     SUSAN
                         I think he could do it.

                                     MARTHA
                         He says older men have been called, 
                         and besides, he misses the food.  I 
                         tell you, Susan, he tried to make it 
                         a casual letter, with little jokes, 
                         but it came out just begging.

               Through the huge window behind Susan and Martha we see the 
               figure of a man in overalls, bending over an incinerator, 
               shoveling the ashes into a wheelbarrow.

               His back is to CAMERA.

                                     SUSAN
                              (Moved)
                         Oh, Martha!  What are we going to 
                         do?

                                     MARTHA
                              (Blowing her nose)
                         I don't know.  Don't let on we know 
                         he's written.  He'll start in I'm 
                         only his housekeeper and that I found
                         out through some chicanery or 
                         something.

                                     SUSAN
                              (Soothing her)
                         How did you find out?

                                     MARTHA
                         Like any housekeeper --  I read the 
                         carbon paper.
                              (She hands the mail 
                              to Susan)
                         Bring him the mail.

               Susan starts out as CAMERA MOVES UP to window.  After a 
               moment, Susan appears and crosses to the man in overalls.  
               He straightens up, dusts off his hands, and as he turns to 
               take the letters, we see for the first time that he is General 
               Waverly.  He looks through them, eagerly, then, downcast, 
               shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work.

                         you.  We'll pay you the half salary 
                         for canceling.

                         I'm afraid not, ma'am.

               Through the door comes Waverly, carrying a load of wood in 
               one arm, and a bucket of coke in the other hand.  Susan 
               follows carrying an armful of kindling.

               Bob turns away.

                              to a stop, and then 
                              to attention)

                         Begging your pardon, sir.

                         Well, to put it in one sentence, 
                         people don't expect major generals 
                         to carry firewood.

               Through the door comes Phil, fast, talking:

                                     PHIL
                         Bob, I was thinking we ought to -

               Phil has his arm out indicating the direction of the door, 
               when he sees Waverly.  He freezes.  He brings his hand up to 
               a salute, from that position.

                                     WAVERLY
                         At ease!

                         Oh, sir!
                              (Horrified)
                         A janitor!

                                     WAVERLY
                         Never thought I'd make it, he?  
                         ...Matter of fact, it's worse than 
                         that.  I own this hotel.

                              (To Waverly)
                         Don't worry -- I've already told 
                         them we'd have to cancel.

                         Why?  We have a floor, haven't we?

                                     MARTHA
                         Last time I looked.  But who are

                         Even if it's only to you and me, it 
                         will be well worth it.  Besides, 
                         there will be six inches of snow 
                         tonight and we'll be full up tomorrow.

                              (Happily)
                         Is that the weather forecast?

                                     WAVERLY
                         No.  But if there was one thing I 
                         learned in the army it was to be 
                         positive -- especially when you don't 
                         know what you're talking about. You'll 
                         excuse me, gentlemen, I'm on K.P.

               Phil and Bob stiffen automatically.

                                     PHIL AND BOB
                         Yes, sir!

                              (To Betty and Judy)
                         And you two charming ladies, I want 
                         you to know I'm looking forward to 
                         your show this evening.  Whatever 
                         your audience lacks in numbers, it
                         will make up for in enthusiasm --
                              (He glares at Martha)
                         or I'll know the reason why!

               He smiles at the girls, and exits, dignified.

                                     JUDY
                              (Utterly charmed)
                         Gee... no wonder we won the war!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DINING ROOM INN - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT -

               BETTY AND JUDY

               They are doing the number, SISTERS, on the floor.  THE CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK to reveal the scene.  There is a scant audience 
               distributed at several tables, totaling not more than fourteen 
               in number.  Not far from the kitchen entrance Bob and Phil 
               are sitting at one table.

               Martha is seen doing general overseeing, principally acting 
               as hostess.  Susan doubles between the cashier's desk and 
               helping out at table.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               They are admiring the performance.  Phil indicates for Bob 
               to look in this direction.  Bob does.

               REVERSE ANGLE - MED. SNOT

               The General is seating a table.

               MED. SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               Bob shakes his head, unhappy at this condition.  They look 
               at each other.

                                     BOB
                         I think well stay a little longer 
                         than we planned.

               MED. FULL SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY

               They finish the number and are applauded enthusiastically, 
               but the few people in the audience don't make for much 
               clatter.  One set of hands seems to be applauding loudest 
               and clearest.

               MED. SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY

               He is the one doing the enthusiastic applauding.  He walks 
               toward the boys, still applauding.  They applaud too.  The 
               girls enter the scene, to sit with the boys.

               Martha is only applauding politely, until Waverly glares at 
               her.  Then her enthusiasm is boundless.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Excellent.  I enjoyed it very much.

                                     JUDY
                         Thank you.

                                     MARTHA
                         It was nice, if you like music.

               A waitress brings food, which Martha helps distribute.

                                     BETTY
                              (After a look that 
                              the waitress is not 
                              in a position to 
                              hear)
                         Mister Waverly, we'd like to make 
                         you a proposition.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Smiling)
                         Well, for heaven's sake!

                                     BETTY
                         You've been very nice not canceling, 
                         we'd like to make a gesture.  Until 
                         it snows, and you have guests, we'll 
                         take half salary.

                                     MARTHA
                              (Appreciative)
                         That's really nice of you.
                              (She takes out pencil 
                              and her order book)
                         Now let's get that in writing.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Pushing it aside)
                         Never heard of anything so ridiculous.
                              (Gets up)
                         Your next performance is tomorrow 
                         night, after dinner.  Be here, or 
                         I'll sue!

               He dignifiedly walks in the direction of some departing 
               guests, and proceeds to show them to the door.

                                     MARTHA
                              (Annoyed)
                         Light-Horse Harry.  Advance, advance, 
                         never retreat!  He's advancing right 
                         into bankruptcy.

                                     PHIL
                         That's just the way he was in the 
                         army.  Always thinking of the other 
                         fellow.

                                     BOB
                         We ate and then he ate.  We slept, 
                         and then he slept.

                                     PHIL
                         Then he woke up, and nobody slept 
                         for the next forty-eight hours.

                                     MARTHA
                         I happen to know he's sunk his life's 
                         savings into this place.  I read the 
                         carbon paper.

                                     JUDY
                         Gee, I wish there were something we 
                         could do to help.

                                     BOB
                         Maybe there is.

                                     PHIL
                         You got a flash?

                                     BOB
                         A glimmer.  Have to stir it around a 
                         bit.

                                     PHIL
                              (To the girls)
                         Shhh!
                              (Indicating Bob, 
                              tapping his forehead)
                         Ticking away madly.  Wheels within 
                         wheels.  This is the brain that, in 
                         darkest Italy, devised a formula to 
                         make food out of K-Ration!  Shhhhhh!

               As he regards Bob with something akin to awe, we

               MED. SHOT - INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT)

               The last of the supper audience is leaving.  We see into a 
               room which adjoins the reservation desk and Bob is on the 
               phone.

               CLOSE SHOT - INT. INN OFFICE

               Phil is sitting on the desk while Bob talks.

                         Relax... I didn't ask you how much 
                         it'll cost us...

                              high voice on the 
                              phone)
                         Easy, easy, remember your blood 
                         pressure... I don't care how much

                         Incidentally, how much will this 
                         cost?

                              It obviously is a 
                              very large number)

                         you take care of the money for both 
                         of us because you're older and so 
                         level headed.  I wonder where I'd be 
                         now if hadn't saved your life?

                         If you had been on the Titanic when 
                         it went down, you wouldn't've been 
                         satisfied just to sink into the ocean.

               FULL SHOT - COLUMBIA INN FLOOR - (DAY)

               The scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying 
               preparations for the show.  The little stage has been enlarged - 
               the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall 
               pushed back a little farther.  There is hammering and painting 
               going on in various parts of the room.  Trunks have been 
               unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places, as more trunks 
               arrive.  Girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around, 
               do cartwheels; two people sing at the piano; six girls kick 
               in unison; altogether, it is quite a contrast to the bareness 
               of the previous scene.

               THE CAMERA TRUCKS through all the activity, taking in our 
               group at the doorway, which features Bob and Phil, the girls 
               standing nearby.  Martha and Susan are amazed at the activity.

                         I can't believe it!  You mean you 
                         brought the whole show up here?

                                     BOB
                         When you hired the Stewart sisters 
                         you also hired a New York show.  It 
                         was in the small print.

                         And you can't get out of it.  We've 
                         got lawyers.

                         if Gramp'll let you do it?

                                     PHIL
                         Why not?

                         Now just a second.  We're not doing 
                         this for him!

                                     PHIL
                         Oh no!  We're bringing the show down 
                         here to rehearse!

                                     BOB
                         The company's been getting a little 
                         ragged.  We'd appreciate the use of 
                         the hall.

                                     PHIL
                         Of course we don't expect it free!

                                     BOB
                         We'll pay a little, but not much. -
                         You see, the audience will be guinea-
                         pigs -- and for us, that's quite an 
                         improvement.

               This has not fooled Susan.  She throws her arms around Bob 
               and then Phil.

                                     SUSAN
                         I don't know what to say!

               She cannot refrain from tears of gratitude and turns and 
               runs out.  There is a moment of silence.

                                     BOB
                         I hope this is not an indication of 
                         advancing age, getting kissed out of 
                         gratitude.

                                     PHIL
                         You didn't expect a girl that pretty 
                         to kiss you because she wanted to?

                                     BOB
                         A body keeps hoping.

               Betty steps up to him and gives him the biggest smack.

               Bob is quite surprised.

                                     BETTY
                              (Sincerely)
                         That was the nicest thing I ever saw 
                         anybody do.

                                     BOB
                         It was still gratitude.

                                     PHIL
                              (To Judy)
                         I'm his partner.  I'm entitled to 
                         half the credit.
                              (Judy steps up to him 
                              and just pecks him 
                              on the cheek, then 
                              joins her sister in 
                              rehearsal)
                         She's not as grateful as her sister.

               They look off through the exit and see a moving van unloading 
               scenery, as the General arrives in his buggy.

               He steps down and looks with amazement at the scenery passing 
               by.

               Waverly is looking interestedly at the goings on, but is 
               puzzled.  The boys exchange a glance.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Finally)
                         I'm not clear about some of it.  
                         Explain it again.

                                     PHIL
                              (Not too good a job)
                         Well, sir.  We have this show, and 
                         we laid off for the holidays.  You 
                         see, business was bad.

                                     WAVERLY
                         I know about business being bad.
                         Go on.

                                     PHIL
                         Yes sir.  Well, so we figured as 
                         long as we had the opportunity we'd 
                         do a little rehearsing.  Right here.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Why here?
                              (There is a hint here 
                              of the General)
                         Phil looks to Bob for help as they 
                         move toward the lobby.

               The troupe is busy transporting the costumes, etc., from the 
               moving van to the dining room auditorium as the above scene 
               is played.

                                     BOB
                         Well, sir, this nice empty room.  
                         The minute we looked at it we said 
                         it was ideal.  Didn't we?

                                     PHIL
                         That's what we said.  Ideal.

                                     BOB
                         And then we'll have an audience to 
                         play to.  You see, sir, you need an 
                         audience on which to try out your 
                         new material.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Where are you going to get the 
                         audience?

                                     PHIL
                         Oh, what guests there are in the 
                         other hotels. They're pretty bored 
                         here without snow, and a New York 
                         show's kind of a novelty in Vermont.

                                     WAVERLY
                         I would think so.
                              (He thinks)
                         How will they know you're here?

                                     BOB
                         Oh, word gets around.

                                     PHIL
                         Yes sir, and we also took the girls 
                         twice around the town for a little 
                         run.  They were stiff from the train.
                         In their practice clothes.

                                     BOB
                         Makes the blood circulate,

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Hers no dope)
                         Hmm.  Whose blood?

                                     BOB AND PHIL
                         Yes sir.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Apparently there must be a lot about 
                         show business I don't understand.

                                     PHIL
                         It'll come to you, sir.

                                     BOB
                         It just takes time.

                                     PHIL
                         We wouldn't be any good as generals.

                                     WAVERLY
                         You weren't any good as privates!

                                     PHIL
                              (Pointing to Bob)
                         He was an officer, sir.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Only to confuse the enemy.

               He turns away and goes to his quarters.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MED. SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR - (DAY)

               The company is rehearsing as Bob and Phil enter.

                                     BOB
                         That's all for today, kids.

               People break off what they were doing and begin to drift 
               out. Bob and Phil have gone toward Betty and Judy.

                                     BOB
                         Get a little rest before tonight's 
                         performance.

                                     PHIL
                              (To Judy)
                         I'll walk you over.

                         Phil!
                              (He takes a sheet of 
                              music out of his 
                              inside pocket)
                         Look this over, I want to try 
                         something.

                                     PHIL
                              (To Judy)
                         See you later.

               The girls go.  Phil goes toward the piano, Bob goes toward 
               Martha, who is on the phone, accepting reservations.

               FULL SHOT - ROOM

               Bob takes Martha by the arm and seats her in the middle of 
               the room as an audience of one.  Phil looks up from the piano, 
               puzzled. The sunset is visible through the window and there 
               is a mood of quiet.

                                     MARTHA
                         Guinea pig?

                                     BOB
                              (Nodding)
                         That's the idea. Want you to hear a 
                         song I just wrote.

                                     MARTHA
                         If it's a love song, don't get too 
                         close.

                                     BOB
                         It isn't.  Just tell me how you think 
                         the Old Man would feel about this 
                         one.

               He leaves her and goes to the piano and they do WHAT CAN YOU 
               DO WITH A GENERAL, solely for Martha.

               Unseen by the others he is standing by the door listening to

               The boys finish the number. Martha applauds and Bob bows.

                              (Very moved)
                         I think it's just wonderful --

               She is standing there, drying her eyes with her apron.

                         I'm afraid I disagree. The song is 
                         funny, but there is one thing wrong 
                         with it.

                         It's true.  I'd rather you didn't.

               FULL SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR

               Bob and Phil exchange a quick glance.

                                     BOB AND PHIL
                         Yes, sir.

               The General turns and exits toward the lobby, THE CAMERA

               Betty is interlocutor, and Judy is later introduced as Mandy.  
               This takes Judy and Phil into a dance to the song MANDY.

                         We needed something like this.  I 
                         had six checkouts, and when they 
                         heard about this they decided to

               MED. SHOT - INT. GIRLS' BUNGALOW

               Betty and Judy are in twin beds, the light is coming in from 
               the moon.  The girls are seen in profile.

                                     JUDY
                              (Talkative)
                         The moon!   I can't get over the 
                         moon up here.  The size of it!

                                     BETTY
                              (In a quiet mood)
                         Same one they have all over.

                                     JUDY
                         They'll never prove it to me.  And 
                         everything smells so beautiful.
                              (She breathes)
                         What is it - pine or fir?

                                     BETTY
                              (Small sniff)
                         We're near the bakery.

                                     JUDY
                              (Friendly, not 
                              realizing the stab)
                         You know your trouble, Betty?  You're 
                         not romantic.

               Betty turns and looks toward her.  Since Judy does not see 
               her, Betty's expression is a true reflection of how she feels.

                                     JUDY
                         Everything's so wonderful here, so 
                         pretty, so exciting, I can't 
                         understand how you stay frozen up.  
                         Let yourself go, go, like me!

                                     BETTY
                              (Afraid to ask)
                         Which one is it?

                                     JUDY
                         What do you mean?

                                     BETTY
                         Bob or Phil?

                                     JUDY
                         Neither.

                                     BETTY
                         You mean both.

                                     JUDY
                              (Smiling)
                         It's the same.  No one is going to 
                         break up our act.

                                     BETTY
                         Isn't there one you prefer over the 
                         other?

                                     JUDY
                         The way Phil dances, and he's funny.  
                         It's easy to see yourself married to 
                         him.

                                     BETTY
                              (An effort)
                         And Bob?

                                     JUDY
                         He's different, deeper, and he's 
                         funny, too.  It'd be nice to be 
                         married to both of them.

                                     BETTY
                         Good thing they're not a quartette.

                                     JUDY
                              (Oblivious)
                         If I was Catherine the Great, that's 
                         what I'd do.  Phil in the daytime, 
                         Bob at night. Or should it be the 
                         other way around?

               CLOSE SHOT - JUDY AND BETTY

               SHOOTING PAST Betty.  Is it possible our Betty has a suspicion 
               of a tear?

                                     JUDY
                         Phil'd be more fun in a night club, 
                         but eventually a girl wants a pipe 
                         and slipper fellow.  That's Bob, 
                         smoking a pipe and petting a cocker 
                         spaniel.  Still, Phil could learn to 
                         smoke a pipe.  Breaking a fellow in 
                         to suit you is something every girl 
                         should go through.  I hear it's half 
                         the fun.  Which one do you like 
                         better?  Betty?
                              (No answer.)
                         Betty?
                              (Softer)
                         Are you asleep?
                              (No answer. Judy turns 
                              over and closes her 
                              eyes)

               Music has underscored this scene.  Betty is wide awake.

               She is looking toward the window.  As the curtains billow 
               outward we see a diffused figure of Bob, sitting on a fence, 
               putting out his pipe.  This is followed by an equally diffused 
               figure of Betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture, 
               and joining Bob.  Bob takes her in his arms.  At this point 
               we are brought back to reality by the wind slamming a shutter.  
               This causes the diffusion to vanish, and Betty gets out of 
               bed and puts on her robe.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. INN KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT)

               We PAN Betty to the refrigerator door, which she opens.

                                     BOB'S VOICE
                         Tuna fish, on the lower shelf.

               Betty whirls around.

               MED. SHOT - BETTY AND BOB

               We see Bob is having a snack of his own.

                                     BETTY
                         Oh!

                                     BOB
                         What are you doing?  Sleep-walking?

                                     BETTY
                         I couldn't sleep.

                                     BOB
                         Little young for that, aren't you?

               He gets up and goes to the refrigerator.  His preoccupation 
               with the food will permit Betty's expression to be more 
               obvious than her lines, which are spoken to tell the audience 
               of her regard for Bob,  since their significance must escape 
               him.

                                     BOB
                         What shall I make you?

                                     BETTY
                         Anything'll do.

                                     BOB
                         If you tell me what you want to dream 
                         about I'll know what to make you.

                                     BETTY
                              (Amused)
                         How's that?

                                     BOB
                         Different foods make for different 
                         dreams.  I've got a whole theory 
                         about it.  It's called "The Wallace 
                         Way of Wishful Wooing."  You'll find 
                         it in the American Medical Journal 
                         under 'W'.  Ham and Swiss cheese, 
                         for instance, you get a cool, thin, 
                         blonde girl.  Turkey sandwich, you 
                         get a dark sort of stumpy girl, sexy 
                         though.  Now a liverwurst sandwich -
                              (He shakes his head)
                         you get both girls at once.  Bad 
                         night.

                                     BETTY
                         What do you dream on tuna?

                                     BOB
                         Darndest thing, I dream about me.

                                     BETTY
                              (Evenly)
                         Then I'll have a tuna sandwich.

               Bob doesn't get the significance of what she has said.

                                     BOB
                         Now that's very flattering.  Tuna 
                         coming up.
                              (He is occupied at 
                              the frigidaire while 
                              she watches him 
                              yearningly)
                         Let me make you some warm milk.  
                         That'll help the insomnia.

                                     BETTY
                              (Meaningly)
                         No it won't.
                              (Looking straight at 
                              his back)
                         Warm milk won't do it.

                                     BOB
                         Whatever you've got on your mind 
                         isn't worth staying awake for.

                                     BETTY
                         I think it is.

               He smiles at her, oblivious to the meaning behind her lines.

                                     BOB
                         Would you like to know how I handle 
                         a situation like that...?

                                     BETTY
                         Tell me, Doctor...

               Bob begins to sing COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS, as he prepares the 
               warm milk and hands it to her.  She drinks it down.  As he 
               reaches the second chorus, he starts to dim the lamp on the 
               table,  Betty, pretending to be sleepy, leans her head toward 
               Bob.

               He takes a pillow from a nearby chair and puts it between 
               her head and her chair.  She waits, eyes closed, expectantly.  
               But Bob gets to his feet, and carefully tiptoes to the door 
               and exits, closing it softly behind him.  After a moment, 
               Betty snaps on the light, throws the pillow on the floor, 
               and rests her chin in her hand, disappointed and wide awake.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN:

               LONG SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR - (DAY)

               Various members of the company are in rehearsal clothes and 
               sitting around the room.  The orchestra is playing the 
               introduction to Phil's number, which will employ a line of 
               six girls who are just coming on the floor.

               Bob is on stage supervising the rehearsal.  Judy is standing 
               across from the piano.  Betty is seated on the sidelines 
               with her legs stretched over two chairs.

               She is knitting a loud colored argyle sock.  Phil, standing 
               close by, has just finished rolling up a ball of yarn.  He 
               looks at Betty's knitting, then at his feet.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't make them too tight.  I wear 
                         size 12.

                                     BOB
                         All right kids!  Places!  Let's get 
                         going! Phil, you're on!

               Phil reacts.

               Bob crosses to his stage manager station, which is a desk 
               and high chair, where Albert is seated, not far from his 
               wife, Sylvia, who is sipping a glass of water.  Albert holds 
               a stop watch and evidently helps in the administration.

                                     BOB
                              (To Albert)
                         How long are we so far?

                                     ALBERT
                         An hour and ten minutes.

                                     BOB
                         Something has to come out.

               From his position, Phil, in a series of leaps and turns, 
               reaches center floor and begins his solo.

               CLOSE SHOT - BETTY

               She continues knitting while watching Phil dancing.

               As Phil comes to a portion where he speeds up his steps she 
               unconsciously speeds up her knitting, Bob has seen her, and 
               he looks from her knitting and her look of admiration, which 
               he mistakes for affection, and then looks from the socks to 
               Phil's feet.  At the end of the number, which is applauded 
               by the witnesses, Judy runs to Phil and hugs and kisses him, 
               THE CAMERA STAYING at this distance.

               Bob, looking at Betty, mistakenly sees her disappointment.

                                     BOB
                         All right, places for the next number!
                              (He turns to Sylvia)
                         You're next, Sylvia.
                              (Sylvia and Albert 
                              exchange peculiar 
                              glances,  Bob senses 
                              it)
                         What's the trouble?

                                     ALBERT
                         Mr. Wallace -
                              (He is embarrassed to 
                              go on)

                                     BOB
                         Come on, out with it.

                                     ALBERT
                         I don't think Sylvia ought to go on, 
                         unless you cut out the high kicks 
                         and let her do some easy waltzes.  
                         Very easy waltzes.

               Bob looks from one to the other and their smiling shyness 
               indicates pregnancy.

                                     BOB
                         You're kidding!

                         We don't want anyone else to know.

                                     ALBERT
                         Please don't mention it.

                              Albert are startled)
                         For heaven's sake!

                         How did they know?

               The girls start crowding around.

                         You wouldn't tell us, would you?  We 
                         had to find out ourselves, etc.
                              (Phil and Judy are

               MED. SHOT - BOB, PHIL AND ALBERT

               Phil puts his arm around Albert.

                                     PHIL
                         Obviously you're going to call the 
                         boy after me!

                                     BOB
                         After you?  I hired Sylvia!  The 
                         baby'll be named after me!

                                     PHIL
                         I've been dancing with her!  That's 
                         more important!  The baby'll be named 
                         after me!

                                     BOB
                         The hiring was more important!  After 
                         me!

                                     PHIL
                         The dancing was more important!  
                         After me!

                                     ALBERT
                         I'm her husband.
                              (Small pause)
                         The baby'll be named after me.

                                     BOB
                         Well, we're going to need another 
                         dancer!

                                     PHIL
                         How about Judy, she knows all the 
                         routines, she could pick it up in no 
                         time.

               They walk to the table where the coffee is, and the group 
               now includes Betty.

                                     BOB
                         On the other hand, it's all right if 
                         we lose a number, we're running too 
                         long now.  We have to cut somewhere.

                                     BETTY
                         Wouldn't it be better if you cut my 
                         solo number?  I've never felt right 
                         in it anyway.
                              (Indicating Phil)
                         The show needs every bit of his 
                         dancing.

                                     BOB
                              (Interpreting this as 
                              mere selflessness 
                              for love)
                         Well -

                                     BETTY
                         There you are - painless.

               She turns away rather abruptly, since she is becoming 
               emotional.  Bob shakes his head, impressed with what he thinks 
               is her devotion.

               MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               Bob dunks a doughnut into his coffee as he looks after Betty.  
               He looks at Phil and shakes his head.

                                     BOB
                         Greater love hath no woman than to 
                         give up a solo number.  Old Chinese 
                         saying.

                                     PHIL
                              (All this is beyond 
                              him)
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BOB
                         Drink your coffee.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               FULL SHOT - WAVERLY QUARTERS - (NIGHT)

               This is the party later that evening.  Some people are 
               dancing.  Others are grouped about, and there is a general 
               home party atmosphere.  The General, Martha and Susan are 
               seen helping everyone to feel at home.

               The CAMERA STARTS ON A LONG SHOT and DOLLIES THROUGH THE 
               GROUP, passing Sylvia, where ad lib comments about the 
               impending baby are sketchily HEARD.  The CAMERA CONTINUES 
               toward the piano, where Bob and Betty are examining the music 
               sheet of A MAN CHASES A GIRL.

               Betty looks up and the CAMERA FOLLOWS her look to Phil, who 
               is dancing with Rita.  Rita nestles up close to Phil.  This 
               is seen by Bob and Betty.  Bob smiles.

               CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND RITA

               On closer view, we can see that Rita is the aggressor.

                                     PHIL
                              (Referring to the 
                              grip)
                         Don't you want me to breathe?

                                     RITA
                         Not especially.

                                     PHIL
                         What's gotten into you?

                                     RITA
                         You were chasing me in Florida.

                                     PHIL
                         And you were running.  What made you 
                         stop?

                                     RITA
                         You're interested in Judy, aren't 
                         you?

                                     PHIL
                         That's it, eh?  Unless it belongs to 
                         someone else, a girl doesn't - Ouch!
                              (Evidently Rita has 
                              deliberately stepped 
                              on his instep)

               SCENE FROM BOB'S VIEWPOINT

               Betty is walking over to the dancing couple and deliberately 
               cuts in on Rita, who is displeased, but can do nothing but 
               yield.  Bob's reaction still implies that this is 
               understandable since Betty loves Phil.  He turns back toward 
               the piano, and other couples are between him and Betty and 
               Phil.

               Still at the same camera distance, we see Betty turning Phil 
               over to Judy.

               CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND JUDY

               Judy is a little cool.

                                     PHIL
                         What's the matter?

                                     JUDY
                         Nothing is the matter.

                                     PHIL
                         This isn't the way you dance.

                                     JUDY
                         Some people dance closer than others.

               Phil is delighted that she is jealous.

                                     PHIL
                         Yes, that's true.  I'm one of the 
                         close ones.  That's my type.

               He holds her closely, by force, dancing, smiling and pleased 
               with himself.

               MED. FULL SHOT - ROOM

               The dance music stops.  The people disperse.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT PIANO

               Harry, the piano player, is playing the last half of A MAN 
               CHASES A GIRL.  Bob and Betty are leaning over the piano, 
               Bob humming the melody.  Betty pantomimes to the others to 
               quiet down.  Bob starts to sing the lyric.  In the second 
               chorus, he is joined in the singing by Betty.  During this 
               chorus we CUT TO show various reactions of the group, and 
               end on Phil, sitting close to Judy, holding her hand.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT - PHIL AND JUDY

               We HEAR Bob and Betty, off scene, continuing to the end of 
               the second chorus, on which Phil, sotto voce, sings the last 
               four bars.

                                     PHIL
                              (Singing; looking at 
                              Judy)
                         And once you've caught him, don't 
                         ever let him go.

               APPLAUSE follows the song.  Phil gets up.

                                     PHIL
                         Ladies and gentlemen, I would like 
                         to make an announcement.

               FULL SHOT - CROWD

               Everyone quiets, waiting to hear the announcement.

                                     PHIL
                         It is my pleasure to identify the 
                         man who has been doing the chasing.  
                         I am him! - Or he! - Or it!  Anyway, 
                         Judy has caught me.  What I'm trying 
                         to say is, we're engaged.

               He looks fondly at Judy, taking it for granted she is 
               overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is 
               going to marry her.  He hugs her amidst a general reaction 
               of congratulations.

               MED. SHOT - BOB

               He is flabbergasted.

               MED. SHOT - GROUP

               Phil and Judy are separated by the congratulators.

               Betty, hiding her emotion, grips Phil's arm.

                                     BETTY
                         I hope you realize that you're getting 
                         he most wonderful girl in the world.

               Bob sees her emotion through the speech.  Betty notices Judy 
               upset, shaking off the people around her and running through 
               the doorway to the kitchen.

               Betty makes her way through the crowd to follow her, as the 
               orchestra goes into HER COMES THE BRIDE.

               MED. SHOT - INT. KITCHEN

               Judy is crying into her hands as Betty enters.

                                     BETTY
                         Darling, don't cry.

                                     JUDY
                              (Turning to her)
                         I didn't know he was going to make 
                         that announcement, I swear I didn't.

               Betty puts one arm around her.

                                     BETTY
                         I know you didn't.

                                     JUDY
                         He had no right to do that.

                                     BETTY
                         You do love him, don't you?

                                     JUDY
                         That doesn't matter.

                                     BETTY
                         Nothing else matters.

                                     JUDY
                         We're not going to break up our act.

               Phil enters the kitchen.

                                     PHIL
                         I've been looking for you, Judy.

                                     BETTY
                         Excuse me.

               She goes through the corridor toward the living room.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - CORRIDOR OFF BUTLER'S PANTRY

               In the background we see the General in the butler's pantry 
               getting some drinks for the guests.  He is not seen by Betty 
               who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few 
               tears.  Bob comes into view in the mirror, entering the 
               corridor from the living room.

                                     BOB
                         Don't take this too much to heart.  
                         Phil is a great kid but constancy 
                         isn't his long suit.

                                     BETTY
                         I'm not the least bit worried.
                              (Phil and Judy enter 
                              from the kitchen)
                         Frankly, this couldn't come at a 
                         better time.  They want me to come 
                         back to The Carousel again - I used 
                         to sing there before Judy and I teamed 
                         up - and I had to turn it down because 
                         they can only use a single.
                              (Not too well)
                         So - this couldn't be more convenient.  
                         You stay with the show and I'll go 
                         back to The Carousel.

                                     JUDY
                         When did you get this offer?

                                     BETTY
                         Just today, as a matter of fact.  I 
                         got a telegram.

                                     JUDY
                         Why didn't you mention it before?

                                     BETTY
                         I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

                                     JUDY
                         Where is the telegram?

                                     BETTY
                         I threw it away.  What is this, a 
                         third degree?  You don't think I 
                         made it up?

                                     JUDY
                         Yes, I do.

               There is a pause, and Waverly, who has been watching each 
               one, speaks.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Well now, I wouldn't bet any large 
                         sum of money on that, since I took 
                         the message over the telephone, and 
                         I had to deliver the telegram.
                              (To take the tension 
                              off)
                         And she didn't tip me, either.

               Betty looks at him gratefully.

                                     JUDY
                         Oh, Betty!
                              (She throws her arms 
                              around her)
                         I'm sorry!  I misunderstood!

                                     BETTY
                         Now, baby!  It's all right!

                                     PHIL
                         Well, everything's fine now!

               Happy, he beams at Judy.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND WAVERLY

               Something bothers Bob about this story.  He looks searchingly 
               at Betty, puzzled.  He does not notice Waverly, who watches 
               him watching Betty.

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               LONG SHOT - RAILROAD STATION - DAY

               Train about to leave.  The General is in the foreground 
               sitting in the buggy.  Betty is saying goodbye to him.

               Bob and the porter are taking care of her luggage.

                                     GENERAL
                              (Shouting over noise 
                              of train)
                         Where are you going to be?

                                     BETTY
                         The Carousel.

               The General looks at her, questioningly.

                                     BETTY
                              (Whispering, during a 
                              lull in the noise)
                         I sent them a telegram this morning.

               The General smiles; Betty waves a farewell to him and crosses 
               to the train, starting up the steps.  The notion behind this 
               scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due 
               to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam.  The manner of 
               playing, though, indicates the sentiment.  To emphasize it: 
               Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully 
               realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return, 
               consciously, her affection.  We hear Betty:

                                     BETTY
                         Take care of my little sister.

                                     BOB
                         She can take care of herself.  Worry 
                         about the menfolk.  Now don't forget 
                         to write.

                                     BETTY
                         I'll send you picture postcards.

               Not all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick their 
               spots, but the attention is on the General, who is watching 
               the scene with a whimsical look.  He, as does the audience, 
               realizes Bob's true feelings.  As the train starts to leave, 
               Betty and Bob shake hands.  She holds his handshake a little 
               longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along with 
               the train.  Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after 
               the train, puzzled.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               THE CAMERA is now on the train platform, Bob out of sight.  
               Betty wipes away a tear.  In the background we see the General 
               in the buggy noticing this.

               MED. LONG SHOT - TRAIN IN DISTANCE

               Bob is in the foreground, the General in the background.  
               Bob joins the General at the buggy.  From Waverly's expression 
               we can see that he has decided on a plan of action.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Must be interesting to be a woman.

                                     BOB
                         The idea's never occurred to me, 
                         sir.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Well, think about it.
                              (Bob is thinking about 
                              it)
                         Well?

                                     BOB
                         Not interested!

                                     WAVERLY
                         A man like you must be an expert on 
                         women.

                                     BOB
                         It's a little immodest to say so, 
                         but I consider myself an authority 
                         on the fair sex,  I've made a study 
                         of the subject.  They're simple 
                         creatures.

                                     WAVERLY
                         They couldn't fool you?

                                     BOB
                         I'm single.

                                     WAVERLY
                         'Pride goeth before a fall.'

                         'Who knows his own strength is twice 
                         armed.'

                                     WAVERLY
                         It's always a pleasure to meet an 
                         expert in any field.  Tell me, why 
                         do you think Betty went to New York?

                                     BOB
                              (Not willing to admit 
                              it)
                         She has a job in The Carousel.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Expert, you're wrong!  She went to 
                         New York because she's so in love 
                         with someone here she just couldn't 
                         stand it.

                                     BOB
                         Phil.
                              (A mixture of 
                              resentment and 
                              frustration)
                         I'm darned if I can figure out why.

                                     WAVERLY
                         I thought you were an expert on women.
                              (To the horse)
                         Come on, Delilah!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTMAS TREE ANGEL - DAY

               THE CAMERA PANS DOWN from the ceiling and we see that THE 
               INN is being decorated for Christmas Eve.

               Everybody is so engaged, except those actively helping Phil 
               and Judy rehearse.  The attitude is slightly cool on Judy's 
               part, but it is lover's coolness.

                                     PHIL
                              (Fitting the action)
                         Good, Judy.
                              (During the dancing)
                         Now the same as the middle part.

               They make a nice couple, with his arm around her waist, 
               dancing as one.

               REVERSE ANGLE - BOB

               He enters the room, and watches.  He looks intently at Phil.  
               Phil and Judy dance closer to Bob. They see him. They continue 
               dancing, talking as they do.

                                     PHIL
                         Betty get off all right?

                                     BOB
                              (Slightly belligerent)
                         Certainly.

                                     JUDY
                         Betty left something for you.  She 
                         said to give it to you after she 
                         left.  It's on the piano.

               Bob hears, nods, but keeps staring at Phil.  Phil becomes 
               conscious of the staring.

                                     PHIL
                         What's the matter?

                                     BOB
                         I don't get it.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't get what?

                                     BOB
                         I just don't see it.  You' re skinny, 
                         you got a big nose, and you squint.

                                     PHIL
                         Who?  Me?

                                     BOB
                         Yes, you!  Nothing personal though.

                                     PHIL
                         No, of course not.

                                     BOB
                         I'm just trying to figure out what 
                         anyone sees in you.

                                     PHIL
                         Well, stop worrying about it.  When 
                         I ask you for a date just turn me 
                         down.  Come on, Judy.

               They dance away.  Bob crosses to the piano and picks up the 
               package Betty left for him.  He opens it up and it is a single 
               knitted sock, the one she knitted on previously.  He looks 
               through the box for its mate.

               There is none.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Bob, puzzled.

               At the moment a hand is completing, in chalk:

               He cycles down the street, whistling A MAN CHASES A GIRL.

               There is a group of elderly men, among them the hotel owners, 
               pitching horseshoes. Waverly is sitting on a bench, ruefully 
               looking at the sign.

                         I'm too young for that sort of thing.

               First Owner laughs goodnaturedly and continues playing.

               Bob rides into the scene and dismounts.

               MED. SHOT - BOB AND WAVERLY

               Bob sits into the shot.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Kind of warm for that kind of 
                         exercise, isn't it?

                                     BOB
                              (Trying to help)
                         It isn't very warm.
                              (He looks to the sky)
                         I think the weatherman's wrong about 
                         his forecast.  Those look like snow 
                         clouds to me.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Without looking up)
                         They're cumulus clouds, at an 
                         elevation of seven thousand feet.

                                     BOB
                         Yes, sir.
                              (Still trying)
                         Still, weather's a funny thing.
                         It could snow - overnight.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (He thinks a moment)
                         I'll tell you something I haven't 
                         told my family.  I'm going back in 
                         the Army.

                                     BOB
                         Really, sir? That's great news!

                                     WAVERLY
                         Yes.  I miss the Army.

                                     BOB
                         Where are you going to be sent, sir?

                                     WAVERLY
                         Well, I'm not sure yet.  I've always 
                         been a combat officer, but I got an 
                         idea they're going to try and palm 
                         off one of the training commands on 
                         me.  They'd better not.  They just 
                         better not.
                              (He's worked up now)
                         I'm not ready for pitching horseshoes 
                         yet.
                              (He smiles)
                         Now nothing to the women folk about 
                         this!

                                     BOB
                         No, sir.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Let's mosey over to the post office, 
                         I'm expecting a letter any day.

                                     BOB
                              (Remembering)
                         Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
                              (He pulls the letter 
                              out of his pocket)
                         That's what I came over to give you, 
                         it slipped my mind.

               The General takes the letter, he looks at it front and back.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Solemn)
                         This is the one.
                              (He opens it,  He 
                              squints.  He looks 
                              to Bob)
                         My glasses are in my room.  I'd like 
                         to read it by myself, but I'm a little 
                         anxious.
                              (He smiles at his own 
                              predicament)
                         Read it, son.  Slowly.

                                     BOB
                              (Reading)
                         Dear Tom: Why, you dirty, old -
                              (He stops)

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Pleased)
                         Skip that word.

                                     BOB
                         Yes, sir.
                              (Continuing)
                         It certainly was a surprise hearing 
                         from you.  Your amusing letter was 
                         appreciated more than you imagine.  
                         Of course you've got plenty of time 
                         to be amusing, sitting on that porch, 
                         rocking away, while we put in a full 
                         day's work.  You always were a lucky 
                         stiff, and I envy you.  A few years 
                         more, I was saying to Emmy the other 
                         evening, and I'm going to be able to 
                         take it easy like old Tom.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Just repeats)
                         Old Tom.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, well, some people have all the 
                         luck.  Everyone in the family is 
                         fine here.  Carol had the mumps, 
                         which is no joke at eleven years of 
                         age -

                                     WAVERLY
                         The rest of the letter is about the 
                         family.
                              (Bob looks at him, 
                              and then glances at 
                              the rest to see if 
                              it is so)
                         He's telling me they have nothing 
                         for me, we're not fooling each other.
                              (He holds has hand 
                              out)
                         Thank you.
                              (Bob gives him his 
                              letter.  There is a 
                              pause.  An attempt 
                              at being light)
                         Say, it couldn't be hard to learn to 
                         pitch horseshoes.  Now could it?

                              (Trapped, unhappy for 
                              him)
                         No sir.
                              (His nerve up)
                         Begging your pardon, sir, there's a 
                         lot to be said for leisure.  You're 
                         not used to it, you've always been 
                         active, but in time -

               He stops, seeing Waverly's expression.  Waverly winks at 
               him.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Quietly)
                         Never kid a kidder.  Go on back to 
                         the hotel.

                                     BOB
                         Yes sir.

               Waverly gets up to join the horseshoe players after all.  
               Bob watches this reflectively as we

               MED. SHOT - (DAY) - INT. HOTEL ROOM - BOB AND PHIL

               Bob is packing his valise, Phil helping him.

                                     PHIL
                         Judy thinks my eyes are soulful.  Do 
                         you think my eyes are soulful?

                                     BOB
                         One of them is.

                                     PHIL
                         You have no poetry in you.  It's 
                         about time you went in for girls, 
                         too.  After all, you haven't many 
                         years left for that sort of thing.

               Bob, his back turned to Phil, comes across the sock Betty 
               knitted for him; he hastily shoves it into the bottom of has 
               bag.

                                     BOB
                              (Over above)
                         I'm the quiet type.  Little do you 
                         know what's aged me.

                                     PHIL
                         Wheels within wheels, eh?  Well, 
                         live it up, Pops.  Eat, drink and be 
                         merry -- is that why you're leaving 
                         for New York?

                                     BOB
                         I told you what I'm seein' Ed Harrison 
                         about.  That's all.

                                     PHIL
                         Business, business.  Glad to be rid 
                         of you.  You're not in the girly 
                         mood.

                              the moment)
                         What do you know about girls?  You 
                         wouldn't know what to do with a girl 
                         if she fell on you!

                                     PHIL
                         Well, I'd know enough not to get up.

               There is a KNOCK at the door and Martha sticks her head in.

                                     MARTHA
                         Mr. Wallace -- gonna miss your train!

                                     PHIL
                              (To Bob)
                         For her I'd get up.

               As Bob slams his suitcase shut,

               A poster outside advertises the appearance of Betty Stewart.  
               MUSIC is heard emanating from the club.

               A rehearsal is in progress in the deserted club.  The chairs 
               are up on the tables, musicians in their shirt sleeves, as 
               Betty SINGS a chorus of LOVE, YOU DIDN'T DO RIGHT BY ME.  As 
               she finishes, the orchestra LEADER turns to her.

               It is alive with customers; couples are dancing on the floor,

               Betty is standing at the microphone ready to sing.

               She sees Bob.  The Leader raises his baton.

                         Relax.  Just do it the way you sang 
                         it this afternoon -- you'll be great.

               He gives the downbeat, and Betty has no choice but to sing 
               LOVE, YOU DIDN'T DO RIGHT BY ME.  She is assisted in the 
               second chorus by a vocal group.

               steps down from the platform and joins Bob.

                                     BETTY
                              (As Bob holds the 
                              chair)
                         Well, surprise.  What brought you to 
                         the big city?  And don't say 'a 
                         train.'

                              her tension)

                                     BOB
                         I never heard you sing that well.  
                         That's a good number for you.

                                     BETTY
                              (Her own significance)
                         Some numbers suit you better than 
                         others.  What are you doing here?

                         That's nice.

                                     BOB
                         I think they like each other.

                                     BETTY
                         I do, too.

                         They're kind of suited, in a lot of 
                         ways.

                                     BETTY
                         Some people are.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks for the knitted sock.

                                     BETTY
                         Don't mention it.

                                     BOB
                         I thought it was for Phil.

                                     BETTY
                              (Evenly)
                         If the sock fits, wear it.

                              (Unsure of her meaning)
                         It started out for Phil.

                                     BETTY
                         It just started out as a sock.

               Every line of the sock exchange should have the meaning of 
               the love implications.

                                     BOB
                         You're a very odd girl.

                                     BETTY
                         You're a very odd fellow.

               Bob is close to declaring himself, if he was only sure of 
               his ground.

                         Two feet, one sock.  I must be.

                         I'll get around to the other one, 
                         eventually.

                                     BOB
                         You mean to do any knitting in the 
                         near future?

                                     BETTY
                         The feeling comes and goes.

                                     BOB
                         Think if the model hung around for a 
                         while... the feeling might be more 
                         permanent?

                         Maybe.

               Bob leans over and takes her hand.

                         What's this maybe, shmaybe, comes 
                         and goes?  Friends tell me I don't 
                         have many years left for this sort 
                         of thing...  I ought to know right

                         Now what's this big deal you wanted 
                         to discuss?  I shouldn't even talk 
                         to you after canceling out on my 
                         show.

                         Ed, I saw the old man.

                         Nobody even knows who he is.

                         He's too proud to let them know he's 
                         General Waverly.

               Ed looks at her, surprised.

                         A glimmer.

                         way to keep our morale up... without 
                         telling us?  It's about time we 
                         returned the favor.  Let's surprise 
                         him with a real big bang-up reunion.

                         the word?

               Bob takes a piece of paper out of his inside pocket and hands 
               it to Ed.

                         Phil, what's happened to you?

               Phil assumes a pain-stricken face again and Judy throws her 
               arms around him.  Phil smiles over her shoulder at Waverly.

               Bob and Betty tiptoe through the entrance to the inn.  In 
               the semidarkness of the lobby we hear a "sst - ", and Susan 
               and Martha are revealed having been waiting for them.

                                     MARTHA
                         We've been waiting for you.

                         Just fine.

                         They are bedded down in all the

                         mean old biddy, I'd probably break 
                         right down and cry.
                              (She cries)

                         There's nothing to cry about, is 
                         there?

               He looks to Susan and she begins to bawl.

                                     SUSAN
                              (Through the crying)
                         Thank you so much.

               Bob looks to Betty for support.

                                     BOB
                         Can't you do something?

                         They're just affected by the gesture.

               She can't hold it back either, and now the three women are 
               crying.

                                     BOB
                         That's fine.

                         Probably in their rooms, crying.

               They start out.

               Judy, locked in an embrace.  Bob has been in front, but he 
               steps back quickly, not wanting to embarrass the lovers.

                         going to have to do a lot of

                              (Flustered again)
                         I mean the other kind of rehearsing - 
                         I mean - rehearsing  Well, good night, 
                         Judy.

               And he holds his hand out, and they shake hands, still 
               flustered.

                                     JUDY

                         Good night.

               Flustered, the boys open the door to the girls' bungalow, 
               thinking it is their own.

                         Let's get out of here before the

               They all laugh.  The girls enter their bungalow and put on 
               the light.  The boys head toward their bungalow.  Phil enters

                         see what's bothering him.

               Betty throws her a look, and exits.

               Betty comes up on the porch.

               She starts to sing, COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS.  At the conclusion, 
               she walks away, leaving him standing there.

                         I can't breathe in this.  What am I 
                         going to do?

                                     PHIL
                         I know what I'm going to do.
                              (Showing him)
                         I'm going to take one big deep breath, 
                         and that's going to be it for the 
                         next three hours.

               Bob takes a deep breath and gets the top button buttoned.

               MED. SHOT - LOBBY STAIRWAY - (NIGHT)

               General Waverly comes down the stairs, cutting quite a figure 
               in his uniform and decorations.  Martha and Susan, waiting 
               for him at the bottom, look him over, admiringly.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Gruffly)
                         Well, I couldn't come down in my 
                         bathrobe.

               FULL SHOT - INN FLOOR

               The spotlight prepared, pinpoints the General as he enters 
               the room, and the music starts.  The audience rises and 
               applauds.  He can't believe it.  He reaches his table, 
               decorated with flowers, and recognizes he is the guest of 
               honor.  From the lobby we hear the outfit SINGING the opening 
               strains of THE OLD MAN.

               All eyes turn to the lobby entrance, through which the old 
               outfit marches, and continues to the stage, and then back to 
               their respective tables as the song finishes.

               MED. SHOT - WAVERLY

               He is profoundly moved and walks to the stage.  The audience 
               is seated.  Waverly looks at the assembled crowd with great 
               affection.  The people begin to shout, "Speech!  Speech!"  
               Martha and Susan sit.

               The crowd quiets, waiting for the speech.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (He must have had a 
                              blood transfusion 
                              from a sergeant at 
                              some time)
                         I am not satisfied with the conduct 
                         of this division!  Some of you men 
                         are under the impression that having 
                         been at Anzio entitles you not to
                         wear neckties!  You are wrong!  
                         Neckties will be worn in this area!  
                         I have also noticed a deterioration 
                         in the quality of saluting!  This is 
                         to be improved!  I have also had 
                         complaints from the commanding officer 
                         of the rest area in Naples!  He 
                         informs me that the non-fraternization 
                         rule is constantly being broken by 
                         men of this division!  In fact, this 
                         division is outstanding in its 
                         violations of non-fraternization!  
                         You all know the rules!  The non-
                         fraternization ban expressly declares 
                         you are not to talk to women!
                              (A slightly different 
                              tone)
                         Don't talk to them!  That is all!

               They howl and cheer.  He makes has way toward his own table, 
               greeting old friends on the way.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               As they step to the front of the stage.

                              (To the audience)
                         Doesn't that bring back memories?  
                         Remember those terrible, trying days 
                         in Italy... when we had to beat the 
                         women off with chocolate bars?

                                     PHIL
                         And wasn't it awful the way they 
                         kept bothering us for American 
                         cigarettes?  Why, I must have taught 
                         fifty girls how to smoke...

                         For a month's pay all we got was 950 
                         million lira...

                         I was forced to hire a caddy for my 
                         loose change.

                                     PHIL

                         I'm glad I'm well out of it.

               Phil looks at him.

                                     PHIL
                         Who are we kidding?

               This is the cue for the orchestra to start the production 
               number, I WISH I WAS BACK IN THE ARMY.  At end of number -

               AUDIENCE - FULL SHOT

               As they applaud and cheer.  The old outfit is happy.

               In the exultation, General Waverly places two fingers to his 
               lips and blows a whistle of sheer pleasure and approval.  We 
               underscore with MUSIC indicating another number is taking 
               place on stage, although we do not see it.

               SECTION OF AUDIENCE - MED. CLOSE

               Ed Harrison crosses to General Waverly and whispers to him.

                                     ED HARRISON
                         Long distance call for you, sir.

               Waverly looks surprised, but rises and starts out.

               Bob, visible in b.g., has been watching.  He and Harrison 
               exchange knowing glances.

               AT HOTEL DESK - MED. SHOT

               The lobby is empty;  in b.g. are the doors to the dining 
               room, where the show is in progress.  The telephone lies on 
               the counter.  Waverly enters and crosses to it.  He is a 
               little annoyed at being forced to leave the entertainment.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Into phone, gruffly)
                         Hurry up, hurry up, I'm busy.
                         Yes, this is General Waverly.

               He suddenly snaps to attention, the old soldier.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Quietly)
                         And a Merry Christmas to you, Mr. 
                         President... Yes, practically the 
                         whole outfit is here.  A little 
                         paunchy, but they're here.  It 
                         certainly was a surprise -- more 
                         like a frameup.  As usual, my 
                         Intelligence was not functioning 
                         efficiently... Yes?
                              (Long pause)
                         That's very nice of you, Mr. 
                         President... any time you want me, 
                         just say the word... but may I add 
                         this?  It isn't always necessary to 
                         take a job... sometimes it's enough 
                         just to know it's there.

               Through the window behind the General we have seen it begin 
               to SNOW.  The General notices it for the first time, and his 
               face brightens.

                                     WAVERLY
                         If you ever take it into your mind 
                         to grab a little rest from all that 
                         work I wish you'd drop in on us here -- 
                         I can't promise you any golf but --
                              (As he looks at the 
                              falling snow)
                         -- we can certainly give you plenty 
                         of snow, Mr, President... Yes, Mr.  
                         President... What?
                              (Smiles)
                         Thanks, Ike.

               He hangs up the phone, and proudly, head erect, he walks 
               through the lobby, smiling, eyes wet.  He lifts the bell on 
               the desk with a loud bang.  Martha hurries in, startled.

                                     MARTHA
                         You frightened me to death!  That 
                         bell hasn't been used for three 
                         months!

                                     GENERAL
                         Get this area policed up.  No telling 
                         who might be dropping in.

               Martha salutes.

                                     MARTHA
                         Yes, sir!

               She and the General gaze at the snow falling beyond the lobby 
               door which is blown open by the wind.

               Underneath all this we have been hearing the introductory 
               music to WHITE CHRISTMAS, which is the number now in progress 
               on the stage.  Waverly now turns and walks into the dining 
               room.

               INT. DINING ROOM - MOVING CAMERA

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Waverly on his entrance.  As he passes Susan, 
               we see she is reacting to something on the stage.

               CAMERA PASSES Waverly and moves to:

               STAGE - FULL SHOT - MOVING CAMERA

               Center stage, there is a large cutout of a decorated Christmas 
               tree.  Also, there is considerable Christmas holly, mistletoe, 
               etc.  Bob and Betty are seen singing.  Throughout action of 
               this number Phil and Judy dance.  In addition there is staged 
               movement by the ensemble.  Bob and Betty are on each side of 
               the cutout Christmas tree, but it is obvious that Betty is 
               preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating 
               with one hand behind the cutout tree.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Bob and Betty as their movement takes them 
               behind the tree.  It is now that we see very clearly that 
               the rear wall of the stage (two immense barn doors) has 
               opened; in b.g. we see the Vermont countryside being covered 
               by the falling snow.  Also, we see pine trees in the snow 
               that are decorated.

               Betty steers Bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of 
               mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock 
               she gave him in scene 110.  Bob looks up, sees the mistletoe 
               and the sock, and smiles at Betty.

               She lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is 
               wearing the other sock.  They laugh and embrace.

               REVERSE SHOT - FROM DINING ROOM

               The cutout tree onstage rises to the flies and now the real 
               trees and falling snow in b.g. are completely visible.  One 
               by one, the trees are lighted.

               AUDIENCE - MED. CLOSE

               Martha and Susan are standing happily beside the General, 
               each holding one of his arms.

               FULL SHOT - REAR AREA - (DAY) - (GLASS)

               This is December 24, 1944, in the first safe area directly 
               behind the battle line, in the Italian theatre.

               In the distance occasional artillery light flashes are seen 
               and artillery rumbles are heard.  The battered terrain shows 
               the effects of battle.

               In the foreground is a recreation area, covered with 
               camouflage; entertainment is in progress on a raised stage.  
               Men of the division are seated about on benches, boxes, and 
               the ground.  A camouflaged motor pool of jeeps and tanks is 
               nearby.

               MED. SHOT - NEAR RECREATION AREA

               We can HEAR LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE from the men as a jeep 
               with two stars on the front indicating it is the General's 
               car jounces along a road toward the side of the recreation 
               area.  A YOUNG SERGEANT is at the wheel, an ADJUTANT beside 
               him, and in the rear are GENERAL WAVERLY and GENERAL CARLTON.

               JEEP - MED. CLOSE

               As it jounces along.  General Waverly is weather-beaten and 
               weary; his uniform, while neat, shows the effects of long 
               wear.  General Carlton, on the other hand, is stiff, clean 
               and fresh from the Pentagon.

               He is staring off at the recreation area.

                                     GENERAL CARLTON
                              (To Adjutant)
                         What's this all about, Colonel?

                                     ADJUTANT
                              (Turning)
                         A little entertainment for the men, 
                         sir.  Tonight's Christmas Eve.

                                     GENERAL CARLTON
                         These men are moving up tonight.  
                         They should be lined up for full 
                         inspection!

               The jeep has come to a halt.

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                              (Eyeing him)
                         You're absolutely right.
                              (To Adjutant)
                         There's no Christmas in the Army, 
                         Colonel.

                                     ADJUTANT
                         Yes, sir.

               Waverly and the Adjutant alight from the jeep.

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                              (To Carlton)
                         There's always a slip-up or two during 
                         a change in command.  The men get a 
                         little loose.  But I know I'm leaving 
                         them in good hands.

                                     GENERAL CARLTON
                              (Stiffly)
                         Thank you.
                              (To Driver)
                         Sergeant, take me to headquarters 
                         immediately!  We'll have those men 
                         turned out on the double!

               The Sergeant looks at General Waverly.

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                         Goodbye, Sergeant.  Take the short 
                         cut.

                                     SERGEANT
                         Yes, sir!

               The jeep pulls off and makes a half circle. The Adjutant 
               makes a gesture, as if to stop it. The General stops him.

               TWO SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY AND ADJUTANT

               The Adjutant turns to him.

                                     ADJUTANT
                         That's not the way to headquarters!

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                         Joe, you know that, and I know that, 
                         but the new General doesn't know it.
                         Or he won't for about an hour and a 
                         half.

                                     ADJUTANT
                         That Sergeant'll be a private 
                         tomorrow!

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                         Yes... isn't he lucky?

               He takes the Adjutant by the arm and leads him toward the 
               recreation area.

               RAISED PLATFORM - MED. SHOT

               CAPTAIN BOB WALLACE (BING CROSBY) is wearing a makeshift 
               beard and Santa Claus hat and PRIVATE PHILIP DAVIS (DONALD 
               O'CONNOR) is in combat clothes.  They are doing a number to 
               entertain the soldiers, WHAT DOES A SOLDIER WANT FOR 
               CHRISTMAS?  During introduction, we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               5A.

               TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT

               just starting to take seats, off to one side where they are 
               not noticed by the performers.

               5B.

               GROUP SHOT - ABOUT 6 SOLDIERS

               seated in audience.  They look off, see General, start to 
               rise.

               5C.

               TWO SHOT - GENERAL AND ADJUTANT

               The General notices them - motions for them to sit down again, 
               indicating he doesn't want attention called to himself.

               5D.

               PLATFORM - FULL SHOT

               The number concludes to applause.  Bob holds up his hand for 
               silence.  He removes his beard.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks, fellows.  I guess by now you 
                         know the Old Man's being replaced by 
                         a new Commanding General fresh out 
                         of the Pentagon... this divisions's 
                         been awfully lucky so far, but tonight 
                         they're running a special on St. 
                         Christophers at the PX... The Old 
                         Man's heading back to the rear - 
                         he's never moved in that direction 
                         in his life.  All I can say is, we 
                         owe so much to General Waverly and 
                         the way --

                                     WAVERLY'S VOICE
                              (A bellow)
                         ATTENTION!

               Automatically, Bob stiffens.  Phil does the same.

               AUDIENCE - FULL SHOT

               Every man is at attention and every head has turned to where 
               General Waverly has taken up a position near the front of 
               the platform.

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                         Captain Wallace, button your shirt.
                         You're out of uniform!
                              (Bob, grinning, hastily 
                              buttons his shirt)
                         This division is now under the command 
                         of General Harold G. Carlton, and I 
                         don't want anyone to forget it -- 
                         not that he'll let you.  He's tough -- 
                         just what this sloppy outfit needs.  
                         You'll be standing inspection night 
                         and day -- you may even learn how to 
                         march.  And if you don't give him 
                         everything you got, I may come back 
                         and fight for the enemy.  Merry 
                         Christmas!

               The boys respond with "Merry Christmas".

                                     GENERAL WAVERLY
                              (Embarrassed)
                         Well -- I guess that's about it - uh - 
                         uh --

               Bob, covering his embarrassment:

                                     BOB
                         Perhaps I can help you out, sir.

               He turns to the musicians, gives the downbeat.  They play 
               THE OLD MAN, which is sung by the entire outfit.

               The General stands at attention through the first chorus, 
               visibly moved.  During the second chorus he starts up the 
               aisle, revealing for the first time that his left leg is 
               bandaged to the knee. The Adjutant puts out his arm to help.  
               Waverly refuses. Toward the finish of the song, he turns, 
               faces the men and salutes them.  The men return the salute.  
               (This is not a military mistake, the General salutes the 
               enlisted men as a deliberate gesture.)  There is a Red Cross 
               ambulance standing by.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT - (NIGHT) - TINY CANDLE

               THE CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a hand lighting a candle on 
               a tiny makeshift Christmas tree.  We reveal a number of 
               enlisted men huddled around the tree in a trench, including 
               Bob and Phil.  One of the men looks at his wristwatch.  Now 
               another does.

               CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH

               The hand is approaching midnight.

               CLOSE SHOT - SOLDIER

               He is looking at his wristwatch.

               CLOSE SHOT - WRISTWATCH

               The second hand is pointing to the hour.

               FULL SHOT OF SCENE

               This is the prearranged signal for Bob to begin singing WHITE 
               CHRISTMAS.  Phil accompanies him on a harmonica.  Toward the 
               end of the song, an enemy barrage DROWNS out the music.  A 
               shell BURSTS in the vicinity.

               CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               Phil pulls Bob down in time to save him from the shrapnel 
               burst.  This has also pushed Bob's face into the mud, which 
               he thinks is unnecessary.  Phil, ignoring Bob's hostile look, 
               brightly continues with WHITE CHRISTMAS from where the song 
               left off.  Bob finishes with him, but eyeing him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. SKY - (NIGHT)

               CAMERA SHOOTING UP to the sky as brilliant fireworks explosion 
               lights up the screen.  Over scene SUPERIMPOSE:

               12-A.

               INSERT - NEWSPAPER

               Headline reads: "V-E DAY!"

               As CAMERA MOVES FAST INTO headline, we LOSE the fireworks 
               display and the headline covers the whole screen.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               12-B.

               INSERT - CHURCH TOWERS - (DAY)

               Bells are ringing for celebration of V-E Day.  CAMERA MOVES 
               INTO mouth of one bell, blacking out the screen.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BILL POSTER OF FLORIDA SHOW - (NIGHT)

               featuring names and pictures of Bob and Phil.  CAMERA MOVES 
               to a CLOSE SHOT of the picture, HOLDS for a second, then 
               suddenly the picture comes to life and we are on the stage 
               of the theatre where Bob and Phil are doing the production 
               number "BELLS".

               MED. SHOT - INT. THEATRE - AUDIENCE

               Perhaps twenty people, photographed at a slant.  They're 
               warm.  One woman has a fan, some use programs.  They are 
               enjoying the show, however.  There are some vacant seats 
               apparent.  This theatre is a modern traveling tent show, 
               such as have been playing in Florida in recent years, and 
               beyond the sides we see palm trees, characteristic of Florida.

               FULL SHOT - AUDIENCE

               APPLAUDING the conclusion of the number.

               MED. FULL SHOT - BACKSTAGE

               The curtain is down, the boys come off, the curtain goes up 
               on the next number, which is dancing.  Phil and Bob are met 
               by COOKE, the Company Manager.

               RITA, a luscious Latin type, and some of the remaining chorus 
               girls and other players ad lib, "Couldn't be cuter!"  "Great."  
               "Very funny!"

                                     COOKE

                         New York's on the telephone.

               Bob and Phil, with Cooke, go to the backstage telephone.

                                     PHIL
                              (Into phone)
                         Hello.
                              (He listens.  To Bob 
                              and Cooke)
                         Oscar.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE

               This is the business office of Bob and Phil.  OSCAR is their 
               representative and manager, not their employer.

               He is sixty and looks competent.  He refers to a telegram in 
               his hand.  Pictures of the boys adorn the desk, and Wallace 
               and Davis sheets of previous shows are on the wall.  It must 
               be evident from their billing that the boys are important 
               stars in New York.

                                     OSCAR
                         Listen, I just heard what you're 
                         doing -- giving the cast a week off 
                         with pay for Christmas.  You don't 
                         know how touched I am.  I'm all choked 
                         up.  Between sobs, I managed to book 
                         you on the Ed Harrison show this 
                         week to take up the slack.  It'll be 
                         stealing money.

               17A.

               CLOSE SHOT - GROUP

               Phil is holding the receiver up to Bob.  Oscar's VOICE can 
               be plainly heard.

                              (Into phone)
                         We'll have to go to New York -- four 
                         days and four nights of rehearsals -- 
                         that's stealing money?

                         It is for me  -- I get ten percent.
                              (He listens for a 
                              moment)
                         Next time you guys make a charitable 
                         gesture, find out if you got with 
                         what to make it.  See you Wednesday.

               He hangs up.

               GROUP SHOT - PHIL, BOB AND COOKE

               Bob hangs up the phone.

                         Well... while the cast takes it easy 
                         we'll be slaving over a hot kinnie.

                         What train do you want?  There's a 
                         one-thirty this morning but you have 
                         to sit up all night.

                                     PHIL
                         Let's get out tonight.

                                     BOB
                         Okay.

               The boys walk to their dressing room.  A group of the chorines 
               come flying by, toward the dressing rooms, with squealing.  
               They make quite a picture from the rear, bouncing and all.

                                     PHIL
                         What are we going to do until one-
                         thirty?

                                     BOB
                         We'll eat dinner.

                                     PHIL
                              (Looking at the 
                              retreating bouncing)
                         Eat, eat  All you think of is your 
                         stomach!

               Rita shows up in front of Phil.

                                     RITA
                              (Eagerly)
                         You said you had something to rehearse 
                         with me after the show.  What is it?

               Phil evidently was trying to hide this from Bob and is self-
               conscious at being caught.

                                     PHIL
                         It's a kind of new dance number.

                              arm)
                         He isn't.  Some business has come 
                         up.  See you in a week.
                              (He pulls Phil away)
                         Come on, Romeo, dinner!
                              (Tempting him)

                              is still anxious to

                         I'm looking at them!  We're going in 
                         the wrong direction.

               MED. SHOT - WATERFRONT INN - BOB AND PHIL - (NIGHT)

               The boys are now finishing their dinner.  Bob is facing the 
               orchestra, Phil would have to turn to see it.  The MUSIC 
               plays, the boys eat.  The table is close to the bar.  On two 
               stools sit JUDY and BETTY.  Betty is wearing her glasses and 
               examining some railroad tickets that have just been handed 
               her by the bartender.  Phil is not paying attention to his 
               eating, he is entranced with Judy's pretty legs draped over 
               the bar stool.  Bob cannot see the girls and is not even 
               interested enough to turn around.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY

               On her part, Judy is not absorbed in the tickets, but is 
               unobtrusively sizing up Phil.

                                     BETTY
                              (Checking the tickets)
                         We'll have to rush to get the 1:30 
                         train.

               CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND BOB

               Bob notices Phil's absorption.

                                     BOB
                         Have you ever considered laying off 
                         the female sex for awhile?

                                     PHIL
                         What other kind is there?
                              (He picks up the card 
                              which announces the 
                              performers names and 
                              reads)
                         'The Stewart Sisters.'  Sister act!
                              (He smacks his lips.  
                              He doesn't realize 
                              that these two girls 
                              are the Stewart 
                              Sisters)

                         have an agreement--you chase no new 
                         tidbits during the season.  You were 
                         man enough to give me your hand on 
                         it.

                                     PHIL
                         You were sneaky enough to take it.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY

               Betty looks from the tickets and sees that Judy is covertly 
               eyeing Phil.  She leans forward.

                                     BETTY
                              (Quietly)
                         Ahem.
                              (Judy's eyes are toward 
                              Phil.  A little louder)
                         Ahem!  All right dear, relax.

                                     JUDY
                         He's awful cute.

                                     BETTY
                         So was the one in Kansas City, and 
                         the one in Canton, Ohio, and the one 
                         in Waco, Texas.

                                     JUDY
                              (Mock seriousness)
                         Canton, Ohio wasn't so much.

                                     BETTY
                         One of these days you're going to 
                         meet somebody extra cute and the 
                         next performance I'll be doing a 
                         single.

                              (Sincerely)
                         Nobody'll ever be cute enough to 
                         break up this sister act.

               MED. SHOT - BOOTH - BOB AND PHIL

               Phil is still fingering the card.

                                     PHIL
                         I haven't much luck with sister acts.  
                         They're all alike.  Shall I tell you 
                         what these two are like?

                         Four feet two inches tall.  Pudgy.  
                         Round races.  Have big bows in their 
                         hair.  Always smiling.
                              (He parodies a smile)
                         Lots of teeth.  Sister acts have 
                         more teeth than anybody else.  Two, 
                         three hundred teeth at a time.  The 
                         American Dental Association is 
                         investigating it.

               There is a drum roll from the orchestra.  Betty takes off 
               her glasses and puts them in their case, on the bar.  The 
               bandleader's voice announces:

                                     BANDLEADER
                         Ladies and gentleman, the Stewart 
                         Sisters!

               The audience applauds politely while the girls start toward 
               the platform,  Phil reacts in surprise to the new development.

               23-A.

               PLATFORM - FULL SHOT

               Betty and Judy do their number: "SISTERS".  As they take 
               their bows --

               MED. SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               Phil pretends to recognize Judy.

                                     PHIL
                         Remember that girl I told you about 
                         who got sick in St. Paul?  That's 
                         her!  The girl in the oxygen tent!  
                         I told you about her!  The road 
                         company of "Student Prince."  The 
                         whole company went to church and 
                         prayed for her!  It was the most 
                         touching thing I've ever seen in 
                         show business.

                                     (HE GETS UP.)
                         I'll bring her over.

               He goes, Bob watching, disgusted.  NOVELLO, the owner of the 
               Waterfront Inn, comes up.

               MED. SHOT - BOB AND NOVELLO

               Novello evidently knows Bob.

                         partner's lining up some pastries 
                         now.

                         we liked it very much.

                         Vermont?  What's there?

                                     BETTY
                         Snow.  We spent last Christmas in 
                         South Carolina, the year before in 
                         Hawaii.  They didn't seem like 
                         Christmases.  There ought to be snow.  
                         This one's going to be real white.

                                     BOB
                         Well, it's the way you've been raised.  
                         If you saw a lot of snow when you 
                         were a kid you miss it more around 
                         Christmas. There's a lot of snow 
                         around St. Paul.

                                     JUDY
                         Is that where you come from - St. 
                         Paul?

               It dawns on him, slowly.  He shows no emotion.

                                     BOB
                         No.  You come from St. Paul.

                                     JUDY
                         I come from Canton, Ohio.

                              he knows)
                         I'd like to ask you something.  Were 
                         you ever in an oxygen tent?

                                     JUDY
                         Oxygen tent?  Oh no!

                                     BOB
                         Were you ever in a road company of

                         No.  Why?

               Bob looks at Phil.  The rules are clear between them.

               Bob puts his hand out.  Phil takes it.  They shake.

                                     BOB
                         Very good.

                         What I admire are the details, the 
                         invention, the little lies all around 
                         the big one.  It takes talent.

                                     PHIL

                         I'll keep an eye on her.

                         Fine. We can make out the probation 
                         report together.

               The orchestra blends into a vocal chorus of the song.  (To 
               be decided upon.)  The vocal is shared by Bob, Betty, Judy 
               and Phil, individually.  Toward the end of the vocal Phil 
               dances Judy out to the terrace overlooking the water.  This 
               blends into their dance.  The staging of the number should 
               reunite the four principals by the end of the number.  The 
               audience applauds and they all go back to their booth.

                         rug and burned it.

                         We couldn't have dropped a cigarette 
                         because we don't smoke.

                                     BETTY
                         He wants two hundred dollars, but 
                         it's just plain stealing.

                         We left the money for our bill in an 
                         envelope on the bed.

                         Then we dropped the bags out the 
                         window and checked them at the depot.

               He leaves them, as Bob and Phil look unpleasantly after him.

               coffee, from Novello's desk.  The Landlord glares at him.

                                     LANDLORD
                         That's the second dessert you've 
                         had, Sheriff!

                                     SHERIFF
                         Real good, too.

                                     LANDLORD
                         I haven't got all night to wait here 
                         while you eat free food!  You've got 
                         your warrant, arrest those girls!

                                     SHERIFF
                              (Displeased)
                         Now, we agreed to let them finish 
                         their show first.

                                     LANDLORD
                         I didn't agree!
                              (To Novello)
                         That was his idea!

                                     NOVELLO
                         I've got some rights, too.  You don't 
                         get those girls until after they've 
                         done their number!

                                     LANDLORD
                         Well, how long is it going to take?

               Novello puts his hand up, listening.

                                     NOVELLO
                         Wait a minute! That's their music!

               He gets up, opens the office door, and we HEAR their entrance 
               music, as before, and the Orchestra Leader's voice, "The 
               Stewart Sisters."

               MED. SHOT - CAFE FLOOR

               Bob and Phil stand with their backs to the audience.

               They turn, face front, and we realize they are mouthing to a 
               record.

               CLOSE SHOT - WINGS - RECORD PLAYER

               We identify that the music is coming from this spinning record 
               player we have previously established.

               Bob and Phil do the number.

               They APPLAUD at end of number.

               We faintly HEAR the applause.

                                     LANDLORD
                         They're clapping! It's over!  Arrest 
                         them!

               The Sheriff gets up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The boys bow themselves off, and run toward their dressing

               MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR

               They hurry down the corridor, passing the office door.

                                     BOB
                         Get out of these clothes! Toot sweet!

                                     PHIL
                         Ma, unhook my bra!

               The office door opens behind them, which they do not see. 
               The Sheriff steps out, followed by the Landlord and Novello.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (Calm)
                         Just a second, folks!  I'll handle 
                         this!
                              (He walks to the 
                              dressing room door)

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - DRESSING ROOM DOOR

               There is a plaque attached to the key in the lock.  The 
               Sheriff smilingly turns the key in the lock.  He puts the 
               key in his pocket.

                                     SHERIFF
                              (Winking)
                         You stay here.  Let them try to go 
                         through the window.

               The landlord is delighted.

                                     LANDLORD
                         If they make a break for it, shoot 
                         'em!

                                                                   WIPE TO:

               MED SHOT - EXT. CAFE - (NIGHT) - SHERIFF

               The Sheriff walks around the corner of the cafe, and a police 
               car awaits, with cop at the wheel.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Just a minute, Hank, couple of 
                         customers coming up.

                                     HANK
                         Okay, boss.

               The Sheriff continues to the window of our dressing room.

               MED CLOSE SHOT - DRESSING ROOM WINDOW

               It opens.  The Sheriff watches it.  Out comes Phil's legs, 
               meaning to get out backwards.  The Sheriff applies both hands 
               and pushes back.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Back you go, boys!

               He pushes Phil in.  Nimbly, he raises himself in.

               MED. SHOT - INT. DRESSING ROOM

               The Sheriff is in the room.  He looks coolly at the boys, 
               who are now in their own clothes.  He stares at them.  They 
               stare at him.  Recognition comes all at once.

                                     PHIL
                         Pete!

                         Pete!

               They all throw their arms around each other, pounding 
               violently.  'No!  Wow!  You dirty skunk!  You grave robber!'

                                     PHIL
                              (Unbelieving)
                         Are you the Sheriff here?

                                     SHERIFF
                         After I got out of the army I sat 
                         down and figured it out!  Who never 
                         got in trouble in the army?  The 
                         M.P.'s!  They were the ones who 
                         arrested you!  So I came back here 
                         and ran for Sheriff!

                                     BOB
                         A civilian M.P.!  If the fellows 
                         ever saw you now!  They'd skin you 
                         alive!

                                     PHIL

                              (As he says 'Danny 
                              Beasly' he recalls 
                              Danny is dead)
                         - the tower of the City Hall and 
                         rang the bell by swinging on the 
                         clapper?  He couldn't hear anything 
                         for two days.

                         make it.

                         You can say that again.  Say I'm 
                         supposed to arrest a couple of dames!  
                         A fellow swore out a warrant!

               He starts with his red lights going, his siren screaming, 
               and tires grinding.

               The Sheriff watches them go, pleased.  A pounding on the 
               door recalls the Landlord, and he frowns.  He strides to the 
               door, takes out his key and opens it.

               MED. SHOT - CORRIDOR

               The Landlord and Novello are looking out the window at the 
               departing police car, the noise having distracted them from 
               the door pounding.  The siren is still heard, retreating.  
               The Sheriff snaps his cigarette at their feet.  They turn to 
               him, faces alight.

               He protests, 'What - !' 'But!'  Novello is openmouthed.

                         Maybe it'll snow in New York for 
                         Christmas.  If it doesn't, we'll 
                         mail you a snowball from Vermont.

                         I haven't been on ice skates in years.

                         Ice?  You mean the stuff in a Scotch 
                         and soda?
                              (Suddenly)
                         Bob, how about snow for Christmas?

                         You'll only thaw it out.

                         Come on, Bob, we could have a great 
                         week up in Vermont.

               Bob looks from him to Judy, whose expression is almost 
               pleading.

                                     BOB
                         I see what you mean.  But Wednesday 
                         we've got to be back in New York.

                         All right -- so it's just for a couple 
                         of days.  Don't you want me to enjoy 
                         the winter sports?

                                     BOB
                         You enjoy them all year round.
                              (He looks to Betty)
                         We won't get in your way, will we?

                         to take my sister for a sleigh ride.

                         The thing I like about you, Bob, is 
                         you're not only kind and generous, 
                         you're handsome.

                         We're going to have to sit up all 
                         night.  Let's get some shut eye.

               All but Phil are half dozing.  One or two other people are 
               seen in the background, asleep.  There is an air of peace 
               and quiet in the car, as the music underscoring continues.  
               Their faces are occasionally streaked with light flashes 
               emanating from the surrounding countryside.  Phil turns to 
               the side of the car and sees a bill poster showing a copy of 
               a winter scene from the Grandma Moses collection, advertising 
               Vermont.  CAMERA PULLS UP TO scene, the music swells and we 
               DISSOLVE to a similar landscape in stylized concept.  This 
               is the WINTER FANTASY production number.  At the end of the 
               fantasy we hear the Conductor's voice, "Pine Tree.  Pine 
               Tree, Vermont."

               scorched toboggan slide.

               platform.

               MARTHA, a sixty year old spinsterish woman, good of heart, 
               forbidding exterior, is occupied at the desk.

               The door opens and a pretty fifteen year old, SUSAN, carrying 
               the mail, walks toward her.

                                     SUSAN
                         Mail, Martha.

               She puts the mail on the desk.

                         the Post Office?

                                     SUSAN
                         Awful.  Fair and warmer.

                         If we don't get snow soon we can 
                         turn this hotel into a haunted house.  
                         We haven't had a guest for three 
                         weeks.

                         Your grandfather's written Washington 
                         asking if he can get back in active 
                         service.  I think he wants to fly 
                         jets.

                                     SUSAN
                         I think he could do it.

                                     MARTHA
                         He says older men have been called, 
                         and besides, he misses the food.  I 
                         tell you, Susan, he tried to make it 
                         a casual letter, with little jokes, 
                         but it came out just begging.

               Through the huge window behind Susan and Martha we see the 
               figure of a man in overalls, bending over an incinerator, 
               shoveling the ashes into a wheelbarrow.

               His back is to CAMERA.

                         Oh, Martha!  What are we going to 
                         do?

                         I don't know.  Don't let on we know 
                         he's written.  He'll start in I'm 
                         only his housekeeper and that I found
                         out through some chicanery or 
                         something.

                                     SUSAN
                              (Soothing her)
                         How did you find out?

                                     MARTHA
                         Like any housekeeper --  I read the 
                         carbon paper.

                              to Susan)
                         Bring him the mail.

               Susan starts out as CAMERA MOVES UP to window.  After a 
               moment, Susan appears and crosses to the man in overalls.  
               He straightens up, dusts off his hands, and as he turns to 
               take the letters, we see for the first time that he is General 
               Waverly.  He looks through them, eagerly, then, downcast, 
               shoves them in his overalls and goes back to his work.

                         I'm fine, sir.
                              (But he looks around 
                              questioningly, 
                              bewildered)

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Smiling)
                         We just try to keep the General part 
                         quiet.

                                     BOB
                         Why?
                              (Reminding himself)
                         Begging your pardon, sir.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Well, to put it in one sentence, 
                         people don't expect major generals 
                         to carry firewood.

               Through the door comes Phil, fast, talking:

                                     PHIL
                         Bob, I was thinking we ought to -

               Phil has his arm out indicating the direction of the door, 
               when he sees Waverly.  He freezes.  He brings his hand up to 
               a salute, from that position.

                                     WAVERLY
                         At ease!

                                     PHIL
                         Oh, sir!
                              (Horrified)
                         A janitor!

                                     WAVERLY
                         Never thought I'd make it, he?  
                         ...Matter of fact, it's worse than 
                         that.  I own this hotel.

                                     MARTHA
                         He got it in a shrewd business move.

                              (To Bob)
                         Was everybody in your outfit?  We 
                         seem to run into them all over the 
                         country.

                                     BOB
                         The Draft Board didn't know when to 
                         stop.

                                     WAVERLY
                         If I start the introductions, can I 
                         get to meet these young ladies?
                              (Indicating them)
                         My housekeeper, Miss Martha Allen, 
                         my granddaughter, Susan Waverly.

                                     BOB
                         I'm Bob Wallace -- this is Phil Davis --

                                     BETTY
                         We're the Stewart sisters.

                                     JUDY
                         Your floor show.

                                     MARTHA
                              (To Waverly)
                         Don't worry -- I've already told 
                         them we'd have to cancel.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Why?  We have a floor, haven't we?

                                     MARTHA
                         Last time I looked.  But who are 
                         they going to sing to?

                                     WAVERLY
                         Even if it's only to you and me, it 
                         will be well worth it.  Besides, 
                         there will be six inches of snow 
                         tonight and we'll be full up tomorrow.

                                     BETTY
                              (Happily)
                         Is that the weather forecast?

                                     WAVERLY
                         No.  But if there was one thing I 
                         learned in the army it was to be 
                         positive -- especially when you don't 
                         know what you're talking about. You'll 
                         excuse me, gentlemen, I'm on K.P.

               Phil and Bob stiffen automatically.

                                     PHIL AND BOB
                         Yes, sir!

                                     WAVERLY
                              (To Betty and Judy)
                         And you two charming ladies, I want 
                         you to know I'm looking forward to 
                         your show this evening.  Whatever 
                         your audience lacks in numbers, it
                         will make up for in enthusiasm --
                              (He glares at Martha)
                         or I'll know the reason why!

               He smiles at the girls, and exits, dignified.

                                     JUDY
                              (Utterly charmed)
                         Gee... no wonder we won the war!

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DINING ROOM INN - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT -

               BETTY AND JUDY

               They are doing the number, SISTERS, on the floor.  THE CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK to reveal the scene.  There is a scant audience 
               distributed at several tables, totaling not more than fourteen 
               in number.  Not far from the kitchen entrance Bob and Phil 
               are sitting at one table.

               Martha is seen doing general overseeing, principally acting 
               as hostess.  Susan doubles between the cashier's desk and 
               helping out at table.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               They are admiring the performance.  Phil indicates for Bob 
               to look in this direction.  Bob does.

               REVERSE ANGLE - MED. SNOT

               The General is seating a table.

               MED. SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               Bob shakes his head, unhappy at this condition.  They look 
               at each other.

                                     BOB
                         I think well stay a little longer 
                         than we planned.

               MED. FULL SHOT - BETTY AND JUDY

               They finish the number and are applauded enthusiastically, 
               but the few people in the audience don't make for much 
               clatter.  One set of hands seems to be applauding loudest 
               and clearest.

               MED. SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY

               He is the one doing the enthusiastic applauding.  He walks 
               toward the boys, still applauding.  They applaud too.  The 
               girls enter the scene, to sit with the boys.

               Martha is only applauding politely, until Waverly glares at 
               her.  Then her enthusiasm is boundless.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Excellent.  I enjoyed it very much.

                                     JUDY
                         Thank you.

                                     MARTHA
                         It was nice, if you like music.

               A waitress brings food, which Martha helps distribute.

                                     BETTY
                              (After a look that 
                              the waitress is not 
                              in a position to 
                              hear)
                         Mister Waverly, we'd like to make 
                         you a proposition.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Smiling)
                         Well, for heaven's sake!

                                     BETTY
                         You've been very nice not canceling, 
                         we'd like to make a gesture.  Until 
                         it snows, and you have guests, we'll 
                         take half salary.

                                     MARTHA
                              (Appreciative)
                         That's really nice of you.
                              (She takes out pencil 
                              and her order book)
                         Now let's get that in writing.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Pushing it aside)
                         Never heard of anything so ridiculous.
                              (Gets up)
                         Your next performance is tomorrow 
                         night, after dinner.  Be here, or 
                         I'll sue!

               He dignifiedly walks in the direction of some departing 
               guests, and proceeds to show them to the door.

                                     MARTHA
                              (Annoyed)
                         Light-Horse Harry.  Advance, advance, 
                         never retreat!  He's advancing right 
                         into bankruptcy.

                                     PHIL
                         That's just the way he was in the 
                         army.  Always thinking of the other 
                         fellow.

                                     BOB
                         We ate and then he ate.  We slept, 
                         and then he slept.

                                     PHIL
                         Then he woke up, and nobody slept 
                         for the next forty-eight hours.

                                     MARTHA
                         I happen to know he's sunk his life's 
                         savings into this place.  I read the 
                         carbon paper.

                                     JUDY
                         Gee, I wish there were something we 
                         could do to help.

                                     BOB
                         Maybe there is.

                                     PHIL
                         You got a flash?

                                     BOB
                         A glimmer.  Have to stir it around a 
                         bit.

                                     PHIL
                              (To the girls)
                         Shhh!
                              (Indicating Bob, 
                              tapping his forehead)
                         Ticking away madly.  Wheels within 
                         wheels.  This is the brain that, in 
                         darkest Italy, devised a formula to 
                         make food out of K-Ration!  Shhhhhh!

               As he regards Bob with something akin to awe, we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MED. SHOT - INT. LOBBY - (NIGHT)

               The last of the supper audience is leaving.  We see into a 
               room which adjoins the reservation desk and Bob is on the 
               phone.

               CLOSE SHOT - INT. INN OFFICE

               Phil is sitting on the desk while Bob talks.

                         Relax... I didn't ask you how much 
                         it'll cost us...

                              high voice on the 
                              phone)
                         Easy, easy, remember your blood 
                         pressure... I don't care how much

                         remember your blood pressure.  
                         Incidentally, how much will this 
                         cost?

                              It obviously is a 
                              very large number)
                         Good night, Oscar.

                         We are coming out - even.

                                     PHIL
                         You mean flat?

                                     BOB
                         That's the same as even.

                                     PHIL
                         Wheels within wheels.  It's nice how 
                         you take care of the money for both 
                         of us because you're older and so 
                         level headed.  I wonder where I'd be 
                         now if hadn't saved your life?

                                     BOB
                         Do you want me to cancel the troupe 
                         coming?

                         No, no.  Let's go through the gesture.  
                         If you had been on the Titanic when 
                         it went down, you wouldn't've been 
                         satisfied just to sink into the ocean.
                              (Gesturing)
                         You'd have done a swan dive into it.

               FULL SHOT - COLUMBIA INN FLOOR - (DAY)

               The scene is a melee of the excitement accompanying 
               preparations for the show.  The little stage has been enlarged - 
               the draperies pulled back right and left and a side wall 
               pushed back a little farther.  There is hammering and painting 
               going on in various parts of the room.  Trunks have been 
               unpacked and wardrobe hung up in odd places, as more trunks 
               arrive.  Girls in abbreviated rehearsal clothes walk around, 
               do cartwheels; two people sing at the piano; six girls kick 
               in unison; altogether, it is quite a contrast to the bareness 
               of the previous scene.

               THE CAMERA TRUCKS through all the activity, taking in our 
               group at the doorway, which features Bob and Phil, the girls 
               standing nearby.  Martha and Susan are amazed at the activity.

                                     MARTHA
                         I can't believe it!  You mean you 
                         brought the whole show up here?

                                     BOB
                         When you hired the Stewart sisters 
                         you also hired a New York show.  It 
                         was in the small print.

                                     PHIL
                         And you can't get out of it.  We've 
                         got lawyers.

                                     SUSAN
                         I can't thank you enough, but I wonder 
                         if Gramp'll let you do it?

                                     PHIL
                         Why not?

                                     MARTHA
                         His pride.  When he decides he's 
                         going into bankruptcy he likes to 
                         go.

                                     BOB
                         Now just a second.  We're not doing 
                         this for him!

                                     PHIL
                         Oh no!  We're bringing the show down 
                         here to rehearse!

                                     BOB
                         The company's been getting a little 
                         ragged.  We'd appreciate the use of 
                         the hall.

                                     PHIL
                         Of course we don't expect it free!

                                     BOB
                         We'll pay a little, but not much. -
                         You see, the audience will be guinea-
                         pigs -- and for us, that's quite an 
                         improvement.

               This has not fooled Susan.  She throws her arms around Bob 
               and then Phil.

                                     SUSAN
                         I don't know what to say!

               She cannot refrain from tears of gratitude and turns and 
               runs out.  There is a moment of silence.

                                     BOB
                         I hope this is not an indication of 
                         advancing age, getting kissed out of 
                         gratitude.

                                     PHIL
                         You didn't expect a girl that pretty 
                         to kiss you because she wanted to?

                                     BOB
                         A body keeps hoping.

               Betty steps up to him and gives him the biggest smack.

               Bob is quite surprised.

                                     BETTY
                              (Sincerely)
                         That was the nicest thing I ever saw 
                         anybody do.

                                     BOB
                         It was still gratitude.

                                     PHIL
                              (To Judy)
                         I'm his partner.  I'm entitled to 
                         half the credit.
                              (Judy steps up to him 
                              and just pecks him 
                              on the cheek, then 
                              joins her sister in 
                              rehearsal)
                         She's not as grateful as her sister.

               They look off through the exit and see a moving van unloading 
               scenery, as the General arrives in his buggy.

               He steps down and looks with amazement at the scenery passing 
               by.

               Waverly is looking interestedly at the goings on, but is 
               puzzled.  The boys exchange a glance.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Finally)
                         I'm not clear about some of it.  
                         Explain it again.

                                     PHIL
                              (Not too good a job)
                         Well, sir.  We have this show, and 
                         we laid off for the holidays.  You 
                         see, business was bad.

                                     WAVERLY
                         I know about business being bad.
                         Go on.

                                     PHIL
                         Yes sir.  Well, so we figured as 
                         long as we had the opportunity we'd 
                         do a little rehearsing.  Right here.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Why here?
                              (There is a hint here 
                              of the General)
                         Phil looks to Bob for help as they 
                         move toward the lobby.

               The troupe is busy transporting the costumes, etc., from the 
               moving van to the dining room auditorium as the above scene 
               is played.

                                     BOB
                         Well, sir, this nice empty room.  
                         The minute we looked at it we said 
                         it was ideal.  Didn't we?

                                     PHIL
                         That's what we said.  Ideal.

                                     BOB
                         And then we'll have an audience to 
                         play to.  You see, sir, you need an 
                         audience on which to try out your 
                         new material.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Where are you going to get the 
                         audience?

                                     PHIL
                         Oh, what guests there are in the 
                         other hotels. They're pretty bored 
                         here without snow, and a New York 
                         show's kind of a novelty in Vermont.

                                     WAVERLY
                         I would think so.
                              (He thinks)
                         How will they know you're here?

                         Yes sir, and we also took the girls 
                         twice around the town for a little 
                         run.  They were stiff from the train.

                         Hmm.  Whose blood?

                         show business I don't understand.

                         It just takes time.

                                     PHIL
                         We wouldn't be any good as generals.

                                     WAVERLY
                         You weren't any good as privates!

                         He was an officer, sir.

                         Only to confuse the enemy.

               He turns away and goes to his quarters.

               People break off what they were doing and begin to drift 
               out. Bob and Phil have gone toward Betty and Judy.

                                     BOB
                         Get a little rest before tonight's

                         See you later.

               The girls go.  Phil goes toward the piano, Bob goes toward 
               Martha, who is on the phone, accepting reservations.

               FULL SHOT - ROOM

               Bob takes Martha by the arm and seats her in the middle of 
               the room as an audience of one.  Phil looks up from the piano, 
               puzzled. The sunset is visible through the window and there 
               is a mood of quiet.

                                     BOB
                         It isn't.  Just tell me how you think 
                         the Old Man would feel about this 
                         one.

               He leaves her and goes to the piano and they do WHAT CAN YOU 
               DO WITH A GENERAL, solely for Martha.

               Toward the end of the song --

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - GENERAL WAVERLY

               Unseen by the others he is standing by the door listening to 
               the song.

               MED. SHOT - INT. ROOM

               The boys finish the number. Martha applauds and Bob bows.

                                     MARTHA
                              (Very moved)
                         I think it's just wonderful --

               CLOSE SHOT - SUSAN - AT KITCHEN DOOR

               She is standing there, drying her eyes with her apron.

                                     SUSAN
                         I think so, too.

                                     WAVERLY
                         I'm afraid I disagree. The song is 
                         funny, but there is one thing wrong 
                         with it.

                                     PHIL'S VOICE
                         What's that, sir?

                                     WAVERLY
                         It's true.  I'd rather you didn't.

               FULL SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR

               Bob and Phil exchange a quick glance.

                                     BOB AND PHIL
                         Yes, sir.

               The General turns and exits toward the lobby, THE CAMERA 
               PANS with him, a lonely figure walking through the lobby, 
               the CAMERA STOPPING on a poster advertising tonight's 
               performance.

               FULL SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR - (NIGHT)

               It is fairly-well filled.  Bob, Phil, Betty, Judy and the 
               ensemble are performing a NUMBER which is a MINSTREL SHOW 
               routine done to lyrics and music.  Bob and Phil are end men, 
               Betty is interlocutor, and Judy is later introduced as Mandy.  
               This takes Judy and Phil into a dance to the song MANDY.  
               This entire number is done in white-face with stylized 
               costumes and set. During the applause and bows, we CUT TO:

               Waverly, flanked by Susan and Martha, is at a large table.  
               The other occupants are local hotel owners and their wives.

                         Great show, Waverly.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Thank you.

                                     SECOND OWNER
                         We needed something like this.  I 
                         had six checkouts, and when they 
                         heard about this they decided to 
                         stay.

                                     FIRST OWNER
                         Same here.
                              (Big smile)
                         Much obliged.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Glad to help.

               Martha and Susan beam; all is well.

               FULL SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR - (NIGHT)

               It is empty and most of the lights are out.  At a considerable 
               distance from CAMERA Martha extinguishes the last light, 
               except for a small work light which is servicing Bob, who is 
               fingering the piano keys and writing music notes, hard at 
               work.

               FULL SHOT - GIRLS' BUNGALOW

               In the background we see the boys' bungalow.

               MED. SHOT - INT. GIRLS' BUNGALOW

               Betty and Judy are in twin beds, the light is coming in from 
               the moon.  The girls are seen in profile.

                                     JUDY
                              (Talkative)
                         The moon!   I can't get over the 
                         moon up here.  The size of it!

                                     BETTY
                              (In a quiet mood)
                         Same one they have all over.

                                     JUDY
                         They'll never prove it to me.  And 
                         everything smells so beautiful.
                              (She breathes)
                         What is it - pine or fir?

                                     BETTY
                              (Small sniff)
                         We're near the bakery.

                                     JUDY
                              (Friendly, not 
                              realizing the stab)
                         You know your trouble, Betty?  You're 
                         not romantic.

               Betty turns and looks toward her.  Since Judy does not see 
               her, Betty's expression is a true reflection of how she feels.

                                     JUDY
                         Everything's so wonderful here, so 
                         pretty, so exciting, I can't 
                         understand how you stay frozen up.  
                         Let yourself go, go, like me!

                                     BETTY
                              (Afraid to ask)
                         Which one is it?

                                     JUDY
                         What do you mean?

                                     BETTY
                         Bob or Phil?

                                     JUDY
                         Neither.

                                     BETTY
                         You mean both.

                                     JUDY
                              (Smiling)
                         It's the same.  No one is going to 
                         break up our act.

                                     BETTY
                         Isn't there one you prefer over the 
                         other?

                                     JUDY
                         The way Phil dances, and he's funny.  
                         It's easy to see yourself married to 
                         him.

                                     BETTY
                              (An effort)
                         And Bob?

                                     JUDY
                         He's different, deeper, and he's 
                         funny, too.  It'd be nice to be 
                         married to both of them.

                                     BETTY
                         Good thing they're not a quartette.

                                     JUDY
                              (Oblivious)
                         If I was Catherine the Great, that's 
                         what I'd do.  Phil in the daytime, 
                         Bob at night. Or should it be the 
                         other way around?

               CLOSE SHOT - JUDY AND BETTY

               SHOOTING PAST Betty.  Is it possible our Betty has a suspicion 
               of a tear?

                                     JUDY
                         Phil'd be more fun in a night club, 
                         but eventually a girl wants a pipe 
                         and slipper fellow.  That's Bob, 
                         smoking a pipe and petting a cocker 
                         spaniel.  Still, Phil could learn to 
                         smoke a pipe.  Breaking a fellow in 
                         to suit you is something every girl 
                         should go through.  I hear it's half 
                         the fun.  Which one do you like 
                         better?  Betty?
                              (No answer.)
                         Betty?
                              (Softer)
                         Are you asleep?
                              (No answer. Judy turns 
                              over and closes her 
                              eyes)

               Music has underscored this scene.  Betty is wide awake.

               She is looking toward the window.  As the curtains billow 
               outward we see a diffused figure of Bob, sitting on a fence, 
               putting out his pipe.  This is followed by an equally diffused 
               figure of Betty, leaving her bed, crossing the furniture, 
               and joining Bob.  Bob takes her in his arms.  At this point 
               we are brought back to reality by the wind slamming a shutter.  
               This causes the diffusion to vanish, and Betty gets out of 
               bed and puts on her robe.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. INN KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - (NIGHT)

               We PAN Betty to the refrigerator door, which she opens.

                                     BOB'S VOICE
                         Tuna fish, on the lower shelf.

               Betty whirls around.

               MED. SHOT - BETTY AND BOB

               We see Bob is having a snack of his own.

                                     BETTY
                         Oh!

                                     BOB
                         What are you doing?  Sleep-walking?

                                     BETTY
                         I couldn't sleep.

                                     BOB
                         Little young for that, aren't you?

               He gets up and goes to the refrigerator.  His preoccupation 
               with the food will permit Betty's expression to be more 
               obvious than her lines, which are spoken to tell the audience 
               of her regard for Bob,  since their significance must escape 
               him.

                                     BOB
                         What shall I make you?

                                     BETTY
                         Anything'll do.

                                     BOB
                         If you tell me what you want to dream 
                         about I'll know what to make you.

                                     BETTY
                              (Amused)
                         How's that?

                                     BOB
                         Different foods make for different 
                         dreams.  I've got a whole theory 
                         about it.  It's called "The Wallace 
                         Way of Wishful Wooing."  You'll find 
                         it in the American Medical Journal 
                         under 'W'.  Ham and Swiss cheese, 
                         for instance, you get a cool, thin, 
                         blonde girl.  Turkey sandwich, you 
                         get a dark sort of stumpy girl, sexy 
                         though.  Now a liverwurst sandwich -
                              (He shakes his head)
                         you get both girls at once.  Bad 
                         night.

                                     BETTY
                         What do you dream on tuna?

                                     BOB
                         Darndest thing, I dream about me.

                                     BETTY
                              (Evenly)
                         Then I'll have a tuna sandwich.

               Bob doesn't get the significance of what she has said.

                                     BOB
                         Now that's very flattering.  Tuna 
                         coming up.
                              (He is occupied at 
                              the frigidaire while 
                              she watches him 
                              yearningly)
                         Let me make you some warm milk.  
                         That'll help the insomnia.

                              (Meaningly)
                         No it won't.

                              his back)
                         Warm milk won't do it.

                         Whatever you've got on your mind 
                         isn't worth staying awake for.

                                     BETTY
                         I think it is.

               He smiles at her, oblivious to the meaning behind her lines.

                                     BOB
                         Would you like to know how I handle 
                         a situation like that...?

                                     BETTY
                         Tell me, Doctor...

               Bob begins to sing COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS, as he prepares the 
               warm milk and hands it to her.  She drinks it down.  As he 
               reaches the second chorus, he starts to dim the lamp on the 
               table,  Betty, pretending to be sleepy, leans her head toward 
               Bob.

               He takes a pillow from a nearby chair and puts it between 
               her head and her chair.  She waits, eyes closed, expectantly.  
               But Bob gets to his feet, and carefully tiptoes to the door 
               and exits, closing it softly behind him.  After a moment, 
               Betty snaps on the light, throws the pillow on the floor, 
               and rests her chin in her hand, disappointed and wide awake.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN:

               LONG SHOT - INT. INN FLOOR - (DAY)

               Various members of the company are in rehearsal clothes and 
               sitting around the room.  The orchestra is playing the 
               introduction to Phil's number, which will employ a line of 
               six girls who are just coming on the floor.

               Bob is on stage supervising the rehearsal.  Judy is standing 
               across from the piano.  Betty is seated on the sidelines 
               with her legs stretched over two chairs.

               She is knitting a loud colored argyle sock.  Phil, standing 
               close by, has just finished rolling up a ball of yarn.  He 
               looks at Betty's knitting, then at his feet.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't make them too tight.  I wear 
                         size 12.

                                     BOB
                         All right kids!  Places!  Let's get 
                         going! Phil, you're on!

               Phil reacts.

               Bob crosses to his stage manager station, which is a desk 
               and high chair, where Albert is seated, not far from his 
               wife, Sylvia, who is sipping a glass of water.  Albert holds 
               a stop watch and evidently helps in the administration.

                                     BOB
                              (To Albert)
                         How long are we so far?

                                     ALBERT
                         An hour and ten minutes.

                                     BOB
                         Something has to come out.

               From his position, Phil, in a series of leaps and turns, 
               reaches center floor and begins his solo.

               CLOSE SHOT - BETTY

               She continues knitting while watching Phil dancing.

               As Phil comes to a portion where he speeds up his steps she 
               unconsciously speeds up her knitting, Bob has seen her, and 
               he looks from her knitting and her look of admiration, which 
               he mistakes for affection, and then looks from the socks to 
               Phil's feet.  At the end of the number, which is applauded 
               by the witnesses, Judy runs to Phil and hugs and kisses him, 
               THE CAMERA STAYING at this distance.

               Bob, looking at Betty, mistakenly sees her disappointment.

                                     BOB
                         All right, places for the next number!
                              (He turns to Sylvia)
                         You're next, Sylvia.
                              (Sylvia and Albert 
                              exchange peculiar 
                              glances,  Bob senses 
                              it)
                         What's the trouble?

                              go on)

                                     BOB
                         Come on, out with it.

                                     ALBERT
                         I don't think Sylvia ought to go on, 
                         unless you cut out the high kicks 
                         and let her do some easy waltzes.  
                         Very easy waltzes.

               Bob looks from one to the other and their smiling shyness 
               indicates pregnancy.

                                     BOB
                         You're kidding!

               Phil puts his arm around Albert.

                                     PHIL
                         Obviously you're going to call the 
                         boy after me!

                         more important!  The baby'll be named

                         The hiring was more important!  After 
                         me!

                                     BOB
                         Well, we're going to need another 
                         dancer!

                                     PHIL
                         How about Judy, she knows all the 
                         routines, she could pick it up in no 
                         time.

               They walk to the table where the coffee is, and the group 
               now includes Betty.

                                     BOB
                         On the other hand, it's all right if 
                         we lose a number, we're running too 
                         long now.  We have to cut somewhere.

                                     BETTY
                         Wouldn't it be better if you cut my 
                         solo number?  I've never felt right 
                         in it anyway.
                              (Indicating Phil)
                         The show needs every bit of his 
                         dancing.

                              (Interpreting this as 
                              mere selflessness 
                              for love)
                         Well -

                         There you are - painless.

               She turns away rather abruptly, since she is becoming 
               emotional.  Bob shakes his head, impressed with what he thinks 
               is her devotion.

               MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               Bob dunks a doughnut into his coffee as he looks after Betty.  
               He looks at Phil and shakes his head.

                                     BOB
                         Greater love hath no woman than to 
                         give up a solo number.  Old Chinese 
                         saying.

                                     PHIL
                              (All this is beyond 
                              him)
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BOB
                         Drink your coffee.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               FULL SHOT - WAVERLY QUARTERS - (NIGHT)

               This is the party later that evening.  Some people are 
               dancing.  Others are grouped about, and there is a general 
               home party atmosphere.  The General, Martha and Susan are 
               seen helping everyone to feel at home.

               The CAMERA STARTS ON A LONG SHOT and DOLLIES THROUGH THE 
               GROUP, passing Sylvia, where ad lib comments about the 
               impending baby are sketchily HEARD.  The CAMERA CONTINUES 
               toward the piano, where Bob and Betty are examining the music 
               sheet of A MAN CHASES A GIRL.

               Betty looks up and the CAMERA FOLLOWS her look to Phil, who 
               is dancing with Rita.  Rita nestles up close to Phil.  This 
               is seen by Bob and Betty.  Bob smiles.

               CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND RITA

               On closer view, we can see that Rita is the aggressor.

                                     PHIL
                              (Referring to the 
                              grip)
                         Don't you want me to breathe?

                                     RITA
                         Not especially.

                                     PHIL
                         What's gotten into you?

                                     RITA
                         You were chasing me in Florida.

                                     PHIL
                         And you were running.  What made you 
                         stop?

                                     RITA
                         You're interested in Judy, aren't 
                         you?

                                     PHIL
                         That's it, eh?  Unless it belongs to 
                         someone else, a girl doesn't - Ouch!
                              (Evidently Rita has 
                              deliberately stepped 
                              on his instep)

               SCENE FROM BOB'S VIEWPOINT

               Betty is walking over to the dancing couple and deliberately 
               cuts in on Rita, who is displeased, but can do nothing but 
               yield.  Bob's reaction still implies that this is 
               understandable since Betty loves Phil.  He turns back toward 
               the piano, and other couples are between him and Betty and 
               Phil.

               Still at the same camera distance, we see Betty turning Phil 
               over to Judy.

               CLOSE SHOT - PHIL AND JUDY

               Judy is a little cool.

                                     PHIL
                         What's the matter?

                                     JUDY
                         Nothing is the matter.

                                     PHIL
                         This isn't the way you dance.

                                     JUDY
                         Some people dance closer than others.

               Phil is delighted that she is jealous.

                                     PHIL
                         Yes, that's true.  I'm one of the 
                         close ones.  That's my type.

               He holds her closely, by force, dancing, smiling and pleased 
               with himself.

               The dance music stops.  The people disperse.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - AT PIANO

               Harry, the piano player, is playing the last half of A MAN 
               CHASES A GIRL.  Bob and Betty are leaning over the piano, 
               Bob humming the melody.  Betty pantomimes to the others to 
               quiet down.  Bob starts to sing the lyric.  In the second 
               chorus, he is joined in the singing by Betty.  During this 
               chorus we CUT TO show various reactions of the group, and 
               end on Phil, sitting close to Judy, holding her hand.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT - PHIL AND JUDY

               We HEAR Bob and Betty, off scene, continuing to the end of 
               the second chorus, on which Phil, sotto voce, sings the last 
               four bars.

                                     PHIL
                              (Singing; looking at 
                              Judy)
                         And once you've caught him, don't 
                         ever let him go.

               APPLAUSE follows the song.  Phil gets up.

                                     PHIL
                         Ladies and gentlemen, I would like 
                         to make an announcement.

               FULL SHOT - CROWD

               Everyone quiets, waiting to hear the announcement.

                                     PHIL
                         It is my pleasure to identify the 
                         man who has been doing the chasing.  
                         I am him! - Or he! - Or it!  Anyway, 
                         Judy has caught me.  What I'm trying 
                         to say is, we're engaged.

               He looks fondly at Judy, taking it for granted she is 
               overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is 
               going to marry her.  He hugs her amidst a general reaction 
               of congratulations.

               MED. SHOT - BOB

               He is flabbergasted.

               MED. SHOT - GROUP

               Phil and Judy are separated by the congratulators.

               Betty, hiding her emotion, grips Phil's arm.

                                     BETTY
                         I hope you realize that you're getting 
                         he most wonderful girl in the world.

               Bob sees her emotion through the speech.  Betty notices Judy 
               upset, shaking off the people around her and running through 
               the doorway to the kitchen.

               Betty makes her way through the crowd to follow her, as the 
               orchestra goes into HER COMES THE BRIDE.

               MED. SHOT - INT. KITCHEN

               Judy is crying into her hands as Betty enters.

                                     BETTY
                         Darling, don't cry.

                                     JUDY
                              (Turning to her)
                         I didn't know he was going to make 
                         that announcement, I swear I didn't.

               Betty puts one arm around her.

                                     BETTY
                         I know you didn't.

                                     JUDY
                         He had no right to do that.

                                     BETTY
                         You do love him, don't you?

                                     JUDY
                         That doesn't matter.

                                     BETTY
                         Nothing else matters.

                                     JUDY
                         We're not going to break up our act.

               Phil enters the kitchen.

                                     PHIL
                         I've been looking for you, Judy.

                                     BETTY
                         Excuse me.

               She goes through the corridor toward the living room.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - CORRIDOR OFF BUTLER'S PANTRY

               In the background we see the General in the butler's pantry 
               getting some drinks for the guests.  He is not seen by Betty 
               who stops at the mirror in the corridor to wipe away a few 
               tears.  Bob comes into view in the mirror, entering the 
               corridor from the living room.

                                     BOB
                         Don't take this too much to heart.  
                         Phil is a great kid but constancy 
                         isn't his long suit.

                                     BETTY
                         I'm not the least bit worried.
                              (Phil and Judy enter 
                              from the kitchen)
                         Frankly, this couldn't come at a 
                         better time.  They want me to come 
                         back to The Carousel again - I used 
                         to sing there before Judy and I teamed 
                         up - and I had to turn it down because 
                         they can only use a single.
                              (Not too well)
                         So - this couldn't be more convenient.  
                         You stay with the show and I'll go 
                         back to The Carousel.

                                     JUDY
                         When did you get this offer?

                                     BETTY
                         Just today, as a matter of fact.  I 
                         got a telegram.

                                     JUDY
                         Why didn't you mention it before?

                                     BETTY
                         I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

                                     JUDY
                         Where is the telegram?

                                     BETTY
                         I threw it away.  What is this, a 
                         third degree?  You don't think I 
                         made it up?

                                     JUDY
                         Yes, I do.

               There is a pause, and Waverly, who has been watching each 
               one, speaks.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Well now, I wouldn't bet any large 
                         sum of money on that, since I took 
                         the message over the telephone, and 
                         I had to deliver the telegram.
                              (To take the tension 
                              off)
                         And she didn't tip me, either.

               Betty looks at him gratefully.

                                     JUDY
                         Oh, Betty!
                              (She throws her arms 
                              around her)
                         I'm sorry!  I misunderstood!

                                     BETTY
                         Now, baby!  It's all right!

                                     PHIL
                         Well, everything's fine now!

               Happy, he beams at Judy.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND WAVERLY

               Something bothers Bob about this story.  He looks searchingly 
               at Betty, puzzled.  He does not notice Waverly, who watches 
               him watching Betty.

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               LONG SHOT - RAILROAD STATION - DAY

               Train about to leave.  The General is in the foreground 
               sitting in the buggy.  Betty is saying goodbye to him.

               Bob and the porter are taking care of her luggage.

                                     GENERAL
                              (Shouting over noise 
                              of train)
                         Where are you going to be?

                                     BETTY
                         The Carousel.

               The General looks at her, questioningly.

                                     BETTY
                              (Whispering, during a 
                              lull in the noise)
                         I sent them a telegram this morning.

               The General smiles; Betty waves a farewell to him and crosses 
               to the train, starting up the steps.  The notion behind this 
               scene is to be able to hear only intermittent dialogue due 
               to the whistle, bells, and escaping steam.  The manner of 
               playing, though, indicates the sentiment.  To emphasize it: 
               Bob is fonder of Betty than he realizes, and Betty fully 
               realizes how fond she is of him but that he does not return, 
               consciously, her affection.  We hear Betty:

                                     BETTY
                         Take care of my little sister.

                                     BOB
                         She can take care of herself.  Worry 
                         about the menfolk.  Now don't forget 
                         to write.

                                     BETTY
                         I'll send you picture postcards.

               Not all of this is heard, since the sound effects pick their 
               spots, but the attention is on the General, who is watching 
               the scene with a whimsical look.  He, as does the audience, 
               realizes Bob's true feelings.  As the train starts to leave, 
               Betty and Bob shake hands.  She holds his handshake a little 
               longer than necessary, and Bob is forced to move along with 
               the train.  Finally she releases him, and Bob looks after 
               the train, puzzled.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               THE CAMERA is now on the train platform, Bob out of sight.  
               Betty wipes away a tear.  In the background we see the General 
               in the buggy noticing this.

               MED. LONG SHOT - TRAIN IN DISTANCE

               Bob is in the foreground, the General in the background.  
               Bob joins the General at the buggy.  From Waverly's expression 
               we can see that he has decided on a plan of action.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Must be interesting to be a woman.

                                     BOB
                         The idea's never occurred to me, 
                         sir.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Well, think about it.
                              (Bob is thinking about 
                              it)
                         Well?

                                     BOB
                         Not interested!

                                     WAVERLY
                         A man like you must be an expert on 
                         women.

                                     BOB
                         It's a little immodest to say so, 
                         but I consider myself an authority 
                         on the fair sex,  I've made a study 
                         of the subject.  They're simple 
                         creatures.

                                     WAVERLY
                         They couldn't fool you?

                                     BOB
                         I'm single.

                         'Who knows his own strength is twice

                                     WAVERLY
                         It's always a pleasure to meet an 
                         expert in any field.  Tell me, why 
                         do you think Betty went to New York?

                                     BOB
                              (Not willing to admit 
                              it)
                         She has a job in The Carousel.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Expert, you're wrong!  She went to 
                         New York because she's so in love 
                         with someone here she just couldn't 
                         stand it.

                                     BOB
                         Phil.
                              (A mixture of 
                              resentment and 
                              frustration)
                         I'm darned if I can figure out why.

                                     WAVERLY
                         I thought you were an expert on women.
                              (To the horse)
                         Come on, Delilah!

               CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTMAS TREE ANGEL - DAY

               THE CAMERA PANS DOWN from the ceiling and we see that THE 
               INN is being decorated for Christmas Eve.

               Everybody is so engaged, except those actively helping Phil 
               and Judy rehearse.  The attitude is slightly cool on Judy's 
               part, but it is lover's coolness.

                                     PHIL
                              (Fitting the action)
                         Good, Judy.
                              (During the dancing)
                         Now the same as the middle part.

               They make a nice couple, with his arm around her waist, 
               dancing as one.

               REVERSE ANGLE - BOB

               He enters the room, and watches.  He looks intently at Phil.  
               Phil and Judy dance closer to Bob. They see him. They continue 
               dancing, talking as they do.

                                     PHIL
                         Betty get off all right?

                                     BOB
                              (Slightly belligerent)
                         Certainly.

                                     JUDY
                         Betty left something for you.  She 
                         said to give it to you after she 
                         left.  It's on the piano.

               Bob hears, nods, but keeps staring at Phil.  Phil becomes 
               conscious of the staring.

                                     PHIL
                         What's the matter?

                                     BOB
                         I don't get it.

                                     PHIL
                         Don't get what?

                                     BOB
                         I just don't see it.  You' re skinny, 
                         you got a big nose, and you squint.

                                     PHIL
                         Who?  Me?

                                     BOB
                         Yes, you!  Nothing personal though.

                                     PHIL
                         No, of course not.

                                     BOB
                         I'm just trying to figure out what 
                         anyone sees in you.

                                     PHIL
                         Well, stop worrying about it.  When 
                         I ask you for a date just turn me 
                         down.  Come on, Judy.

               They dance away.  Bob crosses to the piano and picks up the 
               package Betty left for him.  He opens it up and it is a single 
               knitted sock, the one she knitted on previously.  He looks 
               through the box for its mate.

               There is none.  The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Bob, puzzled.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT - BLACKBOARD - (DAY)

               Painted at the top is the legend:

               WEATHER FORECAST

               At the moment a hand is completing, in chalk:

               "No Snow" After a moment, the hand returns and draws two 
               lines through the "S" so that it now reads, "No $now".  CAMERA 
               PULLS BACK to reveal we are on:

               EXT. PINE TREE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT

               Bob comes out of the Post Office and mounts a bicycle.

               He cycles down the street, whistling A MAN CHASES A GIRL.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               SECTION OF VILLAGE - HORSESHOE PITCHING GROUNDS - MED. SHOT - 
               (DAY)

               There is a group of elderly men, among them the hotel owners, 
               pitching horseshoes. Waverly is sitting on a bench, ruefully 
               looking at the sign.

                                     FIRST HOTEL OWNER
                              (Starting a new game)
                         How about it, Waverly, want to play?

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Looking at him a 
                              moment)
                         I'm too young for that sort of thing.

               First Owner laughs goodnaturedly and continues playing.

               Bob rides into the scene and dismounts.

               MED. SHOT - BOB AND WAVERLY

               Bob sits into the shot.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Kind of warm for that kind of 
                         exercise, isn't it?

                                     BOB
                              (Trying to help)
                         It isn't very warm.
                              (He looks to the sky)
                         I think the weatherman's wrong about 
                         his forecast.  Those look like snow 
                         clouds to me.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Without looking up)
                         They're cumulus clouds, at an 
                         elevation of seven thousand feet.

                                     BOB
                         Yes, sir.
                              (Still trying)
                         Still, weather's a funny thing.
                         It could snow - overnight.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (He thinks a moment)
                         I'll tell you something I haven't 
                         told my family.  I'm going back in 
                         the Army.

                                     BOB
                         Really, sir? That's great news!

                                     WAVERLY
                         Yes.  I miss the Army.

                                     BOB
                         Where are you going to be sent, sir?

                                     WAVERLY
                         Well, I'm not sure yet.  I've always 
                         been a combat officer, but I got an 
                         idea they're going to try and palm 
                         off one of the training commands on 
                         me.  They'd better not.  They just 
                         better not.
                              (He's worked up now)
                         I'm not ready for pitching horseshoes 
                         yet.
                              (He smiles)
                         Now nothing to the women folk about 
                         this!

                                     BOB
                         No, sir.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Let's mosey over to the post office, 
                         I'm expecting a letter any day.

                                     BOB
                              (Remembering)
                         Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
                              (He pulls the letter 
                              out of his pocket)
                         That's what I came over to give you, 
                         it slipped my mind.

               The General takes the letter, he looks at it front and back.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Solemn)
                         This is the one.
                              (He opens it,  He 
                              squints.  He looks 
                              to Bob)
                         My glasses are in my room.  I'd like 
                         to read it by myself, but I'm a little 
                         anxious.
                              (He smiles at his own 
                              predicament)
                         Read it, son.  Slowly.

                                     BOB
                              (Reading)
                         Dear Tom: Why, you dirty, old -
                              (He stops)

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Pleased)
                         Skip that word.

                                     BOB
                         Yes, sir.
                              (Continuing)
                         It certainly was a surprise hearing 
                         from you.  Your amusing letter was 
                         appreciated more than you imagine.  
                         Of course you've got plenty of time 
                         to be amusing, sitting on that porch, 
                         rocking away, while we put in a full 
                         day's work.  You always were a lucky 
                         stiff, and I envy you.  A few years 
                         more, I was saying to Emmy the other 
                         evening, and I'm going to be able to 
                         take it easy like old Tom.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Just repeats)
                         Old Tom.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, well, some people have all the 
                         luck.  Everyone in the family is 
                         fine here.  Carol had the mumps, 
                         which is no joke at eleven years of 
                         age -

                                     WAVERLY
                         The rest of the letter is about the 
                         family.
                              (Bob looks at him, 
                              and then glances at 
                              the rest to see if 
                              it is so)
                         He's telling me they have nothing 
                         for me, we're not fooling each other.
                              (He holds has hand 
                              out)
                         Thank you.
                              (Bob gives him his 
                              letter.  There is a 
                              pause.  An attempt 
                              at being light)
                         Say, it couldn't be hard to learn to 
                         pitch horseshoes.  Now could it?

                                     BOB
                              (Trapped, unhappy for 
                              him)
                         No sir.
                              (His nerve up)
                         Begging your pardon, sir, there's a 
                         lot to be said for leisure.  You're 
                         not used to it, you've always been 
                         active, but in time -

               He stops, seeing Waverly's expression.  Waverly winks at 
               him.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Quietly)
                         Never kid a kidder.  Go on back to 
                         the hotel.

                                     BOB
                         Yes sir.

               Waverly gets up to join the horseshoe players after all.  
               Bob watches this reflectively as we

                                                                   FADE OUT

               FADE IN:

               MED. SHOT - (DAY) - INT. HOTEL ROOM - BOB AND PHIL

               Bob is packing his valise, Phil helping him.

                                     PHIL
                         Judy thinks my eyes are soulful.  Do 
                         you think my eyes are soulful?

                                     BOB
                         One of them is.

                                     PHIL
                         You have no poetry in you.  It's 
                         about time you went in for girls, 
                         too.  After all, you haven't many 
                         years left for that sort of thing.

               Bob, his back turned to Phil, comes across the sock Betty 
               knitted for him; he hastily shoves it into the bottom of has 
               bag.

                                     BOB
                              (Over above)
                         I'm the quiet type.  Little do you 
                         know what's aged me.

                         about.  That's all.

                         of you.  You're not in the girly

                         Well, I'd know enough not to get up.

               There is a KNOCK at the door and Martha sticks her head in.

               A poster outside advertises the appearance of Betty Stewart.  
               MUSIC is heard emanating from the club.

               A rehearsal is in progress in the deserted club.  The chairs 
               are up on the tables, musicians in their shirt sleeves, as 
               Betty SINGS a chorus of LOVE, YOU DIDN'T DO RIGHT BY ME.  As 
               she finishes, the orchestra LEADER turns to her.

               It is alive with customers; couples are dancing on the floor, 
               as a number ends.  Bob enters, and is conducted to a ringside 
               table by a maitre d'.

               STAGE - MED. CLOSE

               Betty is standing at the microphone ready to sing.

               She sees Bob.  The Leader raises his baton.

                         What?

                         Play "Blue Skies" -- anything.

                         Relax.  Just do it the way you sang 
                         it this afternoon -- you'll be great.

               He gives the downbeat, and Betty has no choice but to sing 
               LOVE, YOU DIDN'T DO RIGHT BY ME.  She is assisted in the 
               second chorus by a vocal group.

               as Bob watches her.  When she finishes the number, Betty 
               steps down from the platform and joins Bob.

                                     BETTY

                              chair)
                         Well, surprise.  What brought you to 
                         the big city?  And don't say 'a

                         I never heard you sing that well.  
                         That's a good number for you.

                         Some numbers suit you better than 
                         others.  What are you doing here?

                         I think they like each other.

                         I do, too.

                         They're kind of suited, in a lot of 
                         ways.

                         Thanks for the knitted sock.

                         Don't mention it.

                                     BOB
                         I thought it was for Phil.

                                     BETTY
                              (Evenly)
                         If the sock fits, wear it.

                              (Unsure of her meaning)
                         It started out for Phil.

                                     BETTY
                         It just started out as a sock.

               Every line of the sock exchange should have the meaning of 
               the love implications.

                                     BOB
                         You're a very odd girl.

                                     BETTY
                         You're a very odd fellow.

               Bob is close to declaring himself, if he was only sure of 
               his ground.

                         I'll get around to the other one, 
                         eventually.

                         You mean to do any knitting in the 
                         near future?

                                     BETTY
                         The feeling comes and goes.

                                     BOB
                         Think if the model hung around for a 
                         while... the feeling might be more 
                         permanent?

                         Maybe.

               Bob leans over and takes her hand.

                         What's this maybe, shmaybe, comes 
                         and goes?  Friends tell me I don't 
                         have many years left for this sort 
                         of thing...  I ought to know right 
                         now if --

               He is interrupted by ED HARRISON, who has been brought to 
               the table by the maitre d'.

                         Now what's this big deal you wanted 
                         to discuss?  I shouldn't even talk 
                         to you after canceling out on my 
                         show.

                         He's too proud to let them know he's 
                         General Waverly.

               Ed looks at her, surprised.

                         telling us?  It's about time we 
                         returned the favor.  Let's surprise 
                         him with a real big bang-up reunion.

                         the word?

               Bob takes a piece of paper out of his inside pocket and hands 
               it to Ed.

               Seated around the television set are Waverly, Martha and 
               Susan.  Martha and Susan look at their watches and each other, 
               nervously.  Waverly also looks at his watch.

                         Ed Harrison will be on in a half

                         him.

               The women are becoming very nervous.  Suddenly we HEAR off 
               scene the most tremendous clatter dorm the stairway and Phil's 
               shouting.

                         What's that?

               He runs toward the stairs.  Martha and Susan breathe a sigh 
               of relief and follow Waverly.

                         Now they're going in and out!

               Waverly slaps the towel on his face.

                         Phil, what's happened to you?

               Phil assumes a pain-stricken face again and Judy throws her 
               arms around him.  Phil smiles over her shoulder at Waverly.

               Bob and Betty tiptoe through the entrance to the inn.  In 
               the semidarkness of the lobby we hear a "sst - ", and Susan 
               and Martha are revealed having been waiting for them.

                                     MARTHA
                         We've been waiting for you.

                         Just fine.

                         They are bedded down in all the

                         mean old biddy, I'd probably break 
                         right down and cry.
                              (She cries)

                         There's nothing to cry about, is 
                         there?

               He looks to Susan and she begins to bawl.

                                     SUSAN
                              (Through the crying)
                         Thank you so much.

               Bob looks to Betty for support.

                         They're just affected by the gesture.

               She can't hold it back either, and now the three women are 
               crying.

                                     BOB
                         That's fine.

               Judy, locked in an embrace.  Bob has been in front, but he 
               steps back quickly, not wanting to embarrass the lovers.

               And he holds his hand out, and they shake hands, still 
               flustered.

               Flustered, the boys open the door to the girls' bungalow, 
               thinking it is their own.

               They all laugh.  The girls enter their bungalow and put on 
               the light.  The boys head toward their bungalow.  Phil enters

                                     BOB
                         Where have I heard that?

                         Tell you how I handle a situation

               She starts to sing, COUNT YOUR BLESSINGS.  At the conclusion, 
               she walks away, leaving him standing there.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               MED. SHOT - INT. WAVERLY'S QUARTERS

               The General is in his dressing gown, furious. Martha and 
               Susan are playing a part.

                                     WAVERLY
                         How could you send all my suits to 
                         the cleaners?

                                     MARTHA
                         You've only got two.

                                     SUSAN
                         Why can't you wear your uniform?

                                     WAVERLY
                         I won't appear in uniform!

                                     SUSAN
                         Please, Gramp.

                                     WAVERLY
                         Absolutely not!

                                     MARTHA
                         Very well.  I'll explain to Bob and 
                         Phil that you didn't care to come to 
                         the show tonight.

                                     WAVERLY
                         I'll have you court-martialed!

                                     MARTHA
                         You don't mind being ungrateful, you 
                         just don't like being told you are!

                                     SUSAN
                              (Follows it up)
                         If you think you don't owe them 
                         anything, you're not obliged to go.

                                     MARTHA
                         They haven't done much for you.  
                         Hardly anything.  You do what you 
                         think is right!

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Angrily)
                         Martha, I'll make my own decisions!  
                         I got along very well in the army 
                         without you!

                                     MARTHA
                         It took 15,000 men to take my place!

               She stalks out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               FULL SHOT - INN FLOOR - (NIGHT)

               It is slowly filling up.  One of the guiding officials turns 
               out to be the Sheriff we have previously seen.

                                     PETE

               MED. SHOT - INT. MAKESHIFT DRESSING ROOM - BOB AND PHIL

               They are getting into their old uniforms, which are slightly 
               misfit.

                                     BOB
                              (At the trousers)
                         This thing's shrunk.

                                     PHIL
                              (Looking at the bulge)
                         Pants always shrink in closets.

                                     BOB
                         I can't breathe in this.  What am I 
                         going to do?

                                     PHIL
                         I know what I'm going to do.
                              (Showing him)
                         I'm going to take one big deep breath, 
                         and that's going to be it for the 
                         next three hours.

               Bob takes a deep breath and gets the top button buttoned.

               MED. SHOT - LOBBY STAIRWAY - (NIGHT)

               General Waverly comes down the stairs, cutting quite a figure 
               in his uniform and decorations.  Martha and Susan, waiting 
               for him at the bottom, look him over, admiringly.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Gruffly)
                         Well, I couldn't come down in my 
                         bathrobe.

               FULL SHOT - INN FLOOR

               The spotlight prepared, pinpoints the General as he enters 
               the room, and the music starts.  The audience rises and 
               applauds.  He can't believe it.  He reaches his table, 
               decorated with flowers, and recognizes he is the guest of 
               honor.  From the lobby we hear the outfit SINGING the opening 
               strains of THE OLD MAN.

               All eyes turn to the lobby entrance, through which the old 
               outfit marches, and continues to the stage, and then back to 
               their respective tables as the song finishes.

               MED. SHOT - WAVERLY

               He is profoundly moved and walks to the stage.  The audience 
               is seated.  Waverly looks at the assembled crowd with great 
               affection.  The people begin to shout, "Speech!  Speech!"  
               Martha and Susan sit.

               The crowd quiets, waiting for the speech.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (He must have had a 
                              blood transfusion 
                              from a sergeant at 
                              some time)
                         I am not satisfied with the conduct 
                         of this division!  Some of you men 
                         are under the impression that having 
                         been at Anzio entitles you not to
                         wear neckties!  You are wrong!  
                         Neckties will be worn in this area!  
                         I have also noticed a deterioration 
                         in the quality of saluting!  This is 
                         to be improved!  I have also had 
                         complaints from the commanding officer 
                         of the rest area in Naples!  He 
                         informs me that the non-fraternization 
                         rule is constantly being broken by 
                         men of this division!  In fact, this 
                         division is outstanding in its 
                         violations of non-fraternization!  
                         You all know the rules!  The non-
                         fraternization ban expressly declares 
                         you are not to talk to women!
                              (A slightly different 
                              tone)
                         Don't talk to them!  That is all!

               They howl and cheer.  He makes has way toward his own table, 
               greeting old friends on the way.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND PHIL

               As they step to the front of the stage.

                                     BOB
                              (To the audience)
                         Doesn't that bring back memories?  
                         Remember those terrible, trying days 
                         in Italy... when we had to beat the 
                         women off with chocolate bars?

                                     PHIL
                         And wasn't it awful the way they 
                         kept bothering us for American 
                         cigarettes?  Why, I must have taught 
                         fifty girls how to smoke...

                                     BOB
                         For a month's pay all we got was 950 
                         million lira...

                                     PHIL
                         Nine hundred and fifty two...

                                     BOB
                         I was forced to hire a caddy for my 
                         loose change.

                                     PHIL
                         Fore...!

                                     BOB
                         I'm glad I'm well out of it.

               Phil looks at him.

                                     PHIL
                         Who are we kidding?

               This is the cue for the orchestra to start the production 
               number, I WISH I WAS BACK IN THE ARMY.  At end of number -

               AUDIENCE - FULL SHOT

               As they applaud and cheer.  The old outfit is happy.

               In the exultation, General Waverly places two fingers to his 
               lips and blows a whistle of sheer pleasure and approval.  We 
               underscore with MUSIC indicating another number is taking 
               place on stage, although we do not see it.

               SECTION OF AUDIENCE - MED. CLOSE

               Ed Harrison crosses to General Waverly and whispers to him.

                                     ED HARRISON
                         Long distance call for you, sir.

               Waverly looks surprised, but rises and starts out.

               Bob, visible in b.g., has been watching.  He and Harrison 
               exchange knowing glances.

               AT HOTEL DESK - MED. SHOT

               The lobby is empty;  in b.g. are the doors to the dining 
               room, where the show is in progress.  The telephone lies on 
               the counter.  Waverly enters and crosses to it.  He is a 
               little annoyed at being forced to leave the entertainment.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Into phone, gruffly)
                         Hurry up, hurry up, I'm busy.
                         Yes, this is General Waverly.

               He suddenly snaps to attention, the old soldier.

                                     WAVERLY
                              (Quietly)
                         And a Merry Christmas to you, Mr. 
                         President... Yes, practically the 
                         whole outfit is here.  A little 
                         paunchy, but they're here.  It 
                         certainly was a surprise -- more 
                         like a frameup.  As usual, my 
                         Intelligence was not functioning 
                         efficiently... Yes?
                              (Long pause)
                         That's very nice of you, Mr. 
                         President... any time you want me, 
                         just say the word... but may I add 
                         this?  It isn't always necessary to 
                         take a job... sometimes it's enough 
                         just to know it's there.

               Through the window behind the General we have seen it begin 
               to SNOW.  The General notices it for the first time, and his 
               face brightens.

                                     WAVERLY
                         If you ever take it into your mind 
                         to grab a little rest from all that 
                         work I wish you'd drop in on us here -- 
                         I can't promise you any golf but --
                              (As he looks at the 
                              falling snow)
                         -- we can certainly give you plenty 
                         of snow, Mr, President... Yes, Mr.  
                         President... What?
                              (Smiles)
                         Thanks, Ike.

               He hangs up the phone, and proudly, head erect, he walks 
               through the lobby, smiling, eyes wet.  He lifts the bell on 
               the desk with a loud bang.  Martha hurries in, startled.

                                     MARTHA
                         You frightened me to death!  That 
                         bell hasn't been used for three 
                         months!

                                     GENERAL
                         Get this area policed up.  No telling 
                         who might be dropping in.

               Martha salutes.

                                     MARTHA
                         Yes, sir!

               She and the General gaze at the snow falling beyond the lobby 
               door which is blown open by the wind.

               Underneath all this we have been hearing the introductory 
               music to WHITE CHRISTMAS, which is the number now in progress 
               on the stage.  Waverly now turns and walks into the dining 
               room.

               INT. DINING ROOM - MOVING CAMERA

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Waverly on his entrance.  As he passes Susan, 
               we see she is reacting to something on the stage.

               CAMERA PASSES Waverly and moves to:

               STAGE - FULL SHOT - MOVING CAMERA

               Center stage, there is a large cutout of a decorated Christmas 
               tree.  Also, there is considerable Christmas holly, mistletoe, 
               etc.  Bob and Betty are seen singing.  Throughout action of 
               this number Phil and Judy dance.  In addition there is staged 
               movement by the ensemble.  Bob and Betty are on each side of 
               the cutout Christmas tree, but it is obvious that Betty is 
               preoccupied with some stage business which she is manipulating 
               with one hand behind the cutout tree.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Bob and Betty as their movement takes them 
               behind the tree.  It is now that we see very clearly that 
               the rear wall of the stage (two immense barn doors) has 
               opened; in b.g. we see the Vermont countryside being covered 
               by the falling snow.  Also, we see pine trees in the snow 
               that are decorated.

               Betty steers Bob to a point directly beneath a sprig of 
               mistletoe from which is also hanging the mate to the sock 
               she gave him in scene 110.  Bob looks up, sees the mistletoe 
               and the sock, and smiles at Betty.

               She lifts one of his trouser legs and we see that he is 
               wearing the other sock.  They laugh and embrace.

               REVERSE SHOT - FROM DINING ROOM

               The cutout tree onstage rises to the flies and now the real 
               trees and falling snow in b.g. are completely visible.  One 
               by one, the trees are lighted.

               AUDIENCE - MED. CLOSE

               Martha and Susan are standing happily beside the General, 
               each holding one of his arms.

               EXT. VERMONT TOWN - EXTREME HIGH SHOT - (MINIATURE)

               A church bell is framed in the foreground, and, far in the 
               distance, we see the town and the Inn and the snow as we

And now the story of Sailor and Lula.....




1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to 
maximum R.P.M. up the street.

								CUT TO:


2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE

The sign reads KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS.

								CUT TO:


3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

								CUT TO:


4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY

Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others 
flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.

				OLD WOMAN
		Oh my God! ... Why they doin that?

				OLD MAN
		Who the hell knows.  What you have
		in your mouth?

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

				OLD MAN 
		Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth
		out ... doctor said.  What you 
		tryin to do?  SPIT IT OUT!!!

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a 
tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.

								CUT TO:


5. WASP NEST

A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A 
SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 
nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

								CUT TO:


6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

The telephone rings.  MARIETTA PACE FORTUNE, a rich Southern woman 
around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across 
the livingroom and answers the phone.

				MARIETTA
		Hello...  Who is this?...

								CUT TO:


7. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

A GUARD stands by as SAILOR RIPLEY, twenty-three years old - lost 
somewhere between the cool long-gone generation and a used-car salesman 
- speaks on a prisoner phone in a green cement cubicle with one bench.

				SAILOR
			(into phone)
		...Sailor Ripley...  Can I talk 
		to Lula?

								CUT TO:


6A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		Theres no way in hell you can speak
		to her and...

								CUT TO:


7A. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

				SAILOR
			(feeling a smile coming on)
		What?...

								CUT TO:


6B. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		...Yes you heard me...  Dont ever 
		call back here again.

Marietta hangs up the phone as LULA PACE FORTUNE, Mariettas twenty-year 
old daughter, comes quickly down the stairs.

				LULA
		Mama???

				MARIETTA
		You know who it was and you know 
		you arent, and I mean ARE NOT 
		gonna see him EVER...  End of story.

				LULA
			(quietly)
		Like hell.

Marietta, her hand still on the telephone, grips the receiver so hard 
her knuckles turn white.

								CUT TO:


8. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LULAS ROOM UPSTAIRS - DAY

Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo.  Speed metal music jumps 
up to around one hundred twenty decibels.

								CUT TO:


9. INT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.  
The iron bars of the door slide across Sailors face and close with a 
bang.

								CUT TO:


10. EXT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

A beat-up, red 64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane 
TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the 
club - leaning out the car in every direction.  They scream out to the 
desolate-looking passerby.

				TEENAGERS
		EAT SHIT MOTHERFUCKERS!!!!!!

The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot 
pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.

								CUT TO:


11. INT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas 
while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH 
BOYS.  The group segues smoothly from Elmore Jamess Dust my Broom 
into Robert Johnsons Me and the Devil and Beany lets out a snort.

				BEANY
		I can dig this music...  But not 
		that singer.

				LULA
		Why?...  Hes right in the groove.

				BEANY
		Hes so ugly.  Guys with beards and
		beer guts aint quite my type.

				LULA
		          (giggles)
		Seeins how youre about as thick as
		a used string of unwaxed dental floss,
		dont know how you can criticize.

				BEANY
		Yeah, well, if he says that all that
		flab turns into dick at midnight, 
		hes a liar.

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

				BEANY
		So, Sailors gettin out soon, and
		youre gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

				LULA
		Meetin him at the gate.  That phone
		call this afternoon was the signal.
		My deranged mamas hid the keys to
		my car.  But of course, I know 
		exactly where they are.

				BEANY
		I didnt hate me so much, Id feel
		better wishin you luck.

				LULA
		Cant all husbands be perfect, and
		your Elmo probly wouldnta ever 
		got that second one pregnant, you
		hadnt kicked his ass out.

				BEANY
		So youre gonna be needin the 
		blue-bird pretty soon?

				LULA
		Real soon ... Ill be makin the swap 
		tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.

The Bleach Boys kick into some kind of Professor Longhair swamp mambo.

12. EXT. BAY ST. CLEMENT - DAY

Plumes of smoke from fires rise in the distance.

DISSOLVE TO:

An empty livingroom.  The smoke from the city fire appears during the 
course of the DISSOLVE to be in the livingroom - then it disappears.

An empty hallway.

An empty stairway.


13A. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTAS BEDROOM - DAY

Feet (Lulas) was across carpet.

A closet door opens.

A hand (Lulas) reaches into the pocket of a coat in her mothers 
closet.  The hand comes out clutching car keys.

Lula races down the stairs and through a door into the garage.

The electronic garage door opens and Lula drives her 80 Black Camaro 
out and away.  The garage door closes automatically.

15. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

Lula drives fast up a neighborhood street.  She turns a corner and 
disappears.

								CUT TO:


16. INT. BEANY THORNS GARAGE - DAY

Lula throws her car keys under the front seat and goes around to Beanys 
67 dark blue Thunderbird convertible - fishes around under the T-Birds 
front seat for the keys - finds them - jumps in and takes off.

DISSOLVE TO:


17. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta leaves her Cadillac Seville in her driveway and enters the 
house.  We can hear her calling out for Lula in the distance.  The 
calling changes - it becomes angry.  The garage door opens and Marietta 
comes storming out.  She leaps in her Caddy and peels out.

								CUT TO:


18. INT. SOUTHERN TIME BAR - DAY

Marietta enters the bar on the run.  She calls out to the BARTENDER...

				MARIETTA
		Wheres Johnnie?  Hes not in his office.

				BARTENDER
		Havent seen im yet today, Marietta.

				MARIETTA
			(slightly hysterical)
		Well I gotta find him - right this
		minute!

								CUT TO:


19. EXT. PEE DEE COUNTY WORK FARM - DAY

Sailor is waiting out front as Lula pulls up in her T-Bird - throwing 
out a cloud of dust.  Theyre both smiling.

				LULA
		Hey baby...

				SAILOR
		Peanut...

They kiss tenderly and then Sailor walks around the car to get in while 
Lula opens up a suitcase and gets out his snakeskin jacket.

				SAILOR
		Hey, my snakeskin jacket...  Thanks,    
		baby...  Did I ever tell you that
		this here jacket for me is a symbol
		of my individuality and my belief
		in personal freedom?

				LULA
		Bout fifty thousand times.  I got 
		us a room at the Cape Fear, and 
		guess what?...  I hear Powermads 
		at The Hurricane.

				SAILOR
			(smiling)
		Stab it and steer.

Lula tromps it and throws out an even larger cloud of dust.

								CUT TO:


20. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the 
fan creak.

				LULA
		Did you ever think somethin like
		about the wicked witch of the east
		comin flyin in?...  Did you ever
		think somethin and then later think
		youve said it out loud to someone?

				SAILOR
		I really did miss your mind while I
		was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The
		rest of you, too, of course.  But 
		the way your head works is Gods own
		private mystery.  What was it you
		was thinkin?

				LULA
		Well, I was thinkin about smokin 
		actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros
		now, used to be she smoked Kools?
		I stole em from her beginnin in
		about sixth grade.  When I got old
		enough to buy my own, I bought those.
		Now Ive just about settled on Mores,
		as you probably noticed?  Theyre longer.


				SAILOR
		I guess I started smokin when I was
		about six...  My mama was already
		dead from lung cancer...

				LULA
		What brandd she smoke?

				SAILOR
		Camels, same as me...  Guess both
		my mama and my daddy died of smoke
		or alcohol related illness.

				LULA
		Gee, Sailor.  Im sorry, honey.  I 
		never would have guessed it.

				SAILOR
		Its okay.  I hardly used to see 
		them anyway.  I didnt have much 
		parental guiding.  The public defender
		kept sayin that at my parole hearin.
		He was a good ol boy, stood by me...
		Even brought me some cartons of 
		cigarettes from time to time.

				LULA
		Id stand by you, Sailor ... through
		anything.

				SAILOR
		Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after
		I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man cant
		ask for more than that.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

				LULA
		You move me, Sailor, you really do.
		You mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulas breasts.

				SAILOR
		Youre perfect for me, too.

				LULA
		You remind me of my daddy, you know?
		Mama told me he liked skinny women
		whose breasts were just a bit too
		big for their bodies.  He had a long
		nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever
		tell you how he died?

				SAILOR
		In a fire, as I recall.

				LULA
		Started he couldnt remember things?
		Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin
		me it was on account of lead poisoning
		from cleanin the old paint off our
		house without usin a mask...  But
		I dont know.  Seems like his brain
		just fell apart in pieces.

								CUT TO:


21. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CLYDE FORTUNE tears a door off the kitchen cabinets and strews the 
cabinet contents all across the counter and floor.  He puts his fist 
through the kitchen window.  He leaps on the counter and bats the 
kitchen ceiling light - smashing it.  He kicks over the refrigerator.

				CLYDE
		FUCKIN BITCH!!!!

								CUT TO:


22. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lulas eyes look off, remembering.

				LULA
		Finally in the middle of the one 
		night, with me and mama asleep 
		upstairs ... he poured kerosene over
		himself and lit a match.

								CUT TO:


23. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

Clyde Fortune, completely engulfed in fire, races across and back the 
livingroom until he collapses in a fifties modern armchair.  The drapes 
behind him burst in flames.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		Near burned down the house.  We 
		got out just in time.

The whole livingroom goes up in flames.

								CUT TO:


24. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

CU the red hot ash of Lulas cigarette as she inhales deeply.  As she 
exhales a cloud of smoke she turns to Sailor.

				LULA
		It was a year before I met you.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lulas hand and puts it into the 
ashtray by her bed.  He pulls her to him and kisses her throat.

				SAILOR
		You have such a pretty, long neck, 
		like a swan.

				LULA
		Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth
		white neck.  It was like on a 
		statue it was so white?

Sailor drifts his thumb over Lulas left nipple then cups her breast in 
his hand.  They kiss.

								CUT TO:


25. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Marietta pours JOHNNIE FARRAGUT another shot of scotch.

				MARIETTA
		I knew this would happen.  Soon as
		that piece of filth got out of 
		Pee Dee, I knew thered be trouble.
		Hes just got some kind of influence
		over her I cant decipher.  Theres 
		somethin wild in Lula I dont know
		where it comes from.  You gotta find
		em, Johnnie.

				JOHNNIE
		He served his time for what he did.
		Another thing...  If Lula went with
		him of her own volition - willingly,
		that is - there aint much can be
		done about it.

				MARIETTA
		Dont talk down to me, Johnnie 
		Farragut.  I know what volition means,
		and thats why I want Sailor Ripley
		off the planet!  Hes pure slime and 
		its leakin all over my baby.  
		Maybe you could push him into makin
		some kinda move and then kill him
		dead.  Youd only be defendin 
		yourself, and with his record, 
		nobodyd fuss.

Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.

				JOHNNIE
		Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if
		shes with the Ripley boy, Ill
		give him a talkin to and try to
		convince her to come back with me.
		Thats about all I can do.

He takes a long swallow from the tumbler.  Marietta begins to cry.  She 
blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as shed started.  
Her grey eyes glaze over.

				MARIETTA
		Ill hire a hit man if you dont want
		to help me stop this thing.  Ill
		call Marcello Santos.

				JOHNNIE
		Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you.
		And dont be gettin carried away.
		You dont want to be bringin Santos
		and his people into it.

				MARIETTA
		Youre just jealous of Santos cause
		hes sweet on me.

				JOHNNIE
		Darlin, you aint seein Santos 
		again, are ya?

				MARIETTA
		Oh, Johnnie Farragut...  Dont you 
		trust your very own Marietta?

				JOHNNIE
		Sorry, sweetheart.  Bein in love 
		with you like I am brings out that 
		ugly jealous side.

				MARIETTA
		Well stop worryin about me and 
		start worryin about how youre 
		gonna get that Lula back here and 
		away from that murderer.

				JOHNNIE
		Sailor aint a murderer.  You got to
		get off that kick.  And fars I can 
		tell, Sailor was entire clean prior
		to that involvin Lula.  Even there
		he was protectin her.  You oughta
		be thankin him for that.  That Bob
		Ray Lemon they say was comin after
		the both of em.  Why am I tellin
		you this, you was around that night.
		You ought to know just exactly what
		happened.  Sailor just got a little
		too forceful is all...  You remember
		that night...

CU of Marietta eyes as she thinks back.

								CUT TO:


26. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

We see Marietta standing in a carpeted hallway above the ballroom.  
Dance band music can be heard in the distance.  Sailor appears coming up 
the hallway - slightly drunk - he carefully sets his drink on the carpet 
outside the MENS ROOM.

Mariettas POV of Sailor entering the MENS ROOM.

CU of Mariettas glazed eyes and smiling face.

Mariettas POV of walking toward MENS ROOM.

								CUT TO:


27. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

				MARIETTA
		Maybe I was there, but I didnt see 
		anythin.  All I knows that trash
		killed a man with his bare hands.
		Hands which are now probly all
		over my baby!

				JOHNNIE
		Marietta, settle down now darlin...
		I want whats best for her, too -
		Like I said, Ill do what I can to
		bring her home.

								CUT TO:


28. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with 
her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway 
from where he lays on the bed.

				LULA
		Sailor, you are somethin else, 
		honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama
		told me that pretty soon Id be
		startin to think about sex, and
		I should talk to her before I did
		anything about it.

				SAILOR
		But honey, I thought you told me
		your Uncle Pooch raped you when
		you was thirteen.

				LULA
		Thats true.  Uncle Pooch wasnt
		really an uncle.  He was a business
		partner of my daddys?  And my mama
		never knew nothin about me and 
		him - thats for damn sure.  His real
		name was somethin kind of European,
		like Pucinski.  But everyone just
		called him Pooch.  He came around the
		house sometimes when Daddy was away.
		I always figured he was sweet on 
		mama, so when he cornered me one 
		afternoon, I was surprised moren
		a little.

				SAILOR
		Howd it happen, peanut?  He just
		pull out the old toad and let it
		croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 
pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 
she teases her hair.

				LULA
		Youre terrible crude sometimes, 
		Sailor, you know?

				SAILOR
		I cant hardly understand you when
		you talk with one of them Mores in
		your mouth.

Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of 
the sink.

				LULA
		I said you can be too crude sometimes?
		I dont think I care for it.

				SAILOR
		Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how
		old Pooch done the deed.

				LULA
		Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin
		her hair dyed?  And I was alone in 
		the house.

								CUT TO:


29. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

We see what she talks about.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		Uncle Pooch came in the side door
		through the porch, you know?  Where
		I was makin a jelly and banana
		sandwich?  I remember I had my hair
		in curlers cause I was goin that
		night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the
		DeSoto sisters.  Uncle Pooch must have
		known nobody but me was home, cause 
		he came right in and put both his
		hands on my butt and sorta shoved me
		up against the counter.

								CUT TO:


30. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				SAILOR
		Didnt he say somethin?

Lula shakes her head.  She picks up her cigarette, takes a puff and 
throws it into the toilet.

ECU of cigarette in toilet.

				LULA
		Not really.  Least not so I recall now.

Lula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls 
down the hole.

ECU of cigarette coming apart as it swirls.

				SAILOR
		So howd he finally nail you?  Right 
		there in the kitchen?  

				LULA
		No, he picked me up.

								CUT TO:


31. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - KITCHEN/MAIDS ROOM - DAY

We see what she talks about.

				LULA
			(voice-over)
		He was short but powerful.  With 
		hairy arms?  Anyway, he carried me 
		into the maids dayroom which nobody
		used.  We did it there on an old bed.

								CUT TO:


32. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				SAILOR
		We did it?  Whattaya mean?  Didnt
		he force you?

				LULA
		Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle,
		you know?  I mean, he raped me and
		all, but I guess theres all 
		different kinds of rapes.  I didnt
		exactly want him to do it but I 
		suppose once it started, it didnt
		seem all that terrible.  It was over 
		pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch
		just stood there and pulled up his
		trousers and left me there.  I 
		stayed in bed till I heard him drive
		off.  Then I just went back into
		the kitchen and finished makin my
		sandwich.

				SAILOR
		And you never told nobody about it?

				LULA
		Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted
		strange or different after.  And he
		never did anything else to me.  I
		always got a nice present from him
		at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
			(pause)

								CUT TO:


33. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a 54 Ford Pick-Up 
and a 64 Chevy Station Wagon.  No survivors.  Balls of flame and 
grinding metal.

								CUT TO:


34. INT. CAPE FEAR HOTEL - DAY

				LULA
		Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three
		years later while he was holidayin
		in Myrtle Beach.  They still got way
		too much traffic there for my taste...
		And another thing, baby...  That
		government of ours should be keepin
		us separated from outer space...

				SAILOR
		Here she goes again...

				LULA
		Sailor, that ozone layer is
		disappearin.  Seems to me the 
		government could do somethin about
		it.  One of these mornings the
		sunll come up and burn a hole clean
		through the planet like an X-Ray.

Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette.

				SAILOR
			(laughs)
		That aint never will happen, honey.
		Least not in our lifetime.

Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs.  It is a kind of wild, crazy 
laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lulas face goes pale.

				SAILOR
		You okay, honey?

				LULA
		That womans laugh creeps me out.
		I heard somethin like that...
		somewhere before...  Soundd like 
		the wicked witch...

				SAILOR
		Just sounded like an old gal havin
		a good time to me...  You ready to
		dance?

				LULA
		Im always ready to dance.  But I
		need me a kiss first, honey.  Just one?

Lula and Sailor kiss.  In the middle of the kiss, the womans 
creepy/crazy laugh is heard again in the distance and Lulas eyes snap 
open with a kind of fear.

								CUT TO:


35. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Marietta is escorting MARCELLO SANTOS and two stiff drinks to a table in 
her backyard.

				SANTOS
		I knew youd want it again...

				MARIETTA
		Thats not why I called.

				SANTOS
		Oh yeah - sure ... okay.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  It isnt.

				SANTOS
		Have it your way...  But you want it.

				MARIETTA
		Lulas gone off with Sailor.

				SANTOS
		What do you want me to do about it?

				MARIETTA
		I want you to take care of Sailor, so
		he wont ever be able to bother my
		baby again.


				SANTOS
		Take care of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		What does take care of him mean?...
		Do you want me to give him food or
		some clothing?

				MARIETTA
		Whats with you?...  You know what
		take care of him means.  I dont 
		call Santos except for one big reason.

				SANTOS
		Big is the key word, and Im telling
		you I want it bad.

				MARIETTA
		I want you to get rid of Sailor.

				SANTOS
		Get rid of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes...  Get rid of him.

				SANTOS
		How would I do that?  Send him on a
		trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

				MARIETTA
		Santos, why in hell do you insist on
		playin this stupid game?

				SANTOS
		Just tell me what you want.

				MARIETTA
		I dont need to explain anymoren I
		have...  You know damn well.

				SANTOS
		You need to explain it.

				MARIETTA
		All right...  I want you ... to ...
		kill ... Sailor...  As simple as that.

				SANTOS
		Simple?  Kill him?...  How?

				MARIETTA
		Thats your business...  I dont care
		how.

				SANTOS
		Like an accident where maybe Lula
		might also get hurt?

				MARIETTA
		NO...  For Gods sakes, Santos!

				SANTOS
		Well, like kill him with the atomic
		bomb?

				MARIETTA
		Santos...

				SANTOS
		Explain it...  I told you.

				MARIETTA
		Shoot him.

				SANTOS
		Shoot him?  Like with a gun?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Where?...  In the leg?

				MARIETTA
		No.

				SANTOS
		Where?

				MARIETTA
		In the head.

				SANTOS
		Shoot Sailor in the head with a 
		gun...  Now Im beginning to get 
		it...  You want me to shoot Sailor
		in the head with a gun.

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		But where in the head?...  Not the
		chin, I hope.

				MARIETTA
		No...  In the brains...  What little
		Im sure he has.

				SANTOS
		You want me to shoot Sailor in the
		brains with a gun.  

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Through the forehead?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Wrong!  Its much better to blow a
		hole in the back of the head ... 
		right toward the bridge of the nose
		...  Lots and lots of irreparable
		damage.

				MARIETTA
		See!  I knew you had it all under 
		control.

				SANTOS
		Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?

				MARIETTA
		Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first...
		Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that
		town.

				SANTOS
		On one condition...

He pauses and smiles strangely.

				SANTOS
		You give me your permission to kill
		Johnnie Farragut.

				MARIETTA
			(whisper)
		Santos...  No...  Please, Santos...

				SANTOS
		Youre not tellin me that youre 
		sweet on him?

				MARIETTA
		No...  But...

				SANTOS
		One day hes gonna find out what 
		were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and
		he could cause us a lot of trouble.

They stare at each other for a moment.

				SANTOS
		Im gonna take your silence as a 
		yes...

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  I cant...


				SANTOS
		Shhhh...  Its all right...  Also, I
		either take you or that pretty 
		daughter of yours to bed.

				MARIETTA
		You fucker, dont you ever touch 
		Lula -  You fucker, Ill kill you.

				SANTOS
			(laughing)
		Put your shoulders back.

				MARIETTA
		What?

				SANTOS
		Put your shoulders back, I said.

Marietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of 
her.

				SANTOS
		You got nice tits.

				MARIETTA
		Someones gonna see us.

				SANTOS
			(smiling as he starts
			to feel her breasts)
		Thats just another part of the price
		to pay.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  You kill that Sailor, 
		otherwise hes gonna turn my baby
		against me.

Santos lifts one hand up to Mariettas chin and raises her face up 
towards his.

				SANTOS
		Look at me...  Theres no turning back   
		on this...  Im gonna kill Sailor...
		Thats for sure.

36. INT. THE HURRICANE - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT

We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right - 
as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign.

One hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name Powermad on the 
bass drum.

The BAND segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one.  Sailor grabs 
Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical 
storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula.  
They thought theyd seen everything.

CU of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK 
moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor 
turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music 
immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the 
man a fully extended Reno point...

				SAILOR
		Are you going to provide me with an 
		opportunity to prove my love to my
		girl?  Or are you gonna save 
		youself some trouble and step up 
		like a gentleman and apologize to her?

				IDIOT PUNK
		Dont fuck with me, man.  You look 
		like a clown in that stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me its a symbol of my individuality
		and my belief in personal freedom.

				IDIOT PUNK
		...Asshole.

				SAILOR
		(as he moves toward the Idiot Punk)
		Come here.

				LULA
		Sailor, honey...

The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his 
knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back 
tears and holding his cheek.

				SAILOR
		     (helping him up)
		Im sorry to do this to ya here 
		in front of a crowd, but I want ya
		to stand up and make a nice apology
		to my girl.

				IDIOT PUNK
			(to Lula)
		Im sorry.

				LULA
		Hell, you just rubbed up against 
		the wrong girl is all.

				SAILOR
		Thats good...  Now go get yourself

		You fellas have alotta the same power
		Elvis had...  Yall know this one?...

Sailor starts to sing an Elvis Presley song, Love Me.  As the band

Sailor turns around from his sprawled on the bed position watching The

Lula makes a face.  She lies down on the bed next to Sailor.

Sailor grunts.

				LULA
		Whats that honey?

				SAILOR
		We didnt have no TV up at Pee Dee,

Lula slides her head up and kisses Sailor on the cheek.

				LULA
		Im sorry, sweetie.  I forget some

		Twenty-three months, eighteen days is

Sailor and Lula are in bed.  Lula lays in Sailors arms.

				LULA
		Oh, you know exactly what I mean,

				SAILOR
		At Pee Dee, all you think about is 
		the future, you know?  Gettin out?
		And what youll do and what youll
		think about when youre on the 
		outside again.

				LULA
		I just think about things as they

				SAILOR
		It aint altogether terrible just to

		Lula, I done a few things in my life
		I aint too proud of, but Ill tell

74. INT. MINI-MART - DAY

A tall OLD BLACK MAN about seventy years old, wearing a torn green 
Tulane tee-shirt and a dirty orange Saints baseball cap, is filing items 
on the counter by the cash register.  In the pile are four ready-made, 
plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six 
Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice 
colas; two Barqs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, 
extra salted.

				BLACK MAN

		Sorry, gentlemen.  Im most finished

				ERV
		This be it?

				BLACK MAN
		Yall take American Express?

				ERV
		Yessir.

				BLACK MAN
		Then lemme throw in a couple more

Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up 
several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a 
dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken 
dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.

				BLACK MAN
		   (to Sailor, smiling - showing 
		    no visible upper teeth)
		Pussycats gotta eat, too.

He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through 
the verifier.  The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a 
charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.

				BLACK MAN
			(to Erv)
		Id just soon have a paper bag 
		rather than a plastic one, if its
		same to you.

				ERV
		  (shoving the plastic bag he
		   filled towards the black man)
		We dont have no paper bags.

A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around.  The Black Man 
reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches 
send.

				BLACK MAN
			(into phone)
		Hello...  Yeah, mama, Im on my 
		way...
			(to Sailor and other guy
		   as he picks up his bag
			and heads out)
		Thanks for waitin, gentlemen.

Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.

				SAILOR
			(to Erv)
		All I wants ten bucks regular.
		Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.

Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays 
it on the counter.  Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.

				SAILOR
		I aint got my American Express card
		with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope

Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his 
change.  The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins.

		Muchas gracias.

Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their 
meal before saying anything more.

				REGGIE

				REGGIE
		Only if necessary, of course, and

				REGGIE
		United States Marine issue, before

the floor beneath his chair.

				JOHNNIE
		Why are you in New Orleans?  If you

				REGGIE
		Certainly not.  We are here only

				DROP SHADOW

Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.

		Its been a real pleasure.  I wish

Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnies hand.

				REGGIE
		The same to you.  If you are in

		If a liberal, a socialist, and a

				LULA
		Why were you killin pigeons, Mr.
		Kovich?  Were you in the extermination

				GEORGE
		No, maam.  I was a housepainter,

		retired now, livin with my sister, 
		Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five

		Hey!!!...  Johnnie Farragut.  How

				JOHNNIE
		Real good, Chet...  Its been awhile.

				CHET
		Everythins relative.  Wheres that

				JOHNNIE
		No...  Shes fine.  Back home.

				CHET
		Whatll it be?  The regular?  Black

				JOHNNIE
		Set one up.

Chet brings him a double.

				CHET
		So who you out sleuthin for now?...
		Can I help ya?

				JOHNNIE
		Actually, Im lookin for Mariettas

				CHET
		Hell, that rings a bell.  Someone

				JOHNNIE
		Sounds right...  Ill check it out.

				CHET
		   (checking for a gold ring

		You hitched yet?

				JOHNNIE
		No sir...

				CHET
		Its none of my business, but when

				JOHNNIE
		Not for lack of love, I can tell

				CHET
		Thats what I mean...  Always looked

				JOHNNIE
		Ill tell ya though, its comin up

Lula waits just by the lobby door of the hotel.  In the back of the 
lobby in the shadows is an ancient, old BLACK MAN who stares at her.  
Sailor pulls the T-Bird up in front of the hotel and Lula hurries out to 
him and tosses their suitcase in the backseat.

				LULA
		Lets get outta here...  I suddenly
		got a funny feelin about this

				SAILOR

		Gotta hex from a voodoo?

		You do.

They laugh and take off around the corner and up past the Cafe Du Monde.

whistling.

94. INT. THUNDERBIRD

Lula and Sailor are motoring along.

				SAILOR
		Sweetheart, keep your panties up.
		Were in Jimmy Swaggart country.

Sailor and Lula both laugh.  Up ahead, Sailor spots a hitchhiker.  He 
slows to pick him up.

				LULA
		Sure you wanna do this?  Might be 
		a way they could track us.

				SAILOR
		Hes just a regular guyt needs help,
		honey.  Look at him.

The HITCHHIKER is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is 
carrying a large, covered cardboard box.  He is filthy, with an uneven 
smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth.  Lula opens the door for 
him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway.

				ROACH
		Thanks a lot.  I been standin out
		there off and on for two hours, ha-ha!
		Since noon about, ha-ha!  Cops catch
		ya hitchin on a Interstate around here
		they throw ya on a county road crew
		for a week, less you can pay the
		ticket, ha-ha!  Which I aint got, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		My names Sailor, and this heres
		Lula.  Whats yours?

				ROACH
		Marvin DeLoach.  But everbody calls
		me Roach, ha-ha!  Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!

				LULA
		You always make that strange little
		funny laugh when you talk?

				ROACH
		Aint laughin, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		What you got in the box?

				ROACH
		My dogs, ha-ha!

Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front.  
Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old.

				ROACH
		Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These
		dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!

				LULA
			(to Sailor)
		This guys crazy.

				SAILOR
		Where you from, Roach?

				ROACH
		If you mean where I was born, it was
		Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha!  But I
		been brought up in Baton Rouge.

				LULA
		Why you goin to Alaska?  And whered
		you get them puppies?  They look sick.

Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of 
them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick 
his dirty fingers.

				ROACH
		I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The
		Call of the Wild.  I aint never
		seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs
		at the pound.  Nobody wanted em, 
		ha-ha!  Everbody here got theirself
		pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  Im
		gonna feed these boys good so theyll
		be big and powerful and they can pull
		me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!

Roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his 
field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to 
the dogs.

				LULA
		  (screeches as she sees this)
		Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!

Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops.  
Lula opens her door and jumps out.

				LULA
		Im sorry, but I cant take this.  
		Roach, or whatever your name is, you
		come out of there with them dogs
		this instant!

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box 
of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on 
the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

				LULA
		Im truly sorry?  Im truly sorry, 
		Roach.  But aint gonna make it to
		Alaska?  Least not any part of the 
		way with us.  Youd best find a 
		party to take care of those dogs 
		proper, before they all die?  And, 
		if you dont mind my sayin so?  You
		could most certainly use some serious
		lookin after yourself, startin with
		a bath!

Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on.

				LULA
		Drive.

Sailor takes off.

				SAILOR
		You dont feel you was a little hard
		on the guy, honey?

				LULA
		I know youre thinkin that I got
		moren some of my mama in me?  Well,
		I couldnt help it.  Sailor, I really
		couldnt.  Im sorry for that guy,
		but when he pulled that drippin hunk
		of awful-smellin meat out of his
		pocket?  I near barfed.  And them

We see Reggie and Drop Shadow enter the bar.  Reggies unsmiling eyes 
drift across the room until they see Johnnie in the booth.  He stares 
coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks.

				JOHNNIE
		Really, Marietta, you got more

Johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth.  As he crosses the 
bar...

				REGGIE
			(shouting)
		Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again.  

Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands.

				JOHNNIE
		I thought you two were in Austin, 
		Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in
		these parts.

				DROP SHADOW
		We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and
		I are on our way back to Utila, in
		the morning.

				REGGIE
		Would you like to enjoy a martini 
		with us?

				JOHNNIE
		Why not?  How was the fishin?

				REGGIE
		I think they are too serious, these
		American fishermen.  In Honduras, we
		are not so concerned with the method.

Reggie orders martinis for the three of them.

				JOHNNIE
		So, its back to the islands.

				DROP SHADOW
		Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke 
		yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach
		San Pedro Sula, who is named after
		Cary Grant, and he told them there
		was a shooting.

				REGGIE
		Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local
		shrimp boat captains is in jail now.
		These people are friends of mine, so
		I must return and find out what 
		happened.

				JOHNNIE
		This island of yours sounds like a 
		kind of unpredictable place.  

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		It has its moments of uncertainty.

				DROP SHADOW
		But how are you finding New Orleans,
		Senor Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always
		been a good town to sit around in.


				REGGIE
		I can tell you are an intelligent
		man, Johnnie.  One difference between
		your country and mine is that in the
		islands, it does not pay to reveal
		ones intelligence...  Others may use

Reggie raises his glass to Johnnies.

				REGGIE
		Hasta siempre.

				JOHNNIE

				REGGIE
		Do you know how it came about that

				JOHNNIE

Johnnie finishes off his martini.

				JOHNNIE
		I gotta admit, you guys are

99. INT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR 
COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a 
long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.  
Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  
Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 
alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 
the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 
the arm.

				LULA
		Come on.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a 
tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird.  He holds his 
hand that way while he speaks...

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		This is a friendly place, son.  You 
		folks just relax and have a nice time.

				LULA
		   (bound and determined not 
		    to be intimidated)
		You got yourself a deal.

				BARTENDER
			(to Sailor)
		Thats a real jacket...  By that,
		I mean a real stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for

		individuality and my belief in
		personal freedom.

				BARTENDER
		Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo.


The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table 
near the door.

				LULA
		Ill be damned if Im leavin.  That
		band is too good?

				SAILOR
		Uh huh.

				LULA
		You notice that woman when we come

				SAILOR
		Yeah.

				LULA
		Well, she aint talked to nobody

		I could tell.  What you make of that?

				SAILOR
		Honey, we bein strangers here and 
		all, this is the kinda place we dont
		want to make nothin of nothin.

				LULA
		You think shes pretty?

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 
squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 
green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 
wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 
had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

				SAILOR
		I tend to like em with a little 
		more meat on the bones.  Face aint
		bad, though.

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

				SAILOR
		Whats wrong, sweetheart?  Somethin
		botherin you?

				LULA
		Mama.  I been thinkin about her.
		Shes probly worried to death by now.

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		Cant you read?

Sailor stands and leans against the hood of the car until Lula gets up

Upstairs in a private dining room, Mr. Reindeer is dining with TWELVE 
GUESTS in formal evening attire.  Behind him, a JAZZ TRIO and a 
STRIPTEASE ARTIST are hard at work.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and leans over 
very close to a beautiful WOMAN sitting to his left.

				MR. REINDEER
		Little Miss Muffet sat on a tuffet, 
		eating her curds and whey...  Along
		came a spider and sat down beside her,
		and extended his hand out to play.

With this, he reaches under the table between her legs.  She turns red 
and Mr. Reindeer laughs and lights a cigarette.

				MR. REINDEER
		Oh dear...  Another Miss Dull Cunt.

Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the 
room.  Reggie catches Mr. Reindeers eye and smiles.  Reggie reaches in 
his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches 
it - and puts it back in his pocket.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him 
over to the table.  He whispers something in Reggies ear - then gives 
him an envelope.

				MR. REINDEER
		When I gave you the silver dollar I
		forgot to give you the contents of
		this envelope.  They are to be 
		returned.  Show it just before the deed...

Reggie pockets the envelope - joins Drop Shadow - and as they are 
leaving the dining room, they join a woman, JUANA, who looks half-
Oriental, half-Cajun.  She wears a strange, short, yellowish-bleached 
blonde wig.

		Just some guys I met here...  I

Marietta continues to stare at Reggie, Drop Shadow, and Juana before

The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the 
lobby.

				DESK CLERK
		Im sorry...  But I have overlooked

He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads 
immediately.  We see the note.  

NOTE
Gone fishing with a friend - maybe
buffalo hunting.  Johnnie.


				MARIETTA
		Oh God!  What does that mean?

The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos.  He seems to know 
exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off 
the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta.

		Shhhhhh...

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is 
gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh 
tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning 
to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair 
leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front 
of his.

				JUANA
		Johnnie, you take a good look at me,
		baby, cause you gonna hafta watch

		pay attention fucka - otherwise we 
		hafta work it all night...  Too 
		much fun for us - you see what I 
		mean?  Now watch me how I touch a
		bottle and you count how many times.

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles 
sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the 
opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left 
bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and 
comes back and touches Johnnies face.

				JUANA
		You see, Johnnie.  I toucha number
		one bottle once, I toucha number two
		bottle once, and I touch your face.
		This is a game we love to play.  I
		get hot already...  Now you meet

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come 
around to face him.

				REGGIE
		Hey, Johnnie...  Reggie - you remember
		Reggie, dont ya?  Look what I caught.
			(to Juana)
		Im gettin hot too, mama.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down 
in front of Johnnies again.

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45 
Automatic.

				DROP SHADOW
		Thats a Marine issue.  It goes off
		somethin terrible - you wanna see?

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud click.

				JUANA
		You hear click?

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front 
of Johnnie.

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		Hell, its even worse than I

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot 
again.

		Okay, gimmee nother kiss, Reggie

face.

Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnies face - tears off tape and gag - 
then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular 
design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

				REGGIE
		I forgot to show you this.  The
		gentlemen that gave this to me said
		youd recognize it.  Said he wanted

		SECOND BOTTLE BFORE I TOUCH JOHNNIE

		No...  I touch Johnnie.

As her finger touches Johnnies face there is a loud CLICK.  Johnnie 
moans and closes his eyes.

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair.

				JUANA

We see a hole in the front of the barrel - BOOM!!!

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with 
clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side 
of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each 
other - theyve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the 
highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an 
overturned car.

				LULA

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm.

				GIRL
		OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE...
		ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

				GIRL
		Gotta find my wallet.
			(to Sailor)
		Dont you say one word of this to

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and 
Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

				GIRL
		WHERES MY HAIRBRUSH?...

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 
a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

				LULA
		I cant take this, Sailor.  Shes
		dyin right in front of our eyes...

				SAILOR
		Im afraid she is, baby.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her 
forehead.

				GIRL
			(wide-eyed now)
		Get my lipstick...
			(whisper)
		Its in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 
starts to cry.

				LULA
		She died right in front of me.  Whyd
		she have to go and do that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		Lets get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead 
down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 
gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 
around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  
Sailor starts the car and takes off.

125. EXT. REDS GARAGE - DAY

A tall, skinny man, RED, in his early thirties with wild, uncombed hair 
the color of pomegranate, walks out of the garage.

				SAILOR
		You Red?

				RED
			(with a smile)
		Well, I aint Blackie.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

				SAILOR
		Names Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at
		the drugstore thought you might have
		some work I could do.

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

				RED
		Things aint real hot right now.
		Rex, there though,
			(nodding toward a half-naked
			man burrowed under an 83 Buick)
		is about to relocate in about a week
		to San Angelo.  I might could use a
		man when he does...  You good with
		engines?

				SAILOR
		I aint no Enzo Ferrari, but they 
		used to call me Wrench when I was a
		kid.

				RED
		Well see how she goes then when
		Rex takes off.  Check back.

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of 
them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the 
other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

				SPARKY
		Hows it look?

				RED
		Reckon the heads cracked, like I
		thought.

				SPARKY
		Shit, thats what I was afraid of.

				RED
		Ill get you foreigners a beer.



				BUDDY
			(to Sailor)
		Im Buddy, and this heres Sparky.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake 
hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

				SAILOR
		My girl and I are lookin for a 
		place to settle.  Were bunked down
		at the Iguana Motel.

				SPARKY
		So are we.  Its the only motel in 
		Big Tuna.  Have you met Bobby Just
		Like The Country Peru yet?

				SAILOR
		No, we just got in a hour and a 
		half ago.

				BUDDY
		You will.  Hes the Mr. Fix-It at 
		the Iguana.  His truck broke down 
		here a couple of months ago.

				REX
		Escaped con.  Man got some serious
		prison tattoos.

				RED
		Everbody got a past.

				BUDDY
		Just some got more future in em
		than others.

				REX
		That aint no lie.

Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it, 
crushing it flat.

				SAILOR
		Been nice meetin yall.  Preciate
		the beer.  Ill be seein yall
		soon.

				BUDDY
		Very soon.

				SPARKY
		One thing about bein in Big Tuna:

		you see and who you dont.

127. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

In front of the door there is a large, damp spot on the rug where about 
a hundred and fifty flies are buzzing and landing.  Sailor sees this 
when he opens the door.  He steps across the large spot and finds Lula 
just waking up on the bed.

				LULA
		That you, Sail, honey?

				SAILOR
		The only one.

Lula opens her eyes and looks at him.

				LULA
		You find any work?

				SAILOR
		Maybe.  Met a guy named Red, owns a
		garage, could have some work in
		about a week.  Met a few hard luck
		boys whos stayin here.  Whats
		that smell?

				LULA
		I barfed.  Tried to make it to the

		it cleaned up.

				SAILOR
		You sick?

				LULA
		A little, I think...  Darlin?

				SAILOR
		Yeah?

				LULA
		Come sit by me.

Sailor goes over and sits on the bed.

				LULA
		I dont know that this is the right
		place for us.

Sailor strokes Lulas head.

				SAILOR
		It aint gonna be forever, peanut.

Lula closes her eyes.

129. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Sailor, Lula, Sparky, and Buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the 
motel sharing Sparkys fifth of Ezra Brooks.  An electric bug killer is 
working overtime.  Buddy is reading from a newspaper.

				BUDDY
		     (reading from paper)
		Robert Brenton, twenty-five, was 
		killed when his car went off the road
		on State Highway 118, according to the
		Department of Public Safety.  Brenton
		and two passengers, William Reese and
		Susan Day, were thrown from the 
		automobile, reports said.

Sailor looks at Lula.

				SAILOR
		Susan Day...

The assistant manager, TOMMY THOMPSON, speaks from the shadows behind 
the group.

				TOMMY
		Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck.  That
		stupid shit...  That fuckin Bob was
		so fuckin dumb...  He deserved to
		die...  That asshole.

They all look over at Tommy.

				BUDDY
		Hey, Tommy...  Whats goin on over
		there in number four where al them 
		bright lights are all the time?

				TOMMY
		Them are makin a pornographic movie...
		Texas style...  Why?  You wanna join in?

				SPARKY
		How do you get sixteen Haitians into
		a Dixie Cup?

				LULA
		How?

				SPARKY
		Tell em it floats.

				BUDDY
		Sparkys big on Florida jokes.

				SPARKY
		You need a active sense of humor to
		survive in the Big Tuna.

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

				BOBBY
		Hey, everybody.

				BUDDY
		Sailor, Lula, this heres the man 
		himself.  Bobby, this is Sailor
		and Lula, the most recent strandees,
		economic variety.

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Bobby Peru, just like the country.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

				BUDDY
		Accordin to Red and Rex, Bobbys
		the most excitin item to hit Big
		Tuna since the 86 cyclone sheared
		the roof off the high school.

				SPARKY
		Only in town two months and there 
		aint a young thing around dont 
		know how that cobra tattoo works, 
		right, Bob?

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish 
front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

				LULA
		You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

				BOBBY
		Im from all over.

				SAILOR
		    (noticing a USMC tattoo
		     on Bobbys right hand)
		You was in the Marines, huh?

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

				BOBBY
		Four years.

				SPARKY
		Bobby was at Cao Ben.

				LULA
		Whats Cao Ben?

				BOBBY
			(to Lula)
		How old are you?

				LULA
		Twenty.

				BUDDY
		Lotta women and kids and old people
		died at Cao Ben.

				BOBBY
		March, 1968.  We torched a village
		and the government made a big deal
		out of it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before 
reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they 
practically burn a hole in Buddy.

				BOBBY
			(to Buddy)
		You was on a ship, pardner.  Hard to
		make contact with the people when
		youre off floatin in the Gulf of
		Tonkin.

				SPARKY
		    (changing the subject)
		Hey Bobby, have yourself another 
		glass a Jack.

Sparky refills Bobbys shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

				BOBBY
		Dont mind if I fuckin do...  
		Speakin a Jack...  One-eyed Jacks
		yearnin to go a peepin in a
		seafood store...  Good meetin you.
		Adios, boys.

He walks out and after hes gone...

				LULA
		Somethin in that man scares me.

				BUDDY
		No shit.


				SPARKY
		  (pouring himself another shot)
		Bobbys got a way...  Cant shake
		that institution odor.

Lula puts a hand on Sailors leg.

				LULA
		Darlin, I still aint feelin so 
		well.  Im goin to bed.

				SAILOR

They say goodnight to Sparky and Buddy and head for their room.

Lula goes right to the bed and flops down on it.

				SAILOR
		Anything I can do for you?

				LULA
		No, I dont think so, Sail.  I
		just need to lie down.

Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and 
flush it.  Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed.

				LULA
		Sailor?  You know what?

				SAILOR
		I know you aint particularly pleased
		bein here.

				LULA
		Not that.  Look at what I wrote down

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads Im pregnant.  Sailor looks into 
her eyes.

				SAILOR
		Its okay by me, peanut.

				LULA
		Well, nothin personal, but I aint
		sure its okay by me.

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.


				LULA
		Really, Sailor, it aint nothin

				SAILOR
		Love you, too.

				LULA
		I know.  Just Im sorta uncomfortable

				BOBBY
		Say it...  Then Ill leave...  Whisper

Pee Wees steel guitar ripples through the cigarette haze and buzzes

136A. EXT. ROARITAS - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of 
the Eldorado.  He peels back a brown army blanket.

				BOBBY
		Thats a double-barreled, sawed-off,

		grip stock wrapped with adhesive tape.
		Next to its a cold Smith and Wesson
		.32 handgun with a six inch barrel.
		Thesell do er...  Loosen up that

stands at the top - watching.

				BOB RAY
		Hey Sailor...  Wait a minute...  I
		got somethin for ya.

As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her 
legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to 
Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in Sailors ear.

				BOB RAY
		Shit, man...  Marietta says you been 
		tryin to fuck her in the toilets 
		for the past ten minutes...  You
		crazy fuckin bad boy tryin to 
		fuck your girls mama...  How do
		you think that cute little cunt Lula
		would feel about that?  Hey, take a
		look at this...
			(shows Sailor one thousand
			dollars in cash)
		Marietta just gave me this to kill
		you right now, and afterward she
		said Lula was mine to fuck all the
		way into next Sunday.

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailors fist is already halfway through Bob 
Rays brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 
SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and 
doesnt stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead 
at the foot of the stairs.  The crowd of formally dressed onlookers 
stand aghast.  Sailor stares up at Marietta.  Both their eyes burning 
with hate.

139. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULAS ROOM - NIGHT

Sailor is dripping with sweat.  His teeth are clenched tight and his 
fists violently grip the sheets, as if any minute he could tear the bed 
apart.

								CUT TO:

140. INT. PERDITA DURANGOS HOUSE - NIGHT

Bobby lets the screen door bang shut behind him as he comes in and roams 
around the livingroom.

				PERDITA
		Nice of you to drop by.

				BOBBY
		Told ya I would.  You still riled?

				PERDITA
			(laughs)
		You still screwing sixteen-year-olds
		in the ass?

Bobby keeps circling.

				BOBBY
		Aint never had no girl pull a blade
		on me.

				PERDITA
		Wish Id fuckin cut you up good.

				BOBBY
		You heard from Reggie?

				PERDITA
		Juana called.  Theyre stayin 
		another week.

Bobby stops walking and stares at the photograph on the wall.

				BOBBY
		Stayin a few extra days in the big
		N.O., huh?  This you?

Perdita turns her head and looks, then turns back.

				PERDITA
		Yes.

We see the photo now.  In it are Perdita along with her sister, Juana, 
and her husband, Reggie, whom we recognize as the killers of Johnnie.

				BOBBY
		Dont look like you.

Bobby turns around and leans down and puts his face next to Perditas 
from behind.


				BOBBY
		The cobras waitin to strike, chica.

				PERDITA
		That guy Sailor came around this
		afternoon...  Asked me if there was
		a contract out on im.

				BOBBY
			(laughs out loud)
		No shit?!?!  You know him?

				PERDITA
		Used to.

				BOBBY
		Whatd you say?

				PERDITA
		No, of course.

Bobby takes out a silver dollar and flips it into the air.  It lands 
tails up in his hand.  He pockets it.

				BOBBY
		Thats right...  Could have a bad
		accident, though ... before ... 
		durin ... or after a hold-up...

				PERDITA
		Whats gonna happen when he sees me 
		drivin the car tomorrow?

				BOBBY
		Maybe hell get a little nervous,
		but who gives a shit?

Bobby lowers his hands into the front of Perditas blouse and cups her 
breasts.  She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette.  
Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perditas hair and pulls her over the couch 
onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby 
keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded 
wrist.  Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away.  She stand up 
and spits at him.

				BOBBY
			(grinning)
		I knew we could be friends again...

141. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small 
turquoise radio on the bedside table.  She is listening to a piece of 
sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the 
volume increases.

Lula remembers some moments in her life with Sailor: (Music continues 
over)

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to Slaughter House.

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.  
She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking 
through it at her.  The image puzzles her.

(The Music continues over)

142. EXT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

The big Eldorado pulls up in front of the Iguana Motel where Sailor has 
been waiting in the hot sun.  Bobby opens the door.

Sailor crawls in the back seat and sees Perdita just as she floors it 
and they take off in a cloud of dust.

				BOBBY
		Panty hose.  Work bettern stockins.
		Pull one of the legs down over your

			(hands him the .32)
		Remember, soon as we get inside, you

143. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Bobby slips the panty hose over his head and adjusts it.  His face looks 
crooked and distorted.

				BOBBY

		Come on!  Get that mask on!

Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head, 
stretching the calf part to fit.

Perdita pulls up in front of the store.  The street is deserted.

				BOBBY
		Keep it revved, Chiquita.  We wont

Bobby and Sailor enter the feed store.  Bobby raises his sawed-off 
shotgun and points it at the TWO OLD MEN behind the counter.

				BOBBY

Bobby and the two men head down the hall into the back room.

Suddenly, an Iguana County DEPUTY SHERIFF cruises up in a patrol car and 
parks it on angle in front of the idling Eldo.  The Deputy gets out of 
his car and walks over to the drivers side of the Eldorado.

				DEPUTY
		Waitin for somebody, Miss?

				PERDITA
		Mi esposo.  Hes in the feed store

				DEPUTY
		Youd best be careful of that cigarette,

Perdita stubs out her Marlboro in the ashtray.

146. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind 
the counter.  Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money.  Sailor 
is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby 
finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole 
through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock.

				SAILOR
		BOBBY!!!!  STOP IT, MAN!!!


CUT TO:

147. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Reacting to the shot, Perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels 
out, knocking the deputy down.

								CUT TO:

148. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around 
and points it at Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Youre next, fucker.

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.  
It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill 
Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second 
old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively 
spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the 
old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the 
front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.


148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped 
in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his 
second into Bobbys left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes 
Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobbys right 
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 
his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the 
RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand 
over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy 
orders him to stand up.

Lula is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of the Iguana County

sees Lula, Marietta runs over, sits down next to her and hugs and kisses 
her.

				MARIETTA
		Oh baby, I was beginnin to think 
		I was never gonna see you again.

Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and 
Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos.

				MARIETTA
		Youre comin home, precious.  Santos
		gonna drive us to the San Antonio
		airport.

				LULA
		Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here.
		I just cant leave him.

Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lulas 
eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are 
pale.

				MARIETTA
		Oh, yes, you can.

Santos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble.

				SANTOS
		Your mamas been real worried bout
		you, honey.  Me too...  Can you
		give your old friend Santos a hug,
		too?

Santos arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling 
scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree.  Santos grabs her hard - in a 
bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, 
orange, and silver.

				LULA
			(voice-over)

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing youll want to know is Im keeping the baby.
Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but I think shes looking
forward to it.  Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a 
boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it?  Its
kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old 
when you get out.

I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I dont know how much or what it 
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
youre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  Im going to move out as
soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time dont really fly honey does it?

Love,
your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor.

				SAILOR
			(voice-over)

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 
And Pace being your family name and all is just right.
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 
granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though
he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youre
gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.
Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

Six years later...  Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of 
ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is 
wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a 
Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an 
ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the 
livingroom as she talks on the phone.

				LULA
		Im goin, mama.  No way I cant go.

		Got any plans?

				LULA
		Figure well go have supper someplace.

				MARIETTA
		Well, you be careful with that boy,

				LULA
		Sailor aint a boy no more, mama.

				MARIETTA
		Dont mean him.  Its Pace concerns me.

		Really, mama, I gotta go.

		Wouldnt make any difference.

		What if I told you not to?

PACE ROSCOE FORTUNE is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a 
long-billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders.

				PACE
		Howll we know what he looks like?

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 
causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 
to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 
driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

				PACE
		Mama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 
she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 
window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 
is clamped in her teeth.

				LULA
		Dont give me no trouble now, Pace,
		please.  This aint the easiest day
		in a long time.  And what do you
		mean how are we gonna know what your

				PACE
		Howll he know what we look like?
		He seen our photo?

Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out 
of her mouth and drops it.

				LULA
		Damn it, child!  Now look what you
		made me do.

				PACE
		What I made you do, mama?

Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the 
cigarette.  Sirens can be heard up ahead.

				LULA
		Nothin, honey.

		Mamas just actin strange.

		You aint actin, mama.

				PACE

		Whyd you say that, Pace?

				PACE
		Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama

				LULA
		And?

				PACE
		Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.

				LULA
		Wrong, baby.  Your daddy never

Lula gets out and goes around for Pace.  They hold hands as they walk 
toward the station.  The big clock on the side of the building shows ten 
minutes past six.

				PACE
		Im scared, mama.

				LULA
		Why, honey?

				PACE
		Case daddy dont like me.  What if

		Still partial to Camels, huh?

Sailor smiles.

				SAILOR
		First pack of tailor-mades I had in

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with 
Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

				SAILOR
		You must be my son.

				LULA
		Shake hands with your daddy.

Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors.  Sailor grips it 
gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

				SAILOR
		Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read
		a lot about you.

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them 
loose.  Sailor tries to smile.

				LULA
		You hungry?  Pace and I aint had

Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car.

off the engine and gets out of the car.

				PACE
		Whats wrong, mama?

				SAILOR
		     (turning to Pace and 
			patting his head)
		Dont worry, son.  Just stay here.

Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the 
hood.

				LULA
		Im sorry, Sailor.  I just cant 
		help it.  Give me a minute and Ill

				SAILOR
		Boys frightened, Lula.  This aint

				LULA
		Really, Sail, Ill be okay.

				SAILOR
		Its a mistake, honey.  You two go on.
		Ill walk back to the depot.

				LULA
		Whatre you talkin about?  Thats 
		your son in there.

				SAILOR
		He aint never known me, Lula, so

		Not seein each other for six years
		makes it next best to simple for us, too.

				LULA
		How can you say that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		What makes sense, is all.

Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys 
out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and 
closes the lid.

				LULA
		Dont do this, Sailor, please.

Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the 
car.

				SAILOR

		Oiga, amigo.  If ever somethin

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks 
down her face.

ECU of Lulas eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and 
down her cheeks as in Sailors dream.

				SAILOR
		You been doin fine without me, peanut.

Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER 
TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around 
him, coming in closer for the kill.

				SAILOR
		What do you faggots want?

Thats all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend 
himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood 
begins to pour from his swelling nose.


162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor Ripley...

Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  
His mouth speaks through closed lips.

				SAILOR
		The Good Witch...

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor...  Lula loves you.

				SAILOR
		But Im a robber and a manslaughterer
		and I havent had any parental 
		guidance.

				GOOD WITCH
		Shes forgiven you of all these things
		...  You love her...  Dont be

				SAILOR
		But Im wild at heart.

				GOOD WITCH
		If you are truly wild at heart, youll
		fight for your dreams...  Dont turn
		away from love, Sailor...  Dont turn
		away from love...  Dont turn away
		from love.

The Good Witch disappears.


162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on 
his feet.  The gang still stands around him.

				GANG MEMBER
		You had enough, asshole?

		Yes, I have...  And I wanna apologize

Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME.

He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he 
jumps on the hood of Lulas car.

She sees him.

				SAILOR
		LULA!!!!

				LULA
		SAILOR!!!!

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a 
giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes 
away.  Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 
but now she knows what it is.  It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking 
up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love 
Me Tender. 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.

The sign reads KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS.

3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed 
bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half 
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like 
the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll 
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass 
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of 
blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing 
howl for one entire city block.

4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY

Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others

				OLD MAN
		Who the hell knows.  What you have

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

				OLD MAN 
		Spit it out!!! ... Pull your teeth

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a

SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins, 
bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself 
shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the 
nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the 
kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

A beat-up, red 64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane

Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas 
while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH 
BOYS.  The group segues smoothly from Elmore Jamess Dust my Broom 
into Robert Johnsons Me and the Devil and Beany lets out a snort.

				BEANY
		I can dig this music...  But not 
		that singer.

				LULA
		Why?...  Hes right in the groove.

				BEANY
		Hes so ugly.  Guys with beards and

				LULA

		Seeins how youre about as thick as

				BEANY
		Yeah, well, if he says that all that

		hes a liar.

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

				BEANY
		So, Sailors gettin out soon, and
		youre gonna see him?

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

				LULA
		Meetin him at the gate.  That phone
		call this afternoon was the signal.
		My deranged mamas hid the keys to
		my car.  But of course, I know 
		exactly where they are.

				BEANY
		I didnt hate me so much, Id feel

				LULA
		Cant all husbands be perfect, and

				BEANY
		So youre gonna be needin the

Sailor and Lula lay on the bed in the Cape Fear Hotel listening to the

				LULA
		Did you ever think somethin like

		comin flyin in?...  Did you ever
		think somethin and then later think
		youve said it out loud to someone?

				SAILOR
		I really did miss your mind while I
		was out at Pee Dee, honey.  The
		rest of you, too, of course.  But 
		the way your head works is Gods own
		private mystery.  What was it you
		was thinkin?

				LULA
		Well, I was thinkin about smokin 
		actually...  My mama smokes Marlboros
		now, used to be she smoked Kools?
		I stole em from her beginnin in
		about sixth grade.  When I got old
		enough to buy my own, I bought those.
		Now Ive just about settled on Mores,
		as you probably noticed?  Theyre longer.


				SAILOR
		I guess I started smokin when I was
		about six...  My mama was already
		dead from lung cancer...

				LULA
		What brandd she smoke?

				SAILOR
		Camels, same as me...  Guess both
		my mama and my daddy died of smoke
		or alcohol related illness.

				LULA
		Gee, Sailor.  Im sorry, honey.  I 
		never would have guessed it.

				SAILOR
		Its okay.  I hardly used to see 
		them anyway.  I didnt have much 
		parental guiding.  The public defender
		kept sayin that at my parole hearin.
		He was a good ol boy, stood by me...
		Even brought me some cartons of 
		cigarettes from time to time.

				LULA
		Id stand by you, Sailor ... through
		anything.

				SAILOR
		Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after
		I planted Bob Ray Lemon.  A man cant
		ask for more than that.

Lula pulls Sailor over to her and kisses him soft on the mouth.

				LULA
		You move me, Sailor, you really do.
		You mark me the deepest.

Sailor pulls down the sheet, exposing Lulas breasts.

				SAILOR
		Youre perfect for me, too.

				LULA
		You remind me of my daddy, you know?
		Mama told me he liked skinny women
		whose breasts were just a bit too
		big for their bodies.  He had a long
		nose, too, like theirs.  Did I ever
		tell you how he died?

				SAILOR
		In a fire, as I recall.

				LULA
		Started he couldnt remember things?
		Got real violent?  Mama kept tellin
		me it was on account of lead poisoning
		from cleanin the old paint off our
		house without usin a mask...  But
		I dont know.  Seems like his brain
		just fell apart in pieces.

Sailor takes the cigarette out of Lulas hand and puts it into the

		I knew this would happen.  Soon as

		Hes just got some kind of influence
		over her I cant decipher.  Theres 
		somethin wild in Lula I dont know
		where it comes from.  You gotta find

				JOHNNIE
		He served his time for what he did.
		Another thing...  If Lula went with
		him of her own volition - willingly,
		that is - there aint much can be
		done about it.

				MARIETTA
		Dont talk down to me, Johnnie 
		Farragut.  I know what volition means,
		and thats why I want Sailor Ripley
		off the planet!  Hes pure slime and 
		its leakin all over my baby.  
		Maybe you could push him into makin
		some kinda move and then kill him
		dead.  Youd only be defendin 
		yourself, and with his record,

Johnnie pours himself another tumblerful of Walker Black Label.

				JOHNNIE
		Ill locate Lula, Marietta, and if
		shes with the Ripley boy, Ill
		give him a talkin to and try to
		convince her to come back with me.
		Thats about all I can do.

He takes a long swallow from the tumbler.  Marietta begins to cry.  She 
blubbers for a few seconds, and then stops as abruptly as shed started.  
Her grey eyes glaze over.

				MARIETTA
		Ill hire a hit man if you dont want

				JOHNNIE
		Now, Marietta, I am goin to help you.
		And dont be gettin carried away.
		You dont want to be bringin Santos
		and his people into it.

				MARIETTA
		Youre just jealous of Santos cause

				JOHNNIE
		Darlin, you aint seein Santos

				MARIETTA
		Oh, Johnnie Farragut...  Dont you

				JOHNNIE
		Sorry, sweetheart.  Bein in love

		ugly jealous side.

				MARIETTA
		Well stop worryin about me and 
		start worryin about how youre 
		gonna get that Lula back here and 
		away from that murderer.

				JOHNNIE
		Sailor aint a murderer.  You got to
		get off that kick.  And fars I can 
		tell, Sailor was entire clean prior
		to that involvin Lula.  Even there
		he was protectin her.  You oughta

		Ray Lemon they say was comin after

Lula is standing in the bathroom of their room at the Hotel fooling with 
her hair in front of the mirror.  Sailor can see her through the doorway 
from where he lays on the bed.

				LULA
		Sailor, you are somethin else, 
		honey...  When I was fifteen, Mama
		told me that pretty soon Id be
		startin to think about sex, and
		I should talk to her before I did
		anything about it.

				SAILOR
		But honey, I thought you told me
		your Uncle Pooch raped you when
		you was thirteen.

				LULA
		Thats true.  Uncle Pooch wasnt
		really an uncle.  He was a business
		partner of my daddys?  And my mama
		never knew nothin about me and 
		him - thats for damn sure.  His real
		name was somethin kind of European,
		like Pucinski.  But everyone just
		called him Pooch.  He came around the
		house sometimes when Daddy was away.
		I always figured he was sweet on 
		mama, so when he cornered me one 
		afternoon, I was surprised moren
		a little.

				SAILOR
		Howd it happen, peanut?  He just
		pull out the old toad and let it
		croak?

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the 
pack on the sink and lights it, then lets it dangle from her lips while 
she teases her hair.

				LULA
		Youre terrible crude sometimes, 
		Sailor, you know?

				SAILOR
		I cant hardly understand you when
		you talk with one of them Mores in
		your mouth.

Lula takes a long, slow drag on her More and sets it down on the edge of 
the sink.

				LULA
		I said you can be too crude sometimes?
		I dont think I care for it.

				SAILOR
		Sorry, sugar.  Go on and tell me how
		old Pooch done the deed.

Lula flushes the toilet and watches the More come apart as it swirls

				SAILOR
		We did it?  Whattaya mean?  Didnt

				LULA
		Well, sure.  But he was super-gentle,
		you know?  I mean, he raped me and
		all, but I guess theres all 
		different kinds of rapes.  I didnt
		exactly want him to do it but I 
		suppose once it started, it didnt
		seem all that terrible.  It was over 
		pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch
		just stood there and pulled up his
		trousers and left me there.  I 
		stayed in bed till I heard him drive
		off.  Then I just went back into
		the kitchen and finished makin my
		sandwich.

				SAILOR
		And you never told nobody about it?

				LULA
		Just you.  Uncle Pooch never acted
		strange or different after.  And he

		And another thing, baby...  That

				SAILOR
		Here she goes again...

				LULA
		Sailor, that ozone layer is

Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette.

				SAILOR
			(laughs)
		That aint never will happen, honey.
		Least not in our lifetime.

Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs.  It is a kind of wild, crazy 
laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lulas face goes pale.

				SAILOR
		You okay, honey?

				LULA
		That womans laugh creeps me out.
		I heard somethin like that...
		somewhere before...  Soundd like

		Just sounded like an old gal havin

				LULA
		Im always ready to dance.  But I

		Have it your way...  But you want it.

		What do you want me to do about it?

				MARIETTA
		I want you to take care of Sailor, so

		baby again.


				SANTOS
		Take care of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		What does take care of him mean?...
		Do you want me to give him food or
		some clothing?

				MARIETTA
		Whats with you?...  You know what
		take care of him means.  I dont 
		call Santos except for one big reason.

				SANTOS
		Big is the key word, and Im telling
		you I want it bad.

				MARIETTA
		I want you to get rid of Sailor.

				SANTOS
		Get rid of him?

				MARIETTA
		Yes...  Get rid of him.

				SANTOS
		How would I do that?  Send him on a
		trip - like maybe to Hawaii?

				MARIETTA
		Santos, why in hell do you insist on
		playin this stupid game?

				SANTOS
		Just tell me what you want.

				MARIETTA
		I dont need to explain anymoren I
		have...  You know damn well.

				SANTOS
		You need to explain it.

				MARIETTA
		All right...  I want you ... to ...
		kill ... Sailor...  As simple as that.

				SANTOS
		Simple?  Kill him?...  How?

				MARIETTA
		Thats your business...  I dont care
		how.

				SANTOS
		Like an accident where maybe Lula
		might also get hurt?

				MARIETTA
		NO...  For Gods sakes, Santos!

				SANTOS
		Well, like kill him with the atomic
		bomb?

				MARIETTA
		Santos...

				SANTOS
		Explain it...  I told you.

				MARIETTA
		Shoot him.

				SANTOS
		Shoot him?  Like with a gun?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Where?...  In the leg?

				MARIETTA
		No.

				SANTOS
		Where?

				MARIETTA
		In the head.

				SANTOS
		Shoot Sailor in the head with a 
		gun...  Now Im beginning to get 
		it...  You want me to shoot Sailor
		in the head with a gun.

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		But where in the head?...  Not the
		chin, I hope.

				MARIETTA
		No...  In the brains...  What little
		Im sure he has.

				SANTOS
		You want me to shoot Sailor in the
		brains with a gun.  

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Through the forehead?

				MARIETTA
		Yes.

				SANTOS
		Wrong!  Its much better to blow a
		hole in the back of the head ... 
		right toward the bridge of the nose
		...  Lots and lots of irreparable
		damage.

				MARIETTA
		See!  I knew you had it all under 
		control.

				SANTOS
		Why didnt you send Johnnie Farragut?

				MARIETTA
		Maybe I did...  Try New Orleans first...
		Lula cant ever stop talkin bout that
		town.

				SANTOS
		On one condition...

He pauses and smiles strangely.

				SANTOS
		You give me your permission to kill
		Johnnie Farragut.

				MARIETTA
			(whisper)
		Santos...  No...  Please, Santos...

				SANTOS
		Youre not tellin me that youre 
		sweet on him?

				MARIETTA
		No...  But...

				SANTOS
		One day hes gonna find out what 
		were up to with Mr. Reindeer, and
		he could cause us a lot of trouble.

They stare at each other for a moment.

				SANTOS
		Im gonna take your silence as a 
		yes...

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  I cant...


				SANTOS
		Shhhh...  Its all right...  Also, I
		either take you or that pretty 
		daughter of yours to bed.

				MARIETTA
		You fucker, dont you ever touch 
		Lula -  You fucker, Ill kill you.

				SANTOS
			(laughing)
		Put your shoulders back.

				MARIETTA
		What?

				SANTOS
		Put your shoulders back, I said.

Marietta puts her shoulders back and Santos comes and stands in front of 
her.

				SANTOS
		You got nice tits.

				MARIETTA
		Someones gonna see us.

				SANTOS
			(smiling as he starts
			to feel her breasts)
		Thats just another part of the price
		to pay.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  You kill that Sailor, 
		otherwise hes gonna turn my baby
		against me.

Santos lifts one hand up to Mariettas chin and raises her face up 
towards his.

				SANTOS
		Look at me...  Theres no turning back

		Thats for sure.

The BAND segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one.  Sailor grabs 
Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical 
storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula.  
They thought theyd seen everything.

CU of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK 
moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor 
turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music 
immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the 
man a fully extended Reno point...

				SAILOR
		Are you going to provide me with an 
		opportunity to prove my love to my
		girl?  Or are you gonna save 
		youself some trouble and step up 
		like a gentleman and apologize to her?

				IDIOT PUNK
		Dont fuck with me, man.  You look 
		like a clown in that stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me its a symbol of my individuality
		and my belief in personal freedom.

				IDIOT PUNK
		...Asshole.

				SAILOR
		(as he moves toward the Idiot Punk)
		Come here.

				LULA
		Sailor, honey...

The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his 
knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back 
tears and holding his cheek.

				SAILOR
		     (helping him up)
		Im sorry to do this to ya here 
		in front of a crowd, but I want ya
		to stand up and make a nice apology
		to my girl.

				IDIOT PUNK
			(to Lula)
		Im sorry.

				LULA
		Hell, you just rubbed up against 
		the wrong girl is all.

				SAILOR
		Thats good...  Now go get yourself

		You fellas have alotta the same power
		Elvis had...  Yall know this one?...

Sailor starts to sing an Elvis Presley song, Love Me.  As the band 
joins in with a perfect back-up - Sailor sings to Lula.  The Speed Metal

Sailor turns around from his sprawled on the bed position watching The

Lula slides her head up and kisses Sailor on the cheek.

She takes out a cigarette the length and width of a Dixon Ticonderoga 
No. 2 pencil and lights it.

				SAILOR
		Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?

				LULA
		Yeah, its a real problem for me, 
		Sailor, you know?  When I went in
		that drugstore by the restaurant in
		Biloxi?  I saw em by the register
		and the girl throw em in.  Im
		not big on resistin.  So what about
		a leech?

				SAILOR
		Heard on the radio how doctors is
		usin leeches again, just in old
		times.  You know, when even barbers
		used em?

				LULA
			(shuddering)
		I got one on me at Lake Lanier.  
		Lifeguard poured salt on it and it
		dropped off.  Felt awful.  He was a
		cute boy, though, so it was almost
		worth it.

Sailor laughs.

				SAILOR
		Yeah, well listen to this...  Radio
		said back in the 1920s a I-talian 
		doctor figured out that if, say, a
		fella got his nose cut off or bit
		off in, say, a barfight or somethin,
		theyd sew one of his forearms to his
		nose for a few weeks...  Then put
		leeches on it.

				SAILOR
			(nodding)
		How they used to do it.  Course they
		got more sophisticated ways now.
		Radio said the Chinese, I think it
		is, figured a better idea is by
		insertin a balloon in the forehead
		and lettin it hand down on the nose.

Lula shrieks.

				LULA
		Sailor Ripley!  You stop!  Youre

		Honest, Lula.  I probly aint

		Honey, were goin to bed now and

73. INT. THUNDERBIRD - SOUTHERN HIGHWAY - DAY

Sailor and Lula pass a sign that reads NEW ORLEANS - 26 MILES.  Sailor 
pulls off the road into a Gulf gas station mini-mart and stops the car 
next to a self-serve pump.  A sign on the top of it says PLEASE PAY 
INSIDE BEFORE FUELING.

				SAILOR
		Were about dry bones, sweetheart.
		We dont wanna have to push this

		We sure dont, honey...

		Get me a Mounds?


74. INT. MINI-MART - DAY

A tall OLD BLACK MAN about seventy years old, wearing a torn green 
Tulane tee-shirt and a dirty orange Saints baseball cap, is filing items 
on the counter by the cash register.  In the pile are four ready-made, 
plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six 
Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice 
colas; two Barqs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds, 
extra salted.

				BLACK MAN
		    (to Sailor and another guy 
		    also waiting to pay for gas)
		Sorry, gentlemen.  Im most finished
		on my shoppin here.

				ERV
		This be it?

				BLACK MAN
		Yall take American Express?

				ERV
		Yessir.

				BLACK MAN
		Then lemme throw in a couple more
		things.

Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up 
several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a 
dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken 
dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.

				BLACK MAN
		   (to Sailor, smiling - showing 
		    no visible upper teeth)
		Pussycats gotta eat, too.

He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through 
the verifier.  The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a 
charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.

				BLACK MAN
			(to Erv)
		Id just soon have a paper bag 
		rather than a plastic one, if its
		same to you.

				ERV
		  (shoving the plastic bag he
		   filled towards the black man)
		We dont have no paper bags.

A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around.  The Black Man 
reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches 
send.

				BLACK MAN
			(into phone)
		Hello...  Yeah, mama, Im on my 
		way...
			(to Sailor and other guy
		   as he picks up his bag
			and heads out)
		Thanks for waitin, gentlemen.

Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.

				SAILOR
			(to Erv)
		All I wants ten bucks regular.
		Oh yeah, and a Mounds bar.

Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays 
it on the counter.  Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.

				SAILOR
		I aint got my American Express card
		with me, so I gotta use cash.  Hope
		thats okay.

Sailor smiles, but the clerk keeps a poker face and just gives him his 
change.  The guy in line behind Sailor shakes his head and grins.


75. EXT. MINI MART/THUNDERBIRD - DAY

Sailor goes back to the car.

				LULA
		That took long enough.  You forget
		my Mounds?

Sailor tosses her the candy bar.

				SAILOR
		I really do think the country done
		changed just a little while I was
		away, peanut.

Lula sinks her small white teeth into the chocolate-covered coconut.

				LULA
			(as she chews)
		You got to keep an eye on it.  Thats
		sure.

Sailor starts pumping gas.

At a table near the window, Johnnie takes a man-sized pull off his Dixie 
beer in between bites of an oyster sandwich.  A large, chocolate-colored 
man in his early thirties, REGINALD SAN PEDRO SULA, and a smaller white 
man, DROP SHADOW approach with their trays of food.

				REGGIE
		Do you mind if we share this table?
		...  The others, they are occupied.

Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he 
looks the men over quickly.

				JOHNNIE
			(cautiously)
		Alright...  By all means.  Make 
		yourselves at home.

				DROP SHADOW
			(as he sits down)
		Muchas gracias.

				REGGIE
		My name is Reginald San Pedro Sula.
		But please do call me Reggie.  This
		is my friend, who we call Drop
		Shadow.  He is always with me.

Johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes.

				JOHNNIE
		Johnnie Farragut.  Pleased to meet ya.

Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their 
meal before saying anything more.

				REGGIE
		You are from New Orleans, Senor 
		Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Johnnie, please.  Nope.  Charlotte,
		North Carolina.  Here on business.

Reggie smiles broadly, revealing numerous tall, gold teeth.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is from Honduras.

				REGGIE
		Do you know Honduras, Johnny?

				JOHNNIE
		Only that its supposed to be a 
		pretty poor sight since the hurricane
		came through last year.

				REGGIE
		Yes, thats so.  But there is not 
		much to destroy.

				DROP SHADOW
		No big buildings like in New Orleans.

				JOHNNIE
		Whattaya do there?

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		Oh, many things...

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas got an appliance
		shop.

				REGGIE
		But I am also with the government.

Johnnie takes a bite of his oyster sandwich.

				JOHNNIE
		In what capacity?

				REGGIE
		In many capacities.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is with the 
		Secret Service.

Reggie reaches into his back pocket and takes out his wallet.  He hands 
a card to Johnnie.

				JOHNNIE
			(reading aloud)
		General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez.
		Telefono 666.

				REGGIE
		He is my sponsor.  The General is
		the head of the secret police of
		Honduras.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sula is one of his
		operatives.

Johnnie hands the card back to Reggie and Reggie gives him a small piece 
of paper, folded once.  Johnnie unfolds it.  The printing is in Spanish.

				REGGIE
		That is my permiso.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas permit to kill.

				REGGIE
		Only if necessary, of course, and
		only in my own country.
			(laughs)

				JOHNNIE
		Of course.

Johnnie refolds the piece of paper and hands it over to Reggie.

				DROP SHADOW
		Mr. San Pedro Sulas authorized to
		carry a .45.

				REGGIE
		United States Marine issue, before
		they made the unfortunate switch to
		the less dependable nine millimeters.
		I have it here, in my briefcase.

Reggie holds up his stainless steel briefcase and then replaces it on 
the floor beneath his chair.

				JOHNNIE
		Why are you in New Orleans?  If you 
		dont mind my askin.

				REGGIE
		Certainly not.  We are here only
		briefly, in fact, until this evening,
		when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit
		a friend of mine who is an agent for
		the CIA.

				DROP SHADOW
		He wants to take Mr. San Pedro Sula
		and me bass fishing.

				REGGIE
		We are in the same businesses and
		also we are fishermen.

Johnnie swallows the last of his beer and stands up to leave.

				JOHNNIE
			(extending his hand)
		Its been a real pleasure.  I wish
		you both buena suerte wherever you go.

Reggie and Drop Shadow stand up.  They shake Johnnies hand.

				REGGIE
		The same to you.  If you are in 
		Honduras, come to the Bay Islands and
		visit us.  The Hondurans are great
		friends of the American people.  But
		I have a joke for you before I go.
		If a liberal, a socialist, and a 
		communist all jumped off the roof of
		the Empire State Building at the 
		same time, which one of them would
		hit the ground first?

				JOHNNIE
		I couldnt say, which one?

Reggie turns to Drop Shadow and lets him have the punch line.

		Dont know that I have...  Should I

				GEORGE
		Was in all the papers three years ago.
		Im seventy-six, was only seventy-
		three then.  Had a business in
		Buffalo, New York, called Rats With
		Wings.  Killed pigeons for anyone
		who wanted em killed.

				LULA
		Why were you killin pigeons, Mr.
		Kovich?  Were you in the extermination
		business?

				GEORGE
		No, maam.  I was a housepainter, 
		in the union forty-one years.  Im
		retired now, livin with my sister, 
		Ida.  Ida moved down here twenty-five
		years ago, married an oil man named
		Smoltz, Ed Smoltz.  Hes dead now,
		so its just me and Ida.  I sold my
		house and moved down after the city
		of Buffalo put me out of business.
		Hell, RWW was doin them a service,
		and they charged me with endangerin
		the public.

				GEORGE
		Woman drivin down the street spotted

		the pigeons, the damage they do to
		personal property.  I used to complain
		to the city but they never lifted
		a finger.  I was gonna put out poison,
		but I was afraid somebodys cat 
		would eat it.  Hell, I had six cats
		myself.  So I used the .22 because
		it didnt make much noise and the
		ammo was cheap.

				SAILOR
		What happened on the charges?

				GEORGE
		Guilty on a reduced charge.  Hundred

		Pigeons carry diseases and muss up

Kovich stands up and puts some money on the counter.

		Its a serious situation.  Not like

		Since noon about, ha-ha!  Cops catch
		ya hitchin on a Interstate around here
		they throw ya on a county road crew
		for a week, less you can pay the
		ticket, ha-ha!  Which I aint got, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		My names Sailor, and this heres
		Lula.  Whats yours?

				ROACH
		Marvin DeLoach.  But everbody calls
		me Roach, ha-ha!  Roach DeLoach, ha-ha!

				LULA
		You always make that strange little
		funny laugh when you talk?

				ROACH
		Aint laughin, ha-ha!

				SAILOR
		What you got in the box?

				ROACH
		My dogs, ha-ha!

Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front.  
Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old.

				ROACH
		Im headed to Alaska, ha-ha!  These
		dogs is gonna be my sled team, ha-ha!

				LULA
			(to Sailor)
		This guys crazy.

				SAILOR
		Where you from, Roach?

				ROACH
		If you mean where I was born, it was
		Belzoni, Missippi, ha-ha!  But I
		been brought up in Baton Rouge.

				LULA
		Why you goin to Alaska?  And whered
		you get them puppies?  They look sick.

Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of 
them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick 
his dirty fingers.

				ROACH
		I saw this movie on TV, ha-ha!  The
		Call of the Wild.  I aint never
		seen snow, ha-ha!  I got these dogs
		at the pound.  Nobody wanted em, 
		ha-ha!  Everbody here got theirself
		pit bulls or some kinda hounds.  Im
		gonna feed these boys good so theyll
		be big and powerful and they can pull
		me real fast through the snow, ha-ha!

Roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his 
field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to 
the dogs.

				LULA
		  (screeches as she sees this)
		Sailor!  Stop!  Stop the car now!

Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops.  
Lula opens her door and jumps out.

				LULA
		Im sorry, but I cant take this.  
		Roach, or whatever your name is, you
		come out of there with them dogs
		this instant!

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box 
of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on 
the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

				LULA
		Im truly sorry?  Im truly sorry, 
		Roach.  But aint gonna make it to
		Alaska?  Least not any part of the 
		way with us.  Youd best find a 
		party to take care of those dogs 
		proper, before they all die?  And, 
		if you dont mind my sayin so?  You
		could most certainly use some serious
		lookin after yourself, startin with
		a bath!

Lula takes a pair of sunglasses off the dashboard and puts them on.

				LULA
		Drive.

Sailor takes off.

				SAILOR
		You dont feel you was a little hard
		on the guy, honey?

				LULA
		I know youre thinkin that I got
		moren some of my mama in me?  Well,
		I couldnt help it.  Sailor, I really
		couldnt.  Im sorry for that guy,
		but when he pulled that drippin hunk
		of awful-smellin meat out of his
		pocket?  I near barfed.  And them 
		poor diseased puppies!

				SAILOR
			(laughs)
		Just part of life on the road, peanut.

				LULA
		Do me a favor, Sailor?  Dont pick up
		no more hitchers, okay?

		No, Marietta, I havent found em.

		You better get a move on, Johnnie,

We see Reggie and Drop Shadow enter the bar.  Reggies unsmiling eyes 
drift across the room until they see Johnnie in the booth.  He stares 
coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks.

				JOHNNIE
		Really, Marietta, you got more

		I will, Marietta.  Goodbye now.

Johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth.  As he crosses the 
bar...

				REGGIE
			(shouting)
		Hola!  Senor Farragut!  We meet again.  

Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands.

				JOHNNIE
		I thought you two were in Austin, 
		Texas.  Or Takes-us, as they say in
		these parts.

				DROP SHADOW
		We were.  Now Mr. San Pedro Sula and
		I are on our way back to Utila, in
		the morning.

				REGGIE
		Would you like to enjoy a martini 
		with us?

				JOHNNIE
		Why not?  How was the fishin?

				REGGIE
		I think they are too serious, these
		American fishermen.  In Honduras, we
		are not so concerned with the method.

Reggie orders martinis for the three of them.

				JOHNNIE
		So, its back to the islands.

				DROP SHADOW
		Yes.  Mr. San Pedro Sula spoke 
		yesterday to his son, Archibald Leach
		San Pedro Sula, who is named after
		Cary Grant, and he told them there
		was a shooting.

				REGGIE
		Teddy Roosevelt, one of the local
		shrimp boat captains is in jail now.
		These people are friends of mine, so
		I must return and find out what 
		happened.

				JOHNNIE
		This island of yours sounds like a 
		kind of unpredictable place.  

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		It has its moments of uncertainty.

				DROP SHADOW
		But how are you finding New Orleans,
		Senor Farragut?

				JOHNNIE
		Call me Johnnie...  N.O. has always
		been a good town to sit around in.


				REGGIE
		I can tell you are an intelligent
		man, Johnnie.  One difference between
		your country and mine is that in the
		islands, it does not pay to reveal
		ones intelligence...  Others may use
		what they perceive against us...

Reggie raises his glass to Johnnies.

				REGGIE
		Hasta siempre.

				JOHNNIE
		Hasta siempre.

				REGGIE
		Do you know how it came about that
		copper wire was invented in Scotland?

				JOHNNIE
		Hows that?

				DROP SHADOW
		Two Scotsmen were fighting over a

Johnnie finishes off his martini.

				JOHNNIE
		I gotta admit, you guys are

Sailor spots a Red Devil gas station that still has its lights on and 
pulls the car over.

99. INT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR 
COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a 
long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.  
Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.  
Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting 
alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from 
the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by 
the arm.

				LULA
		Come on.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a 
tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird.  He holds his 
hand that way while he speaks...

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		This is a friendly place, son.  You 
		folks just relax and have a nice time.

				LULA
		   (bound and determined not 
		    to be intimidated)
		You got yourself a deal.

				BARTENDER
			(to Sailor)
		Thats a real jacket...  By that,
		I mean a real stupid jacket.

				SAILOR
		This is a snakeskin jacket, and for
		me it represents a symbol of my 
		individuality and my belief in
		personal freedom.

				BARTENDER
		Fuckin honky cracker mumbo jumbo.


The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table 
near the door.

				LULA
		Ill be damned if Im leavin.  That
		band is too good?

				SAILOR
		Uh huh.

				LULA
		You notice that woman when we come
		in?  The white woman sittin by 
		herself?

				SAILOR
		Yeah.

				LULA
		Well, she aint talked to nobody 
		and aint nobody spoke to her that
		I could tell.  What you make of that?

				SAILOR
		Honey, we bein strangers here and 
		all, this is the kinda place we dont
		want to make nothin of nothin.

				LULA
		You think shes pretty?

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then 
squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.  
Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin, 
green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is 
wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts 
had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

				SAILOR
		I tend to like em with a little 
		more meat on the bones.  Face aint
		bad, though.

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

				SAILOR
		Whats wrong, sweetheart?  Somethin
		botherin you?

				LULA
		Mama.  I been thinkin about her.
		Shes probly worried to death by now.

				SAILOR
		Moren likely.

				LULA
		I want to call her and tell her
		Im okay.  That were okay.

				SAILOR
		I aint so sure its a great idea,
		but thats up to you.  Just dont tell

				LULA
			(to Bartender)
		Pardon me?  Yall got a phone here 
		I can use?

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR
		Cant you read?

Sailor stands and leans against the hood of the car until Lula gets up

				MR. REINDEER
		Oh dear...  Another Miss Dull Cunt.

Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the 
room.  Reggie catches Mr. Reindeers eye and smiles.  Reggie reaches in 
his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches 
it - and puts it back in his pocket.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him 
over to the table.  He whispers something in Reggies ear - then gives 
him an envelope.

				MR. REINDEER
		When I gave you the silver dollar I
		forgot to give you the contents of
		this envelope.  They are to be 
		returned.  Show it just before the deed...

Reggie pockets the envelope - joins Drop Shadow - and as they are 
leaving the dining room, they join a woman, JUANA, who looks half-
Oriental, half-Cajun.  She wears a strange, short, yellowish-bleached 
blonde wig.

								CUT TO:

115. INT. GALATOIRES RESTAURANT - NIGHT

They go downstairs together.  At the bottom of the stairs, Reggie and 
Drop Shadow catch sight of Johnnie who is sitting in the back of the 
restaurant having dinner with Marietta.  When Johnnie sees the two of 
them he waves, but at the same time gets a chill up his spine.

				MARIETTA
		What is it, Johnnie?

				JOHNNIE
		Just some guys I met here...  I 
		keep seein em...
			(looks back at Marietta)
		Now tell me...

Marietta continues to stare at Reggie, Drop Shadow, and Juana before 
turning back to Johnnie.  She also feels the fear.

				MARIETTA
		Johnnie, I cant tell you, honey.  Is
		there anyway we can get on the road
		tonight?  Weve got to find them kids.

				JOHNNIE
		Somethin was upsettin you bad last
		night, and you wanted to tell me
		and I figured you wanted to tell me
		sos I could help...

				MARIETTA
		I did, honey, but that was last 
		night...  Lets just find those two
		kids before its too late.

				JOHNNIE
		Honey, I have to ask you this...
		Is Santos involved in any of this?

				MARIETTA
		Hell no, baby...  I wouldnta done
		that without tellin you.

				JOHNNIE
		That bastard Pucinski...

				MARIETTA
		Who?...  Uncle Pooch?...

				JOHNNIE
		Yeah...  The one that introduced 
		Santos to you and Clyde.

				MARIETTA
		Johnnie...  Thats the past...  We
		gotta get on to our future, sugar!

				JOHNNIE
			(smiles)
		All I have to do is grab my suitcase,
		and Im ready.  Youre lucky cause
		I happen to love night drivin.

				MARIETTA
		Lets head for Texas and see if we
		can pick up the trail.

				JOHNNIE
		Did I tell ya its great to see ya

				MARIETTA
		This bout the fifth time?

Johnnie and Marietta climb together to the second floor and Johnnie 
takes Marietta to her room.

				MARIETTA
		    (as she enters her room)
		Ill pack my things and meet you
		downstairs.

				JOHNNIE
		And to think what coulda happened
		in that king-sized bed tonight...

				MARIETTA
			(pinching his cheek)
		You wont of missed much.

				JOHNNIE
		See ya downstairs.

116A. MAISON VIOLETTE - JOHNNIES ROOM - NIGHT

Johnnie smiles and heads up to his room.  He opens the door and steps 
inside.  WHAM!!  Johnnie is knocked in the head with a heavy metal pipe 
and he goes down hard.  A large dark figure grabs on to him and pulls 
him to an open window and lowers him into the back of a pick-up.  The
dark figure follows out the window.

DISSOLVE TO:


117. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - LOBBY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Marietta is sitting in the lobby trying to hold herself together - half-
sobbing.  The MANAGER approaches and sits next to her.

				MANAGER
		Im afraid his car is gone, Mrs.
		Fortune.

				MARIETTA
		I dont understand this...  I dont
		understand this one bit.  He was 
		supposed to meet me right her in 
		this lobby.  Somethin bad has 
		happened - I jus know it.

				MANAGER
		Perhaps we should call a local law
		enforcement officer.

				MARIETTA
		HELL NO!!!  Thats the last thing 
		we need...  A buncha cops runnin
		around.

The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the 
lobby.

				DESK CLERK
		Im sorry...  But I have overlooked
		this.  Im truly sorry, maam.

He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads 
immediately.  We see the note.  

NOTE
Gone fishing with a friend - maybe
buffalo hunting.  Johnnie.


				MARIETTA
		Oh God!  What does that mean?

				MANAGER
		Im sure I wouldnt know, maam ...
		and buffalo hunting too ... hmmmmm?

				MARIETTA
		And jus when my babys out on some
		Texas road with a killer.

The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos.  He seems to know 
exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off 
the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta.

				MARIETTA
			(horrified whisper)
		Santos...  Wheres J-J-Johnnie?

				SANTOS
		Shhhhhh...
			(to the manager and desk clerk)
		Thank you, gentlemen...  Ill look
		after her now...

The Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back 
through the lobby.  Santos walks over to Marietta.  Marietta stands.

				MARIETTA
		Santos...  Whats happenin here?

				SANTOS
		Hey...  Stop the nervous cry-baby
		routine...  Youre my girl now...
		Santos is gonna wipe away those tears
		and make you happy...  Come on, lets
		get outta here.

				MARIETTA
		Where we goin?

				SANTOS
		Got word the kids are moving through
		Texas...  I think an ending is being

Light comes from one small dirty window.

								CUT TO:

119. INT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is 
gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh 
tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning 
to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair 
leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front 
of his.

				JUANA
		Johnnie, you take a good look at me,
		baby, cause you gonna hafta watch
		close to know when we do it to ya...
		Yall count when I touch the bottle -
		HO!!...
			(she slaps Johnnie hard

		pay attention fucka - otherwise we 
		hafta work it all night...  Too 
		much fun for us - you see what I 
		mean?  Now watch me how I touch a
		bottle and you count how many times.

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles 
sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the 
opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left 
bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and 
comes back and touches Johnnies face.

				JUANA
		You see, Johnnie.  I toucha number
		one bottle once, I toucha number two
		bottle once, and I touch your face.
		This is a game we love to play.  I
		get hot already...  Now you meet 
		second Mr. Killer...  Does he fish
		or dont he?

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come 
around to face him.

				REGGIE
		Hey, Johnnie...  Reggie - you remember
		Reggie, dont ya?  Look what I caught.
			(to Juana)
		Im gettin hot too, mama.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down 
in front of Johnnies again.

				JUANA
		Now Johnnie...  We want to feel the
		feelin...  Feel the feelin...  We
		be gettin up close to you, mutha

		I cant stop her, Johnnie...  She
		gets me too hot doin this...  Im
		gonna be right here, but Im gonna
		stand right behind ya with this big
		ol gun here...

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45 
Automatic.

				DROP SHADOW
		Thats a Marine issue.  It goes off
		somethin terrible - you wanna see?

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud click.

				JUANA
		You hear click?

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front 
of Johnnie.

				REGGIE
			(laughs)
		Hell, its even worse than I 
		remember...  Wait a minute...

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot 
again.

				JUANA
		Okay, gimmee nother kiss, Reggie
		bfore I fuck ya right now...
		FUCKIN HOT NOW, REGGIE.
		    (she opens her mouth with 
		     her tongue sticking out)
		FUCKIN HOT!

Juana screams like a monster from hell coming up close to Johnnies 
face.

				JUANA
		You think you gonna live through
		this night?...  YOU WRONG...  I
		SMELL YO SHIT NOW, JOHNNIE.  GIVE
		US ONE MO KISS, REGGIE.  OH FUCK 
		ME!!!  WE TOUCH BOTTLES NOW - FO

Reggie goes back behind Johnnie quick.

				JUANA
		I go out now...  I toucha one bottle...
		Reggie...  I toucha two bottle...
		I come back, I touch Johnnie...  AHHHHH

		FUCKIN PUSSY - GO OUT NOW...  NOW I GO
		ROUND AND ROUND YOU AHHHH - GO OUT AND
		TOUCH A NUMBER ONE BOTTLE - WAIT NOW!!!
		...  REGGIE...  YOU SHOW NOW-

Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnies face - tears off tape and gag - 
then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular 
design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

				REGGIE
		I forgot to show you this.  The
		gentlemen that gave this to me said
		youd recognize it.  Said he wanted 
		itd be bout the last thing you ever
		saw in this life.

				JOHNNIE

  Oh God...  OH GOD...  Santos...  
		Oh God Marietta ... are you in on

				JUANA
		I GO ROUND AND ROUND - DO I TOUCH A
		SECOND BOTTLE BFORE I TOUCH JOHNNIE
		- DO I?  DO I???.........
		    (very quietly and breathy)
		No...  I touch Johnnie.

As her finger touches Johnnies face there is a loud CLICK.  Johnnie 
moans and closes his eyes.

				JUANA
			(counting fast)
		One ... two ... three ... four ...
		five ... GETTIN TOO FUCKIN HOT, 
		REGGIE...  FEELIN MYSEF ... six

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair.

				JUANA
		Nine...
		   (she moves out of the way)
		FUCK ME NOW, REGGIE...  TEN!!!

We see a hole in the front of the barrel - BOOM!!!

The opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood.  Juana and Reggie 
race into each others arms and kiss right above Johnnies dead, 
bloodied head.

				JUANA

		You know, Lula, I never told you

				LULA
		I just figured you was out bein

				SAILOR
		Not exactly, sugar...  One reason

				LULA
		Youre scarin me, baby.

				SAILOR
		Well, theres a good side as well as
		a bad side to it...  The good side

		Clyde was a good ol guy...

				LULA
		You knew my daddy?

				SAILOR
		Yes I did...  I sure did...  The bad
		side of it is I did some drivin

				LULA
		Oh shit...

				SAILOR
		I quit workin for im, but just
		before I did, I ended up one night at 
		a house...  I dont know what it is
		they all think I saw that night, but
		I was just sittin out in the car

				LULA
		God, Sailor...  Thats the night my

				SAILOR
		I know, sugar...  But while the place
		was burnin...  Before Santos came
		out - I pitched some rocks at the 
		second floor windows case anyone was
		upstairs sleepin...  Afterwards...
		When I met you, I always liked to

				LULA
		Thats some big secret you been

Lula stays quiet for a moment - listening to the heavy hum of the V-8.

				SAILOR
		Lula, you there?

				LULA
		Yeah, Im here.

				SAILOR

The livingroom is on fire.

The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the 
smoke-filled hallway to her mothers bedroom.

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers 
bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window.  
Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula 
heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel.

				LULA

		So Sailor, our histories have been

				SAILOR
		They have, sugar.

				LULA
		I take that as a sign that we were

				SAILOR
		Its a comfortin idea.

				LULA
		Well, were really out in the middle

				SAILOR
		Theres worse places, honey.

				LULA
		If you say so.

				SAILOR
		Trust me on it.

				LULA

		I do trust you, Sailor.  Like I 
		aint never trusted nobody before.

				SAILOR
			(after a moment)
		Well be alright, peanut, long as 
		weve got room to move.

				LULA
		   (looking into the highway)
		Whats that?

				SAILOR
		I dont know...  Looks like clothes.

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with 
clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side 
of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each 
other - theyve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the 
highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an 
overturned car.

				LULA
		Oh God, Sailor.


				SAILOR
		One bad car accident...

				LULA
		SAILOR!!!

Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off - 
blood draining out of several deep wounds.

				LULA
		Sailor, what are we gonna do?

				SAILOR
		I dont know, honey, but we gotta 
		help that girl - get her to a town and
		hope no one catches on I broke parole.

They get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming.

				GIRL
			(completely gone in shock)
		Ive got about five hundred dollars 
		in my wallet and I cant find it...
		My mothers going to kill me.  Its 
		got all my cards in it...  It was

		MY PURSE IS GONE!!!  NOW SHE TELLS ME.

The girl starts walking back toward the car.

				SAILOR
		Lets get ahold a her quick.

				LULA
		You think shes gonna make it?

				SAILOR
		Dont know, but shes gonna bleed
		all over our car, Ill tell ya that...
		           (to Girl)
		Hey...  Hello...  Girl...  You gotta
		come with us, honey.

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm.

				GIRL
		OWWW GOD!!!  LEAVE ME ALONE...
		ROBERT!!!...  Shit, I got this damn
		sticky stuff in my hair...

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

				GIRL
		Gotta find my wallet.
			(to Sailor)
		Dont you say one word of this to
		my mother.  God, shes gonna kill me.

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and 
Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

				GIRL
		WHERES MY HAIRBRUSH?...

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and 
a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

				LULA
		I cant take this, Sailor.  Shes
		dyin right in front of our eyes...

				SAILOR
		Im afraid she is, baby.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her 
forehead.

				GIRL
			(wide-eyed now)
		Get my lipstick...
			(whisper)
		Its in my purse.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula 
starts to cry.

				LULA
		She died right in front of me.  Whyd
		she have to go and do that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		Lets get outta here, honey.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead 
down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then 
gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.  
Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes 
around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.  
Sailor starts the car and takes off.

		Well, I aint Blackie.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

				SAILOR
		Names Sailor Ripley.  Katy over at

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

				RED
		Things aint real hot right now.

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of 
them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the 
other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

				SPARKY
		Hows it look?

				SPARKY
		Shit, thats what I was afraid of.

				RED
		Ill get you foreigners a beer.

		Im Buddy, and this heres Sparky.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake 
hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

				SAILOR
		My girl and I are lookin for a 
		place to settle.  Were bunked down
		at the Iguana Motel.

				SPARKY
		So are we.  Its the only motel in 
		Big Tuna.  Have you met Bobby Just

				SAILOR
		No, we just got in a hour and a

				BUDDY
		You will.  Hes the Mr. Fix-It at

				REX
		Escaped con.  Man got some serious

				RED
		Everbody got a past.

				BUDDY
		Just some got more future in em

		That aint no lie.

Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it, 
crushing it flat.

				SAILOR
		Been nice meetin yall.  Preciate
		the beer.  Ill be seein yall

Lula opens her eyes and looks at him.

Sailor looks at Lula.

				SAILOR
		Susan Day...

The assistant manager, TOMMY THOMPSON, speaks from the shadows behind 
the group.

				TOMMY
		Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck.  That
		stupid shit...  That fuckin Bob was
		so fuckin dumb...  He deserved to
		die...  That asshole.

They all look over at Tommy.

				BUDDY
		Hey, Tommy...  Whats goin on over
		there in number four where al them 
		bright lights are all the time?

				TOMMY
		Them are makin a pornographic movie...
		Texas style...  Why?  You wanna join in?

				SPARKY
		How do you get sixteen Haitians into

				LULA
		How?

				SPARKY
		Tell em it floats.

				BUDDY
		Sparkys big on Florida jokes.

				SPARKY
		You need a active sense of humor to
		survive in the Big Tuna.

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

				BOBBY
		Hey, everybody.

				BUDDY
		Sailor, Lula, this heres the man 
		himself.  Bobby, this is Sailor
		and Lula, the most recent strandees,
		economic variety.

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Bobby Peru, just like the country.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

				BUDDY
		Accordin to Red and Rex, Bobbys
		the most excitin item to hit Big
		Tuna since the 86 cyclone sheared
		the roof off the high school.

				SPARKY
		Only in town two months and there 
		aint a young thing around dont 
		know how that cobra tattoo works, 
		right, Bob?

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish 
front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

				LULA
		You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

				BOBBY
		Im from all over.

				SAILOR
		    (noticing a USMC tattoo
		     on Bobbys right hand)
		You was in the Marines, huh?

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

				BOBBY
		Four years.

				SPARKY
		Bobby was at Cao Ben.

				LULA
		Whats Cao Ben?

				BOBBY
			(to Lula)
		How old are you?

				LULA
		Twenty.

				BUDDY
		Lotta women and kids and old people
		died at Cao Ben.

				BOBBY
		March, 1968.  We torched a village
		and the government made a big deal
		out of it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before 
reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they 
practically burn a hole in Buddy.

				BOBBY
			(to Buddy)
		You was on a ship, pardner.  Hard to
		make contact with the people when
		youre off floatin in the Gulf of
		Tonkin.

				SPARKY
		    (changing the subject)
		Hey Bobby, have yourself another 
		glass a Jack.

Sparky refills Bobbys shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

				BOBBY
		Dont mind if I fuckin do...  
		Speakin a Jack...  One-eyed Jacks
		yearnin to go a peepin in a
		seafood store...  Good meetin you.
		Adios, boys.

He walks out and after hes gone...

				LULA
		Somethin in that man scares me.

				BUDDY
		No shit.


				SPARKY
		  (pouring himself another shot)
		Bobbys got a way...  Cant shake
		that institution odor.

Lula puts a hand on Sailors leg.

				LULA
		Darlin, I still aint feelin so 
		well.  Im goin to bed.

				SAILOR
		Ill come along.

They say goodnight to Sparky and Buddy and head for their room.

Lula goes right to the bed and flops down on it.

		Anything I can do for you?

				LULA
		No, I dont think so, Sail.  I
		just need to lie down.

Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and 
flush it.  Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed.

				LULA
		Sailor?  You know what?

				SAILOR
		I know you aint particularly pleased
		bein here.

				LULA
		Not that.  Look at what I wrote down

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads Im pregnant.  Sailor looks into 
her eyes.

				SAILOR
		Its okay by me, peanut.

				LULA
		Well, nothin personal, but I aint

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.


				LULA
		Really, Sailor, it aint nothin

				SAILOR
		Love you, too.

				LULA
		I know.  Just Im sorta uncomfortable

				BOBBY
		Say it...  Then Ill leave...  Whisper

Pee Wees steel guitar ripples through the cigarette haze and buzzes

136A. EXT. ROARITAS - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of 
the Eldorado.  He peels back a brown army blanket.

				BOBBY
		Thats a double-barreled, sawed-off,

		Next to its a cold Smith and Wesson
		.32 handgun with a six inch barrel.
		Thesell do er...  Loosen up that

Bobby closes the trunk.  Sailor stands - hesitating to commit.

Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his

As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her 
legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to 
Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in Sailors ear.

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailors fist is already halfway through Bob 
Rays brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.  
Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of 
SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and

Bobby lowers his hands into the front of Perditas blouse and cups her 
breasts.  She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette.  
Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perditas hair and pulls her over the couch 
onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby 
keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small 
turquoise radio on the bedside table.  She is listening to a piece of 
sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the 
volume increases.

Lula remembers some moments in her life with Sailor: (Music continues 
over)

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to Slaughter House.

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.  
She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking 
through it at her.  The image puzzles her.

142. EXT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

The big Eldorado pulls up in front of the Iguana Motel where Sailor has 
been waiting in the hot sun.  Bobby opens the door.

				BOBBY
		Jump in back.

Sailor crawls in the back seat and sees Perdita just as she floors it 
and they take off in a cloud of dust.


142A. INT. ELDORADO - BIG TUNA - DAY

				SAILOR
		Whats she doin here?

				BOBBY
		Shes my girl...  Shes drivin...
		That bother you?

				SAILOR
		Why should it?

				BOBBY
		Thats right...  Take one of these.

				SAILOR
		What is it?

				BOBBY
		Panty hose.  Work bettern stockins.
		Pull one of the legs down over your
		face and let the other leg trail
		behind your head.  You get the pistol.
			(hands him the .32)
		Remember, soon as we get inside, you
		keep that bad boy up where those 
		hicks can see it.  Once they notice
		the Ithaca and the Smith, theyll 
		know we aint foolin with em.

				PERDITA
		Comin up on it now, Bobby.

								CUT TO:

143. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Bobby slips the panty hose over his head and adjusts it.  His face looks 
crooked and distorted.

				BOBBY
		     (frightening whisper)
		Come on!  Get that mask on!

Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head, 
stretching the calf part to fit.

Perdita pulls up in front of the store.  The street is deserted.

				BOBBY
		Keep it revved, Chiquita.  We wont
		be long.  Just goin in to get our
		five grand.

CUT TO:								

144. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

Bobby and Sailor enter the feed store.  Bobby raises his sawed-off 
shotgun and points it at the TWO OLD MEN behind the counter.

				BOBBY
		Into the back room, both of you, 
		NOW!!!

Bobby and the two men head down the hall into the back room.

				BOBBY
		    (calling back to Sailor)
		If anyone comes in, herd em back
		here quick.

								CUT TO:

145. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Suddenly, an Iguana County DEPUTY SHERIFF cruises up in a patrol car and 
parks it on angle in front of the idling Eldo.  The Deputy gets out of 
his car and walks over to the drivers side of the Eldorado.

				DEPUTY
		Waitin for somebody, Miss?

				PERDITA
		Mi esposo.  Hes in the feed store
		picking up some supplies.

				DEPUTY
		Youd best be careful of that cigarette,
		Maam.  Its about to burn down 
		between your fingers.

Perdita stubs out her Marlboro in the ashtray.

				PERDITA
		Gracias, officer.

								CUT TO:

146. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind 
the counter.  Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money.  Sailor 
is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby 
finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole 
through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock.

				SAILOR
		BOBBY!!!!  STOP IT, MAN!!!


CUT TO:

147. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Reacting to the shot, Perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels 
out, knocking the deputy down.

								CUT TO:

148. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around 
and points it at Sailor.

				BOBBY
		Youre next, fucker.

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.  
It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill 
Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second 
old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively 
spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the 
old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the 
front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.


148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped 
in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his 
second into Bobbys left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes 
Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobbys right 
hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under 
his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the 
RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand 
over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy 
orders him to stand up.

149. INT. IGUANA COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

Lula is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of the Iguana County 
Courthouse Building when Marietta and Santos walk in.  As soon as she 
sees Lula, Marietta runs over, sits down next to her and hugs and kisses 
her.

				MARIETTA
		Oh baby, I was beginnin to think 
		I was never gonna see you again.

Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and 
Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos.

				MARIETTA
		Youre comin home, precious.  Santos
		gonna drive us to the San Antonio
		airport.

				LULA
		Mama, Sailors in deep trouble here.
		I just cant leave him.

Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lulas 
eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are 
pale.

				MARIETTA
		Oh, yes, you can.

Santos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble.

				SANTOS
		Your mamas been real worried bout
		you, honey.  Me too...  Can you
		give your old friend Santos a hug,
		too?

Santos arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling 
scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree.  Santos grabs her hard - in a 
bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise, 
orange, and silver.

Sailor lays on his jail bed reading a letter from Lula.

				LULA
			(voice-over)

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing youll want to know is Im keeping the baby.
Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but I think shes looking
forward to it.  Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a 
boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it?  Its
kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old 
when you get out.

I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I dont know how much or what it 
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
youre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  Im going to move out as
soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time dont really fly honey does it?

Love,
your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

151. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor.

				SAILOR
			(voice-over)

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. 
And Pace being your family name and all is just right.
What about a middle name if it is a boy after my 
granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though
he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youre
gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.
Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

153. INT. LULA FORTUNES HOUSE - EVENING - (SIX YEARS LATER)

Six years later...  Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of 
ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is 
wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a 
Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an 
ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the 
livingroom as she talks on the phone.

				LULA
		Im goin, mama.  No way I cant go.

				MARIETTA
		You aint takin Pace, though.

				LULA
		Course I am, mama.

				MARIETTA
			(sighs)
		What times Sailors train get in?

				LULA
		Six.

				MARIETTA
		Got any plans?

				LULA
		Figure well go have supper someplace.
		Maybe get some barbecue out by 
		Stateline.  Sailor always liked that
		Havana Browns Pig Pickin.

				MARIETTA
		Well, you be careful with that boy,
		Lula.

				LULA
		Sailor aint a boy no more, mama.

				MARIETTA
		Dont mean him.  Its Pace concerns me.

				LULA
		Really, mama, I gotta go.

				MARIETTA
		What if I asked you not to?

				LULA
		Wouldnt make any difference.

				MARIETTA
		What if I told you not to?

				LULA
			(forcefully)
		Mama ... if you get in the way of
		me and Sailors happiness, Ill

Lula hangs up and throws her glass of water at a picture of her mother - 
draining it.

154. INT. LULAS CAR - EVENING

PACE ROSCOE FORTUNE is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a 
long-billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders.

				PACE
		Howll we know what he looks like?

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling, 
causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection 
to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville 
driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

				PACE
		Mama, you almost crashed us.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while 
she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the 
window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette 
is clamped in her teeth.

				LULA
		Dont give me no trouble now, Pace,
		please.  This aint the easiest day
		in a long time.  And what do you
		mean how are we gonna know what your
		daddy looks like?  You seen his photo.


				PACE
		Howll he know what we look like?
		He seen our photo?

Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out 
of her mouth and drops it.

				LULA
		Damn it, child!  Now look what you
		made me do.

				PACE
		What I made you do, mama?

Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the 
cigarette.  Sirens can be heard up ahead.

				LULA
		Nothin, honey. 
		  (stubbing it out in the ashtray)
		Mamas just actin strange.

				PACE
		You aint actin, mama.

				LULA
		Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, aint you
		got one cute mouth tonight?

They pass an automobile accident where a man has been thrown into the 
curb - his head broken open and bleeding.  The ambulance is just 
arriving.  Lula looks away.

								CUT TO:

155. ACCIDENT - EVENING

A CRAZY MAN in a wheelchair is wheel up to the accident victim, who is

Pace looks up at his mother.

				LULA
		Like you, sweetheart.  You and your

				PACE
		My daddy aint never killed nobody,

				LULA
		Course he aint never killed nobody.
		Whyd you say that, Pace?

				PACE
		Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama

				LULA
		And?

				PACE
		Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.

				LULA
		Wrong, baby.  Your daddy never 
		committed no murder.  Musta been you

157. EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

Lula pulls the Camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the 
engine.

				PACE
		Why we sittin here, mama?

				LULA
		Thinkin a second, baby.

Lula gets out and goes around for Pace.  They hold hands as they walk 
toward the station.  The big clock on the side of the building shows ten 
minutes past six.

				PACE
		Im scared, mama.

				LULA
		Why, honey?

				PACE
		Case daddy dont like me.  What if
		he dont like that I dont got

				LULA
		Pace, your daddyd love you even

CUT TO:								

158. INT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

Lula sees Sailor as soon as she opens the door.  He is sitting in an 
orange plastic chair against the opposite wall, smoking a cigarette.

				LULA
		Still partial to Camels, huh?

Sailor smiles.

				SAILOR
		First pack of tailor-mades I had in
		a while.

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with 
Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

				SAILOR
		You must be my son.

				LULA
		Shake hands with your daddy.

Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors.  Sailor grips it 
gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

				SAILOR
		Pleasure to meet you, Pace.  I read
		a lot about you.

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them 
loose.  Sailor tries to smile.

				LULA
		You hungry?  Pace and I aint had
		dinner yet.

				SAILOR
		Lead the way.

Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car.

CUT TO:								

159. INT. LULAS CAR - NIGHT

Lula drives.

				SAILOR
		No rag top, huh?

Lula starts to reply, then stops.  She stares straight ahead, gripping 
the wheel hard.  Suddenly, she pulls over to the side of the road, turns 
off the engine and gets out of the car.

				PACE
		Whats wrong, mama?

				SAILOR
		     (turning to Pace and 
			patting his head)
		Dont worry, son.  Just stay here.

Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the 
hood.

				LULA
		Im sorry, Sailor.  I just cant 
		help it.  Give me a minute and Ill
		quit.

				SAILOR
		Boys frightened, Lula.  This aint
		no good.

				LULA
		Really, Sail, Ill be okay.

				SAILOR
		Its a mistake, honey.  You two go on.
		Ill walk back to the depot.

				LULA
		Whatre you talkin about?  Thats 
		your son in there.

				SAILOR
		He aint never known me, Lula, so 
		there aint much for him to forget.
		Not seein each other for six years
		makes it next best to simple for us, too.

				LULA
		How can you say that, Sailor?

				SAILOR
		What makes sense, is all.

Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys 
out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and 
closes the lid.

				LULA
		Dont do this, Sailor, please.

Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the 
car.

				SAILOR
			(to Pace)
		Oiga, amigo.  If ever somethin 
		dont feel right to you, remember what
		Pancho said to The Cisco Kid...  
		Lets went, before we are dancing at
		the end of a rope, without music.

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks 
down her face.

ECU of Lulas eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and 
down her cheeks as in Sailors dream.

				SAILOR
		You been doin fine without me, peanut. 
		There aint no need to make life 
		toughern it has to be.

He picks up his suitcase, kisses Lula lightly on the lips and walks 
away.  She lets him go.

Lula climbs in behind the wheel - sobbing.  Pace sits sadly, staring out 
the window.

								CUT TO:

162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER 
TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around 
him, coming in closer for the kill.

				SAILOR
		What do you faggots want?

Thats all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend 
himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood 
begins to pour from his swelling nose.


162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful 
Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor Ripley...

Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.  
His mouth speaks through closed lips.

				SAILOR
		The Good Witch...

				GOOD WITCH
		Sailor...  Lula loves you.

				SAILOR
		But Im a robber and a manslaughterer
		and I havent had any parental 
		guidance.

				GOOD WITCH
		Shes forgiven you of all these things
		...  You love her...  Dont be
		afraid, Sailor.

				SAILOR
		But Im wild at heart.

				GOOD WITCH
		If you are truly wild at heart, youll
		fight for your dreams...  Dont turn
		away from love, Sailor...  Dont turn
		away from love...  Dont turn away
		from love.

The Good Witch disappears.


162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on 
his feet.  The gang still stands around him.

				GANG MEMBER
		You had enough, asshole?

				SAILOR
		Yes, I have...  And I wanna apologize
		to you gentlemen for referring to 
		you as homosexuals.  I also want to
		thank you fellas, youve taught me

Sailor turns around and starts running back.  The gang watches him go.

Lula sits in the car in the middle of a giant traffic jam.  She is still 
crying and horns are honking all around them.

								CUT TO:

164. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME.

He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he 
jumps on the hood of Lulas car.

She sees him.

				SAILOR
		LULA!!!!

				LULA
		SAILOR!!!!

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a 
giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes 
away.  Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.  
It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, 
but now she knows what it is.  It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking 
up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love 
Me Tender. 

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a 
feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.

               TITLE SEQUENCE

               The faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP, 
               as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND 
               TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The 
               CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, 
               then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar 
               faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are 
               dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               Through the last traces of early morning mist another group 
               of black-clad figures make their way down a lane.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               An Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the 
               landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces.

               Framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern 
               figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, 
               his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired 
               like his father, peering out.

               The horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS 
               on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES 
               on the pavement.

               ANOTHER LANE

               Two Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of 
               three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a 
               leafless thicket of hickory.

               VALLEY

               A BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen 
               buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.

               BARNYARD

               Where literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses 
               have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of 
               the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  FRONT PORCH

               As the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women 
               and children presumably first).

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               The coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse 
               has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen 
               partially covering the bearded face.

               END TITLE SEQUENCE

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of 
               the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred-
               fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows 
               of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the 
               f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy 
               a special Place.

               RACHEL LAPP

               A young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and 
               drawn.

               In happier circumstances, although there haven't been too 
               many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual 
               woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence.

               Eight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would 
               appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events.

               And the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered  yet 
               not unkind  features grief-stricken.

               THE MOURNERS

               Their faces...

               CLOCK

               As it begins to CHIME nine a.m.

               FAVORING PREACHER

               As he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation 
               remove their hats also.

               Then the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect:

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     PREACHER
                         ...a brother has been called home. 
                         God has spoken through the death of 
                         our neighbor, Jacob Lapp...

               THE FAMILY

               Where Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion 
               and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as:

                                     PREACHER
                         ...husband of Rachel, father to 
                         Samuel, son of Eli.
                              (and)
                         His chair is empty, his bed is empty, 
                         his voice will be heard no more. He 
                         was needed in our presence, but God 
                         needs such men, too. That one should 
                         be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. 
                         Still, we would not wish him back. 
                         Rather we should prepare ourselves 
                         to follow him.

               TIGHTENING to the Lapps, and...

               EXT. CEMETERY

               The mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in 
               silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the 
               pit. The many buggies are aligned in the b.g.

               As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the 
               grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a 
               slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty 
               air.

               RACHEL

               TIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Where the Amish have gathered for the traditional post 
               funeral, midday meals.

               Long tables are laden with customary Amishfare... crocks of 
               soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets, 
               preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries.

               RACHEL

               Where she sits among women, accepting their condolences.

               DANIEL HOCHSTETLER

               A brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman. 
               There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic 
               set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. Not exactly 
               what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up 
               man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group 
               of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER, 
               BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Lapp was a good farmer. None better.

                                     BEILER
                         But not the man to buy a horse for 
                         you.
                              (and)
                         Hochstetler, wasn't it your father 
                         sold him that horse with a ruptured 
                         testicle?

                                     TOM
                              (grins)
                         Told him it was a bee sting made him 
                         limp that way.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (amused)
                         That horse had one good ball. That's 
                         all it takes.

               The others chuckle. But Hochstetler's attention is still on 
               Rachel.

               RACHEL

               As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a 
               tree in front of her.

               At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. 
               All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, 
               tune in as Rachel looks up.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let 
                         us hope he walks close with God.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sure he does, Daniel.

               FIELDS, LAPP FARM  DAY

               It is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is 
               hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. The 
               death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three  
               Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli 
               work nearby, further breaking up the earth. Rachel looks up 
               from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach  
               it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers. Without a 
               word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various 
               tasks associated with the work in hand.

               Daniel works close beside Rachel.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROADS, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A few BRIEF SHOTS of a lone buggy containing the Lapp family 
               take us from the 18th century into the 20th century the 
               reassuring RATTLE OF THE CARRIAGE WHEELS on quiet backroad, 
               to the ROAR OF TRAFFIC as the buggy waits patiently for a 
               chance to cross a busy interstate highway.

               EXT. HIGHWAY, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it 
               trots down the interstate. The camera cranes up to reveal a 
               procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to 
               overtake it.

               EXT. PLATFORM, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat-form, 
               Rachel turns surprised, as he approaches, a faint color coming 
               to her cheek.

                                     RACHEL
                         Daniel?

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I... I was at the feed store. And I 
                         saw your horse, so...

               There is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival 
               of the train.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         You will come back soon?

               Samuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his 
               mother's hand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Quickly, Mother Quickly!

               Rachel embraces Eli.

                                     ELI
                         You be careful out among them English.

               She turns to Hochstetler.

                                     RACHEL
                         I need time, Daniel.

               EXT. CARPARK, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open 
               wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his 
               horse off at a fast trot.

               EXT. TRAIN  DAY

               The ENGINE gives a WARNING BLAST before creeping slowly 
               forward.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               As Samuel spots something out of the window that causes him 
               to light up.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Look, Mama...!

               HIS POV THROUGH WINDOW

               A road runs parallel to the train track, and Hochstetler in 
               his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts 
               to keep pace with the train.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see, darling.

               And Samuel cranes to look back, waving, for as long as he 
               can.

               EXT. LANCASTER COUNTRYSIDE  DAY

               The train moves across a broad panorama of fields, dotted 
               with dolls'-house-sized farms and the tiny figures of Amish 
               farmers working their horse-drawn equipment.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               As the train continues its eastward journey... Samuel stares 
               raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the 
               countryside. He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot 
               air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills... he 
               looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to 
               suburbs, bustling shopping centers, restaurants, car lots 
               and fast food outlets.

               EXT. PHILADELPHIA SLUMS

               As the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets 
               choked with cars and the gutters with filth.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               Now Samuel is staring out the window with some confusion, 
               almost apprehension:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is this where we're going?

                                     RACHEL
                         Of course not. We're going to 
                         Baltimore. It's much nicer in 
                         Baltimore.

               And Rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the 
               window.

               INT. 30TH ST. STATION, PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Rachel is in a line at one of the counters. The plain dress 
               of the two Amish  particularly Samuel's black coat and hat 
                are drawing curious stares.

               SAMUEL

               He's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a 
               little girl about his own age, standing in line with her 
               parents at the next counter. He edges away from his mother...

               ANGLE

               As Samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock 
               coat and flat-brimmed hat... the man's back is turned, could, 
               from appearances, be an Amishman.

               Samuel stares... A beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we 
               discover that he is a Hasidic Jew.

               SAMUEL

               As he reacts.

               BACK TO TICKET COUNTER

               As Rachel's turn arrives. The TICKET SELLER glances up and 
               she shows him her ticket.

                                     RACHEL
                         We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where 
                         is that train, please?

                                     TICKET SELLER
                         Delayed three hours. You'll hear an 
                         announcement when it's time to board.

               He starts to go without his hat, but Rachel collars him and 
               puts it on his head.

               ANGLE IN MEN'S ROOM

               As Samuel enters.

               It's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... Samuel stops 
               before one of the urinals  a long, trough-like affair with 
               water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel.

               It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING 
               FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel 
               stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, 
               stoops to see which are empty.

               HIS POV  TOILETS

               Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. Samuel 
               is alone in the restroom.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a 
               stall near the end. He enters. As he does so, a heavily 
               bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, 
               he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind 
               a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up.

               Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large 
               BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. 
               His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and 
               a short leather jacket.

               They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace.

               The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for 
               him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close 
               confines of the lavatory.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he 
               can see their feet under the edge of the door.

               BACK TO FIGHT

               As the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young 
               man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color.

               The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's 
               hand bloodstained. His partner stares at what they've 
               accomplished with a stunned expression:

                                     PARTNER
                         Jesus...

               The young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with 
               blood.

               He stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. Finally his 
               bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. 
               Then he collapses to the floor.

               The black man motions for his partner to watch the door, 
               then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind 
               the dispenser.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As he edges open the stall door a crack. Over his shoulder 
               we can see the black man, his BACK TO US, rifling the 
               backpack. But beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we 
               catch sight of the black man's face.

               SAMUEL

               As he stares out the narrow crack. A beat, then he closes 
               the stall door.

               ANGLE IN STALL

               Samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and 
               won't fall closed.

               BLACK MAN

               As he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket. 
               His partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand.

               The black man makes for the exit, then on second thought, 
               glances at the row of stalls.

               HIS POV  STALLS

               All quiet, but...

               BACK TO SCENE

               The black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting 
               at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               As the black man approaches, Samuel working desperately on 
               the latch. At the last minute he finally wedges it in.

               BLACK MAN

               He elbows Samuel's stall... the door won't open.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               Fighting back panic, Samuel has retreated as far as he can.

               BLACK MAN

               As he gives the door a kick. It holds. He swears under his 
               breath.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               In desperation, Samuel does the only thing he can think of... 
               he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the 
               black man just checked out. But he loses his hat in the 
               process. His hand snakes back INTO FRAME to snatch it just 
               as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that 
               splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. He's 
               framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking 
               down our throats.

               ANGLE

               As his partner snaps from the doorway:

                                     PARTNER
                         Will you come on, for Christ's sakes!

               A beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to 
               follow the partner out.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               As we hear the SOUND OF THE TWO MEN EXITING the lavatory. A 
               long beat, then Samuel opens the stall door a crack.

               HIS POW THROUGH DOOR

               Samuel's own face reflected in the blood-smeared mirror... 
               then PANNING DOWN to the still figure of the young man lying 
               in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor.

               BENCH WAITING ROOM  LOW ANGLE  NIGHT

               Samuel sits close to his mother, his face pale, his eyes 
               staring.

               Rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various 
               police and officials pass through foreground, occasionally 
               obscuring the lonely couple. There is considerable ECHOING 
               NOISE as commands and requests mingle with the CRACKLE OF 
               TWO-WAY RADIOS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DOOR  MEN'S' ROOM

               The diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the 
               Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal, JOHN BOOK, 
               who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the 
               crowd of police, reporters and others. He is about 40, with 
               a rangy, athletic body. Behind him comes CARTER, Book's black 
               partner  about five years younger than Book. Book is wearing 
               a suit, Carter is much more casually  almost disreputably  
               dressed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BENCH

               Little Samuel watching Book, back to crowd of police, as 
               Book questions an old black CUSTODIAN.

                                     BOOK
                         You found the body?

                         Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported 
                         it. It was the kid.

                                     BOOK
                         What kid?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         How'n hell do I know what kid? The 
                         kid in the funny black threads.

               TIGHT SHOT  SAMUEL

               Worry-eyed, still staring straight ahead. Then his eyes move 
               suddenly to his left.

               BOOK'S LEGS  SAMUEL'S POV

               Coming in at full stride, then stopping.

               SAMUEL

               He doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And, 
               slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's 
               belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his 
               face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then...

               ANGLE  BOOK

               As his face breaks into a big grin, and...

                                     BOOK
                         Hi, kid.

               RACHEL

               Immediately alarmed, intervening.

                                     RACHEL
                         What do you want of my son?

               THE SCENE

               As Book takes out his wallet, displays his shield.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm a police officer. I'm going to 
                         have to talk to the boy. What's his 
                         name?

                                     RACHEL
                         Samuel. Samuel Lapp.
                              (then, quickly)
                         But what happened here is none of 
                         his affair. My sister is expecting 
                         me... our train is leaving soon.

                                     BOOK
                         There'll be another train.
                              (turns to Samuel)
                         The man who was killed tonight was a 
                         policeman, Sam. It's my job to find 
                         out who did it. I want you to tell 
                         me everything you saw when you went 
                         in there.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stammers)
                         I saw him.

                         Who'd you see?

               Sam looks at his mother.

                         Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the 
                         floor?

                                     SAMUEL
                         No... I saw the man who killed him.

               Book stares at him in surprise, speaks over his shoulder to 
               Carter.

                                     BOOK
                         Anybody know about this?

                                     CARTER
                         I didn't even know about it.

                                     BOOK
                              (back to Sam)
                         Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he 
                         looked like?

                                     SAMUEL
                              (groping, touching 
                              his clothes and 
                              pointing at Carter)
                         He was... like him.

                                     BOOK
                              (nods)
                         Black... I understand. What else,Sam?

               A beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather 
               slightly built partner:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Not Zwartich, like him 

               Book frowns, puzzled:

                                     BOOK
                         Try that one again, Sam 

               Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel 
               intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter:

                                     RACHEL
                         May I talk to you?

               ANGLE

               As Rachel takes Book aside, and in a low voice:

                                     RACHEL
                         Zwartich. It's the way we say... 
                         dwarf.
                              (glances at Carter)
                         Not like him... very big.

               Book nods, starts to turn back to Sam. Just then a commotion 
               off screen catches his attention.

               BOOK'S POV  ONCOMING COPS

               It's Capt. TERRY DONAHUE, Chief of Homicide, striding past 
               the crowd of journalists and TV crews... brushing off 
               reporters' questions and snapping orders to the aides he's 
               got in tow:

               BACK TO SCENE

               AS DONAHUE COMES ON BOOK:

                                     DONAHUE
                              (to aides)
                         Close it all down... I want a man on 
                         every exit... I want the lab in here 
                         now!
                              (to Book)
                         And I want to talk to you, Captain.

               ANGLE

               As Book steps aside with Donahue... In the b.g. Rachel moves 
               protectively to Samuel's side.

                                     BOOK
                         All right, talk. 

                                     DONAHUE
                         This is homicide  not Internal 
                         Affairs! So why are you behaving 
                         like you own this case?

                                     BOOK
                         We were running Zenovitch... That's 
                         all I can tell you. But I want it, 
                         Terry.
                              (then)
                         I've got a call into Schaeffer.

               RACHEL / SAMUEL

               They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue 
               and Book... although they're keeping the volume down, it's 
               obviously intense and angry:

                                     SAMUEL
                              (alarmed)
                         Momma... are they angry with us.

                                     RACHEL
                              (reassuring, but hardly 
                              in her own mind)
                         No... No. It is just the English 
                         way.

               Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile:

                                     DONAHUE
                         You ought to think about coming back 
                         to Homicide, Johnny... Stick with 
                         Internal Affairs and you're not gonna 
                         have any friends left.

                              (smiles right back)
                         I'll buy a dog.

               EXT. 30TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book emerges from the terminal, looks about him, then crosses 
               to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby. Two men sit 
               in the front seat. Book crosses to the driver's side and 
               opens the door.

                                     BOOK
                         Go get a cup of coffee, Stan.

               The driver, a uniformed policeman, glances at the man beside 
               him who nods in agreement. He gets out and Book gets in behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. SEDAN

               Book sits next to SCHAEFFER, a surprisingly kindly looking 
               man of about fifty. Schaeffer is a Deputy Chief.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         How reliable is this kid?

                         Yeah.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What have you got?

                                     BOOK
                         Zenovitch was about to deliver a 
                         list of names tonight  street 
                         chemists... the guys processing this 
                         P2P into speed.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         So one of them got to him.

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You know who?

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You're still convinced there's a 
                         link to the department?

                                     BOOK
                         If there isn't I've just wasted the 
                         last six months.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         That's the problem. We need results. 
                         The press is driving us crazy over 
                         this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed 
                         capitol of the country'. You know 
                         the sort of thing. It's getting 
                         political. The Commissioner's getting 
                         very uneasy.

                                     BOOK
                         The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll 
                         make it, but Set Donahue and the 
                         Homicide Department off my back or 
                         they'll blow the whole thing.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         When word gets out that Zenovitch 
                         was a cop, all hell will break lose.

                         can give you. 24 hours on your own. 
                         After that the case and the witness 
                         go back to the Homicide Department.

                                     SCHAEFFER

                         Tell you what... why don't you and 
                         that blonde  what's-her-name  come 
                         over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout 
                         that.

                                     BOOK
                         What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.

                         Well, anyway, don't get crazy.
                              (dismisses him)
                         I'll do something for Zenovich's 
                         wife.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between 
               neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened 
               storefronts.

               Carter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat 
               looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters 
               huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about. On the 
               POLICE RADIO a description of the cop killing is BROADCAST 
               EVERY FEW MINUTES.

                                     CARTER
                         I got there late, John.

                              (beat)
                         Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You 
                         didn't let anybody down. It happens 
                         

                                     CARTER
                              (grimly)
                         It won't happen again.

                                     RACHEL
                         Where are you taking us?

                                     BOOK
                         We're looking for a suspect. We've 
                         reason to believe he's still in the 
                         area.

                                     RACHEL
                         You have no right to keep us here.

                                     BOOK
                         Yes I do. Your son is a material 
                         witness to a homicide.

                                     RACHEL
                         You don't understand, we have nothing 
                         to do with your laws!

                                     BOOK
                         Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of 
                         people like that.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not a joke.

               Book decides to try contrition:

                                     BOOK
                         You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, 
                         I know a little about the Amish. I 
                         know this has to be an ordeal for 
                         you; and I'm really sorry you an 
                         Samuel got involved.

               Samuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his 
               mother in German. She responds in the same language. Book 
               frowns.

                                     BOOK
                         What was that?

                                     RACHEL
                         He wants to know who you are. Your 
                         name. I told him we don't need to 
                         know anything about you.

               Book eyes Samuel:

               EXT. 13TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened 
               little MAN. He looks about before crossing to the driver's 
               side window.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR  NIGHT

               Book lowers the window.

                         Sammy, where's Coalmine?

               The little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the 
               back seat.

                                     SAMMY
                         What you got there, the Salvation 
                         Army?

                         Try "Happy Valley".

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY BAR, SOUTH STREET  NIGHT

               Book's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get 
               out, and move swiftly inside.

               INT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               Sixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on 
               the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and 
               move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this 
               point... no mistakes. From the back, the black man they've 
               approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did 
               the killing of Zenovitch. And, as Book and Carter make their 
               move...

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               As Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar, 
               violently propelling Coalmine along with them. Now we see 
               Coalmine is not the killer.

               As Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police 
               squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car. 
               An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's 
               face down next to the car window.

                                     BOOK
                         Put some light on him.

               A cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over 
               Coalmine's face.

                                     BOOK
                              (continuing; to Samuel)
                         Look at him.

               Crazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at 
               Samuel inside the car:

               Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative.

               Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and 
               slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing 
               his face up against the front window. His face takes on a 
               grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his 
               partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away 
               by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has 
               horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he 
               gets back in the car.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, you listen to me! I will 
                         have no further part in this, nor 
                         will my son! As God stands between 
                         us!

               Book sighs, starts the engine and moves off.

               EXT. HOTEL  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed DOORMAN 
               moves to open the rear door.

               INT. CAR  NIGHT

               Rachel and Sam recoil as the Doorman opens the door. He is 
               puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Ma'am?

                         No! We do not stay in hotels.

               Book and Carter exchange a glance.

               EXT. / INT. FRONT DOOR, SUBURBAN HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  
               NIGHT

               An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers 
               stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house. 
               This is ELAINE, Book's sister. She stops Book as he tries to 
               follow Rachel inside.

                                     ELAINE
                         How could you do this to me tonight? 
                         I told you I had company

                                     BOOK
                         Sorry. It's important.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she glances in a doorway.

               HER POV  ELAINE'S KITCHEN

               It's a shambles, with dirty supper dishes piled sink, the 
               table littered with empty beer cans.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she hustles Samuel along.

               BOOK / ELAINE

               Book frowns:

               Elaine looks like she's going to blow again, then decides 
               it's pointless.

                                     ELAINE

               ANGLE IN GUEST ROOM

               Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room.

               Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the 
               other one.

               Off screen we hear a DOOR CLOSE, presumably Book leaving. A 
               beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in.

                                     ELAINE
                         Everything okay?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes, thank you very much.

                                     ELAINE
                              (a beat)
                         John said you're Amish.

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes.

                         Oh.

               She nods and goes.

               Rachel crosses to Samuel, sits on the bed. Samuel looks up 
               at her bleakly.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I don't want to stay here.

                         I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.

               She puts her hand on his forehead, closes his eyes. she 
               frowns, and...

               Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple 
               of beers. Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into 
               the car.

               Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut. 
               Its clear they've worked through the night.

               EXT. ELAINE'S HOUSE  DAY

               Elaine's house is situated on the corner of a row of terraces, 
               which stretch into the distance on both sides of the street.

               INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE

               As Samuel comes out of the guest room in his night-shirt, 
               turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom.

               ANGLE

               But it's not the bathroom; it's Elaine's bedroom. She and 
               FRED are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love. Elaine 
               gasps, Fred manages to grunt.

                                     FRED
                         Wrong door, kid.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Samuel quickly shuts the door. A straight-faced beat; 
               then, barely suppressing a giggle, he hurries on...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               As Rachel appears in the living room entry. Samuel is sitting 
               on the floor with two boys of about his own age, watching 
               television.

               They're eating cold cereal out of a box.

               RACHEL'S POV  TV SCREEN

               Some artless Saturday morning cartoon.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she frowns, watching her son and the other two staring 
               hypnotically. And...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               It's later in the morning now, as Elaine, a bit blearily, 
               appears in the entryway, stares in groggy disbelief.

               HER POV  KIDS

               Her oldest boy and Samuel are busily washing the windows 
               while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper. The TV is 
               off.

               BACK TO ELAINE

               As she stares.

               ANGLE IN KITCHEN

               Rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen 
               finishing a brisk mop of the floor. The coffee is perking. 
               Elaine appears.

                         Good morning.

                                     RACHEL
                         I wanted to. you were kind to take 
                         us in last night.
                              (and)
                         Anyway, I needed something to do. I 
                         was so angry with your brother. He's 
                         so... agaanisish!

                                     ELAINE
                         Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like 
                         John.

               She takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         Just a minute. I'll pour you some 
                         coffee.

                                     ELAINE
                         You're not carrying a bullwhip... 
                         how'd you manage to put my kids to 
                         work?

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiles)
                         I made it a contest... the one who 
                         does best gets his cereal back first.
                              (and)
                         Children like to help... they only 
                         need to be kept after a little bit.

               Rachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to 
               storm.

                                     ELAINE
                         Oh, is that so?
                              (and)
                         No offense, lady, but I'm not so 
                         sure I like the idea of your coming 
                         in here and turning the place upside 
                         down!

               Rachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, I didn't mean...

               Abruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's 
               hands.

               She mops furiously as she Continues:

                                     ELAINE
                         I know exactly what you meant! Listen, 
                         maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau, 
                         but maybe I don't have time to polish 
                         the goddamn china and keep after the 
                         kids!
                              (and)
                         It's none of your business, but I 
                         don't happen to have a man around 
                         here full time. So I sell cosmetics 
                         in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes 
                         I can even pay the rent on time! So 
                         maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe 
                         I don't need to have it jammed down 
                         my throat like this.

               She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER:

                                     ELAINE
                         There is that clean enough for you?

               Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting 
               into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his 
               undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.

                                     FRED
                         Jesus, Elaine... Somebody die and 
                         leave you a broom?

               Not a politic observation on Fred's part.

                                     ELAINE
                              (blurts)
                         Go to hell, Fred!

               And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. Fred stares 
               after her.

                                     FRED
                         What's bugging her?

               Unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, 
               letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure.

               INT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM

               As Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door 
               behind her. Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing.

                                     RACHEL
                         I brought your coffee.

               She takes a seat next to the bed.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that 
                         way.

               After a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together:

                                     ELAINE
                         It's okay.
                              (and)
                         Look, I shouldn't have blown my top. 
                         It's like... somehow... I've let 
                         everything get away from me. And you 
                         sort of made me face it.

               She takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private 
               thought.

                                     ELAINE
                         What's so funny?

                                     RACHEL
                         Fred. The way he looked when you 
                         screamed at him.

                                     ELAINE
                              (disparing)
                         God, Fred...

                                     RACHEL
                         At home you'd never hear a woman 
                         scream at a man that way.

                                     ELAINE
                         No? Why not?

                                     RACHEL
                         You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish 
                         way.
                              (then)
                         But I think it would have done me 
                         good if I could have screamed at 
                         your brother last night.

                                     ELAINE
                         Listen, I don't know what's going on 
                         or how you got mixed up with him, 
                         but don't you let that self-righteous 
                         son of a bitch push you around, okay?

               Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Okay.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  DAY

               Book glances irritably at Rachel:

                                     BOOK
                         Now what's the problem?

                                     RACHEL
                         The problem is I don't happen to 
                         think my son should be spending all 
                         his time with a man who carried a 
                         gun under his coat and goes around 
                         whacking people.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Whacking?

                                     RACHEL
                              (firmly)
                         Yes. And I also want to leave this 
                         city.

                                     BOOK
                         Believe me, I'm trying to get this 
                         over with as fast as I can. But Samuel 
                         will probably have to come back and 
                         testify.

                                     RACHEL
                         We do not go into your courts.

                                     BOOK
                         People who don't go into our courts 
                         when they're told to sometimes go 
                         directly into our jail.

               Rachel glares at him and the ride continues on that chilly 
               note for a beat.

                                     BOOK
                         Look, I'm genuinely sorry...

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         No you're not 
                              (off his look)
                         You're glad, because now you've got 
                         a witness.
                              (and)
                         I heard the other police talking 
                         last night.
                              (and)
                         They don't seem to like you very 
                         much.

                                     BOOK
                         They kid a lot.

                                     RACHEL
                              (glances at him)
                         I would not be too sure.

               Samuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something 
               to his mother in German. Book gives her an inquiring look.

                                     RACHEL
                         He says you look very tired. I thought 
                         the same thing.

               Book says nothing.

                                     RACHEL
                         But not a good tired.

                                     BOOK
                         What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.

               She doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into 
               his funk as Samuel glares at him with hostility.

               INT. IDENTIFICATION ROOM  POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               Samuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind. They 
               are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers. 
               Samuel shakes his head  another negative.

               Book winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow 
               gumball. He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an 
               inquiring look. It's a peace offering.

               Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel. But just 
               as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches 
               over and plucks it off the table. She shakes her head at 
               Samuel.

                                     BOOK
                              (to Rachel)
                         Just wanted to see if you were on 
                         your toes.

               EXT. CITY PARK  DAY

               Book, Sam and Rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of 
               hot dogs heaped with kraut.

               Book watches with amusement as Samuel wolfs down his lunch. 
               Rachel eyes him a beat. then:

                                     RACHEL
                         Your sister said you don't have a 
                         family?

                                     BOOK
                         No.

                                     RACHEL
                         She thinks you should get married 
                         and have children of your own. Instead 
                         of trying to be a father to hers. 
                         Except she thinks you're afraid of 
                         the responsibility.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Oh? Anything else?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes. She thinks you like policing 
                         because you think you're right about 
                         everything. And you're the only one 
                         who can do anything. And that when 
                         you drink a lot of beer you say things 
                         like none of the other police would 
                         know a crook from a... um... bag of 
                         elbows.

               Book is staring at her. Rachel nods.

                                     RACHEL
                         I think that's what she said.

               Just then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing 
               looks from Book and a couple of passersby. Rachel smiles 
               proudly.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good appetite.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OUTER OFFICE/WAITING ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Rachel sits uneasily in the outer office, one or two police 
               clerks eyeing her curiously. A sign on the desk reads 
               "Narcotics Division."

               Rachel cranes forward trying to peer through a partially 
               open door.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION, POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               A group of Narcotics Detectives are interrupted in mid 
               conversation by the opening of the main office door. They 
               stare in considerable surprise.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JOHN BOOK

               Standing in the doorway, holding little Samuel by the hand.

                                     BOOK
                         Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you 
                         to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a 
                         little help.

               INT. SMALL OFFICE, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               A Narcotics Detective enters the room laden with several 
               volumes of mug shots. He puts them on the desk beside a 
               similar book which Samuel is intently studying. Sam sits on 
               the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker.

               The Detective, SGT. KAMAN, eyes Book a little suspiciously  
               internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the 
               working policemen in any department.

                                     KAMAN
                         There's a Sgt. Carter on the phone 
                         for you.

               Book gets up and moves to the door.

                                     KAMAN
                         And, Captain, don't want to rush 
                         you, but I'm gonna need these files 
                         back in a half hour. We got a lot of 
                         work to do round here.

               The two men leave. Samuel looks about before hopping off his 
               perch and following the direction taken by Book.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Through glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in 
               a cubicle of an office.

               Samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the 
               bustle of the squadroom.

               He crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques 
               and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of 
               outstanding duty and achievement.

               ANGLE THOUGH GLASS CASE

               As Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes 
               are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway.

               Until suddenly he freezes.

               SAMUEL'S POV  NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT

               Enlarged, prominently displayed. The headline reads: "Division 
               Chief McElroy Honored For Youth Project". Accompanying the 
               item is a large sidebar mug-shot of McElroy  clearly the 
               black man who murdered the young cop in the train station 
               men's room.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               He stares, transfixed.

               A long beat, then Book, lowering himself to one knee next to 
               Samuel, ENTERS FRAME.

               He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that 
               they've found their man. Samuel slowly raises his hand to 
               point at the photograph. Book gently takes the boy's small 
               hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes. 
               He smiles gently at the boy.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  PHILADELPHIA  DUSK

               Rachel is curled tight in her corner of the front seat holding 
               Samuel close. Book glances at her:

                                     RACHEL
                         Why don't you arrest that man? Are 
                         you protecting him because policeman?

                                     BOOK
                              (snaps)
                         Listen, I'm the cop that polices the 
                         police. I'm not in the business of 
                         protecting crooked cops.
                              (eases up)
                         I'll make an arrest when I know 
                         everybody involved.

               Rachel shakes her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         But why would they murder...

                                     BOOK
                         Because  somehow  they knew I was 
                         getting close.
                              (and)
                         Look, it's narcotics... They make 
                         dope out of chemicals... they sell 
                         it on the street for millions of 
                         dollars. They'll do anything.
                              (and)
                         And they can get away with it because 
                         they're cops.

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat, then)
                         I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I 
                         want to go home.

                                     BOOK
                         You'll be safe. You don't have to 
                         worry.

               She says nothing.

               Another beat, then:

                                     BOOK
                         Look, they're thinking as long as 
                         they keep the killer out of Samuel's 
                         way, we can't make an I.D. There's 
                         no way they can know Samuel saw that 
                         photograph, so he's safe.

               He glances at her, but she continues ahead.

                                     BOOK
                         I mean it. You will be safe.

               Suddenly Rachel explodes:

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we 
                         feel safe in a city where the police 
                         are so busy killing each other!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. / INT. SCHAEFFER HOME, PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS  NIGHT

               The front door of Schaeffer's upper-middle class home is 
               opened by his wife MARILYN. She knows Book and is surprised 
               and delighted to see him. In the background daughter KATHY 
               is visible. Schaeffer himself appears and Book is welcomed 
               inside.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S STUDY  NIGHT

               Schaeffer passes Book a drink.

               Book is excited, animated... the hunter, after a long chase, 
               closing on his quarry:

                                     BOOK
                         It was McElroy, Paul.

               Schaeffer gives him a sharp look:

                                     BOOK
                         Last guy I would have figured. But 
                         he's part of it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I hope you don't have any doubts 
                         about that.

                                     BOOK
                         If I did, I'd have kept my mouth 
                         shut...
                              (and)
                         It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons 
                         of P2P confiscated four years ago... 
                         Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.
                              (excited, explaining 
                              the thing eagerly)
                         He salts it away somewhere... he 
                         knows the stuff is potent, but the 
                         street chemists haven't figured out 
                         how to process it. But they do now.
                              (and)
                         And now the stuff is worth five-grand 
                         a pint and there are a lot of pints 
                         in a fifty-five gallon drum.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (beat)
                         Who else knows?

                                     BOOK
                         Just us.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (shakes his head)
                         Okay, what are you going to need to 
                         clean it up

                                     BOOK
                         More people... Gotta pick up where 
                         Zenovich left off. People from outside 
                         the department.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (nods)
                         Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards 
                         at Treasury. I'll take care of it.
                              (then)
                         I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut 
                         their balls off for me. I'm counting 
                         on you.

               Schaeffer pours himself another drink.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What's your first move?

                                     BOOK
                              (expels a breath)
                         A hot shower... I haven't changed 
                         clothes in two days.

               EXT. PARKING LOT  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being 
               locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports 
               section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward 
               his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports 
               section. He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts 
               to take a step... and looks up.

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the 
               other side of the parking lot crosswalk

               BACK TO BOOK

               Freezing, eyes widening. Utterly surprised and caught.

               MCELROY

               Still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping 
               bag (which he appeared to be carrying)  letting the shopping 
               bag fall away as he does so  revealing a five-inch barrel 
               Smith and Wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer. 
               Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he FIRES 
               once.

               BOOK

               Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven 
               into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as:

               MCELROY

               Coming right on, FIRING again... the pistol's report a 
               WHOOSHING, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne. 
               And McElroy still smiling as:

               BOOK

               Hit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send 
               Book down hard and grasping.

               MCELROY

               Lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two MEN, barely 
               taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book 
               toward McElroy.

               He smiles at them.

               BOOK

               Down, muttering CURSES.

               THE SCENE

               As McElroy walks past Book, drops the pistol to the pavement, 
               keeps on going... and is gone.

               BOOK

               GROANING in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like. And 
               we HEAR  from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream.

                                     SCHAEFFER (V.O.)
                         Who else knows?

                                     BOOK (V.O.)
                         Just us.

               As the lights of an oncoming car  going very slowly, on its 
               way to a parking space  sweep over him and we HEAR it come 
               to a sudden, squealing stop. Book is already trying to get 
               to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, 
               using an adjacent car for support. OFF SCREEN we HEAR a car 
               door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, 
               accompanied by excited voices. Book HEARS, turns to face the 
               oncomers,

               ANGLE

               A fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of 
               Book, looks on edgily:

                                     MAN
                         Hey, buddy, what's the score? Little 
                         too much to drink?

               Book stares at him, then looks down at his belly.

               BOOK'S WOUND

               As Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck 
               him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other 
               just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage).

               THE SCENE

               As the man stares:

                                     MAN
                         Goddamn, buddy. You better get to a 
                         hospital!
                              (and)
                         Here; I'll give you a hand.

               He starts to approach, but Book shoves him away.

                                     BOOK
                         No! No hospital!

               By now the man's WIFE is hovering at a safe distance:

                                     WIFE
                         Let him alone, Henry! If he wants to 
                         die in the street, that's his 
                         business!

               But the man is not content:

                                     MAN
                         Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at 
                         that blood?

               Book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to 
               intercept him:

                                     MAN
                         Come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed 
                         to death!

               Book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed 
               squarely at the fat man's face:

                                     MAN
                         Shit!

                         I told you, Henry!

               Book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is 
               sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at 
               the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back 
               toward his car.

               As he's awakened by the RINGING bedside telephone. He snaps

               in the wee hours. A woman sleeps beside him.

               As the door opens and Elaine switches on the light, rousing 
               Rachel. Elaine looks haggard.

                                     ELAINE
                         It's John. He says you have to leave 
                         now. He says it's urgent.

               She leaves the room as Rachel instantly awake, moves quickly 
               to rouse Samuel.

               EXT. BATHROOM DOOR

               Elaine is outside the bathroom listening to instructions 
               from her brother. From inside we hear the SOUND OF RUNNING 
               WATER. Elaine is puzzled but also senses the urgency.

                         never heard of that woman and her 
                         boy.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Book looks at himself in the mirror, his face is pale and 
               drawn.

               He examines the wound, a cleanly drilled hole through his 
               right side, just under the rib cage. The wound continues to 
               bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him, before putting 
               his shirt back on.

               He then carefully wipes away any traces of blood on basin 
               with tissues which he flushes down the toilet.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)

               As he drives across town. Samuel is curled up asleep, his 
               head on Rachel's lap.

               Book gives her a look.

                              (insistent)
                         What happened?

               But Book, glancing in his rearview mirror, tenses.

               HIS POV  MIRROR

               In it we can see a police car coming on fast, with lights 
               and SIREN.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rachel eyes Book warily.

               A beat, then the police car WAILS past. Book expels a breath.

                                     RACHEL
                         You said we would be safe in

               Rachel looks away, speaks almost sarcastically, MUTTERING.

               A couple of plainclothesmen have paused outside the door to 
               give him a look. Meets their eyes. They move on.

               Lancaster County.

               Book glances at Rachel; she's asleep. He coughs wrackingly, 
               hurting... cinches the belt of his overcoat even tighter. 
               And...

               As the car pulls up in the barnyard and Eli crosses to it.

               Suddenly the car door flies open and Samuel jumps out, races 
               across the barnyard to hurl himself into the old man.

               ANGLE AT CAR

               As Rachel steps out of the passenger's side, Book remains 
               seated.

               He lets his eyes travel around the farm.

                                     RACHEL
                         Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make

                         What about Samuel? Will you come 
                         back to take him to trial?

               Book starts the engine:

                         There isn't going to be one.

               Rachel stares at him, not sure what he means. Then backs 
               away, closing the door. Book begins to turn the car around 
               in the barnyard.

               ANGLE

               As Eli crosses to Rachel, his arm around Samuel.

               The car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now 
               bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field. It's knocked 
               over a tall birdhouse by the roadside. The car finally comes 
               to rest against a bank of earth.

               Eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon. He 
               hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot.

               ANGLE AT BOOK'S CAR

               We see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible 
               in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under 
               his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron. 
               Momentarily he comes awake:

                         But 

               Book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely:

                                     BOOK
                         And when they find me, they'll find 
                         your boy!

               He slips under again. Rachel stares at him, realizing the 
               price he's paid in returning them to safety.

               She reaches out, touches him gently.

               But the moment is broken by...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Eli reins up in the springwagon. He climbs down, crosses 
               to glance into the car.

                         Looks dead...

               And together they begin to lift Book from the car and place 
               him in the back of the springwagon. And...

               An Amish buggy coming up the drive, past Book' s car.

               Where Book lies on a bed. Rachel is bathing his wound with 
               warm water from a pan.

               Eli appears in the doorway.

                         Stoltzfus is coming.

               Rachel looks at him, nods.

               Eli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly 
               folded clothes on a chair near the bed.

                                     ELI
                         That has no place in this house.

               She picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places

               As Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily, 
               moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the 
               examination.

               Finally he steps back.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         This man should be treated in town.
                              (indicates)
                         The bullet entered there... and came 
                         out there. But there is the danger 
                         of infection, and he has lost a great 
                         deal of blood.

               Rachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her 
               dilemma.

               Her eyes fall on Samuel. Gently she ushers him from the room:

                                     RACHEL
                         Go help Levi with the car, Samuel.

               She closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and 
               Stoltzfus:

                                     RACHEL
                         No, he must stay here.

               Stoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look. And:

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if 
                         he dies? Then the sheriff will come. 
                         They'll say we broke their laws 

                                     RACHEL
                         We'll pray that he doesn't die! But 
                         if he does, then we'll find a way so 
                         no one knows!

                                     ELI
                         Rachel, this is a man's life, we 
                         hold it in our hands.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know God help me, I know that, 
                         Eli.
                              (then)
                         But I tell you that if he's found 
                         here, the people who did this to him 
                         will come for Samuel.

               Rachel beseeches them helplessly:

                                     RACHEL
                         What else can we do?

               EXT. LAPP DRIVE

               Levi has hitched Eli's mules to the rear of Book's car and 
               is towing it up the drive toward the barn, with Samuel 
               catching a ride on the bumper.

               RACHEL

               Where she's waiting with the big barn doors thrown open. As 
               the mules tow the car in, she closes the doors.

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM

               As Stoltzfus and Levi are about to go: Stoltzfus turns to 
               Rachel:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Make a poultice... three parts milk, 
                         two parts linseed oil... for the 
                         infection.

               I'll send Mary by with some teas I will brew myself.

                                     RACHEL
                         Thank you.

               Stoltzfus turns to Eli:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Lapp, I'll have to speak with the 
                         diener on this matter.

                                     ELI
                              (nods)
                         As you see fit, Stoltzfus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SICKROOM  LAPS FARM  NIGHT

               As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning 
               low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered.

               Book's brow is beaded with sweat.

               Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat-
               soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should 
               get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on 
               display here just now than she's quite comfortable with.

               She begins to apply the poultice.

               ANGLE

               As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he 
               recoils with alarm.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's all right! You have got to lie 
                         still.

               Book stares up at her without recognition, but some of what 
               she says seems to penetrate. He quiets.

                                     RACHEL
                              (soothingly)
                         Yes, much better...

               ANGLE

               As Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her 
               hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so.

               She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, 
               so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, 
               scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one 
               shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious 
               Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at 
               first, then the words take shape  swear words; curses; fuck 
               this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks 
               coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth. 
               She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind 
               her.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  DAY

               He's on the phone:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Looks like we're going to need some 
                         help from you folks down there.

               INT. LANCASTER COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE  DAY

               Where an UNDERSHERIFF is on the phone:

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         ...want to help any way we can, Chief, 
                         but you got to understand we've got 
                         upwards of seven thousand Amish over 
                         here.

               And that's just Lancaster County.

               INTERCUT SCHAEFFER

               Who is trying to control his impatience:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I've got the woman's name, Sheriff. 
                         Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should 
                         simplify your work.

               The Undersheriff frowns. He doesn't like being talked down 
               to.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         How about an address?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Ah... no.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                              (frowns)
                         Maybe a road or route number?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Sorry.

               The Undersheriff is not impressed.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third 
                         Amishman around here is named Lapp. 
                         That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler.
                              (and)
                         Chief, if the Amish have taken your 
                         man in, I wouldn't want to hang from 
                         a rope until you find him.

               ANGLE

               Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an 
                         education.

               He hangs up. A beat; the man is a study in frustration. Then 
               he glances up.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who 
               spotted Carter in Book's office in the earlier scene. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  DAY

               A bright, sunny afternoon.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's leading a team of horses to the barn. In the b.g. 
               three buggies are parked in the barnyard, traces empty. 
               Visitors.

               ANGLE IN SICKROOM

               Where Book lies in the bed. His fever seems to have subsided. 
               He's coming awake, tries to focus on the room.

               BOOK'S POV  CLERGY

               PANNING the four men in Amish black who are standing around 
               the bed looking down at Book, muttering among themselves in 
               German.

               These include TSCHANTZ, the district bishop, a hawk-nosed, 
               sterneyed old fellow; Stoltzfus, a deacon as well as a healer; 
               and two preachers, ERB and HERSHBERGER. Eli stands somewhat 
               apart.

               ANGLE

               Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes.

               Tschantz rumbles in German.

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to 
                         your credit.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         He was touched by God's hand.

               Tschantz grunts, motions, for the other clergy aside with 
               him.

               Rachel enters briskly with a steaming pot of tea and a cup, 
               smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Hello.

               Book stares at her, then at the old bearded gentlemen.

                                     BOOK
                              (closing his eyes)

                                     RACHEL
                         The leadership of our district... 
                         the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the 
                         one with no hair on top. They decided 
                         to come and see you for themselves. 
                         Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came 
                         the first day. I think he saved your 
                         life.

               Rachel brings him tea.

                                     BOOK
                         Does anybody know I'm here?

                                     RACHEL
                         Only the elders.

                                     BOOK
                         How long?

                                     RACHEL
                         What?

                                     BOOK
                         How long have I been here?

                                     RACHEL
                         Two days.

                                     BOOK
                              (a beat)
                         Listen, thank you. Thanks for 
                         everything. But I've got to go.

                                     RACHEL
                              (frowns)
                         But you can't.

               He tries to rise, falls back faint. Rachel rearranges the 
               sheet.

                                     RACHEL
                         See. Anyway, you don't have any 
                         clothes on. And besides that, Bishop 
                         Tschantz wants to talk to you when 
                         you feel better.

               The elders appear to have concluded their conference, and 
               are filing out. Stoltzfus pauses at bedside.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Rest, Mr. Book. That's the ticket. 
                         And drink my of my tea.

               He goes. Book is still fending off the dizziness. Rachel 
               puts the teacup to his lips.

                                     BOOK
                         Tell him his tea stinks.

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiles)
                         You tell him. When you're able.

               He looks like he's about to drop off again. Rachel rises.

                                     RACHEL
                              (from the door)
                         We're all very happy that you're 
                         going to live, John Book. We didn't 
                         quite know what we were going to do 
                         with you if you died.

               That penetrates for a moment just before Book slips into 
               sleep again.

               INT. LAPP LIVING ROOM  DAY

               As the rather worrisome Hershberger frowns:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         ...but a gunshot wound. Very serious.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         It is not the first time we have 
                         done this. In the Englischer war of 
                         the revolution, old Elmer Miller's 
                         grandfather took in gunshot English 
                         soldiers.
                              (a tad of pride)
                         Saved them, too.

               They all nod. What Tschantz says is well known. Then:

                                     ERB
                         Still, he should be among his own 
                         people.

               Rachel enters on this last.

                                     RACHEL
                         He'll leave as soon as he is able. 
                         He already wants to go.

               Hershberger gives her a gloomy look, turns to Stoltzfus:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         How long will that be, Stoltzfus?

                                     STOLTZFUS
                              (shrugs)
                         A month. Maybe less. With God's 
                         healing love.

               EXT. BOOK'S SISTER'S HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Schaeffer is knocking at the front doors. A beat, then Elaine 
               opens it cautiously, peers out.

                                     ELAINE
                              (half fearfully)
                         Did you find him?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Not yet.

               Suddenly her eyes blaze, she starts to close the door:

                                     ELAINE
                         Then go away, you bastard.

               Schaeffer quickly  but gently  prevents her from shutting 
               it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Elaine, I've come to apologize for 
                         Lt. McElroy. He overstated the 
                         department's position.

                                     ELAINE
                              (bitterly)
                         He accused John of taking kickbacks. 
                         And you know  anybody who knows 
                         John  knows that's a goddamn lie!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (smoothly)
                         Of course, Elaine. But as long as 
                         there's any question, better Johnny 
                         should come back and clear his name.

                                     ELAINE
                              (cuts in)
                         Better you should get off my front 
                         porch before I get my mace!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Elaine, I don't want to have to take 
                         you in for questioning. You've got 
                         his car, you were the last to see 
                         him 

                                     ELAINE
                              (clipped)
                         I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         But... if you had to guess?

               ANOTHER ANGLE  SCHAEFFER'S CAR

               McElroy watching.

               THEIR POV  FRONT DOOR

               We see a final exchange between Elaine and Schaeffer. Elaine 
               forces the door shut. Schaeffer turns, walks slowly to his 
               car.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S CAR

               As Schaeffer opens the door, climbs in, sinks wearily into 
               the seat, beside McElroy.

                                     MCELROY
                         She say where he is?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I don't think she knows.

               Schaeffer is staring grimly ahead.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What about Carter?

                                     MCELROY
                         Tight. But I'm working on him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lean on him.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  NIGHT

               REESTABLISHING, and TIGHTENING to the upstairs sickroom window 
               where a lamp dimly burns.

               INT. SICKROOM

               As Samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan. Book is lying asleep 
               on the bed.

               Samuel puts the bedpan down, checks to make sure Book is 
               indeed asleep, then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed 
               and opens the clothes chest.

               ANGLE

               Book's big .38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded 
               clothes.

               Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled 
               pistol grips. Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon 
               from the holster, then pauses to steal a look. OFF SCREEN...

               BOOK

               His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the 
               boy something of a jolt.

                                     BOOK
                         Give me that.

               Mutely, Samuel hands Book the pistol from arm's length. He 
               looks on as Book takes the pistol out of the holster, shoots 
               the boy another look, then snaps open the cylinder and shakes 
               out the heavy, copper-jacketed bullets into his palm. He 
               snaps the cylinder closed again, then nods to Samuel.

                         Come here.

               The boy edges closer.

                         You ever handle a pistol like this, 
                         Samuel?

                                     SAMUEL
                              (swallows)
                         No pistol. Ever.

                         Tell you what  I'm going to let you 
                         handle this one. But only if you 
                         promise not to say anything to your 
                         momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (grins)
                         Okay, Mr. Book.

               Book smiles. Then he gives the boy a playful, John Wayne-
               tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol, 
               demonstrating the action.

               He finally hands it over to Samuel, butt first.

                         Call me John.

               The boy tries to imitate Book's one-handed expertise, but 
               his hands are too small. Book smiles.

               Samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked, using two 
               hands, and Book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so 
               that it's not pointed at him.

                                     BOOK
                         You don't want to point that at people 
                         you just started calling by their 
                         first name.

               Samuel levels the pistol at the door and, just as he snaps 
               the trigger, Rachel enters, pulls up short in some dismay to 
               find her son has a gun pointed at her. Samuel blanches and 
               Book winces, knowing there's heavy weather ahead.

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         Samuel!

               Samuel quickly hands the pistol back to Book, who holsters 
               it:

                                     RACHEL
                         Wait for me downstairs.

               Samuel quickly exits, and Rachel angrily advances on Book.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, I would appreciate it if, 
                         during the time you are with us, you 
                         would have as little to do with Samuel 
                         as possible.

                                     BOOK
                         Nobody meant any harm. The boy was 
                         curious. I unloaded the gun -

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not the gun. Don't you 
                         understand... It's you. What you 
                         stand for.
                              (and)
                         That is not for Samuel.

               Book looks at her thoughtfully.

               Rachel softens a bit:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, it has nothing to do with 
                         you personally.

               He hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets.

                                     BOOK
                         Put it up someplace Samuel can't get 
                         it.

               A beat, then Rachel, takes the pistol and starts to go. Book 
               stops her:

                                     BOOK
                         Friends?

               Rachel glances back at him, smiles and nods. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN  LAPP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book's holstered gun and bullets at center table. Eli sits 
               on one side, a chastened Samuel on the other. Rachel looks 
               on from the b.g.

               Eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will 
               ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central 
               pillars of the Amish way.

                                     ELI
                         The gun  that gun of the hand  is 
                         for the taking of human life. Would 
                         you kill another man? Eh?

               Samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. Eli 
               leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially.

                                     ELI
                         What you take into your hands, you 
                         take into your heart.

               A beat, then Samuel musters some defiance.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I would only kill a bad man.

                                     ELI
                         Only a bad man. I see. And you know 
                         these bad men on sight? You are able 
                         to look into their hearts and see 
                         this badness?

                                     SAMUEL
                         I can see what they do.

               Now he meets Eli's eyes:

                                     SAMUEL
                         I have seen it.

               Eli expels a deep sigh; then:

                                     ELI
                         And having seen, you would become 
                         one of them?
                              (intent... gesturing)
                         Don't you see...? The hand leads the 
                         arm leads the shoulder leads the 
                         head... leads the heart. The one 
                         goes into the other into the other 
                         into the other... And you have 
                         changed, and gone amongst them...

               He breaks off, bows his head for a moment. Then he fixes the 
               boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly 
               into the tabletop with enormous intensity:

                                     ELI
                         "Wherefore come out from among them 
                         and be ye separate, saith the Lord!"

                                     ELI
                              (indicating pistol; 
                              continuing from 
                              Corinthians 6:17)
                         "And touch not the unclean thing!"

               His intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely 
               impressive.

               EXT. WASHHOUSE  NEAR KITCHEN  NIGHT 

               Book stands near the door to the kitchen, and has heard most 
               or all of Eli's words. He turns, and painfully makes his way 
               into the washhouse, moving quietly, hoping no one will come 
               out from the kitchen.

               EXT. BARN  LAPP FARM  DAY

               Samuel harnesses up the family mare, and backs her into the 
               traces of the buggy.

               INT. BOOK'S BEDROOM  DAY

               Book stands at the window in a worn robe. Below, through the 
               window, we can see Samuel and Eli in the barnyard. A beat, 
               then Book crosses impatiently back to his bed, sits down, 
               picks up a dog-earred copy of The American Dairyman. There's 
               a stack of well-thumbed farm magazines and copies of The 
               Budget (the Amish newspaper) on the bedside table.

               There's a knock. Rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing. 
               She smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Enjoying your reading?

                         Yes. It's good that someone can have 
                         the use of them. Besides, in your

               EXT. FARMHOUSE  DAY

               Eli calls impatiently from the buggy. Samuel sits beside 
               him.

                                     ELI
                         Hurry up now, John Book!

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Rachel washing dishes turns on hearing Book enter. She laughs 
               out loud at the sight of him in his Amish gear, and rightly 
               so  the pants are highwater, the hat low-rise, the jacket 
               ill-fitting.

               Book looks self-conscious, even a little sheepish.

               Outside another SHOUT from Eli.

                                     RACHEL
                         You'd better go.

               Book looks embarrassed.

                         My... eh... gun?

               The smile fades from Rachel's face as she reaches up into a 
               cupboard. She passes the gun in its holster to Book. He 
               fastens it about him. The contradiction of an "Armed Amishman" 
               increases the awkwardness between them. Book turns his back 
               to her and checks the weapon. He turns back to her smiling 
               in an odd way.

                         Oh. The bullets.

               She takes them out of a disused coffee jar, passes them to 
               Book.

               INT. BUGGY  COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

               Samuel sits between Eli and Book. Both men stare straight 
               ahead.

               Eli looks particularly stern. It's pretty clear he doesn't 
               like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith.

               EXT. AMISH ONE-TEACHER-SCHOOL  DAY

               With awave Samuel runs into the schoolyard to join his 
               friends. A teacher begins ringing a bell.

               INT. STORE  SALTZBURG

               Book on the telephone waiting for his call to be answered. 
               He looks about him  several Amish and Dithers mingle in the 
               shop.

               Book-has gotten a coke from a machine, seems a bit self-
               conscious shout it sips at it surreptitiously... A voice 
               comes on the line; it's that of Book's partner.

                         Yeah?

               A silence.

                         Listen, Johnny, don't do anything 
                         stupid. You couldn't get within a 
                         mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay

                         know when maybe it makes sense.

               A beat as Book considers that.

                                     CARTER
                              (edgily)

                                     CARTER
                         That's more like it.
                              (and)
                         Where are you at, anyway?

               Book allows himself a small smile, regarding his Amish image 
               reflected in the window of the store.

                                     BOOK
                         Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

                                     CARTER
                              (uncomprehending)
                         Say again?

                         Make that 1790.

               He hangs up. A beat, then he stares toward the door of the 
               store.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book works on his car. The battery has gone flat and he's 
               trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted 
               under the front seat of the Lapp buggy.

               Eli stands at the barn door staring at him, again the 
               disapproving look.

                                     ELI
                         If you are well enough to do that 
                         thing, you can do work for me.

               Book is genuinely apologetic.

                                     BOOK
                         Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind 
                         me plugging in to your battery. Mine's 
                         dead... How can I help? What can I 
                         do?

                                     ELI
                         Maybe milking.

               Where Book lies asleep. A beat, then Eli comes in carrying a 
               lamp.

               He pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with 
               undisguised anticipation. Then he gives him a jarring thump:

                                     ELI
                              (briskly)
                         Veck oufl. Time for milking.

               Book comes groggily awake as Eli exits. He gropes for his 
               watch.

               INSERT WATCHFACE

               It reads 4:30 a.m.

               BACK TO BOOK

               As he stares at it in disbelief.

               INT. BARN

               As the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with 
               Samuel prodding them along, headed for the milking stalls. 
               Book looks on in the lamplight, nonplused.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's pitching hay into the cow's feed-troughs.

               BOOK, ELI

               Where the old man is showing Book how to milk a cow by hand. 
               We see Rachel watching from the milkhouse door (steam from 
               scalding milk cans rising behind her).

                                     ELI
                         Good, firm twist and pull, eh?
                              (and)
                         Right. Now you try it.

               Book gives him a look, takes over the milking stool. The cow 
               shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder. Book 
               bends to his task.

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You 
                         never had your hands on a teat before?

                         Not one this big.

               Eli unexpectedly finds this hilarious, cackles, gives Book a 
               comradely, man-of-the-world thump on the shoulder that jars 
               him.

               Then he moves off. Book bends to his task, and...

               ANGLE  RACHEL

               Grinning, giggling, covering her mouth with one hand.

               As he pours a pail full of milk into a large, stainless steel 
               milk can.

               Something in him can't help but respond to the beauty.

               A beat, then he blows on his hands, rubs them briskly together 
               against the morning chill, and turns back to the barn.

               It is later in the morning. Rachel comes out onto the porch, 
               tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass, looks 
               toward the barn.

               As Samuel brings Luke out. Eli is now harnessing the other 
               mule of the team to a large manure-spreader. But as Luke 
               nears Book, his eyes widen and he shies, almost hauling Samuel 
               off his feet.

                                     BOOK
                              (alarmed)
                         Careful, son 

               Book moves to Samuel's aid; a gesture which proves a serious 
               mistake. Luke erupts into a SCREAMING, bucking cyclone. Samuel 
                who no doubt has been here before  dives nimbly for cover 
               as a flying hoof nearly takes Book's head off.

               Then Eli hustles into the fray, pushing Book aside as he 
               BELLOWS belligerently in German at the rearing animal. Finally 
               he gives Luke a swat upside the head that seems, somehow, to 
               have the effect of quieting the beast instantly.

               ANGLE

               Samuel gives the shaken Book a look:

                                     SAMUEL
                         That's Luke. He doesn't like 
                         strangers.

                                     BOOK
                              (still shaken)
                         You don't say.

               Eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces, grunting at 
               Book.

                                     ELI
                         Have to teach you mules, too, I guess.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FIELD NEAR FARMHOUSE  DAY

               Book collects the pieces of the birdhouse which his car 
               knocked down the day of his attempted departure. He pauses 
               as a figure approaches. We recognize Daniel Hochstetler, 
               Rachel's would-be suitor. He heads for Book with an outgoing 
               smile and outstretched hand. Here's a likable man who likes 
               people.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good morning. Book, is it? You are 
                         the Yankee they talk about?

                                     BOOK
                         I thought I was the English.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         English, Yankee. It's the same. My 
                         name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.
                              (sizes up his clothes)
                         You look plain, Book.
                              (grinning)
                         Very plain.

               Book is not particularly amused.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I came to see Rachel Lapp.

                                     BOOK
                         Try the house.

               Hochstetler gives Book a powerful clap on the shoulder.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (genially)
                         You bet. you take care of yourself.

               Hochstetler heads for the house. Book stares after him with 
               some interest.

               ANGLE

               As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him. She also 
               catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion 
               crossing her expression for an instant.

               And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either.

               Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome.

               HOG PENS

               Book, having gathered up the pieces of the bird house, is 
               headed toward the outbuildings, passing by hog pens. He 
               glances toward the house:

               HIS POV  THE BACK PORCH

               Where Rachel and Hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing, 
               sharing a pitcher of lemonade.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Thoughtful... He glances at the hog pen as a huge sow SQUEALS 
               and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she 
               can feed.

               INT. CARPENTRY SHOP, LAPP FARM  DAY

               Book works on repairing the broken birdhouse when Rachel 
               enters.

               He uses a drawknife on a piece of 2x4, with some obvious 
               expertise.

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the 
                         district. He and his father built 
                         the big house themselves forty years 
                         ago.

                         We had some lemonade and he left.

                         A real fireball.

               Rachel smiles. Book crosses to a workbench and selects another 
               tool.

                                     RACHEL
                         You know carpentry?

                                     BOOK
                         I did some carpentry summers when I 
                         was going to school.

                                     RACHEL
                         What else can you do?

                                     RACHEL
                         Whacking is not of much use on a 
                         farm.

                         Now hold on. There's a lot of people

                         job.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.

               She turns, starts to go. Then turns back, eyeing his makeshift 
               garb:

                                     RACHEL
                         Tonight I'll let out those trousers 
                         for you.

               Stifling a smile, she goes. HOLD on Book a beat, then...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  DINING ROOM

               Eli is seated at the head of the table, Book opposite Samuel 
               and Rachel. The table is piled high with an incredible amount 
               of food.

               Eli eyes Book cagily, waves his fork at him:

                                     ELI
                         Eat up, Book. What's the matter with 
                         your appetite?

                                     BOOK
                         Guess I'm not used to so much.

                                     ELI
                              (snorts)
                         Not used to hard work. That's what 
                         makes an appetite.

               Book swallows that one. With difficulty. Rachel intervenes:

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli, John is a carpenter.
                              (conciliatory 
                              afterthought)
                         As well as being a fine policeman.

                                     ELI
                         Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to 
                         Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how 
                         good a carpenter.

               Book can't refuse the challenge.

                                     BOOK
                         Sure.

                                     RACHEL
                         But... You may not be well enough.

               EXT. / INT. BARN  NIGHT

               As Rachel, lamp in hand, walks up to the barn. She looks in 
               to find Book tinkering with the battery hookup to the Lapp 
               buggy.

               He glances up as she enters:

                                     BOOK
                         Hi...

               As she sets her lamp down near the one he's using.

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat)
                         When will you be going?

                                     BOOK
                         Not long... A few days.

               Another beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the 
               battery power, hits the radio  and suddenly from the 
               Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major 
               inventions  rock and roll.

               It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more 
               even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's 
               his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous 
               as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in 
               Amish.

               Rachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book 
               sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel 
               alternately protesting and laughing.

                                     BOOK
                         You like it... Don't you?

               Rachel, confused, protests:

                                     RACHEL
                         No... You just stop 

               But she doesn't really want to. Book grins:

                                     BOOK
                              (mock alarm)
                         Next thing you know you'll be off 
                         drinking beer and racing motorcycles.

               And it goes on... Rachel alternately protesting and laughing.

               ANGLE  THE BARN DOOR

               As Eli suddenly appears. He glowers for an instant, 
               thunderstruck, then BELLOWS:

                                     ELI
                         Rachel!

               THE SCENE

               As Book and Rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt. Both 
               turn, look at Eli. Rachel regards him level-eyed, without 
               discernible alarm. Book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over, 
               turns off the radio, as:

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         What is this? This Myusick?

               Book hesitates, then starts to say something:

                                     BOOK
                         It's not her fault. I 

               But he gets such a look from Eli that he turns, goes out.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         How can this be? How can you do such 
                         a thing? Is this plain? Is this the 
                         ordnung?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have done nothing against the 
                         ordnung.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this 
                         man to our house. With his gun of 
                         the hand. You bring fear to this 
                         house. Fear of English with guns 
                         coming after. You bring blood and 
                         whispers of more blood. Now English 
                         music... and you are dancing to 
                         English music! And you call this 
                         nothing?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have committed no sin.

                                     ELI
                              (in English)
                         No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, 
                         it does not look...
                              (tone softening... in 
                              the dialect)
                         Don't you know there has been talk? 
                         Talk about you, not him. Talk about 
                         going to the Bishop. About having 
                         you... shunned!

                                     RACHEL
                         That is idle talk.

                                     ELI
                              (in English, pleading)
                         Do not make light of it, Rachel. 
                         They can do it... quick! Like that! 
                         And then... then I can not sit at 
                         table with you. I can not take a 
                         thing from your hand. I... I can not 
                         go with you to meeting!
                              (the old man almost 
                              breaks down as, in 
                              the dialect)
                         Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go 
                         too far! Dear child!

               Rachel is annoyed  also touched, no doubt, by the old man's 
               plea  but irked by his condescending tone.

                                     RACHEL
                         I am not a child.

                                     ELI
                              (suddenly stern again)
                         You are acting like one!

                                     RACHEL
                         I will be the judge of that.

                                     ELI
                              (fierce as a prophet)
                         No! They will be the judge of that! 
                         And so will I... if you shame me!

                                     RACHEL
                              (blinking a tear now, 
                              but meeting his gaze)
                         You shame yourself.

               And shaken  but proud and erect  she turns and walks out.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  NIGHT

               Carter sits, Schaeffer prowls... slowly, letting silences 
               grow before he strikes again with another softly-snarled 
               question or statement.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You know where he is.

                                     CARTER
                         Wrong.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You'd lie to protect him.

                                     CARTER
                              (cool)
                         Probably.

               Schaeffer snaps around, glares at him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You admit you're lying?

                                     CARTER
                              (shakes head)
                         I admit I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You're the first one he'll contact.

                                     CARTER
                              (sighing)
                         He's got my number.

               Schaeffer stops, stands in front of Carter, takes a deep 
               breath... suddenly smiles. And is abruptly (as he is capable 
               of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason. He even 
               CHUCKLES as he begins:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         It's funny. I know he's hiding 
                         somewhere with the Amish, I know it.
                              (a quick glance at 
                              Carter)
                         Can you imagine John Book at a prayer 
                         meeting? Our John Book?

               Schaeffer CHUCKLES again, looks hopefully again at Carter.

               Carter looks back, stony-eyed. Schaeffer makes another abrupt 
               shift in form... but still speaks softly.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Either you're a member of the club 
                         or you aren't, Elton.
                              (he nods his head, as)
                         Tell me what you know...

                                     CARTER
                         What I know, Paul, is...
                              (nodding his head)
                         He's going to take you out...

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               As Book pauses by the barn door, glances over his shoulder.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               With trace horse harnessed... Samuel and Eli loading 
               provisions into the buggy, standing down by the house.

               BACK TO BOOK  INT. / EXT. BARN

               As he goes into the barn.

               Book approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the 
               temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his 
               hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches.

               Book starts to talk gently to the animal:

                                     BOOK
                         All right, you nasty son of a bitch, 
                         we're going to be friends whether 
                         you like it or not.

               Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall 
               gate.

               ANGLE

               As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, 
               brings out some lumps of sugar.

                                     BOOK
                         See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't 
                         you for Christ's sake?

               Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends 
               to eat. Book nods with satisfaction.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled 
               expression.

                                     RACHEL
                              (surprised)
                         Well...

               Book turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment!

                                     BOOK
                         Won him over just like that.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see.
                              (and)
                         But I hope you have a lot of sugar.
                              (then, going)
                         Eli is ready to go to Zook's.

               Just then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a 
               nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him 
               skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go:

                                     BOOK
                         Later.

               And we...

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               BIG SHOT... it's early morning as the Amish buggies are 
               arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising.

               In the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the 
               construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun 
               raising the main supports on the already laid foundation.

               Elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are 
               spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot 
               coffee and cold lemonade for the men,

               LAPP BUGGY

               As Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the 
               construction site.

                                     ELI
                         Wait here 'til I find a gang you can 
                         work with.

               He goes. Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and 
               more workmen and their families climb out.

               Eli appears with Hochstetler in tow. Hochstetler's broad 
               face breaks into a grin:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Book! Good to see you!

               He pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting 
               and pleasantry to Rachel. She looks on, amused.

               Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his 
               showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance.

               And Book realizes it as well.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.

                                     BOOK
                         It's been a while.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         No matter. Come with me. We can always 
                         use a good carpenter.

               With that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and 
               ushers him away. Rachel calls after them:

                                     RACHEL
                         Good luck.

               BOOK / HOCHSTETLER

               As they move off.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Your hole is healed, then?

                                     BOOK
                              (gives him a look)
                         Pretty much.

               Hochstetler nods with satisfaction:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good. Then you can go home.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CUTS

               As the morning progresses:

               ...Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers 
               on big sawhorses. There's an unmistakable atmosphere of 
               competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely 
               unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the 
               gang.

               ...or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems  without leaning 
               on it too heavily  to be measuring the two men as the morning 
               progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of 
               them.

               ...Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with 
               sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising 
               the construction. All around them the structure is rising 
               with remarkable rapidity.

               ...Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge 
               noon meal. Other women are sitting on benches in the b.g., 
               knitting or doing quiltwork.

               ...Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a 
               group of boys his own age. Elsewhere we see little girls 
               "botching" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes).

               ...The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs 
               in the sunlight, looking on  the old men kibitzing in German, 
               the women gossiping.

               Until...

               BIG SHOT

               Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead... at 
               least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about 
               the barn framework...

               ...some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job, 
               others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and 
               what-all... so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing 
               up before our very eyes. And there isn't a power tool in 
               sight.

               WOMEN'S AREA

               As Rachel crosses near the benches... we can see other women 
               eyeing her, whispering among themselves, some tittering. 
               Rachel ignores them.

               She joins the stoutly amiable Mrs. Yoder from the funeral 
               sequence earlier. The older woman is emptying a big pan of 
               fried chicken into serving platters. She smiles, obviously 
               liking Rachel.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Everyone has an idea about you and 
                         the English.

                                     RACHEL
                         All of them charitable, I'm sure.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Hardly any of them.

               ANGLE  THE ROOFBEAM

               Book and Hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs, holding 
               them together prior to nailing them to the roof-beam. They 
               are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another, 
               way out at the far end of the roof.

               Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start 
               to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them.

               Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof 
               with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it 
               back together.

               Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe.

               Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Nail it!

                                     BOOK
                         Yes, sir.

               And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding, 
               looks on.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BIG SHOT

               The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters. 
               It's late afternoon.

               ANGLE ON BOOK

               He hesitates. His face is pale and covered with sweat. The 
               exertion of the day has taken its toll. He's in danger of 
               fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. But he's 
               determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, 
               nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. Hochstetler 
               guesses the situation. He moves beside Book, claps an arm 
               about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book. From 
               below, someone TELLS them to hurry up.

               Hochstetler shouts:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         We admire our work!

               The moment passes for Book, and he's okay. Hochstetler removes 
               his supporting arm. Book looks him in the eye, nods his 
               appreciation almost imperceptibly. Hochstetler wants no 
               thanks, and Book knows it. Hochstetler gives him a resounding 
               SLAP on the back, and starts climbing down. Book follows.

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  EVENING

               The gathering has congregated to hear Bishop Tschantz offer 
               up a blessing on the new barn.

               CONGREGATION

               PANNING the faces as they listen to the heavy German words 
               rolling out over the still evening air.

               Book stands a little to one side of the Amish. The prayers 
               he cannot share with them. Rachel is aware of this, feels 
               something of his emotion. She looks toward him, then she too 
               closes her eyes and drifts away from him, into the soothing 
               prayer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  NIGHT

               Book stands outside, listening to the NIGHT SOUNDS. He turns, 
               walks up toward the porch.

               EXT. PORCH  TARP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book takes a seat in a chair, SIGHS, looks toward the night 
               sky.

               There is a SOUND, but it's a moment before he turns his eyes 
               toward the door.

               ANGLE  THE DOOR

               Samuel standing there in his nightshirt.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Book leans forward in his chair.

                                     BOOK
                         Hey, Sam...

                                     SAMUEL
                         ...I want to say a thing.

                                     BOOK
                              (sitting up)
                         What's that, Sam?

               The boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts 
               across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly... 
               then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving 
               the door open behind him.

               ANGLE  BOOK

               Looking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he 
               speaks softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Same to you, Sam.

               After another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door 
               that Samuel has left open behind him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               From the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to 
               the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see 
               where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor. 
               The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks 
               softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Sam?

               No answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind 
               him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen.

               INT. LAPP WASHHOUSE  NIGHT

               Where Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is 
               pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub.

               She replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of 
               her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back 
               of a chair.

               Then she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath.

               RACHEL'S POV  FRYING PAN

               The gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over 
               the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image 
               reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rachel hesitates for a moment  and in that moment she makes 
               a choice.

               Slowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his 
               eyes.

               And for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of 
               eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, 
               for an instant, a woman of Book's world.

               BOOK

               As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable 
               to make it happen.

               And suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, 
               picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting 
               it on, looks away.

               BOOK

               TIGHTENING to him, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE  HEN YARD

               Where Rachel is scattering feed to the chickens.

               A beat, then Book approaches from behind her. A moment, as 
               she senses his presence.

               Book watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing 
               them in the fold of her apron.

               When he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work.

                                     BOOK
                         Last night.

               She goes very still, but keeps her back to him.

                                     BOOK
                         If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't 
                         leave.

               She lowers her head slightly, but remains turned away from 
               him.

               Book continues to stare at her.

               EXT. RURAL ROAD  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               The Lapp carriage on a winding lane.

               INT. BUGGY (MOVING)

               Rachel is driving, Book sitting next to her. Samuel is in 
               the back, looking out the rear window and not paying any 
               attention to the adults.

               A beat, then a large produce truck roars past them. It's all 
               Book can do to keep from flinching.

               Rachel stares straight ahead. Book glances at her.

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe I ought to learn to drive this 
                         thing.

               Rachel says nothing.

                                     BOOK
                              (beat)
                         Pick myself up another useful skill.

               Now Rachel can't help but smile. She looks at him. And...

               EXT. ANGLE

               We can see the Lapp buggy approaching a rural intersection, 
               another buggy approaching at right angles.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel eyes the other buggy through the windshield.

                                     RACHEL
                         Samuel, who is that?

               Samuel checks out the buggy.

                                     SAMUEL
                         It looks like Hochstetler's mare.

               EXT. ANGLE

               As the Lapp buggy passes the intersection and the Hochstetler 
               buggy swings in behind them. Then the Hochstetler buggy, 
               coming on at a faster clip, starts to pass the Lapp buggy.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel waves at the occupants of the other buggy; Daniel 
               returns her greeting:

                                     BOOK
                              (teasing her)
                         Uh oh, they're leaving us behind.

               Rachel gives him a look, and... gives the reins a flick  
               the race is on.

               RACE MONTAGE

               Hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together 
               with his young sister  at first they're not aware of the 
               race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and 
               gives his horse a couple of whoops. The buggies are neck and 
               neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly.

               It's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off 
               Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she 
               gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers 
               of Samuel and Book.

               EXT. SALZBURGSTORE  DAY

               It's a Saturday afternoon in the tourist season, and they're 
               everywhere  taking shots of anything Amish. There's a ROWDY 
               YOUNG ELEMENT amongst them who are making their presence 
               fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.

               Book and Rachel get out of the buggy. Samuel stays inside; 
               the crowds make him nervous. A huge tourist bus billowing 
               smoke pulls up nearby.

               Rachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's 
               stopped by a TOURIST LADY with an instamatic camera... She 
               waggles the camera at him...

                                     TOURIST LADY
                         Could I... ah, you know?

                                     BOOK
                              (smiling)
                         Lady, if you take my picture, I'll 
                         rip your brassiere off and strangle 
                         you with it.

               The Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her 
               grin frozen on her face. Then she begins to scuttle back 
               from whence she came.

               INT. STORE

               Rachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company 
               of a young Amish woman, Ellie Beiler. Rachel is carrying 
               Ellie's tiny baby, and the infant is getting as much attention 
               as the shopping.

               Book is standing at a wall pay phone in the b.g. We TIGHTEN

                         Lieutenant Elton Carter, please.

               A beat, then we hear the FILTERED VOICE of the Philadelphia 
               Police Department switchboard:

                                     VOICE

                                     VOICE
                         I'm sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter 
                         was killed in the line of duty...

               Book hangs up. His breathing is thrown out by the shock of 
               the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain 
               control. He hesitates, unsure of his next move. He makes to 
               move away, then he turns back, finds more coins and dials a 
               second number.

               Schaeffer's wife answers the phone; she is momentarily

               She calls for her husband, then makes polite conversation.

                         How are you, John?

               Paul Schaeffer appears, slightly irritated at being called 
               away from the Saturday afternoon game.

                                     MRS. SCHAEFFER

               Book hangs up the phone and the dead CLICK registers on 
               Schaeffer.

               Book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second 
               to unclench his fist. Then it takes something else to resist 
               his first impulse, which is to smash out at something... 
               Training. Get it under control. Deal rationally with the 
               situation.

               He straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat/tears from his 
               eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the Saltzburg General 
               Store.

               but doesn't ask about it. He stares straight ahead, oblivious 
               to the surroundings of the street, now crawling with tourists

               The buggy turns into the side street. Some hundred yards 
               ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road  
               several youths gathered about it. A pickup truck is stopped,

               Rachel is at first puzzled, then makes a small face, looks 
               at Book.

               Rachel puts a restraining hand on Book's arm.

               them being dirty etc. One jabs an ice cream cone into 
               Hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle 
               on his forehead. Another fools about with the horse causing

                         Here comes another one!

               Book stops, his path blocked by the third youth. The youth 
               flicks off Book's hat.

                                     BOOK
                              (quietly)
                         You're making a mistake.

               Hochstetler calls from his buggy.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Everything is all right, John.

                                     BOOK
                              (to the youth)
                         Pick up the hat.

               The youth momentarily unsure  something about Book's tone 
               of voice. The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps 
               on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head. A 
               pause, then Book explodes.

               The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he 
               hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth 
               grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into 
               him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. 
               He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting. 
               Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd 
               is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book 
               shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a 
               kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction 
               of the Lapp farm.

               The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back 
               to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD 
               LOCAL addresses Rachel.

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         Never seen anything like that in all 
                         my years.

                                     RACHEL
                              (covering)
                         He's from... Ohio... My cousin.

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         We'll, them Ohio Amish sure must be 
                         different.
                              (addresses a gathering 
                              crow)
                         Our Lancaster brethren, they just 
                         don't have that kind of fight in 
                         them.

                                     RACHEL
                         John, lost control of himself. He... 
                         will be repentant.

                                     LOCAL MAN
                              (to Rachel)
                         You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes. Samuel! We're going.

               A second man calls from the pickup.

                                     SECOND MAN
                         Kid's nose is broken!

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         We'll take him up the hospital. Good-
                         day to you, Mrs. Lapp.
                              (he shouts after her)
                         This ain't good for the tourist trade, 
                         you know! You tell that to your Ohio 
                         cousin!

               But Rachel is already steering past the scene and following 
               the by now distant figure of John Book.

               EXT. BARN / CARPENTER'S SHOP  DUSK

               Book comes out of the carpenter's shop carrying the repaired 
               birdhouse on its pole in one hand, a shovel in the other.

               Rachel is shepherding the milking cows toward the barn.

                                     RACHEL
                         You should not bother with that 
                         birdhouse.
                              (a beat)
                         If you're leaving tomorrow.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm leaving tonight.
                              (and)
                         I'm going to need my clothes. And my 
                         gun.

               She nods, looks away... looks back at him twice in glances. 
               There is a moment when it appears she might either bark at 
               him or begin to weep. He waits. When she does turn to him, 
               she speaks softly:

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I thought you 
                         might have stayed.

                                     BOOK
                              (hesitating... then)
                         There was.

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I would have 
                         welcomed it.

                                     BOOK
                              (after a beat)
                         I know.

                                     RACHEL
                              (asking)
                         I was being foolish?

                                     BOOK
                         No.
                              (and)
                         I was being unrealistic. Even thinking 
                         about living this life.

                                     RACHEL
                         You're so sure of that?

                                     BOOK
                         Aren't you? After today?

                                     RACHEL
                              (almost conceding it, 
                              but... her voice 
                              rising a bit, annoyed)
                         I'm not so sure of anything as you 
                         are, John Book. You could live this 
                         life if you wanted to bad enough.
                              (a beat)
                         Just as I could live yours!

                                     BOOK
                              (almost groaning)
                         Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.

                                     RACHEL
                         There is always a way! But you are 
                         such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot 
                         see! You'd rather go back to that 
                         city! To nothing! No woman! No 
                         children! No land!

                                     BOOK
                              (now getting annoyed)
                         Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman 
                         and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's 
                         what I know and that's what I do!

                                     RACHEL
                         What you do is take vengeance! Which 
                         is a sin against heaven!

                                     BOOK
                         That's your way, not mine.

                                     RACHEL
                         That's God's way!

                                     BOOK
                         Well in the City of Philadelphia, 
                         God needs a little help!

               He has offended her, immediately knows it, but can't bring 
               himself to make an instant apology. But he's chewing on it 
               when she takes the moment unto herself. She pulls herself 
               up, speaks with great dignity:

                                     RACHEL
                         I could never love a man who was 
                         so... little.

               He looks at her, sad-eyed, his anger ebbing and gone, 
               realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman... never even 
               get close to such a one. He appears to start to speak, but 
               then does not.

               She turns, moves away a few steps, stops, looks back at him. 
               she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with 
               some difficulty, emotion welling in her words.

                                     RACHEL
                         The other night... when you saw me 
                         after my bath... I... I tried to 
                         look as I thought you would want a 
                         woman to look.
                              (sadly... but with a 
                              slight, proud lift 
                              of chin)
                         I am sorry... that I did not.

               She holds for an instant, then turns and walks off.

               BOOK

               Looking after her. A face full of loss.

               INT. KITCHEN  DUSK

               Eli is lighting the lamps. Samuel reads a book at the kitchen 
               table. Rachel moves slowly to the sink and begins washing a 
               few dishes. She looks out the window.

               CLOSE on her face, a strange expression.

               INT. / EXT RACHEL'S POV  DUSK

               The distant figure of Book working on the birdhouse.

               INT. KITCHEN

               CLOSE on Rachel's hands, lifting items slowly up and of the 
               water to the draining board, where she places them carefully 
               down. She shakes the water off her hands.

               CLOSE on her face, still staring fixedly out the window. She 
               speaks without turning around.

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli, would you see Samuel to bed?

               The old man glances at her; this is not their routine.

               EXT. DRIVEWAY  DUSK

               In the rapidly fading light, Rachel walks slowly toward Book.

               CLOSE on her face, staring straight ahead toward Book.

               ANGLE on Book, CLOSE. He turns and watches Rachel's approach.

               BIG WIDE ANGLE

               The light now nearly gone, the NIGHT SOUNDS beginning, as 
               Rachel reaches Book and they embrace.

               EXT. FIELD BY ROAD  NIGHT

               Book and Rachel in a passionate embrace, sink to the still 
               warm earth and make love.

               ESTABLISHING an all-night cafe in the early hours of the 
               morning.

               TIGHTENING to the bleakly lighted windows.

               INT. CARE

               A booth, where Schaeffer and McElroy and Fergie, a Lancaster 
               County Undersheriff and his SHERIFF  an expansive politician 
               type  are seated.

               The Undersheriff eyes Schaeffer narrowly. The Sheriff has a 
               county map spread out on the table, amid breakfast dishes, 
               pointing directions to Schaeffer:

                                     SHERIFF
                         There... White Oak Road a couple of 
                         miles before it ties into two-twenty-
                         two. Got it?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Got it. We owe you one, Sheriff.

                                     SHERIFF
                         My man Holmes here put it together. 
                         Fine officer, Chief. He spoke to the 
                         doctor at the hospital.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked 
                         on the phone.
                              (nods at Holmes)
                         Good work.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Sure you don't want us to post some 
                         backup units?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         If we need any help, we'll give you 
                         a shout. I'd like to slip in there 
                         quiet, then get out before we attract 
                         any attention.

               EXT. CAFE PORCH  DAY

               As Schaeffer and his men are climbing into their car. Holmes 
               and the Sheriff watch after them.

                                     HOLMES
                         Maybe I'll take a drive over that 
                         way.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Let 'em be. It's their dirty laundry.

               But Holmes pauses to watch Schaeffer's car pull out.

               EXT. RURAL LANE  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAWN

               With the first light of dawn on the eastern horizon, 
               Schaeffer's car approaches along the lane, pulls into the 
               Lapp driveway and comes to a halt.

               In the b.g. we can make out the farmhouse and outbuildings.

               HOLD as Schaeffer, McElroy and Fergie step out of the car. 
               They break out short-barreled twelve-gauge pumps, start TOWARD 
               CAMERA, spreading out as they turn up the long driveway... 
               figures of ominous intent striding through the misty dawn.

               ANGLE

               GOING WITH the trio of gunmen... McElroy, breath smoking in 
               the chill, eyes the terrain:

                                     MCELROY
                         Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. 
                         What do you figure they plug all

                         They don't have any shit.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Where Eli is getting into a heavy coat, preparing to go out... 
               the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table. 
               Rachel is beginning the dishes.

               INT. BARN  DAWN

               Book and Samuel are starting the morning milking...

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Eli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the 
               kitchen door is kicked open and McElroy and Fergie weapons 
               leveled, burst in. Eli reacts with angry shock as Schaeffer 
               enters: Rachel is, for a moment, terrified.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Fergie)
                         Outside 
                              (to Mac)
                         Check out the rest of the house.

               He turns to Eli, who is standing in the middle of the room.

               Schaeffer flashes his badge:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         We're police officers. We're looking 
                         for a fugitive, John Book. He's living 
                         here?

                                     ELI
                         I have nothing to say to you. Get 
                         out of my house!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You speak English. Good. Now listen 
                         

                                     RACHEL
                              (recovering)
                         No, you listen. Get out!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lady, I'm here to help you. This man 
                         is very dangerous. An armed criminal.
                              (ingratiating)
                         He's got a gun, hasn't he?

                                     RACHEL
                         You have no right here!

               McElroy re-enters.

                                     MCELROY
                         He's not in this building.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Eli)
                         All right, where is he?

               Suddenly Eli SHOUTS: It's deafening. Probably the loudest 
               noise Eli has ever made:

                                     ELI
                         John Book!

               McElroy whips around, smashes Eli on the temple with the 
               butt of his shotgun. Eli crumples to the floor. Rachel 
               SCREAMS, runs to Eli.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book and Samuel in the milkhouse. They've heard Eli's outcry. 
               Book moves to the window, looks out.

               BOOK'S POV  FERGIE

               About halfway between the barn and the house. He turns from 
               glancing back toward the house (having heard Eli's shout) 
               and starts again toward the barn. Gun at the ready.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               As Book REACTS.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Rachel kneeling next to Eli, wiping at his bruise with a 
               damp cloth. Schaeffer looks on.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         He'll live.

                                     RACHEL
                         You might have killed him!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to McElroy)
                         Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll 
                         watch these two.

               McElroy nods, moves outside, turns toward the barns.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book still at the window, Samuel now beside him, trying to 
               get a look.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is it them?

                              (turning, mind racing)
                         It's them, Sam.
                              (he bends to the boy, 
                              takes him by the 
                              shoulders)
                         Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to 
                         me carefully. Listen to me as you 
                         never listened before.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (interrupting)
                         Are they going to kill you?

                                     BOOK
                         Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go 
                         across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. 
                         Run as fast as you can. And stay 
                         there!

                                     SAMUEL
                         What are you going to do?

                                     BOOK
                         I'll be all right. You just do as I 
                         say.

               He takes Samuel by the hand, leads him to the side door. He 
               bends, holds the boy close.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Don't let them hurt you.

                              (as Sam looks back)
                         Fast as you can!

               Sam turns, takes off.

               Samuel running.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie almost to the upper barn, McElroy  well back and 
               moving slowly, circumspectly  headed toward the lower barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book, at another window in the lower barn, sees McElroy 
               heading for the milkhouse door. He can't see Fergie. He turns, 
               crosses the cowpen area, climbs an inner ladder leading to 
               the upper barn.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie at the door to the upper barn, moving very cautiously, 
               gun up. He eases around the doorpost, looks within.

               INT. BARN  ANGLE PAST BOOK

               Beyond Book, now at the top of the ladder, we see Fergie 
               easing into the barn. Book pulls himself up, crawls behind 
               the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside 
               Luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm 
               him. He gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes Luke's 
               nose. The mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes 
               widen, but he makes no untoward sound. Book closes the gate.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               He comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting.

               DOLLYING WITH him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens 
               the gate. An edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously. 
               Fergie backs off, moves on.

               BOOK

               As he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh 
               straw.

               Book eases back alongside Luke, waits.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               As he approaches Luke's stall, reaches for the gate-latch.

               BOOK  FLASH CUT

               As the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack 
               on the back. The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy 
               explode in an horrendous SCREAM.

               FERGIE

               Bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies 
               open, involuntarily FIRING, suddenly finding himself under 
               the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast. Staggering 
               backwards, he SCREAMS, FIRES again, the load striking the 
               mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into 
               Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half 
               like a matchstick.

               BOOK

               As he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the 
               barn.

               FERGIE

               Fallen, skull smashed... and now the dying Luke's legs buckle 
               and he collapses atop Fergie.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy standing still, shock-eyed, looking toward the sound 
               of the shots. Then starting slowly forward.

               On the porch of the house, looking toward the barn.

               EXT. FIELD  DAY

               Some distance from the barn, Samuel's hearing the shots, 
               stops dead in his tracks... the sound of the shots still 
               REVERBERATING across the quiet fields.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stricken)
                         Mr. Book?

               He hesitates, then turns, starts trotting back toward the 
               barns.

               EXT. / INT. KITCHEN PORCH  DAY

               Rachel has moved into the open kitchen door, glances anxiously 
               toward the barns. Starts out. Schaeffer pushes her back.

               As McElroy, checking the safety on his twelve-gauge, steps 
               into the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy flattens himself against the wall, looks around 
               fearfully.

                                     MCELROY
                              (softly)
                         Fergie?

               Only silence.

               Schaeffer staring toward the barn, SHOUTS:

                         What the hell happened?

               He listens, hears nothing, snorts, starts toward the barn 
               checking his gun, not hurrying.

               Samuel running as fast as he can trips as he crosses a small 
               muddy stream, falls full length, scrambles up, runs on.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy, moving very cautiously, comes around the mule stalls, 
               stops short, stares off screen.

               HIS POV  FERGIE

               Where he lies half buried beneath the huge bulk of the mule, 
               his head crushed like an eggshell.

               BACK TO MCELROY

               As he moves on around Fergie and the dead mule, planting 
               each foot as if he were walking in a mine field.

               BOOK

               Standing in shadow at the back of the barn next to a hay 
               mow.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Moving toward the center of the barn.

               BOOK

               As he starts to move even further back, he nudges into a 
               rope fastened to the wall behind him, He looks at it, looks 
               up.

               HIS POV  THE ROPE

               It runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to 
               the center roofbeam of the barn to a trolley fixed to a track 
               that runs the length of the roofbeam. Attached to this trolley 
               is a big hayfork (Paul Krantz has one), U-shaped, sharply-
               pointed at each end of the U. the points hanging toward the 
               floor. The thing weighs about eighty pounds, and is suspended 
               in place by the rope anchored at the wall next to Book.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Keeping one eye on McElroy, he carefully begins to un-tie 
               the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               Moving out toward the center of the barn, almost under the 
               suspended hay fork. He stops short, listens. Then, either 
               spotting a moving shadow or hearing a SOUND, he FIRES. His 
               shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader. He SHOUTS:

                                     MCELROY
                         Book, you sneaky bastard, I know 
                         you're here! Come out and fight!

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel, at the top of the barnyard, stops at the SOUND OF 
               THE SHOT, wide-eyed. He listens for an-instant, starts a 
               step toward the barn, then stops again, looks to a large 
               bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings. He 
               moves quickly to the bell, seizes the rope, pulls. The bell 
               CLANGS loudly, Sonorously.

               SCHAEFFER

               On the front porch, looking around for the location of the 
               sounding bell. He takes a step toward the barn, the stops, 
               looks back toward the house... frustrated.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book watches as McElroy starts to move again looking back 
               toward the SOUNDING of the bell.

               HIGH ANGLE  HAY FORK

               Looking down we can see McElroy almost directly beneath the 
               hay fork. The bell SOUNDING throughout. BOOK Waiting... trip 
               rope in hand. Then:

                                     BOOK
                              (shouting)
                         Hey, Mac!

               And he lets go the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               As he turns toward the SOUND of Book's voice.

               HAY FORK

               As it plummets down, causing a RATCHETING SOUND that fills 
               the barn, even drowns out the SOUND of the bell.

               MCELROY

               Eyes darting wildly, looking up.

               HIS POV  HAY FORK

               Plunging straight for him.

               MCELROY

               Diving to one side.

               ANGLE  HAY FORK

               THUDDING into the barn floor like a great trident fork.

               Quivering there, not a foot from McElroy's head.

               MCELROY

               Staring at the fork pop-eyed.

               BOOK

               Sprinting toward a ladder thrust up through an opening in 
               the barn floor just in front of his parked car.

               MCELROY

               Spotting Book, coming up to one knee, quick-aiming, FIRING. 
               The shot smashes the windshield of the car.

               BOOK

               Diving, rolling, slamming into the top of the ladder, flailing 
               down out of sight.

               MCELROY

               FIRING AGAIN, then again. Emptying the gun, cursing as he 
               begins to reload, gets to his feet, starts toward the ladder. 
               The BELL still SOUNDING outside. The hood of the car SLOWLY 
               POPS UP.

               ANGLE

               As McElroy wheels at the movement of the car's hood, FIRES 
               twice.

               MCELROY'S POV  LAPP BUGGY

               The buckshot virtually blows the dashboard off.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel RINGING the bell. The bell rope is short, and so is 
               Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of 
               the rockerarm.

               He hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of 
               his head, his face set against the tears that move down his 
               cheeks.

               SCHAEFFER

               Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward 
               the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward 
               the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are. 
               He still can't see Samuel.

               HIS POV  THE PORCH

               As Rachel starts off the porch, takes a few steps.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, SHOUTING:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You stay put!

               RACHEL

               She stops. She is also unable to see Samuel.

               SCHAEFFER

               Moving out toward the barn, rounding a corner... and there 
               is Samuel at the bellrope. He starts toward him.

               EXT. FIELDS  DAY

               Beyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm, 
               Stotlzfus and others  including Hochstetler and his brothers 
                are baling the first cutting of June hay.

               But the operation has come to a halt. All are looking in 
               toward the Lapp farm, hearing the RINGING OF THE BELL (the 
               Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating.

               But now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward 
               Samuel.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               As Schaeffer reaches Samuel, SHOUTS:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Cut that out!

               Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling.

               Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of 
               the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs 
               on grimly.

               Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves 
               him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun 
               blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several 
               threads, so he FIRES again.

               The rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to 
               look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when 
               Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy 
               kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness 
               right then and there.

               But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He 
               SNARLS at Sam:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get down to the house and stay there!

               Samuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off.

               RACHEL

               Already halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in 
               her arms... then to lead him back toward the house.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, starting very slowly toward the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy at the top of the ladder, looking down. Then easing 
               over, placing his feet on the rungs.

               BOOK

               He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The 
               cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks 
               at him with its horns. Book waits, watches.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder. He stops 
               at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering 
               the rungs.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He turns now to a door at the back of the pen. He un-hooks 
               it, pulls it open, moves inside.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               He is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to 
               a nearly-empty silo. Above the entrance, a ladder (interior) 
               rises to the top of the structure.

               Book looks in, and up. We should get the impression that 
               Book's been here before, expects what he sees.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He steps through to the base of the ladder, then ducks beyond 
               it into the silo. There is about two feet of old silage 
               covering the floor. He turns, looks up the white walls.

               HIS POV  INSIDE SILO

               An inside ladder runs to the top.

               HIS POV  KICKBOARD

               Standing against the wall next to the entrance... . obviously 
               to be inserted as the silo is filled.

               BOOK

               Now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses 
               to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out..

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy at the bottom of the ladder, looking in the other 
               direction (toward the milkhouse).

               BACK TO BOOK

               Very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward 
               into the cowpen). It begins to swing very slowly open. Book 
               immediately turns, darts back into the silo.

               MCELROY

               Turning slowly toward the cowpen... then FIRES twice as his 
               eye catches the motion of the swinging door. His shots blow 
               half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall. 
               McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Old Eli, at the sight of Samuel, rises from the table.

                                     ELI
                         Praise Gott!

               Rachel stands aside as the old man embraces Samuel long and 
               hard.

               She watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big 
               family Bible. He crosses to the table, sets the book down, 
               places his hand on its pulls Samuel to the table beside him.

               Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man 
               helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun, 
               takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of 
               the coffee jar. She drops several as she tries to figure out 
               how to open the chamber to load it.

               In the b.g., Eli glances up, sees what she is about... he 
               rises and crosses to her. Samuel watches from the table.

                                     ELI
                              (fiercely)
                         No, Rachel...

                                     RACHEL
                         I have to help him!

               Rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try 
               to load the bullets. Eli's callused hand closes over hers, 
               halting the action:

                                     ELI
                         It is not our way!

               Bullets are already CLATTERING to the floor from her trembling 
               fingers as she raises her eyes to Eli's.

               A long beat as Rachel looks at him... Finally her fingers 
               release the pistol and it CLATTERS to the floor. She closes 
               her eyes.

               Samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches Eli 
               and Rachel silently.

               Eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the Bible 
               beneath his. They stand there and they pray.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book finishes putting the kickboard into the entrance.

               MCELROY

               Moving among the cows, stepping cautiously between the 
               cowflops.

               The goat nudges him once, then butts him rather firmly. 
               McElroy swats at him with the gun butt, moves to the door. 
               As he arrives, he HEARS a noise  very slight  from the 
               direction of the silo.

               He enters the passage way, looks in toward the silo entrance, 
               He hesitates. Another slight noise. He steps in to the base 
               of the inner ladder, looks up.

               HIS POV  THE HATCH

               The patch of blue sky, forty feet up.

               BACK TO MCELROY

               He frowns, reaches out, grabs a rung.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Schaeffer, easing toward the mule stalls, MUTTERS, CURSES 
               under his breath. Then he rounds the corner of the first 
               stall... and there is Fergie with Luke the mule on top of 
               him. Schaeffer stares, blinks... moves on spotting a spent 
               shotgun shell near the hayfork...

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book listening at the kickboard. SOUNDS of feet, shotgun 
               rattling against metal rungs, Book moves to the ladder on 
               his side, starts silently up.

               MCELROY

               Climbing with difficulty, shotgun clutched in one hand.

               BOOK

               He climbs up to the second kickboard, pauses, checks the 
               distance to the floor, starts upward again.

               BARN YARD  DAY

               The Amish beginning to arrive. Sam comes running, pulls 
               Stoltzfus toward the door of the milkhouse as the other Amish 
               look at the shot-shattered bellrope. Rachel and Eli come 
               rapidly up the path toward the group.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Schaeffer finds another spent shotgun shell, crosses to the 
               ladder, looks down. He sets his shotgun down, takes out his 
               service revolver, starts down.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book has reaches the third kickboard, about thirty feet from 
               the ground. He checks it, turns the thumb-screws that hold 
               it in place, places his hand on the handle, moves to one 
               side as best he can... hangs there, listening.

               MCELROY

               Rattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard.

               BOOK

               Listening tensely, hearing McElroy arrive on the other side 
               of the kickboard. Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist, 
               raps on the board smartly once.

               MCELROY

               Startled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the 
               back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts 
               the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety.

               BOOK

               We HEAR with him the thump of the muzzle, the CLICK... and, 
               with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it 
               to the floor.

               McELROY  FLASH CUT Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling 
               forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as Book 
               seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As McElroy pitches forward through the opening, SCREAMS and 
               GRABS as he plunges past Book. The shotgun FIRES as McElroy 
               manages to hold onto Book, and both men plunge thirty feet 
               to the bottom of the silo.

               BOOK

               He falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies 
               stunned.

               MCELROY

               His forward motion has carried him across the silo. His head 
               bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up... and he 
               falls in a heap, blood gushing from his head, as...

               TIGHT ON BOOK

               Blinking, groaning, just beginning to stir... and, suddenly, 
               into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it. The muzzle 
               is placed firmly against Book's temple.

               WIDER

               Schaeffer holding the pistol. He cocks the pistol, tenses as 
               if to FIRE (and he is actually about to)... when there is a 
               SOUND behind him. He snaps around.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Old Stoltzfus and Samuel standing in the kickboard opening 
               (Schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the 
               shot from within the silo). They stand solemnly, looking on 
               as:

               SCHAEFFER

               He eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Okay, Johnny. On your feet.

               THE SCENE

               As Book struggles to his feet  Schaeffer holding the pistol 
               tight to Book's head. Book turns, sees Samuel and Stoltzfus, 
               blinks.

               Schaeffer shoves Book toward the opening. As Book moves toward 
               Samuel, he speaks quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's okay, Sam.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book and McElroy move out of the silo, down the passageway 
               toward the milkhouse, Stoltzfus and Sam (after a glance in 
               at the inert McElroy) follow and...

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               As first Stoltzfus and Samuel, then Book and Schaeffer emerge 
               into the barnyard. Schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol 
               pressed firmly against Book's throat, just below his jaw.

               Schaeffer pulls up, frowning:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Hold it.

               WHAT HE SEES

               The Amishmen gathered  the Stoltzfus family, the Hochstetler 
               brothers, et al. All staring hard at Schaeffer and Book.

               EXT. BARN / DRIVE  DAY

               From a high wide angle the final scene is played out. 
               Schaeffer and Book, now moving again slowly up the drive, 
               the Amish following along closely on both sides.

               CLOSE ON BOOK

               As Schaeffer prods Book forward, warily eyeing the Amish.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get back, you people!
                              (prodding)
                         Keep moving, Johnny...

               Book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops. 
               The Amish stand about close, staring, no one moving. Book 
               now slowly turns his head, looks at Schaeffer.

                                     BOOK
                         You're going to have to do it right 
                         here, Schaeffer.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Don't try me, Johnny!

               Eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head.

                                     ELI
                         So... will you kill us all, then?

               As Schaeffer's eyes waver between Book and Eli, Book slowly 
               turns until he is facing Schaeffer... the gun now leveled  
               and almost pressing against  Book's chest. Book locks eyes 
               with Schaeffer.

               Quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's all over, Paul.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Move! Or you die right here!

               Book's right hand snakes out, grabs Schaeffer by the gunhand 
               wrist, twists viciously, Schaeffer SCREAMS in pain, the gun 
               falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force 
               of Book's grip.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book bends, picks up the pistol, releases Schaeffer, pushes 
               him away. Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who  partly 
               to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to 
               congratulate him on his surrender  wraps one brawny arm 
               around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving 
               nod... holds Schaeffer as:

               Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel. Their gazes 
               meet, hold for a long MOMENT. In the eyes of both we read 
               resignation... whatever there was between them has been 
               terribly damaged. It is almost certainly over for them, too.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               HIGH SHOT holding the moment.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LATE AFTERNOON

               The door opens and Book steps out, looking somehow strange 
               in his working suit. He looks about him, sees Samuel down by 
               the pond.

               EXT. POND

               He eases down beside Samuel. They both stare into the pond.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Are you really ever coming back?

                                     BOOK
                         Got to, Sam. You and I are going to 
                         a courthouse together, put some people 
                         behind bars.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Have you got your gun on now?

                                     BOOK
                         Sure have, Sam.

               Sam grins. Book takes him in his arms, holds him.

               EXT. HOUSE  DAY

               Book opens the door of the car, turns to find Rachel standing 
               there with his Amish hat in hand.

                                     RACHEL
                         I want you to take this... to remember 
                         by.

                         Here. Whenever you want them.

               He wants to kiss her, but does not. Their eyes say it all. 
               Eli has a final word, SHOUTING from the porch.

                                     ELI
                         You be careful, John Book! Out among 
                         them English!

               Book gets quickly into the car.

               INT. /EXT. DRIVEWAY  LAPP FARM  DAY

               As Book drives, he sees an open buggy coming down the hill 
               toward the farm, He slows as he passes, It's Daniel 
               Hochstetler. A long beat, and as they pass, Hochstetler gives 
               Book an expansive tip of his hat.

               Book turns to look back at his rival, a doubt in his eyes.

               TITLE SEQUENCE

               The faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP, 
               as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND 
               TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The 
               CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, 
               then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar 
               faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are 
               dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               Through the last traces of early morning mist another group 
               of black-clad figures make their way down a lane.

               EXT. COUNTRY LANE  DAY

               An Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the 
               landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces.

               Framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern 
               figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, 
               his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired 
               like his father, peering out.

               The horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS 
               on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES 
               on the pavement.

               ANOTHER LANE

               Two Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of 
               three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a 
               leafless thicket of hickory.

               VALLEY

               A BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen 
               buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.

               BARNYARD

               Where literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses 
               have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of 
               the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  FRONT PORCH

               As the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women 
               and children presumably first).

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               The coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse 
               has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen 
               partially covering the bearded face.

               END TITLE SEQUENCE

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of 
               the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred-
               fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows 
               of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the 
               f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy 
               a special Place.

               RACHEL LAPP

               A young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and 
               drawn.

               In happier circumstances, although there haven't been too 
               many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual 
               woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence.

               Eight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would 
               appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events.

               And the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered  yet 
               not unkind  features grief-stricken.

               THE MOURNERS

               Their faces...

               CLOCK

               As it begins to CHIME nine a.m.

               FAVORING PREACHER

               As he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation 
               remove their hats also.

               Then the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect:

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     PREACHER
                         ...a brother has been called home. 
                         God has spoken through the death of 
                         our neighbor, Jacob Lapp...

               THE FAMILY

               Where Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion 
               and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as:

                                     PREACHER
                         ...husband of Rachel, father to 
                         Samuel, son of Eli.
                              (and)
                         His chair is empty, his bed is empty, 
                         his voice will be heard no more. He 
                         was needed in our presence, but God 
                         needs such men, too. That one should 
                         be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. 
                         Still, we would not wish him back. 
                         Rather we should prepare ourselves 
                         to follow him.

               TIGHTENING to the Lapps, and...

               EXT. CEMETERY

               The mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in 
               silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the 
               pit. The many buggies are aligned in the b.g.

               As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the 
               grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a 
               slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty 
               air.

               RACHEL

               TIGHTENING to her as the hymn continues...

               INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE

               Where the Amish have gathered for the traditional post 
               funeral, midday meals.

               Long tables are laden with customary Amishfare... crocks of 
               soup, hams, fowl, fried boiled eggs and pickled beets, 
               preserves and an infinite variety of pies and pastries.

               Where she sits among women, accepting their condolences.

               DANIEL HOCHSTETLER

               A brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman. 
               There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic 
               set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. Not exactly 
               what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up 
               man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group 
               of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER, 
               BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Lapp was a good farmer. None better.

                                     BEILER
                         But not the man to buy a horse for 
                         you.
                              (and)
                         Hochstetler, wasn't it your father 
                         sold him that horse with a ruptured 
                         testicle?

                                     TOM
                              (grins)
                         Told him it was a bee sting made him 
                         limp that way.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (amused)
                         That horse had one good ball. That's 
                         all it takes.

               The others chuckle. But Hochstetler's attention is still on 
               Rachel.

               RACHEL

               As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a 
               tree in front of her.

               At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. 
               All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, 
               tune in as Rachel looks up.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let 
                         us hope he walks close with God.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sure he does, Daniel.

               FIELDS, LAPP FARM  DAY

               It is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is 
               hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. The 
               death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three  
               Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli 
               work nearby, further breaking up the earth. Rachel looks up 
               from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach  
               it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers. Without a 
               word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various 
               tasks associated with the work in hand.

               Daniel works close beside Rachel.

               EXT. COUNTRY ROADS, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A few BRIEF SHOTS of a lone buggy containing the Lapp family 
               take us from the 18th century into the 20th century the 
               reassuring RATTLE OF THE CARRIAGE WHEELS on quiet backroad, 
               to the ROAR OF TRAFFIC as the buggy waits patiently for a 
               chance to cross a busy interstate highway.

               EXT. HIGHWAY, LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               A huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it 
               trots down the interstate. The camera cranes up to reveal a 
               procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to 
               overtake it.

               EXT. PLATFORM, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat-form, 
               Rachel turns surprised, as he approaches, a faint color coming 
               to her cheek.

                                     RACHEL
                         Daniel?

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I... I was at the feed store. And I 
                         saw your horse, so...

               There is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival 
               of the train.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         You will come back soon?

               Samuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his 
               mother's hand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Quickly, Mother Quickly!

               Rachel embraces Eli.

                         You be careful out among them English.

               She turns to Hochstetler.

                         I need time, Daniel.

               EXT. CARPARK, LANCASTER STATION  DAY

               Daniel Hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open 
               wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his 
               horse off at a fast trot.

               EXT. TRAIN  DAY

               The ENGINE gives a WARNING BLAST before creeping slowly 
               forward.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Look, Mama...!

               HIS POV THROUGH WINDOW

               A road runs parallel to the train track, and Hochstetler in 
               his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts 
               to keep pace with the train.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see, darling.

               And Samuel cranes to look back, waving, for as long as he 
               can.

               EXT. LANCASTER COUNTRYSIDE  DAY

               The train moves across a broad panorama of fields, dotted 
               with dolls'-house-sized farms and the tiny figures of Amish 
               farmers working their horse-drawn equipment.

               SERIES OF CUTS

               As the train continues its eastward journey... Samuel stares 
               raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the 
               countryside. He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot 
               air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills... he 
               looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to 
               suburbs, bustling shopping centers, restaurants, car lots 
               and fast food outlets.

               EXT. PHILADELPHIA SLUMS

               As the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets 
               choked with cars and the gutters with filth.

               INT. TRAIN (MOVING)

               Now Samuel is staring out the window with some confusion, 
               almost apprehension:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is this where we're going?

                                     RACHEL
                         Of course not. We're going to 
                         Baltimore. It's much nicer in 
                         Baltimore.

               And Rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the 
               window.

               INT. 30TH ST. STATION, PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Rachel is in a line at one of the counters. The plain dress 
               of the two Amish  particularly Samuel's black coat and hat 
                are drawing curious stares.

               SAMUEL

               He's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a 
               little girl about his own age, standing in line with her 
               parents at the next counter. He edges away from his mother...

               ANGLE

               As Samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock 
               coat and flat-brimmed hat... the man's back is turned, could, 
               from appearances, be an Amishman.

               Samuel stares... A beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we 
               discover that he is a Hasidic Jew.

               SAMUEL

               As he reacts.

               BACK TO TICKET COUNTER

               As Rachel's turn arrives. The TICKET SELLER glances up and 
               she shows him her ticket.

                                     RACHEL
                         We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where 
                         is that train, please?

                                     TICKET SELLER
                         Delayed three hours. You'll hear an 
                         announcement when it's time to board.

               He starts to go without his hat, but Rachel collars him and 
               puts it on his head.

               ANGLE IN MEN'S ROOM

               As Samuel enters.

               It's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... Samuel stops 
               before one of the urinals  a long, trough-like affair with 
               water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel.

               It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING 
               FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel 
               stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, 
               stoops to see which are empty.

               HIS POV  TOILETS

               Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. Samuel 
               is alone in the restroom.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a 
               stall near the end. He enters. As he does so, a heavily 
               bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, 
               he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind 
               a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up.

               Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large 
               BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. 
               His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and 
               a short leather jacket.

               They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace.

               The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for 
               him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close 
               confines of the lavatory.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he 
               can see their feet under the edge of the door.

               BACK TO FIGHT

               As the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young 
               man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color.

               The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's 
               hand bloodstained. His partner stares at what they've 
               accomplished with a stunned expression:

                                     PARTNER
                         Jesus...

               The young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with 
               blood.

               He stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. Finally his 
               bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. 
               Then he collapses to the floor.

               The black man motions for his partner to watch the door, 
               then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind 
               the dispenser.

               ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL

               As he edges open the stall door a crack. Over his shoulder 
               we can see the black man, his BACK TO US, rifling the 
               backpack. But beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we 
               catch sight of the black man's face.

               SAMUEL

               As he stares out the narrow crack. A beat, then he closes 
               the stall door.

               ANGLE IN STALL

               Samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and 
               won't fall closed.

               BLACK MAN

               As he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket. 
               His partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand.

               The black man makes for the exit, then on second thought, 
               glances at the row of stalls.

               HIS POV  STALLS

               All quiet, but...

               BACK TO SCENE

               The black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting 
               at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               As the black man approaches, Samuel working desperately on 
               the latch. At the last minute he finally wedges it in.

               BLACK MAN

               He elbows Samuel's stall... the door won't open.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               Fighting back panic, Samuel has retreated as far as he can.

               BLACK MAN

               As he gives the door a kick. It holds. He swears under his 
               breath.

               ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL

               In desperation, Samuel does the only thing he can think of... 
               he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the 
               black man just checked out. But he loses his hat in the 
               process. His hand snakes back INTO FRAME to snatch it just 
               as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that 
               splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. He's 
               framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking 
               down our throats.

               ANGLE

               As his partner snaps from the doorway:

                                     PARTNER
                         Will you come on, for Christ's sakes!

               A beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to 
               follow the partner out.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               As we hear the SOUND OF THE TWO MEN EXITING the lavatory. A 
               long beat, then Samuel opens the stall door a crack.

               HIS POW THROUGH DOOR

               Samuel's own face reflected in the blood-smeared mirror... 
               then PANNING DOWN to the still figure of the young man lying 
               in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor.

               BENCH WAITING ROOM  LOW ANGLE  NIGHT

               Samuel sits close to his mother, his face pale, his eyes 
               staring.

               Rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various 
               police and officials pass through foreground, occasionally 
               obscuring the lonely couple. There is considerable ECHOING 
               NOISE as commands and requests mingle with the CRACKLE OF 
               TWO-WAY RADIOS.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DOOR  MEN'S' ROOM

               The diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the 
               Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal, JOHN BOOK, 
               who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the 
               crowd of police, reporters and others. He is about 40, with 
               a rangy, athletic body. Behind him comes CARTER, Book's black 
               partner  about five years younger than Book. Book is wearing 
               a suit, Carter is much more casually  almost disreputably  
               dressed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BENCH

               Little Samuel watching Book, back to crowd of police, as 
               Book questions an old black CUSTODIAN.

                                     BOOK
                         You found the body?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported 
                         it. It was the kid.

                                     BOOK
                         What kid?

                                     CUSTODIAN
                         How'n hell do I know what kid? The 
                         kid in the funny black threads.

               TIGHT SHOT  SAMUEL

               Worry-eyed, still staring straight ahead. Then his eyes move 
               suddenly to his left.

               BOOK'S LEGS  SAMUEL'S POV

               Coming in at full stride, then stopping.

               SAMUEL

               He doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And, 
               slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's 
               belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his 
               face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then...

               ANGLE  BOOK

               As his face breaks into a big grin, and...

                                     BOOK
                         Hi, kid.

               RACHEL

               Immediately alarmed, intervening.

                                     RACHEL
                         What do you want of my son?

               THE SCENE

               As Book takes out his wallet, displays his shield.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm a police officer. I'm going to 
                         have to talk to the boy. What's his 
                         name?

                                     RACHEL
                         Samuel. Samuel Lapp.
                              (then, quickly)
                         But what happened here is none of 
                         his affair. My sister is expecting 
                         me... our train is leaving soon.

                                     BOOK
                         There'll be another train.
                              (turns to Samuel)
                         The man who was killed tonight was a 
                         policeman, Sam. It's my job to find 
                         out who did it. I want you to tell 
                         me everything you saw when you went 
                         in there.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stammers)
                         I saw him.

                                     BOOK
                         Who'd you see?

               Sam looks at his mother.

                         Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the 
                         floor?

                                     SAMUEL
                         No... I saw the man who killed him.

               Book stares at him in surprise, speaks over his shoulder to 
               Carter.

                                     BOOK
                         Anybody know about this?

                                     CARTER
                         I didn't even know about it.

                                     BOOK
                              (back to Sam)
                         Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he 
                         looked like?

                                     SAMUEL
                              (groping, touching 
                              his clothes and 
                              pointing at Carter)
                         He was... like him.

                         Black... I understand. What else,Sam?

               A beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather 
               slightly built partner:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Not Zwartich, like him 

               Book frowns, puzzled:

                                     BOOK
                         Try that one again, Sam 

               Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel 
               intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter:

                                     RACHEL
                         May I talk to you?

               ANGLE

               As Rachel takes Book aside, and in a low voice:

                         Zwartich. It's the way we say... 
                         dwarf.
                              (glances at Carter)
                         Not like him... very big.

               Book nods, starts to turn back to Sam. Just then a commotion 
               off screen catches his attention.

               BOOK'S POV  ONCOMING COPS

               It's Capt. TERRY DONAHUE, Chief of Homicide, striding past 
               the crowd of journalists and TV crews... brushing off 
               reporters' questions and snapping orders to the aides he's 
               got in tow:

               BACK TO SCENE

               AS DONAHUE COMES ON BOOK:

                                     DONAHUE
                              (to aides)
                         Close it all down... I want a man on 
                         every exit... I want the lab in here 
                         now!
                              (to Book)
                         And I want to talk to you, Captain.

               ANGLE

               As Book steps aside with Donahue... In the b.g. Rachel moves 
               protectively to Samuel's side.

                                     BOOK
                         All right, talk. 

                                     DONAHUE
                         This is homicide  not Internal 
                         Affairs! So why are you behaving 
                         like you own this case?

                                     BOOK
                         We were running Zenovitch... That's 
                         all I can tell you. But I want it, 
                         Terry.
                              (then)
                         I've got a call into Schaeffer.

               RACHEL / SAMUEL

               They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue 
               and Book... although they're keeping the volume down, it's 
               obviously intense and angry:

                                     SAMUEL
                              (alarmed)
                         Momma... are they angry with us.

                                     RACHEL
                              (reassuring, but hardly 
                              in her own mind)
                         No... No. It is just the English 
                         way.

               Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile:

                                     DONAHUE
                         You ought to think about coming back 
                         to Homicide, Johnny... Stick with 
                         Internal Affairs and you're not gonna 
                         have any friends left.

                              (smiles right back)

               EXT. 30TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book emerges from the terminal, looks about him, then crosses 
               to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby. Two men sit 
               in the front seat. Book crosses to the driver's side and 
               opens the door.

                                     BOOK
                         Go get a cup of coffee, Stan.

               The driver, a uniformed policeman, glances at the man beside 
               him who nods in agreement. He gets out and Book gets in behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. SEDAN

               Book sits next to SCHAEFFER, a surprisingly kindly looking 
               man of about fifty. Schaeffer is a Deputy Chief.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         How reliable is this kid?

                                     BOOK
                         Oh, he's good.

                         Yeah.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What have you got?

                                     BOOK
                         Zenovitch was about to deliver a 
                         list of names tonight  street 
                         chemists... the guys processing this 
                         P2P into speed.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         So one of them got to him.

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You know who?

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You're still convinced there's a 
                         link to the department?

                                     BOOK
                         If there isn't I've just wasted the 
                         last six months.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         That's the problem. We need results. 
                         The press is driving us crazy over 
                         this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed 
                         capitol of the country'. You know 
                         the sort of thing. It's getting 
                         political. The Commissioner's getting 
                         very uneasy.

                         Homicide Department off my back or 
                         they'll blow the whole thing.

                         When word gets out that Zenovitch 
                         was a cop, all hell will break lose.

                         can give you. 24 hours on your own. 
                         After that the case and the witness 
                         go back to the Homicide Department.

                                     SCHAEFFER

                         that blonde  what's-her-name  come

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between 
               neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened 
               storefronts.

               Carter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat 
               looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters 
               huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about. On the 
               POLICE RADIO a description of the cop killing is BROADCAST 
               EVERY FEW MINUTES.

                                     CARTER
                         I got there late, John.

                         Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You 
                         didn't let anybody down. It happens 
                         

                                     CARTER
                              (grimly)
                         It won't happen again.

                                     RACHEL
                         Where are you taking us?

                                     BOOK
                         We're looking for a suspect. We've 
                         reason to believe he's still in the 
                         area.

                                     RACHEL
                         You have no right to keep us here.

                                     BOOK
                         Yes I do. Your son is a material 
                         witness to a homicide.

                                     RACHEL
                         You don't understand, we have nothing 
                         to do with your laws!

                                     BOOK
                         Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of 
                         people like that.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not a joke.

               Book decides to try contrition:

                                     BOOK
                         You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, 
                         I know a little about the Amish. I 
                         know this has to be an ordeal for 
                         you; and I'm really sorry you an 
                         Samuel got involved.

               Samuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his 
               mother in German. She responds in the same language. Book 
               frowns.

                                     BOOK
                         What was that?

                                     RACHEL
                         He wants to know who you are. Your 
                         name. I told him we don't need to 
                         know anything about you.

               Book eyes Samuel:

                         Book. John Book

               EXT. 13TH ST. STATION  NIGHT

               Book's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened 
               little MAN. He looks about before crossing to the driver's 
               side window.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR  NIGHT

               Book lowers the window.

                         Sammy, where's Coalmine?

               The little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the 
               back seat.

                                     SAMMY
                         What you got there, the Salvation 
                         Army?

                         Coalmine.

                         Try "Happy Valley".

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY BAR, SOUTH STREET  NIGHT

               Book's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get 
               out, and move swiftly inside.

               INT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               Sixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on 
               the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and 
               move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this 
               point... no mistakes. From the back, the black man they've 
               approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did 
               the killing of Zenovitch. And, as Book and Carter make their 
               move...

               EXT. HAPPY VALLEY  NIGHT

               As Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar, 
               violently propelling Coalmine along with them. Now we see 
               Coalmine is not the killer.

               As Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police 
               squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car. 
               An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's 
               face down next to the car window.

                                     BOOK
                         Put some light on him.

               A cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over 
               Coalmine's face.

                                     BOOK
                              (continuing; to Samuel)
                         Look at him.

               Crazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at 
               Samuel inside the car:

               Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative.

               Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and 
               slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing 
               his face up against the front window. His face takes on a 
               grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his 
               partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away 
               by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has 
               horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he 
               gets back in the car.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, you listen to me! I will 
                         have no further part in this, nor 
                         will my son! As God stands between

               Book sighs, starts the engine and moves off.

               EXT. HOTEL  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed DOORMAN 
               moves to open the rear door.

               INT. CAR  NIGHT

               Rachel and Sam recoil as the Doorman opens the door. He is 
               puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests.

                                     DOORMAN
                         Ma'am?

                                     RACHEL
                         No! We do not stay in hotels.

               Book and Carter exchange a glance.

               EXT. / INT. FRONT DOOR, SUBURBAN HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  
               NIGHT

               An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers 
               stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house. 
               This is ELAINE, Book's sister. She stops Book as he tries to 
               follow Rachel inside.

                                     ELAINE
                         How could you do this to me tonight? 
                         I told you I had company

                                     BOOK
                         Sorry. It's important.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she glances in a doorway.

               HER POV  ELAINE'S KITCHEN

               It's a shambles, with dirty supper dishes piled sink, the 
               table littered with empty beer cans.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she hustles Samuel along.

               BOOK / ELAINE

               Book frowns:

                                     BOOK
                         Where's Timmy and Buck?

                                     ELAINE
                         Upstairs, asleep. Where'd you think?

                                     BOOK
                         You've got a man here and the kids 
                         are upstairs?

                                     ELAINE
                         That's none of your goddamn business! 
                         So keep your goddamn holier-than-
                         thou mouth shut!
                              (and)
                         Anyway, they like Fred.

                                     BOOK
                         Oh sure, Fred.

               Elaine looks like she's going to blow again, then decides 
               it's pointless.

                                     ELAINE
                         Who are these orphans, anyway?

                         They're Amish.

               ANGLE IN GUEST ROOM

               Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room.

               Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the 
               other one.

               Off screen we hear a DOOR CLOSE, presumably Book leaving. A 
               beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in.

                                     ELAINE
                         Everything okay?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes, thank you very much.

                                     ELAINE
                              (a beat)
                         John said you're Amish.

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes.

                                     ELAINE
                              (blankly)
                         Oh.

               She nods and goes.

               Rachel crosses to Samuel, sits on the bed. Samuel looks up 
               at her bleakly.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I don't want to stay here.

                                     RACHEL
                         They are English. They don't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I wish dawdie was with us.

                                     RACHEL
                              (swallows)
                         I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.

               She puts her hand on his forehead, closes his eyes. she 
               frowns, and...

               EXT. DRIVE-IN FAST-FOOD JOINT  PHILADELPHIA  DAWN

               Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple 
               of beers. Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into 
               the car.

               Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut. 
               Its clear they've worked through the night.

               EXT. ELAINE'S HOUSE  DAY

               Elaine's house is situated on the corner of a row of terraces, 
               which stretch into the distance on both sides of the street.

               INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE

               As Samuel comes out of the guest room in his night-shirt, 
               turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom.

               ANGLE

               But it's not the bathroom; it's Elaine's bedroom. She and 
               FRED are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love. Elaine 
               gasps, Fred manages to grunt.

                                     FRED
                         Wrong door, kid.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Samuel quickly shuts the door. A straight-faced beat; 
               then, barely suppressing a giggle, he hurries on...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               As Rachel appears in the living room entry. Samuel is sitting 
               on the floor with two boys of about his own age, watching 
               television.

               They're eating cold cereal out of a box.

               RACHEL'S POV  TV SCREEN

               Some artless Saturday morning cartoon.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               As she frowns, watching her son and the other two staring 
               hypnotically. And...

               ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM

               It's later in the morning now, as Elaine, a bit blearily, 
               appears in the entryway, stares in groggy disbelief.

               HER POV  KIDS

               Her oldest boy and Samuel are busily washing the windows 
               while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper. The TV is 
               off.

               BACK TO ELAINE

               As she stares.

               ANGLE IN KITCHEN

               Rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen 
               finishing a brisk mop of the floor. The coffee is perking. 
               Elaine appears.

                                     ELAINE
                              (mutters)
                         Jesus...

               Rachel turns cheerily.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good morning.

                                     ELAINE
                              (helplessly)
                         You didn't have to...

                                     RACHEL
                         I wanted to. you were kind to take 
                         us in last night.
                              (and)
                         Anyway, I needed something to do. I 
                         was so angry with your brother. He's 
                         so... agaanisish!

                                     ELAINE
                         Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like 
                         John.

               She takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         Just a minute. I'll pour you some 
                         coffee.

                                     ELAINE
                         You're not carrying a bullwhip... 
                         how'd you manage to put my kids to 
                         work?

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiles)
                         I made it a contest... the one who 
                         does best gets his cereal back first.
                              (and)
                         Children like to help... they only 
                         need to be kept after a little bit.

               Rachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to 
               storm.

                                     ELAINE
                         Oh, is that so?
                              (and)
                         No offense, lady, but I'm not so 
                         sure I like the idea of your coming 
                         in here and turning the place upside 
                         down!

               Rachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, I didn't mean...

               Abruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's 
               hands.

               She mops furiously as she Continues:

                                     ELAINE
                         I know exactly what you meant! Listen, 
                         maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau, 
                         but maybe I don't have time to polish 
                         the goddamn china and keep after the 
                         kids!
                              (and)
                         It's none of your business, but I 
                         don't happen to have a man around 
                         here full time. So I sell cosmetics 
                         in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes 
                         I can even pay the rent on time! So 
                         maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe 
                         I don't need to have it jammed down 
                         my throat like this.

               She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER:

                                     ELAINE
                         There is that clean enough for you?

               Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting 
               into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his 
               undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.

                                     FRED
                         Jesus, Elaine... Somebody die and 
                         leave you a broom?

               Not a politic observation on Fred's part.

                                     ELAINE
                              (blurts)
                         Go to hell, Fred!

               And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. Fred stares 
               after her.

                                     FRED
                         What's bugging her?

               Unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, 
               letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure.

               INT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM

               As Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door 
               behind her. Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing.

                                     RACHEL
                         I brought your coffee.

               She takes a seat next to the bed.

                                     RACHEL
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that 
                         way.

               After a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together:

                                     ELAINE
                         It's okay.
                              (and)
                         Look, I shouldn't have blown my top. 
                         It's like... somehow... I've let 
                         everything get away from me. And you 
                         sort of made me face it.

               She takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private 
               thought.

                                     ELAINE
                         What's so funny?

                                     RACHEL
                         Fred. The way he looked when you 
                         screamed at him.

                                     ELAINE
                              (disparing)
                         God, Fred...

                                     RACHEL
                         At home you'd never hear a woman 
                         scream at a man that way.

                                     ELAINE
                         No? Why not?

                                     RACHEL
                         You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish 
                         way.
                              (then)
                         But I think it would have done me 
                         good if I could have screamed at 
                         your brother last night.

                                     ELAINE
                         Listen, I don't know what's going on 
                         or how you got mixed up with him, 
                         but don't you let that self-righteous 
                         son of a bitch push you around, okay?

               Rachel smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Okay.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  DAY

               Book glances irritably at Rachel:

                                     BOOK
                         Now what's the problem?

                                     RACHEL
                         The problem is I don't happen to 
                         think my son should be spending all 
                         his time with a man who carried a 
                         gun under his coat and goes around 
                         whacking people.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Whacking?

                                     RACHEL
                              (firmly)
                         Yes. And I also want to leave this 
                         city.

                                     BOOK
                         Believe me, I'm trying to get this 
                         over with as fast as I can. But Samuel 
                         will probably have to come back and 
                         testify.

                                     RACHEL
                         We do not go into your courts.

                                     BOOK
                         People who don't go into our courts 
                         when they're told to sometimes go 
                         directly into our jail.

               Rachel glares at him and the ride continues on that chilly 
               note for a beat.

                                     BOOK
                         Look, I'm genuinely sorry...

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         No you're not 
                              (off his look)
                         You're glad, because now you've got 
                         a witness.
                              (and)
                         I heard the other police talking 
                         last night.
                              (and)
                         They don't seem to like you very 
                         much.

                                     BOOK
                         They kid a lot.

                                     RACHEL
                              (glances at him)
                         I would not be too sure.

               Samuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something 
               to his mother in German. Book gives her an inquiring look.

                                     RACHEL
                         He says you look very tired. I thought 
                         the same thing.

               Book says nothing.

                                     RACHEL
                         But not a good tired.

                                     BOOK
                         What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.

               She doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into 
               his funk as Samuel glares at him with hostility.

               INT. IDENTIFICATION ROOM  POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               Samuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind. They 
               are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers. 
               Samuel shakes his head  another negative.

               Book winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow 
               gumball. He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an 
               inquiring look. It's a peace offering.

               Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel. But just 
               as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches 
               over and plucks it off the table. She shakes her head at 
               Samuel.

                                     BOOK
                              (to Rachel)
                         Just wanted to see if you were on 
                         your toes.

               EXT. CITY PARK  DAY

               Book, Sam and Rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of 
               hot dogs heaped with kraut.

               Book watches with amusement as Samuel wolfs down his lunch. 
               Rachel eyes him a beat. then:

                                     RACHEL
                         Your sister said you don't have a 
                         family?

                                     BOOK
                         No.

                                     RACHEL
                         She thinks you should get married 
                         and have children of your own. Instead 
                         of trying to be a father to hers. 
                         Except she thinks you're afraid of 
                         the responsibility.

               Book gives her a look:

                                     BOOK
                         Oh? Anything else?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes. She thinks you like policing 
                         because you think you're right about 
                         everything. And you're the only one 
                         who can do anything. And that when 
                         you drink a lot of beer you say things 
                         like none of the other police would 
                         know a crook from a... um... bag of 
                         elbows.

               Book is staring at her. Rachel nods.

                                     RACHEL
                         I think that's what she said.

               Just then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing 
               looks from Book and a couple of passersby. Rachel smiles 
               proudly.

                                     RACHEL
                         Good appetite.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. OUTER OFFICE/WAITING ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Rachel sits uneasily in the outer office, one or two police 
               clerks eyeing her curiously. A sign on the desk reads 
               "Narcotics Division."

               Rachel cranes forward trying to peer through a partially 
               open door.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION, POLICE H.Q.  DAY

               A group of Narcotics Detectives are interrupted in mid 
               conversation by the opening of the main office door. They 
               stare in considerable surprise.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               JOHN BOOK

               Standing in the doorway, holding little Samuel by the hand.

                                     BOOK
                         Afternoon, gentlemen. I'd like you 
                         to meet Samuel Lapp. We'd like a 
                         little help.

               INT. SMALL OFFICE, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               A Narcotics Detective enters the room laden with several 
               volumes of mug shots. He puts them on the desk beside a 
               similar book which Samuel is intently studying. Sam sits on 
               the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker.

               The Detective, SGT. KAMAN, eyes Book a little suspiciously  
               internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the 
               working policemen in any department.

                                     KAMAN
                         There's a Sgt. Carter on the phone 
                         for you.

               Book gets up and moves to the door.

                                     KAMAN
                         And, Captain, don't want to rush 
                         you, but I'm gonna need these files 
                         back in a half hour. We got a lot of 
                         work to do round here.

               The two men leave. Samuel looks about before hopping off his 
               perch and following the direction taken by Book.

               INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION  DAY

               Through glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in 
               a cubicle of an office.

               Samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the 
               bustle of the squadroom.

               He crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques 
               and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of 
               outstanding duty and achievement.

               ANGLE THOUGH GLASS CASE

               As Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes 
               are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway.

               Until suddenly he freezes.

               SAMUEL'S POV  NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT

               Enlarged, prominently displayed. The headline reads: "Division 
               Chief McElroy Honored For Youth Project". Accompanying the 
               item is a large sidebar mug-shot of McElroy  clearly the 
               black man who murdered the young cop in the train station 
               men's room.

               BACK TO SAMUEL

               He stares, transfixed.

               A long beat, then Book, lowering himself to one knee next to 
               Samuel, ENTERS FRAME.

               He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that 
               they've found their man. Samuel slowly raises his hand to 
               point at the photograph. Book gently takes the boy's small 
               hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes. 
               He smiles gently at the boy.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)  PHILADELPHIA  DUSK

               Rachel is curled tight in her corner of the front seat holding 
               Samuel close. Book glances at her:

                                     RACHEL
                         Why don't you arrest that man? Are 
                         you protecting him because policeman?

                                     BOOK
                              (snaps)
                         Listen, I'm the cop that polices the 
                         police. I'm not in the business of 
                         protecting crooked cops.
                              (eases up)
                         I'll make an arrest when I know 
                         everybody involved.

               Rachel shakes her head.

                                     RACHEL
                         But why would they murder...

                                     BOOK
                         Because  somehow  they knew I was 
                         getting close.
                              (and)
                         Look, it's narcotics... They make 
                         dope out of chemicals... they sell 
                         it on the street for millions of 
                         dollars. They'll do anything.
                              (and)
                         And they can get away with it because 
                         they're cops.

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat, then)
                         I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I 
                         want to go home.

                                     BOOK
                         You'll be safe. You don't have to 
                         worry.

               She says nothing.

               Another beat, then:

                                     BOOK
                         Look, they're thinking as long as 
                         they keep the killer out of Samuel's 
                         way, we can't make an I.D. There's 
                         no way they can know Samuel saw that 
                         photograph, so he's safe.

               He glances at her, but she continues ahead.

                                     BOOK
                         I mean it. You will be safe.

               Suddenly Rachel explodes:

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh yes! Of Course. Why shouldn't we 
                         feel safe in a city where the police 
                         are so busy killing each other!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. / INT. SCHAEFFER HOME, PHILADELPHIA SUBURBS  NIGHT

               The front door of Schaeffer's upper-middle class home is 
               opened by his wife MARILYN. She knows Book and is surprised 
               and delighted to see him. In the background daughter KATHY 
               is visible. Schaeffer himself appears and Book is welcomed 
               inside.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S STUDY  NIGHT

               Schaeffer passes Book a drink.

               Book is excited, animated... the hunter, after a long chase, 
               closing on his quarry:

                                     BOOK
                         It was McElroy, Paul.

               Schaeffer gives him a sharp look:

                                     BOOK
                         Last guy I would have figured. But 
                         he's part of it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I hope you don't have any doubts 
                         about that.

                                     BOOK
                         If I did, I'd have kept my mouth 
                         shut...
                              (and)
                         It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons 
                         of P2P confiscated four years ago... 
                         Guess who was in on the collar? Mac.
                              (excited, explaining 
                              the thing eagerly)
                         He salts it away somewhere... he 
                         knows the stuff is potent, but the 
                         street chemists haven't figured out 
                         how to process it. But they do now.
                              (and)
                         And now the stuff is worth five-grand 
                         a pint and there are a lot of pints 
                         in a fifty-five gallon drum.

                         clothes in two days.

               EXT. PARKING LOT  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               Book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being 
               locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports 
               section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward 
               his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports 
               section. He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts 
               to take a step... and looks up.

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the 
               other side of the parking lot crosswalk

               BACK TO BOOK

               Freezing, eyes widening. Utterly surprised and caught.

               MCELROY

               Still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping 
               bag (which he appeared to be carrying)  letting the shopping 
               bag fall away as he does so  revealing a five-inch barrel 
               Smith and Wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer. 
               Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he FIRES 
               once.

               BOOK

               Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven 
               into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as:

               MCELROY

               Coming right on, FIRING again... the pistol's report a 
               WHOOSHING, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne. 
               And McElroy still smiling as:

               BOOK

               Hit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send 
               Book down hard and grasping.

               MCELROY

               Lowering the pistol alongside his leg, as two MEN, barely 
               taking notice of anything, cross with their backs to Book 
               toward McElroy.

               He smiles at them.

               BOOK

               Down, muttering CURSES.

               THE SCENE

               As McElroy walks past Book, drops the pistol to the pavement, 
               keeps on going... and is gone.

               BOOK

               GROANING in pain, beginning to try to crawl crab-like. And 
               we HEAR  from the agonized recesses of Book's Dream.

                         Just us.

               As the lights of an oncoming car  going very slowly, on its 
               way to a parking space  sweep over him and we HEAR it come 
               to a sudden, squealing stop. Book is already trying to get 
               to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, 
               using an adjacent car for support. OFF SCREEN we HEAR a car 
               door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, 
               accompanied by excited voices. Book HEARS, turns to face the 
               oncomers,

               ANGLE

               A fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of 
               Book, looks on edgily:

                                     MAN
                         Hey, buddy, what's the score? Little 
                         too much to drink?

               Book stares at him, then looks down at his belly.

               BOOK'S WOUND

               As Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck 
               him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other 
               just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage).

               THE SCENE

               As the man stares:

                                     MAN
                         Goddamn, buddy. You better get to a 
                         hospital!
                              (and)
                         Here; I'll give you a hand.

               He starts to approach, but Book shoves him away.

                                     BOOK
                         No! No hospital!

               By now the man's WIFE is hovering at a safe distance:

                                     WIFE
                         Let him alone, Henry! If he wants to 
                         die in the street, that's his 
                         business!

               But the man is not content:

                                     MAN
                         Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at 
                         that blood?

               Book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to 
               intercept him:

                                     MAN
                         Come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed 
                         to death!

               Book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed 
               squarely at the fat man's face:

                                     MAN
                         Shit!

                                     WIFE
                              (quavering)
                         I told you, Henry!

               Book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is 
               sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at 
               the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back 
               toward his car.

               EXT. STREET  PHILADELPHIA  NIGHT

               As Book's car wheels somewhat erratically through traffic.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)

               Book has a gym bag open on the seat next to him, is stuffing 
               a tshirt under his belt to staunch the blood. And...

               INT. CARTER'S APARTMENT  BEDROOM  NIGHT

               As he's awakened by the RINGING bedside telephone. He snaps 
               on a lamp... He's instantly awake, not unused to such rousing 
               in the wee hours. A woman sleeps beside him.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah...

               INTERCUT BOOK

               He's at an n.d. pay phone.

                         What's happening.

                         can.

                         it. Maybe at the top of it.

               There's a stunned silence at the other end.

                                     BOOK
                         Yeah... I can put it all together 
                         when I get back, 'Til then, you know 
                         nothing, understand? Business as 
                         usual...

                         for me. And watch your ass.

               INT. GUEST ROOM, ELAINE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

               As the door opens and Elaine switches on the light, rousing 
               Rachel. Elaine looks haggard.

                                     ELAINE
                         It's John. He says you have to leave 
                         now. He says it's urgent.

               She leaves the room as Rachel instantly awake, moves quickly 
               to rouse Samuel.

               EXT. BATHROOM DOOR

               Elaine is outside the bathroom listening to instructions 
               from her brother. From inside we hear the SOUND OF RUNNING 
               WATER. Elaine is puzzled but also senses the urgency.

                         never heard of that woman and her 
                         boy.

               INT. BATHROOM

               Book looks at himself in the mirror, his face is pale and 
               drawn.

               He examines the wound, a cleanly drilled hole through his 
               right side, just under the rib cage. The wound continues to 
               bleed as he binds a towel tightly about him, before putting 
               his shirt back on.

               He then carefully wipes away any traces of blood on basin 
               with tissues which he flushes down the toilet.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING)

               As he drives across town. Samuel is curled up asleep, his 
               head on Rachel's lap.

                                     RACHEL

               Book gives her a look.

                              (insistent)
                         What happened?

               But Book, glancing in his rearview mirror, tenses.

               HIS POV  MIRROR

               In it we can see a police car coming on fast, with lights 
               and SIREN.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rachel eyes Book warily.

               A beat, then the police car WAILS past. Book expels a breath.

                                     RACHEL

               Rachel looks away, speaks almost sarcastically, MUTTERING.

               A couple of plainclothesmen have paused outside the door to 
               give him a look. Meets their eyes. They move on.

               Carter shakes it off, goes. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR (MOVING)

               As light colors the eastern horizon, Book is crossing into 
               Lancaster County.

               Book glances at Rachel; she's asleep. He coughs wrackingly, 
               hurting... cinches the belt of his overcoat even tighter. 
               And...

               HIS POV  BOOK'S CAR

               Coming up the long drive.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As the car pulls up in the barnyard and Eli crosses to it.

               Suddenly the car door flies open and Samuel jumps out, races 
               across the barnyard to hurl himself into the old man.

               ANGLE AT CAR

               As Rachel steps out of the passenger's side, Book remains 
               seated.

               He lets his eyes travel around the farm.

                                     RACHEL
                         Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make 
                         coffee and breakfast.

                                     BOOK
                         I can't.

                         What about Samuel? Will you come 
                         back to take him to trial?

               Book starts the engine:

                                     BOOK
                              (grimly)
                         There isn't going to be one.

               Rachel stares at him, not sure what he means. Then backs 
               away, closing the door. Book begins to turn the car around 
               in the barnyard.

               ANGLE

               As Eli crosses to Rachel, his arm around Samuel.

                         Who was that man?

                                     RACHEL
                         His name is John Book.

               Eli is about to inquire further when Samuel cries:

                                     SAMUEL
                         Momma  look.

               They glance in the direction Samuel is looking.

               THEIR POV  BOOK'S CAR

               The car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now 
               bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field. It's knocked 
               over a tall birdhouse by the roadside. The car finally comes 
               to rest against a bank of earth.

               BACK TO RACHEL

               She stares...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               As Samuel races for all he's worth across the field, 
               negotiates the creek via a fallen log  Rachel, now, also 
               running toward the car.

               EXT. STABLES  DAY

               Eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon. He 
               hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot.

               ANGLE AT BOOK'S CAR

               We see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible 
               in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under 
               his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron. 
               Momentarily he comes awake:

                                     RACHEL
                         But John... why didn't you go to a

                              (bewildered)
                         But why?

                         Gunshot... they'll file reports... 
                         they'll find me.

                                     RACHEL
                         But 

               Book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely:

                                     BOOK
                         And when they find me, they'll find 
                         your boy!

               He slips under again. Rachel stares at him, realizing the 
               price he's paid in returning them to safety.

               She reaches out, touches him gently.

               But the moment is broken by...

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Eli reins up in the springwagon. He climbs down, crosses 
               to glance into the car.

                                     ELI
                         Is the English dead?

                         Looks dead...

               And together they begin to lift Book from the car and place 
               him in the back of the springwagon. And...

               Where Eli is looking out a window.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               An Amish buggy coming up the drive, past Book' s car.

               ANGLE IN BEDROOM

               Where Book lies on a bed. Rachel is bathing his wound with 
               warm water from a pan.

               Eli appears in the doorway.

                                     ELI
                         Stoltzfus is coming.

               Rachel looks at him, nods.

               Eli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly 
               folded clothes on a chair near the bed.

                                     ELI
                         That has no place in this house.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know.

               She picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places 
               them in a chest.

                                     RACHEL

               As Samuel comes in with old Stoltzfus and Stoltzfus's teenage 
               son, LEVI.

                         Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus.

               Stoltzfus's eyes have gone to the bed:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         That's the English is it?

               INT. SICKROOM  TIGHT

               As Stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of 
               Book's wound:

                                     STOLTZFUS (O.S.)
                         I feel... burning.

               WIDER

               As Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily, 
               moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the 
               examination.

               Finally he steps back.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         This man should be treated in town.
                              (indicates)
                         The bullet entered there... and came 
                         out there. But there is the danger 
                         of infection, and he has lost a great 
                         deal of blood.

               Rachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her 
               dilemma.

               Her eyes fall on Samuel. Gently she ushers him from the room:

                                     RACHEL
                         Go help Levi with the car, Samuel.

               She closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and 
               Stoltzfus:

                                     RACHEL
                         No, he must stay here.

               Stoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look. And:

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if 
                         he dies? Then the sheriff will come. 
                         They'll say we broke their laws 

                                     RACHEL
                         We'll pray that he doesn't die! But 
                         if he does, then we'll find a way so 
                         no one knows!

                                     ELI
                         Rachel, this is a man's life, we 
                         hold it in our hands.

                                     RACHEL
                         I know God help me, I know that, 
                         Eli.
                              (then)
                         But I tell you that if he's found 
                         here, the people who did this to him 
                         will come for Samuel.

               Rachel beseeches them helplessly:

                                     RACHEL
                         What else can we do?

               EXT. LAPP DRIVE

               Levi has hitched Eli's mules to the rear of Book's car and 
               is towing it up the drive toward the barn, with Samuel 
               catching a ride on the bumper.

               As Stoltzfus and Levi are about to go: Stoltzfus turns to 
               Rachel:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Make a poultice... three parts milk, 
                         two parts linseed oil... for the 
                         infection.

               I'll send Mary by with some teas I will brew myself.

                                     RACHEL
                         Thank you.

               Stoltzfus turns to Eli:

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Lapp, I'll have to speak with the 
                         diener on this matter.

                                     ELI
                              (nods)
                         As you see fit, Stoltzfus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning 
               low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered.

               Book's brow is beaded with sweat.

               Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat-
               soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should 
               get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on 
               display here just now than she's quite comfortable with.

               She begins to apply the poultice.

               ANGLE

               As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he 
               recoils with alarm.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's all right! You have got to lie 
                         still.

               Book stares up at her without recognition, but some of what 
               she says seems to penetrate. He quiets.

                                     RACHEL
                              (soothingly)
                         Yes, much better...

               ANGLE

               As Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her 
               hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so.

               She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, 
               so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, 
               scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one 
               shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious 
               Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at 
               first, then the words take shape  swear words; curses; fuck 
               this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks 
               coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth. 
               She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind 
               her.

               Who is trying to control his impatience:

                         Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should 
                         simplify your work.

               The Undersheriff frowns. He doesn't like being talked down 
               to.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF

                         Maybe a road or route number?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Sorry.

               The Undersheriff is not impressed.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third 
                         Amishman around here is named Lapp. 
                         That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler.
                              (and)
                         Chief, if the Amish have taken your 
                         man in, I wouldn't want to hang from 
                         a rope until you find him.

               ANGLE

               Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an 
                         education.

               He hangs up. A beat; the man is a study in frustration. Then 
               he glances up.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who 
               spotted Carter in Book's office in the earlier scene. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  DAY

               A bright, sunny afternoon.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's leading a team of horses to the barn. In the b.g. 
               three buggies are parked in the barnyard, traces empty. 
               Visitors.

               ANGLE IN SICKROOM

               Where Book lies in the bed. His fever seems to have subsided. 
               He's coming awake, tries to focus on the room.

               BOOK'S POV  CLERGY

               PANNING the four men in Amish black who are standing around 
               the bed looking down at Book, muttering among themselves in 
               German.

               These include TSCHANTZ, the district bishop, a hawk-nosed, 
               sterneyed old fellow; Stoltzfus, a deacon as well as a healer; 
               and two preachers, ERB and HERSHBERGER. Eli stands somewhat 
               apart.

               ANGLE

               Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes.

               Tschantz rumbles in German.

               SUBTITLES OVER.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to 
                         your credit.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         He was touched by God's hand.

               Tschantz grunts, motions, for the other clergy aside with 
               him.

               Rachel enters briskly with a steaming pot of tea and a cup, 
               smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Hello.

               Book stares at her, then at the old bearded gentlemen.

                                     BOOK
                              (closing his eyes)
                         Who are they?

                                     RACHEL
                         The leadership of our district... 
                         the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the 
                         one with no hair on top. They decided 
                         to come and see you for themselves. 
                         Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came 
                         the first day. I think he saved your 
                         life.

                                     BOOK
                         Can I have something to drink?

               Rachel brings him tea.

                                     BOOK
                         Does anybody know I'm here?

                                     RACHEL
                         Only the elders.

                                     BOOK
                         How long?

                                     RACHEL
                         What?

                                     BOOK
                         How long have I been here?

                                     RACHEL
                         Two days.

                                     BOOK
                              (a beat)
                         Listen, thank you. Thanks for 
                         everything. But I've got to go.

                                     RACHEL
                              (frowns)
                         But you can't.

               He tries to rise, falls back faint. Rachel rearranges the 
               sheet.

                                     RACHEL
                         See. Anyway, you don't have any 
                         clothes on. And besides that, Bishop 
                         Tschantz wants to talk to you when 
                         you feel better.

               The elders appear to have concluded their conference, and 
               are filing out. Stoltzfus pauses at bedside.

                                     STOLTZFUS
                         Rest, Mr. Book. That's the ticket. 
                         And drink my of my tea.

               He goes. Book is still fending off the dizziness. Rachel 
               puts the teacup to his lips.

                                     BOOK
                         Tell him his tea stinks.

                                     RACHEL
                              (smiles)
                         You tell him. When you're able.

               He looks like he's about to drop off again. Rachel rises.

                                     RACHEL
                              (from the door)
                         We're all very happy that you're 
                         going to live, John Book. We didn't 
                         quite know what we were going to do 
                         with you if you died.

               That penetrates for a moment just before Book slips into 
               sleep again.

               INT. LAPP LIVING ROOM  DAY

               As the rather worrisome Hershberger frowns:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         ...but a gunshot wound. Very serious.

                                     TSCHANTZ
                         It is not the first time we have 
                         done this. In the Englischer war of 
                         the revolution, old Elmer Miller's 
                         grandfather took in gunshot English 
                         soldiers.
                              (a tad of pride)
                         Saved them, too.

               They all nod. What Tschantz says is well known. Then:

                                     ERB
                         Still, he should be among his own 
                         people.

               Rachel enters on this last.

                                     RACHEL
                         He'll leave as soon as he is able. 
                         He already wants to go.

               Hershberger gives her a gloomy look, turns to Stoltzfus:

                                     HERSHBERGER
                         How long will that be, Stoltzfus?

                                     STOLTZFUS
                              (shrugs)
                         A month. Maybe less. With God's 
                         healing love.

               EXT. BOOK'S SISTER'S HOUSE  PHILADELPHIA  DAY

               Schaeffer is knocking at the front doors. A beat, then Elaine 
               opens it cautiously, peers out.

                                     ELAINE
                              (half fearfully)
                         Did you find him?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Not yet.

               Suddenly her eyes blaze, she starts to close the door:

                                     ELAINE
                         Then go away, you bastard.

               Schaeffer quickly  but gently  prevents her from shutting 
               it.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Elaine, I've come to apologize for 
                         Lt. McElroy. He overstated the 
                         department's position.

                                     ELAINE
                              (bitterly)
                         He accused John of taking kickbacks. 
                         And you know  anybody who knows 
                         John  knows that's a goddamn lie!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (smoothly)
                         Of course, Elaine. But as long as 
                         there's any question, better Johnny 
                         should come back and clear his name.

                                     ELAINE
                              (cuts in)
                         Better you should get off my front 
                         porch before I get my mace!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Elaine, I don't want to have to take 
                         you in for questioning. You've got 
                         his car, you were the last to see 
                         him 

                                     ELAINE
                              (clipped)
                         I don't know where he is.

               McElroy watching.

               THEIR POV  FRONT DOOR

               We see a final exchange between Elaine and Schaeffer. Elaine 
               forces the door shut. Schaeffer turns, walks slowly to his 
               car.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S CAR

               As Schaeffer opens the door, climbs in, sinks wearily into 
               the seat, beside McElroy.

                                     MCELROY
                         She say where he is?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I don't think she knows.

               Schaeffer is staring grimly ahead.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         What about Carter?

                                     MCELROY
                         Tight. But I'm working on him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lean on him.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  NIGHT

               REESTABLISHING, and TIGHTENING to the upstairs sickroom window 
               where a lamp dimly burns.

               INT. SICKROOM

               As Samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan. Book is lying asleep 
               on the bed.

               Samuel puts the bedpan down, checks to make sure Book is 
               indeed asleep, then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed 
               and opens the clothes chest.

               ANGLE

               Book's big .38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded 
               clothes.

               Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled 
               pistol grips. Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon 
               from the holster, then pauses to steal a look. OFF SCREEN...

               BOOK

               His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the 
               boy something of a jolt.

                                     BOOK
                         Give me that.

               Mutely, Samuel hands Book the pistol from arm's length. He 
               looks on as Book takes the pistol out of the holster, shoots 
               the boy another look, then snaps open the cylinder and shakes 
               out the heavy, copper-jacketed bullets into his palm. He 
               snaps the cylinder closed again, then nods to Samuel.

                                     BOOK
                         Come here.

                         promise not to say anything to your 
                         momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't 
                         understand.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (grins)
                         Okay, Mr. Book.

               Book smiles. Then he gives the boy a playful, John Wayne-
               tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol, 
               demonstrating the action.

               He finally hands it over to Samuel, butt first.

                         Call me John.

               The boy tries to imitate Book's one-handed expertise, but 
               his hands are too small. Book smiles.

               Samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked, using two 
               hands, and Book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so 
               that it's not pointed at him.

                                     BOOK
                         You don't want to point that at people 
                         you just started calling by their 
                         first name.

               Samuel levels the pistol at the door and, just as he snaps 
               the trigger, Rachel enters, pulls up short in some dismay to 
               find her son has a gun pointed at her. Samuel blanches and 
               Book winces, knowing there's heavy weather ahead.

                                     RACHEL
                              (snaps)
                         Samuel!

               Samuel quickly hands the pistol back to Book, who holsters 
               it:

                                     RACHEL
                         Wait for me downstairs.

               Samuel quickly exits, and Rachel angrily advances on Book.

                                     RACHEL
                         John Book, I would appreciate it if, 
                         during the time you are with us, you 
                         would have as little to do with Samuel 
                         as possible.

                                     BOOK
                         Nobody meant any harm. The boy was 
                         curious. I unloaded the gun -

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not the gun. Don't you 
                         understand... It's you. What you 
                         stand for.
                              (and)
                         That is not for Samuel.

               Book looks at her thoughtfully.

               Rachel softens a bit:

                                     RACHEL
                         Please, it has nothing to do with 
                         you personally.

               He hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets.

                                     BOOK
                         Put it up someplace Samuel can't get 
                         it.

               A beat, then Rachel, takes the pistol and starts to go. Book 
               stops her:

                                     BOOK
                         Friends?

               Rachel glances back at him, smiles and nods. And...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KITCHEN  LAPP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book's holstered gun and bullets at center table. Eli sits 
               on one side, a chastened Samuel on the other. Rachel looks 
               on from the b.g.

               Eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will 
               ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central 
               pillars of the Amish way.

                                     ELI
                         The gun  that gun of the hand  is 
                         for the taking of human life. Would 
                         you kill another man? Eh?

               Samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. Eli 
               leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially.

                                     ELI
                         What you take into your hands, you 
                         take into your heart.

               A beat, then Samuel musters some defiance.

                                     SAMUEL
                         I would only kill a bad man.

                                     ELI
                         Only a bad man. I see. And you know 
                         these bad men on sight? You are able 
                         to look into their hearts and see 
                         this badness?

                                     SAMUEL
                         I can see what they do.

               Now he meets Eli's eyes:

                                     SAMUEL
                         I have seen it.

               Eli expels a deep sigh; then:

                                     ELI
                         And having seen, you would become 
                         one of them?
                              (intent... gesturing)
                         Don't you see...? The hand leads the 
                         arm leads the shoulder leads the 
                         head... leads the heart. The one 
                         goes into the other into the other 
                         into the other... And you have 
                         changed, and gone amongst them...

               He breaks off, bows his head for a moment. Then he fixes the 
               boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly 
               into the tabletop with enormous intensity:

                                     ELI
                         "Wherefore come out from among them 
                         and be ye separate, saith the Lord!"

                                     ELI
                              (indicating pistol; 
                              continuing from 
                              Corinthians 6:17)
                         "And touch not the unclean thing!"

               His intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely 
               impressive.

               EXT. WASHHOUSE  NEAR KITCHEN  NIGHT 

               Book stands near the door to the kitchen, and has heard most 
               or all of Eli's words. He turns, and painfully makes his way 
               into the washhouse, moving quietly, hoping no one will come 
               out from the kitchen.

               EXT. BARN  LAPP FARM  DAY

               Samuel harnesses up the family mare, and backs her into the 
               traces of the buggy.

               INT. BOOK'S BEDROOM  DAY

               Book stands at the window in a worn robe. Below, through the 
               window, we can see Samuel and Eli in the barnyard. A beat, 
               then Book crosses impatiently back to his bed, sits down, 
               picks up a dog-earred copy of The American Dairyman. There's 
               a stack of well-thumbed farm magazines and copies of The 
               Budget (the Amish newspaper) on the bedside table.

               There's a knock. Rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing. 
               She smiles.

                                     RACHEL
                         Enjoying your reading?

                         stained with blood. I have them 
                         soaking.You can wear these.

               She passes the clothes to Book.

                         Yes. It's good that someone can have 
                         the use of them. Besides, in your 
                         clothes you'd stand out to strangers.

               She continues, cheerfully.

                                     RACHEL
                         I should tell you these do not have

                         Vain. Proud. Such a person is 
                         Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.

                              (almost blushing)
                         You make fun of me. Like the tourists.
                         Driving by all the time. Some even 
                         come into the yard. Very rude. They 
                         seem to think we are quaint.

                                     BOOK
                         Quaint? Can't imagine why.

               She smiles.

               Rachel's face clouds.

                         Samuel to school. But you'll have to 
                         hurry.

               Rachel turns to leave when Book calls her back.

                                     BOOK
                         Rachel.

               She turns to look at him. It's the first time he's used her 
               name.

                                     BOOK
                         Thanks.

               She smiles and leaves.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE  DAY

               Eli calls impatiently from the buggy. Samuel sits beside 
               him.

                                     ELI
                         Hurry up now, John Book!

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Rachel washing dishes turns on hearing Book enter. She laughs 
               out loud at the sight of him in his Amish gear, and rightly 
               so  the pants are highwater, the hat low-rise, the jacket 
               ill-fitting.

               Book looks self-conscious, even a little sheepish.

               Outside another SHOUT from Eli.

                                     RACHEL
                         You'd better go.

               Book looks embarrassed.

                                     BOOK
                         My... eh... gun?

               The smile fades from Rachel's face as she reaches up into a 
               cupboard. She passes the gun in its holster to Book. He 
               fastens it about him. The contradiction of an "Armed Amishman" 
               increases the awkwardness between them. Book turns his back 
               to her and checks the weapon. He turns back to her smiling 
               in an odd way.

                                     BOOK
                         The... bullets?

                                     RACHEL
                         Oh. The bullets.

               She takes them out of a disused coffee jar, passes them to 
               Book.

                                     BOOK
                              (attempting a joke)
                         Not much good without them.

               INT. BUGGY  COUNTRY ROAD  DAY

               Samuel sits between Eli and Book. Both men stare straight 
               ahead.

               Eli looks particularly stern. It's pretty clear he doesn't 
               like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith.

               EXT. AMISH ONE-TEACHER-SCHOOL  DAY

               With awave Samuel runs into the schoolyard to join his 
               friends. A teacher begins ringing a bell.

               INT. STORE  SALTZBURG

               Book on the telephone waiting for his call to be answered. 
               He looks about him  several Amish and Dithers mingle in the 
               shop.

               Book-has gotten a coke from a machine, seems a bit self-
               conscious shout it sips at it surreptitiously... A voice 
               comes on the line; it's that of Book's partner.

                                     CARTER
                         Yeah?

               A silence.

                         Listen, Johnny, don't do anything 
                         stupid. You couldn't get within a

                         know when maybe it makes sense.

               A beat as Book considers that.

                         That's more like it.

                         Where are you at, anyway?

               Book allows himself a small smile, regarding his Amish image 
               reflected in the window of the store.

                                     BOOK
                         Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

                         Make that 1790.

               He hangs up. A beat, then he stares toward the door of the 
               store.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book works on his car. The battery has gone flat and he's 
               trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted 
               under the front seat of the Lapp buggy.

               Eli stands at the barn door staring at him, again the 
               disapproving look.

                                     ELI
                         If you are well enough to do that 
                         thing, you can do work for me.

               Book is genuinely apologetic.

               lamp.

               He pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with 
               undisguised anticipation. Then he gives him a jarring thump:

                                     ELI
                              (briskly)
                         Veck oufl. Time for milking.

               Book comes groggily awake as Eli exits. He gropes for his 
               watch.

               As he stares at it in disbelief.

               As the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with 
               Samuel prodding them along, headed for the milking stalls. 
               Book looks on in the lamplight, nonplused.

               SAMUEL

               Where he's pitching hay into the cow's feed-troughs.

               BOOK, ELI

               Where the old man is showing Book how to milk a cow by hand. 
               We see Rachel watching from the milkhouse door (steam from 
               scalding milk cans rising behind her).

                                     ELI
                         Good, firm twist and pull, eh?
                              (and)
                         Right. Now you try it.

               Book gives him a look, takes over the milking stool. The cow 
               shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder. Book 
               bends to his task.

                                     ELI
                         Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You 
                         never had your hands on a teat before?

                         Not one this big.

               Eli unexpectedly finds this hilarious, cackles, gives Book a 
               comradely, man-of-the-world thump on the shoulder that jars 
               him.

               Then he moves off. Book bends to his task, and...

               ANGLE  RACHEL

               Grinning, giggling, covering her mouth with one hand.

               As he pours a pail full of milk into a large, stainless steel 
               milk can.

               Something in him can't help but respond to the beauty.

               A beat, then he blows on his hands, rubs them briskly together 
               against the morning chill, and turns back to the barn.

               EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE  DAY

               It is later in the morning. Rachel comes out onto the porch, 
               tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass, looks 
               toward the barn.

               ANGLE  THE BARN

               Eli and Book standing in one of the open doorways, looking 
               in.

               ANGLE FAVORING Luke, one of Eli's team of fine mules as Samuel 
               opens the stall gate. The beast is skittish, obviously 
               afflicted with something of a behavioral problem.

               But he allows Samuel to lead him out.

               BOOK, ELI

               As Samuel brings Luke out. Eli is now harnessing the other 
               mule of the team to a large manure-spreader. But as Luke 
               nears Book, his eyes widen and he shies, almost hauling Samuel 
               off his feet.

               Book moves to Samuel's aid; a gesture which proves a serious 
               mistake. Luke erupts into a SCREAMING, bucking cyclone. Samuel 
                who no doubt has been here before  dives nimbly for cover 
               as a flying hoof nearly takes Book's head off.

               Then Eli hustles into the fray, pushing Book aside as he 
               BELLOWS belligerently in German at the rearing animal. Finally 
               he gives Luke a swat upside the head that seems, somehow, to 
               have the effect of quieting the beast instantly.

               Samuel gives the shaken Book a look:

                         That's Luke. He doesn't like 
                         strangers.

                         You don't say.

               Eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces, grunting at 
               Book.

                                     ELI

               Book collects the pieces of the birdhouse which his car 
               knocked down the day of his attempted departure. He pauses 
               as a figure approaches. We recognize Daniel Hochstetler, 
               Rachel's would-be suitor. He heads for Book with an outgoing 
               smile and outstretched hand. Here's a likable man who likes 
               people.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good morning. Book, is it? You are 
                         the Yankee they talk about?

                         I thought I was the English.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         English, Yankee. It's the same. My 
                         name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.
                              (sizes up his clothes)
                         You look plain, Book.
                              (grinning)
                         Very plain.

               Book is not particularly amused.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         I came to see Rachel Lapp.

                         Try the house.

               Hochstetler gives Book a powerful clap on the shoulder.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                              (genially)
                         You bet. you take care of yourself.

               Hochstetler heads for the house. Book stares after him with 
               some interest.

               ANGLE

               As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him. She also 
               catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion 
               crossing her expression for an instant.

               And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either.

               Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome.

               HOG PENS

               Book, having gathered up the pieces of the bird house, is 
               headed toward the outbuildings, passing by hog pens. He 
               glances toward the house:

               Thoughtful... He glances at the hog pen as a huge sow SQUEALS 
               and angrily noses her young ones away from the trough so she 
               can feed.

               Eli is seated at the head of the table, Book opposite Samuel 
               and Rachel. The table is piled high with an incredible amount 
               of food.

               Eli eyes Book cagily, waves his fork at him:

                                     ELI
                         Eat up, Book. What's the matter with 
                         your appetite?

                                     BOOK
                         Guess I'm not used to so much.

                                     ELI
                              (snorts)
                         Not used to hard work. That's what 
                         makes an appetite.

               Book swallows that one. With difficulty. Rachel intervenes:

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli, John is a carpenter.
                              (conciliatory 
                              afterthought)
                         As well as being a fine policeman.

                                     ELI
                         Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to 
                         Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how 
                         good a carpenter.

               Book can't refuse the challenge.

                                     BOOK
                         Sure.

                                     RACHEL
                         But... You may not be well enough.

                                     BOOK
                         I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' 
                         tea.

               EXT. / INT. BARN  NIGHT

               As Rachel, lamp in hand, walks up to the barn. She looks in 
               to find Book tinkering with the battery hookup to the Lapp 
               buggy.

               He glances up as she enters:

                                     BOOK
                         Hi...

               As she sets her lamp down near the one he's using.

                                     RACHEL
                              (beat)
                         When will you be going?

                                     BOOK
                         Not long... A few days.

               Another beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the 
               battery power, hits the radio  and suddenly from the 
               Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major 
               inventions  rock and roll.

               It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more 
               even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's 
               his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous 
               as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in 
               Amish.

               Rachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book 
               sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel 
               alternately protesting and laughing.

                                     BOOK
                         You like it... Don't you?

               Rachel, confused, protests:

                                     RACHEL
                         No... You just stop 

               But she doesn't really want to. Book grins:

                                     BOOK
                              (mock alarm)
                         Next thing you know you'll be off 
                         drinking beer and racing motorcycles.

               And it goes on... Rachel alternately protesting and laughing.

               ANGLE  THE BARN DOOR

               As Eli suddenly appears. He glowers for an instant, 
               thunderstruck, then BELLOWS:

                                     ELI
                         Rachel!

               THE SCENE

               As Book and Rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt. Both 
               turn, look at Eli. Rachel regards him level-eyed, without 
               discernible alarm. Book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over, 
               turns off the radio, as:

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         What is this? This Myusick?

               Book hesitates, then starts to say something:

                                     BOOK
                         It's not her fault. I 

               But he gets such a look from Eli that he turns, goes out.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         How can this be? How can you do such 
                         a thing? Is this plain? Is this the 
                         ordnung?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have done nothing against the 
                         ordnung.

                                     ELI
                              (in the dialect)
                         Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this 
                         man to our house. With his gun of 
                         the hand. You bring fear to this 
                         house. Fear of English with guns 
                         coming after. You bring blood and 
                         whispers of more blood. Now English 
                         music... and you are dancing to 
                         English music! And you call this 
                         nothing?

                                     RACHEL
                         I have committed no sin.

                                     ELI
                              (in English)
                         No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, 
                         it does not look...
                              (tone softening... in 
                              the dialect)
                         Don't you know there has been talk? 
                         Talk about you, not him. Talk about 
                         going to the Bishop. About having 
                         you... shunned!

                                     RACHEL
                         That is idle talk.

                                     ELI
                              (in English, pleading)
                         Do not make light of it, Rachel. 
                         They can do it... quick! Like that! 
                         And then... then I can not sit at 
                         table with you. I can not take a 
                         thing from your hand. I... I can not 
                         go with you to meeting!
                              (the old man almost 
                              breaks down as, in 
                              the dialect)
                         Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go 
                         too far! Dear child!

               Rachel is annoyed  also touched, no doubt, by the old man's 
               plea  but irked by his condescending tone.

                                     RACHEL
                         I am not a child.

                                     ELI
                              (suddenly stern again)
                         You are acting like one!

                                     RACHEL
                         I will be the judge of that.

                                     ELI
                              (fierce as a prophet)
                         No! They will be the judge of that! 
                         And so will I... if you shame me!

                                     RACHEL
                              (blinking a tear now, 
                              but meeting his gaze)
                         You shame yourself.

               And shaken  but proud and erect  she turns and walks out.

               INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE  NIGHT

               Carter sits, Schaeffer prowls... slowly, letting silences 
               grow before he strikes again with another softly-snarled 
               question or statement.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You know where he is.

                                     CARTER
                         Wrong.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You'd lie to protect him.

                                     CARTER
                              (cool)
                         Probably.

               Schaeffer snaps around, glares at him.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You admit you're lying?

                                     CARTER
                              (shakes head)
                         I admit I don't know where he is.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You're the first one he'll contact.

                                     CARTER
                              (sighing)
                         He's got my number.

               Schaeffer stops, stands in front of Carter, takes a deep 
               breath... suddenly smiles. And is abruptly (as he is capable 
               of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason. He even 
               CHUCKLES as he begins:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         It's funny. I know he's hiding 
                         somewhere with the Amish, I know it.
                              (a quick glance at 
                              Carter)
                         Can you imagine John Book at a prayer 
                         meeting? Our John Book?

               Schaeffer CHUCKLES again, looks hopefully again at Carter.

               Carter looks back, stony-eyed. Schaeffer makes another abrupt 
               shift in form... but still speaks softly.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Either you're a member of the club 
                         or you aren't, Elton.
                              (he nods his head, as)
                         Tell me what you know...

                                     CARTER
                         What I know, Paul, is...
                              (nodding his head)
                         He's going to take you out...

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               As Book pauses by the barn door, glances over his shoulder.

               HIS POV  BUGGY

               With trace horse harnessed... Samuel and Eli loading 
               provisions into the buggy, standing down by the house.

               BACK TO BOOK  INT. / EXT. BARN

               As he goes into the barn.

               Book approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the 
               temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his 
               hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches.

               Book starts to talk gently to the animal:

                                     BOOK
                         All right, you nasty son of a bitch, 
                         we're going to be friends whether 
                         you like it or not.

               Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall 
               gate.

               ANGLE

               As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, 
               brings out some lumps of sugar.

                                     BOOK
                         See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't 
                         you for Christ's sake?

               Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends 
               to eat. Book nods with satisfaction.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled 
               expression.

                                     RACHEL
                              (surprised)
                         Well...

               Book turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment!

                                     BOOK
                         Won him over just like that.

                                     RACHEL
                         I see.
                              (and)
                         But I hope you have a lot of sugar.
                              (then, going)
                         Eli is ready to go to Zook's.

               Just then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a 
               nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him 
               skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go:

                                     BOOK
                         Later.

               And we...

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               BIG SHOT... it's early morning as the Amish buggies are 
               arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising.

               In the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the 
               construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun 
               raising the main supports on the already laid foundation.

               Elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are 
               spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot 
               coffee and cold lemonade for the men,

               LAPP BUGGY

               As Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the 
               construction site.

                                     ELI
                         Wait here 'til I find a gang you can 
                         work with.

               He goes. Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and 
               more workmen and their families climb out.

               Eli appears with Hochstetler in tow. Hochstetler's broad 
               face breaks into a grin:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Book! Good to see you!

               He pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting 
               and pleasantry to Rachel. She looks on, amused.

               Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his 
               showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance.

               And Book realizes it as well.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.

                                     BOOK
                         It's been a while.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         No matter. Come with me. We can always 
                         use a good carpenter.

               With that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and 
               ushers him away. Rachel calls after them:

                                     RACHEL
                         Good luck.

               BOOK / HOCHSTETLER

               As they move off.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Your hole is healed, then?

                                     BOOK
                              (gives him a look)
                         Pretty much.

               Hochstetler nods with satisfaction:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Good. Then you can go home.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CUTS

               As the morning progresses:

               ...Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers 
               on big sawhorses. There's an unmistakable atmosphere of 
               competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely 
               unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the 
               gang.

               ...or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems  without leaning 
               on it too heavily  to be measuring the two men as the morning 
               progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of 
               them.

               ...Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with 
               sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising 
               the construction. All around them the structure is rising 
               with remarkable rapidity.

               ...Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge 
               noon meal. Other women are sitting on benches in the b.g., 
               knitting or doing quiltwork.

               ...Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a 
               group of boys his own age. Elsewhere we see little girls 
               "botching" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes).

               ...The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs 
               in the sunlight, looking on  the old men kibitzing in German, 
               the women gossiping.

               Until...

               BIG SHOT

               Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead... at 
               least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about 
               the barn framework...

               ...some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job, 
               others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and 
               what-all... so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing 
               up before our very eyes. And there isn't a power tool in 
               sight.

               WOMEN'S AREA

               As Rachel crosses near the benches... we can see other women 
               eyeing her, whispering among themselves, some tittering. 
               Rachel ignores them.

               She joins the stoutly amiable Mrs. Yoder from the funeral 
               sequence earlier. The older woman is emptying a big pan of 
               fried chicken into serving platters. She smiles, obviously 
               liking Rachel.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Everyone has an idea about you and 
                         the English.

                                     RACHEL
                         All of them charitable, I'm sure.

                                     MRS. YODER
                         Hardly any of them.

               ANGLE  THE ROOFBEAM

               Book and Hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs, holding 
               them together prior to nailing them to the roof-beam. They 
               are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another, 
               way out at the far end of the roof.

               Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start 
               to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them.

               Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof 
               with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it 
               back together.

               Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe.

               Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Nail it!

                                     BOOK
                         Yes, sir.

               And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding, 
               looks on.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               BIG SHOT

               The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters. 
               It's late afternoon.

               ANGLE ON BOOK

               He hesitates. His face is pale and covered with sweat. The 
               exertion of the day has taken its toll. He's in danger of 
               fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. But he's 
               determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, 
               nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. Hochstetler 
               guesses the situation. He moves beside Book, claps an arm 
               about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book. From 
               below, someone TELLS them to hurry up.

               Hochstetler shouts:

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         We admire our work!

               The moment passes for Book, and he's okay. Hochstetler removes 
               his supporting arm. Book looks him in the eye, nods his 
               appreciation almost imperceptibly. Hochstetler wants no 
               thanks, and Book knows it. Hochstetler gives him a resounding 
               SLAP on the back, and starts climbing down. Book follows.

               EXT. ZOOK FARM  LANCASTER COUNTY  EVENING

               The gathering has congregated to hear Bishop Tschantz offer 
               up a blessing on the new barn.

               CONGREGATION

               PANNING the faces as they listen to the heavy German words 
               rolling out over the still evening air.

               Book stands a little to one side of the Amish. The prayers 
               he cannot share with them. Rachel is aware of this, feels 
               something of his emotion. She looks toward him, then she too 
               closes her eyes and drifts away from him, into the soothing 
               prayer.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LAPP FARM  NIGHT

               Book stands outside, listening to the NIGHT SOUNDS. He turns, 
               walks up toward the porch.

               EXT. PORCH  TARP FARMHOUSE  NIGHT

               Book takes a seat in a chair, SIGHS, looks toward the night 
               sky.

               There is a SOUND, but it's a moment before he turns his eyes 
               toward the door.

               ANGLE  THE DOOR

               Samuel standing there in his nightshirt.

               BACK TO SCENE

               As Book leans forward in his chair.

                                     BOOK
                         Hey, Sam...

                                     SAMUEL
                         ...I want to say a thing.

                                     BOOK
                              (sitting up)
                         What's that, Sam?

               The boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts 
               across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly... 
               then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving 
               the door open behind him.

               ANGLE  BOOK

               Looking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he 
               speaks softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Same to you, Sam.

               After another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door 
               that Samuel has left open behind him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               From the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to 
               the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see 
               where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor. 
               The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks 
               softly:

                                     BOOK
                         Sam?

               No answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind 
               him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen.

               INT. LAPP WASHHOUSE  NIGHT

               Where Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is 
               pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub.

               She replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of 
               her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back 
               of a chair.

               Then she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath.

               RACHEL'S POV  FRYING PAN

               The gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over 
               the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image 
               reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway.

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rachel hesitates for a moment  and in that moment she makes 
               a choice.

               Slowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his 
               eyes.

               And for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of 
               eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, 
               for an instant, a woman of Book's world.

               BOOK

               As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable 
               to make it happen.

               And suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, 
               picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting 
               it on, looks away.

               BOOK

               TIGHTENING to him, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Where Rachel is scattering feed to the chickens.

               A beat, then Book approaches from behind her. A moment, as 
               she senses his presence.

               Book watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing 
               them in the fold of her apron.

               When he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work.

                                     BOOK
                         Last night.

               She goes very still, but keeps her back to him.

                                     BOOK
                         If... we'd made love, then, I couldn't 
                         leave.

               She lowers her head slightly, but remains turned away from 
               him.

               Book continues to stare at her.

               EXT. RURAL ROAD  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAY

               The Lapp carriage on a winding lane.

               INT. BUGGY (MOVING)

               Rachel is driving, Book sitting next to her. Samuel is in 
               the back, looking out the rear window and not paying any 
               attention to the adults.

               A beat, then a large produce truck roars past them. It's all 
               Book can do to keep from flinching.

               Rachel stares straight ahead. Book glances at her.

                                     BOOK
                         Maybe I ought to learn to drive this 
                         thing.

               Rachel says nothing.

                                     BOOK
                              (beat)
                         Pick myself up another useful skill.

               Now Rachel can't help but smile. She looks at him. And...

               EXT. ANGLE

               We can see the Lapp buggy approaching a rural intersection, 
               another buggy approaching at right angles.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel eyes the other buggy through the windshield.

                                     RACHEL
                         Samuel, who is that?

               Samuel checks out the buggy.

                                     SAMUEL
                         It looks like Hochstetler's mare.

               EXT. ANGLE

               As the Lapp buggy passes the intersection and the Hochstetler 
               buggy swings in behind them. Then the Hochstetler buggy, 
               coming on at a faster clip, starts to pass the Lapp buggy.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY

               As Rachel waves at the occupants of the other buggy; Daniel 
               returns her greeting:

                                     BOOK
                              (teasing her)
                         Uh oh, they're leaving us behind.

               Rachel gives him a look, and... gives the reins a flick  
               the race is on.

               RACE MONTAGE

               Hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together 
               with his young sister  at first they're not aware of the 
               race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and 
               gives his horse a couple of whoops. The buggies are neck and 
               neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly.

               It's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off 
               Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she 
               gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers 
               of Samuel and Book.

               everywhere  taking shots of anything Amish. There's a ROWDY 
               YOUNG ELEMENT amongst them who are making their presence 
               fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.

               Book and Rachel get out of the buggy. Samuel stays inside; 
               the crowds make him nervous. A huge tourist bus billowing 
               smoke pulls up nearby.

               Rachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's 
               stopped by a TOURIST LADY with an instamatic camera... She 
               waggles the camera at him...

                                     TOURIST LADY
                         Could I... ah, you know?

                                     BOOK
                              (smiling)
                         Lady, if you take my picture, I'll 
                         rip your brassiere off and strangle 
                         you with it.

               The Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her 
               grin frozen on her face. Then she begins to scuttle back 
               from whence she came.

               INT. STORE

               Rachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company 
               of a young Amish woman, Ellie Beiler. Rachel is carrying 
               Ellie's tiny baby, and the infant is getting as much attention 
               as the shopping.

               Book is standing at a wall pay phone in the b.g. We TIGHTEN 
               to him, and...

                                     BOOK
                         Lieutenant Elton Carter, please.

               A beat, then we hear the FILTERED VOICE of the Philadelphia 
               Police Department switchboard:

                                     VOICE
                         Are you a member of the family?

                                     BOOK
                         What? I'm a friend of his.

                                     VOICE
                         I'm sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter 
                         was killed in the line of duty...

               Book hangs up. His breathing is thrown out by the shock of 
               the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain 
               control. He hesitates, unsure of his next move. He makes to 
               move away, then he turns back, finds more coins and dials a 
               second number.

               INT. HALLWAY, SCHAEFFER'S HOME  DAY

               Schaeffer's wife answers the phone; she is momentarily 
               shocked.

               She calls for her husband, then makes polite conversation.

                                     MRS. SCHAEFFER
                         How are you, John?

               Paul Schaeffer appears, slightly irritated at being called 
               away from the Saturday afternoon game.

                                     MRS. SCHAEFFER
                              (covering mouthpiece)
                         John Book!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         I'll take it in the study.

               INT. STUDY / STORE  DAY

               Schaeffer takes the phone.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You can hang up, dear.

               We HEAR the click of the other phone,

                                     BOOK
                         You made a mistake, Paul. You 
                         shouldn't have taken Elton out.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (beat)
                         How bad did Mac get you? We figured 
                         pretty bad.

                                     BOOK
                         I'm fine. I'm going to live a long 
                         time. That's what I called to tell 
                         you.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (quickly)
                         Johnny 

                                     BOOK
                         You might want to pass it along to 
                         Mac.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (urgently)
                         Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're 
                         out there all alone... We're getting 
                         close... real close... Maybe if you 
                         listen to me for a minute we can 
                         work something out so you can come 
                         in 

                                     BOOK
                         I've already got something worked 
                         out.
                              (and)
                         Be seeing you.

               Book hangs up the phone and the dead CLICK registers on 
               Schaeffer.

               Book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second 
               to unclench his fist. Then it takes something else to resist 
               his first impulse, which is to smash out at something... 
               Training. Get it under control. Deal rationally with the 
               situation.

               He straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat/tears from his 
               eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the Saltzburg General 
               Store.

               INT. BUGGY  MAIN STREET  SALTZBURG  DAY

               Book, as Rachel eyes him. She has noticed his changed mood, 
               but doesn't ask about it. He stares straight ahead, oblivious 
               to the surroundings of the street, now crawling with tourists 
               and traffic.

               EXT. NARROW SIDE STREET  SALTZBURG  DAY

               The buggy turns into the side street. Some hundred yards 
               ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road  
               several youths gathered about it. A pickup truck is stopped, 
               facing the buggy.

               INT. LAPP BUGGY  DAY

               As Rachel approaches the scene, slowing down and finally 
               stopping.

               Rachel is at first puzzled, then makes a small face, looks 
               at Book.

               Rachel puts a restraining hand on Book's arm.

                                     RACHEL
                         Do nothing. This happens from time 
                         to time.

               She senses him about to get out, grips his arm tightly.

                                     RACHEL
                         It's not our way, John. We'll have 
                         nothing to do with violence! John!

               Book shakes free, gets out and slowly walks toward the...

               EXT. HOCHSTETLER'S BUGGY  DAY

               Hochstetler and his family sit, impassive, ignoring various 
               jeers and taunts from the English lads  various jokes about 
               them being dirty etc. One jabs an ice cream cone into 
               Hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle 
               on his forehead. Another fools about with the horse causing 
               it to shy. A third notices the slow, sure, approach of John 
               Book.

                                     YOUTH
                         Here comes another one!

               Book stops, his path blocked by the third youth. The youth 
               flicks off Book's hat.

                                     BOOK
                              (quietly)
                         You're making a mistake.

               Hochstetler calls from his buggy.

                                     HOCHSTETLER
                         Everything is all right, John.

                                     BOOK
                              (to the youth)
                         Pick up the hat.

               The youth momentarily unsure  something about Book's tone 
               of voice. The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps 
               on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head. A 
               pause, then Book explodes.

               The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he 
               hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth 
               grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into 
               him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. 
               He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting. 
               Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd 
               is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book 
               shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a 
               kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction 
               of the Lapp farm.

               The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back 
               to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD 
               LOCAL addresses Rachel.

                                     LOCAL MAN

                         them.

                                     RACHEL
                         John, lost control of himself. He... 
                         will be repentant.

                              (to Rachel)
                         You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?

                                     RACHEL
                         Yes. Samuel! We're going.

               A second man calls from the pickup.

                                     SECOND MAN
                         Kid's nose is broken!

                                     LOCAL MAN
                         We'll take him up the hospital. Good-
                         day to you, Mrs. Lapp.
                              (he shouts after her)
                         This ain't good for the tourist trade, 
                         you know! You tell that to your Ohio 
                         cousin!

               But Rachel is already steering past the scene and following 
               the by now distant figure of John Book.

               EXT. BARN / CARPENTER'S SHOP  DUSK

               Book comes out of the carpenter's shop carrying the repaired 
               birdhouse on its pole in one hand, a shovel in the other.

               Rachel is shepherding the milking cows toward the barn.

                                     RACHEL
                         You should not bother with that 
                         birdhouse.
                              (a beat)

                         gun.

               She nods, looks away... looks back at him twice in glances. 
               There is a moment when it appears she might either bark at 
               him or begin to weep. He waits. When she does turn to him, 
               she speaks softly:

                                     RACHEL
                         There was a time when I thought you 
                         might have stayed.

                         There was.

                                     BOOK
                         No.
                              (and)
                         I was being unrealistic. Even thinking 
                         about living this life.

                         such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot 
                         see! You'd rather go back to that 
                         city! To nothing! No woman! No 
                         children! No land!

                              (now getting annoyed)
                         Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman 
                         and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's 
                         what I know and that's what I do!

                                     RACHEL
                         What you do is take vengeance! Which 
                         is a sin against heaven!

                                     BOOK
                         That's your way, not mine.

                                     RACHEL
                         That's God's way!

                                     BOOK
                         Well in the City of Philadelphia, 
                         God needs a little help!

               He has offended her, immediately knows it, but can't bring 
               himself to make an instant apology. But he's chewing on it 
               when she takes the moment unto herself. She pulls herself 
               up, speaks with great dignity:

                                     RACHEL
                         I could never love a man who was 
                         so... little.

               He looks at her, sad-eyed, his anger ebbing and gone, 
               realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman... never even 
               get close to such a one. He appears to start to speak, but 
               then does not.

               She turns, moves away a few steps, stops, looks back at him. 
               she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with 
               some difficulty, emotion welling in her words.

                                     RACHEL
                         The other night... when you saw me 
                         after my bath... I... I tried to 
                         look as I thought you would want a 
                         woman to look.
                              (sadly... but with a 
                              slight, proud lift 
                              of chin)
                         I am sorry... that I did not.

               She holds for an instant, then turns and walks off.

               Looking after her. A face full of loss.

               INT. KITCHEN  DUSK

               Eli is lighting the lamps. Samuel reads a book at the kitchen 
               table. Rachel moves slowly to the sink and begins washing a 
               few dishes. She looks out the window.

               CLOSE on her face, a strange expression.

               INT. / EXT RACHEL'S POV  DUSK

               The distant figure of Book working on the birdhouse.

               INT. KITCHEN

               CLOSE on Rachel's hands, lifting items slowly up and of the 
               water to the draining board, where she places them carefully 
               down. She shakes the water off her hands.

               CLOSE on her face, still staring fixedly out the window. She 
               speaks without turning around.

                                     RACHEL
                         Eli, would you see Samuel to bed?

               The old man glances at her; this is not their routine.

               EXT. DRIVEWAY  DUSK

               In the rapidly fading light, Rachel walks slowly toward Book.

               CLOSE on her face, staring straight ahead toward Book.

               ANGLE on Book, CLOSE. He turns and watches Rachel's approach.

               BIG WIDE ANGLE

               The light now nearly gone, the NIGHT SOUNDS beginning, as 
               Rachel reaches Book and they embrace.

               EXT. FIELD BY ROAD  NIGHT

               Book and Rachel in a passionate embrace, sink to the still 
               warm earth and make love.

               ESTABLISHING an all-night cafe in the early hours of the 
               morning.

               TIGHTENING to the bleakly lighted windows.

               INT. CARE

               A booth, where Schaeffer and McElroy and Fergie, a Lancaster 
               County Undersheriff and his SHERIFF  an expansive politician 
               type  are seated.

               The Undersheriff eyes Schaeffer narrowly. The Sheriff has a 
               county map spread out on the table, amid breakfast dishes, 
               pointing directions to Schaeffer:

                                     SHERIFF
                         There... White Oak Road a couple of 
                         miles before it ties into two-twenty-
                         two. Got it?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Got it. We owe you one, Sheriff.

                                     SHERIFF
                         My man Holmes here put it together. 
                         Fine officer, Chief. He spoke to the 
                         doctor at the hospital.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Undersheriff Holmes and I have talked 
                         on the phone.
                              (nods at Holmes)
                         Good work.

                                     UNDERSHERIFF
                         Sure you don't want us to post some 
                         backup units?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         If we need any help, we'll give you 
                         a shout. I'd like to slip in there 
                         quiet, then get out before we attract 
                         any attention.

               EXT. CAFE PORCH  DAY

               As Schaeffer and his men are climbing into their car. Holmes 
               and the Sheriff watch after them.

                                     HOLMES
                         Maybe I'll take a drive over that 
                         way.

                                     SHERIFF
                         Let 'em be. It's their dirty laundry.

               But Holmes pauses to watch Schaeffer's car pull out.

               EXT. RURAL LANE  LANCASTER COUNTY  DAWN

               With the first light of dawn on the eastern horizon, 
               Schaeffer's car approaches along the lane, pulls into the 
               Lapp driveway and comes to a halt.

               In the b.g. we can make out the farmhouse and outbuildings.

               HOLD as Schaeffer, McElroy and Fergie step out of the car. 
               They break out short-barreled twelve-gauge pumps, start TOWARD 
               CAMERA, spreading out as they turn up the long driveway... 
               figures of ominous intent striding through the misty dawn.

               ANGLE

               GOING WITH the trio of gunmen... McElroy, breath smoking in 
               the chill, eyes the terrain:

                                     MCELROY
                         Weird, man. No fuckin' electricity. 
                         What do you figure they plug all 
                         their shit into?

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         They don't have any shit.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Where Eli is getting into a heavy coat, preparing to go out... 
               the remains of the hearty morning breakfast are on the table. 
               Rachel is beginning the dishes.

               INT. BARN  DAWN

               Book and Samuel are starting the morning milking...

               INT. KITCHEN  DAWN

               Eli is preparing to extinguish the lamp when suddenly the 
               kitchen door is kicked open and McElroy and Fergie weapons 
               leveled, burst in. Eli reacts with angry shock as Schaeffer 
               enters: Rachel is, for a moment, terrified.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Fergie)
                         Outside 
                              (to Mac)
                         Check out the rest of the house.

               He turns to Eli, who is standing in the middle of the room.

               Schaeffer flashes his badge:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         We're police officers. We're looking 
                         for a fugitive, John Book. He's living 
                         here?

                                     ELI
                         I have nothing to say to you. Get 
                         out of my house!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You speak English. Good. Now listen 
                         

                                     RACHEL
                              (recovering)
                         No, you listen. Get out!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Lady, I'm here to help you. This man 
                         is very dangerous. An armed criminal.
                              (ingratiating)
                         He's got a gun, hasn't he?

                                     RACHEL
                         You have no right here!

               McElroy re-enters.

                                     MCELROY
                         He's not in this building.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to Eli)
                         All right, where is he?

               Suddenly Eli SHOUTS: It's deafening. Probably the loudest 
               noise Eli has ever made:

                                     ELI
                         John Book!

               McElroy whips around, smashes Eli on the temple with the 
               butt of his shotgun. Eli crumples to the floor. Rachel 
               SCREAMS, runs to Eli.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book and Samuel in the milkhouse. They've heard Eli's outcry. 
               Book moves to the window, looks out.

               BOOK'S POV  FERGIE

               About halfway between the barn and the house. He turns from 
               glancing back toward the house (having heard Eli's shout) 
               and starts again toward the barn. Gun at the ready.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               As Book REACTS.

               INT. KITCHEN  DAY

               Rachel kneeling next to Eli, wiping at his bruise with a 
               damp cloth. Schaeffer looks on.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         He'll live.

                                     RACHEL
                         You might have killed him!

                                     SCHAEFFER
                              (to McElroy)
                         Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll 
                         watch these two.

               McElroy nods, moves outside, turns toward the barns.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book still at the window, Samuel now beside him, trying to 
               get a look.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Is it them?

                              (turning, mind racing)
                         It's them, Sam.
                              (he bends to the boy, 
                              takes him by the 
                              shoulders)
                         Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to 
                         me carefully. Listen to me as you 
                         never listened before.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (interrupting)
                         Are they going to kill you?

                                     BOOK
                         Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go 
                         across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. 
                         Run as fast as you can. And stay 
                         there!

                                     SAMUEL
                         What are you going to do?

                                     BOOK
                         I'll be all right. You just do as I 
                         say.

               He takes Samuel by the hand, leads him to the side door. He 
               bends, holds the boy close.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Don't let them hurt you.

                                     BOOK
                              (rising, pushing Samuel 
                              toward door)
                         I won't. Now run.
                              (as Sam looks back)
                         Fast as you can!

               Sam turns, takes off.

               EXT. REAR DOOR  DAY

               Samuel running.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie almost to the upper barn, McElroy  well back and 
               moving slowly, circumspectly  headed toward the lower barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book, at another window in the lower barn, sees McElroy 
               heading for the milkhouse door. He can't see Fergie. He turns, 
               crosses the cowpen area, climbs an inner ladder leading to 
               the upper barn.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               Fergie at the door to the upper barn, moving very cautiously, 
               gun up. He eases around the doorpost, looks within.

               Beyond Book, now at the top of the ladder, we see Fergie 
               easing into the barn. Book pulls himself up, crawls behind 
               the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside 
               Luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm 
               him. He gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes Luke's 
               nose. The mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes 
               widen, but he makes no untoward sound. Book closes the gate.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               He comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting.

               DOLLYING WITH him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens 
               the gate. An edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously. 
               Fergie backs off, moves on.

               BOOK

               As he listens, tenses, hearing Fergie's feet in the fresh 
               straw.

               Book eases back alongside Luke, waits.

               BACK TO FERGIE

               As he approaches Luke's stall, reaches for the gate-latch.

               BOOK  FLASH CUT

               As the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack 
               on the back. The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy 
               explode in an horrendous SCREAM.

               FERGIE

               Bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies 
               open, involuntarily FIRING, suddenly finding himself under 
               the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast. Staggering 
               backwards, he SCREAMS, FIRES again, the load striking the 
               mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into 
               Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half 
               like a matchstick.

               BOOK

               As he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the 
               barn.

               FERGIE

               Fallen, skull smashed... and now the dying Luke's legs buckle 
               and he collapses atop Fergie.

               McElroy standing still, shock-eyed, looking toward the sound 
               of the shots. Then starting slowly forward.

               On the porch of the house, looking toward the barn.

               EXT. FIELD  DAY

               Some distance from the barn, Samuel's hearing the shots, 
               stops dead in his tracks... the sound of the shots still 
               REVERBERATING across the quiet fields.

                                     SAMUEL
                              (stricken)
                         Mr. Book?

               He hesitates, then turns, starts trotting back toward the 
               barns.

               EXT. / INT. KITCHEN PORCH  DAY

               Rachel has moved into the open kitchen door, glances anxiously 
               toward the barns. Starts out. Schaeffer pushes her back.

               As McElroy, checking the safety on his twelve-gauge, steps 
               into the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy flattens himself against the wall, looks around 
               fearfully.

                         What the hell happened?

               He listens, hears nothing, snorts, starts toward the barn 
               checking his gun, not hurrying.

               Samuel running as fast as he can trips as he crosses a small 
               muddy stream, falls full length, scrambles up, runs on.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy, moving very cautiously, comes around the mule stalls, 
               stops short, stares off screen.

               HIS POV  FERGIE

               Where he lies half buried beneath the huge bulk of the mule, 
               his head crushed like an eggshell.

               BACK TO MCELROY

               As he moves on around Fergie and the dead mule, planting 
               each foot as if he were walking in a mine field.

               BOOK

               Standing in shadow at the back of the barn next to a hay 
               mow.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Moving toward the center of the barn.

               BOOK

               As he starts to move even further back, he nudges into a 
               rope fastened to the wall behind him, He looks at it, looks 
               up.

               HIS POV  THE ROPE

               It runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to 
               the center roofbeam of the barn to a trolley fixed to a track 
               that runs the length of the roofbeam. Attached to this trolley 
               is a big hayfork (Paul Krantz has one), U-shaped, sharply-
               pointed at each end of the U. the points hanging toward the 
               floor. The thing weighs about eighty pounds, and is suspended 
               in place by the rope anchored at the wall next to Book.

               BACK TO BOOK

               Keeping one eye on McElroy, he carefully begins to un-tie 
               the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               Moving out toward the center of the barn, almost under the 
               suspended hay fork. He stops short, listens. Then, either 
               spotting a moving shadow or hearing a SOUND, he FIRES. His 
               shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader. He SHOUTS:

                                     MCELROY
                         Book, you sneaky bastard, I know 
                         you're here! Come out and fight!

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel, at the top of the barnyard, stops at the SOUND OF 
               THE SHOT, wide-eyed. He listens for an-instant, starts a 
               step toward the barn, then stops again, looks to a large 
               bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings. He 
               moves quickly to the bell, seizes the rope, pulls. The bell 
               CLANGS loudly, Sonorously.

               SCHAEFFER

               On the front porch, looking around for the location of the 
               sounding bell. He takes a step toward the barn, the stops, 
               looks back toward the house... frustrated.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Book watches as McElroy starts to move again looking back 
               toward the SOUNDING of the bell.

               HIGH ANGLE  HAY FORK

               Looking down we can see McElroy almost directly beneath the 
               hay fork. The bell SOUNDING throughout. BOOK Waiting... trip 
               rope in hand. Then:

                                     BOOK
                              (shouting)
                         Hey, Mac!

               And he lets go the trip rope.

               MCELROY

               As he turns toward the SOUND of Book's voice.

               HAY FORK

               As it plummets down, causing a RATCHETING SOUND that fills 
               the barn, even drowns out the SOUND of the bell.

               MCELROY

               Eyes darting wildly, looking up.

               HIS POV  HAY FORK

               Plunging straight for him.

               MCELROY

               Diving to one side.

               ANGLE  HAY FORK

               THUDDING into the barn floor like a great trident fork.

               Quivering there, not a foot from McElroy's head.

               MCELROY

               Staring at the fork pop-eyed.

               BOOK

               Sprinting toward a ladder thrust up through an opening in 
               the barn floor just in front of his parked car.

               MCELROY

               Spotting Book, coming up to one knee, quick-aiming, FIRING. 
               The shot smashes the windshield of the car.

               BOOK

               Diving, rolling, slamming into the top of the ladder, flailing 
               down out of sight.

               MCELROY

               FIRING AGAIN, then again. Emptying the gun, cursing as he 
               begins to reload, gets to his feet, starts toward the ladder. 
               The BELL still SOUNDING outside. The hood of the car SLOWLY 
               POPS UP.

               ANGLE

               As McElroy wheels at the movement of the car's hood, FIRES 
               twice.

               MCELROY'S POV  LAPP BUGGY

               The buckshot virtually blows the dashboard off.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               Samuel RINGING the bell. The bell rope is short, and so is 
               Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of 
               the rockerarm.

               He hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of 
               his head, his face set against the tears that move down his 
               cheeks.

               SCHAEFFER

               Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward 
               the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward 
               the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are. 
               He still can't see Samuel.

               HIS POV  THE PORCH

               As Rachel starts off the porch, takes a few steps.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, SHOUTING:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         You stay put!

               RACHEL

               She stops. She is also unable to see Samuel.

               SCHAEFFER

               Moving out toward the barn, rounding a corner... and there 
               is Samuel at the bellrope. He starts toward him.

               EXT. FIELDS  DAY

               Beyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm, 
               Stotlzfus and others  including Hochstetler and his brothers 
                are baling the first cutting of June hay.

               But the operation has come to a halt. All are looking in 
               toward the Lapp farm, hearing the RINGING OF THE BELL (the 
               Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating.

               But now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward 
               Samuel.

               EXT. BARNYARD  DAY

               As Schaeffer reaches Samuel, SHOUTS:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Cut that out!

               Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling.

               Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of 
               the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs 
               on grimly.

               Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves 
               him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun 
               blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several 
               threads, so he FIRES again.

               The rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to 
               look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when 
               Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy 
               kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness 
               right then and there.

               But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He 
               SNARLS at Sam:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get down to the house and stay there!

               Samuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off.

               RACHEL

               Already halfway out to the barn, running to gather Sam in 
               her arms... then to lead him back toward the house.

               SCHAEFFER

               Turning, starting very slowly toward the barn.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               McElroy at the top of the ladder, looking down. Then easing 
               over, placing his feet on the rungs.

               BOOK

               He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The 
               cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks 
               at him with its horns. Book waits, watches.

               HIS POV  MCELROY

               Visible to his knees as he eases down the ladder. He stops 
               at every rung to scrape his shoes free of the cowshit covering 
               the rungs.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He turns now to a door at the back of the pen. He un-hooks 
               it, pulls it open, moves inside.

               ANOTHER ANGLE  BOOK

               He is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to 
               a nearly-empty silo. Above the entrance, a ladder (interior) 
               rises to the top of the structure.

               Book looks in, and up. We should get the impression that 
               Book's been here before, expects what he sees.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch.

               BACK TO BOOK

               He steps through to the base of the ladder, then ducks beyond 
               it into the silo. There is about two feet of old silage 
               covering the floor. He turns, looks up the white walls.

               HIS POV  INSIDE SILO

               An inside ladder runs to the top.

               HIS POV  KICKBOARD

               Standing against the wall next to the entrance... . obviously 
               to be inserted as the silo is filled.

               BOOK

               Now, quickly, he ducks back out through the entrance, crosses 
               to the door to the cowpen, very cautiously peers out..

               WHAT HE SEES

               McElroy at the bottom of the ladder, looking in the other 
               direction (toward the milkhouse).

               BACK TO BOOK

               Very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward 
               into the cowpen). It begins to swing very slowly open. Book 
               immediately turns, darts back into the silo.

               MCELROY

               Turning slowly toward the cowpen... then FIRES twice as his 
               eye catches the motion of the swinging door. His shots blow 
               half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall. 
               McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Old Eli, at the sight of Samuel, rises from the table.

                                     ELI
                         Praise Gott!

               Rachel stands aside as the old man embraces Samuel long and 
               hard.

               She watches as he turns to the cupboard, takes down the big 
               family Bible. He crosses to the table, sets the book down, 
               places his hand on its pulls Samuel to the table beside him.

               Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man 
               helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun, 
               takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of 
               the coffee jar. She drops several as she tries to figure out 
               how to open the chamber to load it.

               In the b.g., Eli glances up, sees what she is about... he 
               rises and crosses to her. Samuel watches from the table.

                                     ELI
                              (fiercely)
                         No, Rachel...

                                     RACHEL
                         I have to help him!

               Rachel somehow manages to open the chamber and begins to try 
               to load the bullets. Eli's callused hand closes over hers, 
               halting the action:

                                     ELI
                         It is not our way!

               Bullets are already CLATTERING to the floor from her trembling 
               fingers as she raises her eyes to Eli's.

               A long beat as Rachel looks at him... Finally her fingers 
               release the pistol and it CLATTERS to the floor. She closes 
               her eyes.

               Samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches Eli 
               and Rachel silently.

               Eli leads her to the table, places her hands on the Bible 
               beneath his. They stand there and they pray.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book finishes putting the kickboard into the entrance.

               MCELROY

               Moving among the cows, stepping cautiously between the 
               cowflops.

               The goat nudges him once, then butts him rather firmly. 
               McElroy swats at him with the gun butt, moves to the door. 
               As he arrives, he HEARS a noise  very slight  from the 
               direction of the silo.

               He enters the passage way, looks in toward the silo entrance, 
               He hesitates. Another slight noise. He steps in to the base 
               of the inner ladder, looks up.

               HIS POV  THE HATCH

               The patch of blue sky, forty feet up.

               BACK TO MCELROY

               He frowns, reaches out, grabs a rung.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Schaeffer, easing toward the mule stalls, MUTTERS, CURSES 
               under his breath. Then he rounds the corner of the first 
               stall... and there is Fergie with Luke the mule on top of 
               him. Schaeffer stares, blinks... moves on spotting a spent 
               shotgun shell near the hayfork...

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book listening at the kickboard. SOUNDS of feet, shotgun 
               rattling against metal rungs, Book moves to the ladder on 
               his side, starts silently up.

               MCELROY

               Climbing with difficulty, shotgun clutched in one hand.

               BOOK

               He climbs up to the second kickboard, pauses, checks the 
               distance to the floor, starts upward again.

               BARN YARD  DAY

               The Amish beginning to arrive. Sam comes running, pulls 
               Stoltzfus toward the door of the milkhouse as the other Amish 
               look at the shot-shattered bellrope. Rachel and Eli come 
               rapidly up the path toward the group.

               INT. BARN  DAY

               Schaeffer finds another spent shotgun shell, crosses to the 
               ladder, looks down. He sets his shotgun down, takes out his 
               service revolver, starts down.

               INT. SILO  DAY

               Book has reaches the third kickboard, about thirty feet from 
               the ground. He checks it, turns the thumb-screws that hold 
               it in place, places his hand on the handle, moves to one 
               side as best he can... hangs there, listening.

               MCELROY

               Rattling up the other ladder, approaching the third kickboard.

               BOOK

               Listening tensely, hearing McElroy arrive on the other side 
               of the kickboard. Then, deliberately, Book makes a fist, 
               raps on the board smartly once.

               MCELROY

               Startled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the 
               back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts 
               the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety.

               BOOK

               We HEAR with him the thump of the muzzle, the CLICK... and, 
               with marvelous speed, Book pulls the kickboard and drops it 
               to the floor.

               McELROY  FLASH CUT Staring in, stun-eyed, already falling 
               forward (having leaned his weight on the shotgun) as Book 
               seizes the shotgun by the barrel, pulls inward.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As McElroy pitches forward through the opening, SCREAMS and 
               GRABS as he plunges past Book. The shotgun FIRES as McElroy 
               manages to hold onto Book, and both men plunge thirty feet 
               to the bottom of the silo.

               BOOK

               He falls almost straight down, lands on his back, lies 
               stunned.

               MCELROY

               His forward motion has carried him across the silo. His head 
               bounds off the white brick wall about five feet up... and he 
               falls in a heap, blood gushing from his head, as...

               TIGHT ON BOOK

               Blinking, groaning, just beginning to stir... and, suddenly, 
               into the frame comes a hand with a pistol in it. The muzzle 
               is placed firmly against Book's temple.

               WIDER

               Schaeffer holding the pistol. He cocks the pistol, tenses as 
               if to FIRE (and he is actually about to)... when there is a 
               SOUND behind him. He snaps around.

               WHAT HE SEES

               Old Stoltzfus and Samuel standing in the kickboard opening 
               (Schaeffer having kicked the kickboard in when he heard the 
               shot from within the silo). They stand solemnly, looking on 
               as:

               SCHAEFFER

               He eases the hammer down on this pistol, speaks softly:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Okay, Johnny. On your feet.

               THE SCENE

               As Book struggles to his feet  Schaeffer holding the pistol 
               tight to Book's head. Book turns, sees Samuel and Stoltzfus, 
               blinks.

               Schaeffer shoves Book toward the opening. As Book moves toward 
               Samuel, he speaks quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's okay, Sam.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book and McElroy move out of the silo, down the passageway 
               toward the milkhouse, Stoltzfus and Sam (after a glance in 
               at the inert McElroy) follow and...

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               As first Stoltzfus and Samuel, then Book and Schaeffer emerge 
               into the barnyard. Schaeffer has the muzzle of his pistol 
               pressed firmly against Book's throat, just below his jaw.

               Schaeffer pulls up, frowning:

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Hold it.

               WHAT HE SEES

               The Amishmen gathered  the Stoltzfus family, the Hochstetler 
               brothers, et al. All staring hard at Schaeffer and Book.

               EXT. BARN / DRIVE  DAY

               From a high wide angle the final scene is played out. 
               Schaeffer and Book, now moving again slowly up the drive, 
               the Amish following along closely on both sides.

               CLOSE ON BOOK

               As Schaeffer prods Book forward, warily eyeing the Amish.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Get back, you people!
                              (prodding)
                         Keep moving, Johnny...

               Book takes a couple of steps further, then abruptly stops. 
               The Amish stand about close, staring, no one moving. Book 
               now slowly turns his head, looks at Schaeffer.

                                     BOOK
                         You're going to have to do it right 
                         here, Schaeffer.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Don't try me, Johnny!

               Eli steps forward, bloody cloth held to his head.

                                     ELI
                         So... will you kill us all, then?

               ANGLE

               As Schaeffer's eyes waver between Book and Eli, Book slowly 
               turns until he is facing Schaeffer... the gun now leveled  
               and almost pressing against  Book's chest. Book locks eyes 
               with Schaeffer.

               Quietly:

                                     BOOK
                         It's all over, Paul.

                                     SCHAEFFER
                         Move! Or you die right here!

               Book's right hand snakes out, grabs Schaeffer by the gunhand 
               wrist, twists viciously, Schaeffer SCREAMS in pain, the gun 
               falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force 
               of Book's grip.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As Book bends, picks up the pistol, releases Schaeffer, pushes 
               him away. Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who  partly 
               to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to 
               congratulate him on his surrender  wraps one brawny arm 
               around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving 
               nod... holds Schaeffer as:

               BOOK

               Turning, looking into the crowd, finding Rachel. Their gazes 
               meet, hold for a long MOMENT. In the eyes of both we read 
               resignation... whatever there was between them has been 
               terribly damaged. It is almost certainly over for them, too.

               EXT. BARN  DAY

               HIGH SHOT holding the moment.

               EXT. LAPP FARM  LATE AFTERNOON

               The door opens and Book steps out, looking somehow strange 
               in his working suit. He looks about him, sees Samuel down by 
               the pond.

               EXT. POND

               He eases down beside Samuel. They both stare into the pond.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Are you really ever coming back?

                                     BOOK
                         Got to, Sam. You and I are going to 
                         a courthouse together, put some people 
                         behind bars.

                                     SAMUEL
                         Have you got your gun on now?

                                     BOOK
                         Sure have, Sam.

               Sam grins. Book takes him in his arms, holds him.

               EXT. HOUSE  DAY

               Book opens the door of the car, turns to find Rachel standing 
               there with his Amish hat in hand.

                                     RACHEL
                         I want you to take this... to remember 
                         by.

                                     BOOK
                         Where's my baggy pants?

                                     RACHEL
                         Here. Whenever you want them.

               He wants to kiss her, but does not. Their eyes say it all. 
               Eli has a final word, SHOUTING from the porch.

                                     ELI
                         You be careful, John Book! Out among 
                         them English!

               Book gets quickly into the car.

               INT. /EXT. DRIVEWAY  LAPP FARM  DAY

               As Book drives, he sees an open buggy coming down the hill 
               toward the farm, He slows as he passes, It's Daniel 
               Hochstetler. A long beat, and as they pass, Hochstetler gives 
               Book an expansive tip of his hat.

               INT. BOOK'S CAR

               Book turns to look back at his rival, a doubt in his eyes. 

               FREEZE FRAME.

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END
