                         General atmosphere, typical of a busy 
                         newspaper office. Copy boys running 
                         about, shirtsleeved reporters and rewrite 
                         men pounding away on typewriters. Little 
                         wire baskets containing cylinders of 
                         copy whizzing back and forth, such as 
                         are used in some department stores, 
                         etc.
                                      
                         SOUND
                                     
                         (Morkrum machines,[1] typewriters, telephone 
                         bells and all other sounds relative 
                         to a newspaper office)
                                      
                         When shot has been fully established:

                         It takes in the battery of Morkrum machines 
                         clattering away; the crescent-shaped 
                         copy desk; the desk of the sporting 
                         editor, with a big cauliflower-eared 
                         pugilist and his manager standing by 
                         the side of the sporting editor, a hefty 
                         guy in his shirtsleeves, smoking a big 
                         cigar and wearing a green eye-shade; 
                         the desk of the society editor, a prissy 
                         old lady, who takes down a worn copy 
                         of the Blue Book as the camera passes 
                         her and starts looking up some data; 
                         and any other interesting or typical 
                         bits that can be thought out. At the 
                         far end of the room is the desk of Conroy, 
                         the City Editor.
                                      
                         Everything shows evidence of feverish 
                         activity and great haste.

                         guys - a lot of hard luck stories. You 
                         come back here and I'll give you an 
                         assignment. It will be a last interview

                         Schuyler story, will you?

                         a drawing room, you'd step on a sliding 
                         rug! Stew is the only man that's got 
                         brains enough to handle this. Scram!

                         screen, concealing a corner of the room.

                         On the other side of the screen. Stew 
                         Smith is holding something in his hand. 
                         His hat tilted back on his head, and 
                         he is regarding this plaything intently. 
                         Gallagher is sitting close to him, also 
                         gazing intently at the plaything. Gallagher 
                         is a girl, one of the sob sisters[2] 
                         on the newspaper, dressed in a trim 
                         but inexpensive little tailored suit.

                         On the object in his hand, one of those 
                         hand-puzzles where you have to land 
                         jumping beans in the holes.

                         Stew, your hands are shaking. You've 
                         been drinking again.

                         Here they come!
                                      
                         Conroy's shouts are heard in the background.

                         There's the third one. If I don't get 
                         the last one, there's a certain sob 
                         sister I know that's going to get a 
                         kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, 
                         almost had that.

                         Conroy, the City Editor at his desk, 
                         looking about with a scowl for Stew.

                         The Copy Boy races over to whisper something 
                         to Conroy.

                         The screen, concealing the washbasin 
                         corner.

                         A wrathy Conroy, his eyes centering 
                         suspiciously on something. With his 
                         eyes on the screen, Conroy reaches out 
                         and grasps a heavy telephone book on 
                         the corner of his desk. Still looking 
                         off, he heaves it forcefully.

                         Showing the screen. The telephone book 
                         crashes into it, overturning it and 
                         revealing Stew and Gallagher on the 
                         other side. They both look up, startled. 
                         The newsroom erupts in laughter.

                         Conroy at his desk. Stew saunters into 
                         the scene.

                         You're always picking on me. It took 
                         me three hours to get those little gadgets 
                         in those holes, and you screw it up 
                         in a minute. Hey, look!
                                      
                         He gives the hand-puzzle to Conroy, 
                         who is immediately captivated by the 
                         fascinating object in his hand.

                         Conroy puts it down with a disgusted

                         it be imposing too much upon you if 
                         I asked you to do a little work today? 
                         Just to sort of break the monotony?

                         It isn't a question of knowing what 
                         to do, it's knowing how to get in one 
                         that counts.

                         with that chorus dame.

                         His fingers are nipping out little chunks 
                         of a folded piece of paper, dropping 
                         the bits on the floor. This is indicative 
                         of a habit of the individual in question 
                         when undergoing nervous stress. He is 
                         very fidgety and apprehensive, as he 
                         glances around.

                         indicates suppressed nervousness and 
                         anger. She glares over in the direction 
                         of Michael. Then she turns and looks 
                         in another direction.

                         back!

                         completing the pacing of a few short 
                         steps in his best courtroom manner, 
                         his head bowed in an attitude of deepest 
                         thought. He is dressed in striped afternoon 
                         trousers and black coat. He turns to 
                         regard Mrs. Schuyler.

                         But I keep telling you how difficult 
                         it is, Mrs. Schuyler. The last time 
                         I asked her for those letters, she made 
                         very uncouth noises with her mouth.

                         CAMERA DRAWS BACK
                                     
                         To reveal a full shot of the room and 
                         group. They are in the magnificent drawing 
                         room of the Schuyler home, resembling 
                         the Union Depot and furnished with almost 
                         imperial splendor and magnificence. 
                         They very much resemble a jury in session. 
                         As they continue:

                         I don't know why you're making all this 
                         fuss. I only sent her six of them.
 
                                                              
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         (sarcastic)
                                     
                         If you had to make a fool of yourself, 
                         why didn't you tell it to her instead 
                         of writing?
                                      
                         MICHAEL
                                     
                         Because I couldn't get her on the phone.

                         You should have known better than to 
                         write, Romeo. I found that out a long 
                         time ago.

                         I should say you had. At the rate you 
                         two are going, we'll have to leave the 
                         country to save our faces.

                         Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to 
                         Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save 
                         a face.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         Oh, shut up!
                                     
                         A butler appears in the doorway. He 
                         is about to say something, but he stammers 
                         and turns.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         (stopping him)
                                     
                         What is it, Smythe?
                                     
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Pardon me, madam - but what am I to 
                         say to the newspapermen?
                                      
                         Mrs. Schuyler looks distractedly at 
                         Grayson.

                         Mrs. Schuyler and Grayson. She rises 
                         and speaks imperiously:
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         Dexter, go out and tell those ruffians 
                         I have nothing to say.
                                      
                         Grayson faces her placatingly.
                                     
                         GRAYSON
                                     
                         You can't do that. Leave it to me. I 
                         know how to handle reporters.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         (with a shudder)
                                     
                         All right, then - get it over with.

                         Grayson turns officiously toward the 
                         waiting butler.
                                      
                         GRAYSON
                                     
                         We've decided to see the reporters. 
                         Send in the man from the Tribune first.

                         Very good, sir.
                                     
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         Oh, Smythe, some bicarbonate of soda, 
                         quick - double strength. I know those 
                         news mongrels[3] will upset me.
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         I've anticipated it, madame. The bicarbonate 
                         is ready.
                                      
                         The butler exits.

                         This room resembles the Grand Central 
                         Station. It is lined with bookcases 
                         filled with gorgeous first editions 
                         and special bindings, and is furnished 
                         in the extreme of magnificence and luxury.
 
                                                              
                         Present are Stew and Bingy, reporter 
                         from the Tribune. Stew is seated, idly 
                         leafing through a first edition.
                                      
                         Bingy, still with his hat on, spots 
                         an expensive music box on a nearby table, 
                         opens it and does a little jig to the 
                         tune that is emitted.

                         Bingy, as he lingers at the table. He 
                         is a lazy, sloppy-looking guy. His face 
                         needs a shave and his pants need pressing. 
                         There is a spot of dried ketchup on 
                         his tie. On the table is a humidor. 
                         Bingy opens it and lifts out a handful 
                         of cigars.

                         As he looks up from the book, he suggests:

                         Hey Bingy, you'll find the silverware 
                         in the dining room.
                                      
                         CONTINUATION, SCENE 20
                                     
                         Bingy turns, putting the cigars in his 
                         pocket.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Much obliged.

                         Smythe enters.
                                     
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         (frigidly)
                                     
                         Mr. Grayson has decided to see you.

                         Both Stew and Bingy start forward eagerly. 
                         Smythe continues:

                         Bingy beams broadly and Stew is disappointed.

                         There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.

                         I understand, sir.
                                     
                         Smythe leads the way out. As Bingy passes 
                         by, Stew trips him.

                         my boy. No use you hanging around here. 
                         Just buy the Tribune tonight and read 
                         all about it. You can rewrite it for 
                         your last edition.

                         Couldn't make the last edition. It'd 
                         take me four hours to translate your 
                         story into English.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Oh, is that so?
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         I'm afraid.
                                     
                         Bingy turns to leave.
                                     
                         Take off your hat. You might make an 
                         impression.
                                      
                         Bingy dutifully doffs his hat.
                                     
                         Impossible. Put it on again.
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Hey, make up your mind, will you?
                                     
                         Bingy hurriedly puts his hat back on 
                         as he disappears.

                         By the door which leads out into the 
                         hall. The butler enters and stops, standing 
                         stiffly. Bingy enters behind him, shambling 
                         awkwardly. He stops in some consternation 
                         as he sees:

                         The Schuyler jury. Grayson, Mrs. Schuyler, 
                         Anne and Michael, all surveying him 
                         in varying degrees of unfriendliness.

                         Bingy hesitates uneasily as he regards 
                         this impressive assemblage. Quickly, 
                         he takes his hat back off. Then he smiles 
                         nervously and starts forward.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Hi, folks!

                         Grayson comes forward to meet him, attempting 
                         to be very cordial. Bingy is seized 
                         by a sudden impulse to sneeze. He does 
                         so, violently. There is awkward silence. 
                         Mrs. Schuyler throws off a visible shudder.
 
                                                              
                         BINGY
                                     
                         What's the matter? Isn't there a 'bless 
                         you' in the crowd?
                                      
                         GRAYSON
                                     
                         You're the Tribune man?
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Yeah, hello. How are you?
                                     
                         Bingy extends his hand. Grayson pointedly 
                         ignores it.
                                      
                         GRAYSON

                         BINGY
                                     
                         Thanks, I will.
                                     
                         Bingy crosses the room, taking note 
                         of the beauteous Anne.

                         BINGY

                         Bingy sits gingerly on the edge of a 
                         handsome chair.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Oh, boy!

                         Bingy and Grayson. Grayson picks up 
                         a very flossy and expensive cigarette 
                         box from the small end table beside 
                         the chair. It is made of gold and semi-precious 
                         stones are inset in the cover. Grayson 
                         opens the lid and takes out a cigarette, 
                         but pointedly does not offer one to 
                         Bingy.
                                      
                         Grayson remains standing before the 
                         reporter, who is very uncomfortable 
                         and ill at ease.

                         She clears her throat menacingly, as 
                         she looks sternly at Grayson.

                         Bingy and Grayson. Both look over. Grayson 
                         gives her a quick reassuring glance, 
                         as though to say "leave it to me now." 
                         He continues his conversation with the

                         Grayson and Bingy. Grayson takes an 
                         envelope out of his pocket and hands 
                         it to Bingy. Bingy opens the flap and 
                         sees the contents.

                         Bingy quickly shuts the envelope up. 
                         Grayson is watching him closely.

                         So, you see how silly that rumor is?

                         That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't 
                         think of it.
                                      
                         Grayson starts leading him toward the 
                         door. CAMERA PANS WITH THEM as Grayson 
                         leads him toward the door, talking as

                         They stop at the door. Bingy extends 
                         a handshake, which is again refused. 
                         He stops and looks back at the jury.

                         The Schuylers all sitting silently and 
                         contemplating him.

                         He flutters his eyes at Anne.

                         He takes one last look at Mrs. Schuyler 
                         and is again gripped by a violent sneeze.

                         The butler appears in the doorway behind 
                         him. Bingy exits past him, beaming.

                         The group awaiting the advent of the 
                         Post reporter. Stew is shown in by the 
                         butler, still carrying the Conrad book 
                         in his hand. They give him the once-over. 
                         Mrs. Schuyler raises her lorgnette with 
                         a magnificent gesture. Stew eyes them 
                         with animation, not in the slightest 
                         discouraged by this supercilious scrutiny. 
                         He starts toward them.

                         As Stew approaches them.

                         Schuyler's the name, I presume? Yes, 
                         thank you, thank you. My name's Smith 
                         - Stewart Smith. No relation to John, 
                         Joe, Trade or Mark. Of course you can't 
                         have everything.
                                      
                         He smiles engagingly on them. Stew addresses 
                         Mrs. Schuyler ingratiatingly, disregarding 
                         her expression of obvious distaste.

                         put out by all the rumors going around.

                         Dexter Grayson, you told me it was only 
                         ten thousandand you didn't even get 
                         those letters from that Jezebel!

                         Oh, so you did give her ten thousand 
                         dollars, eh? and there are letters .

                         Behind Stew's back, Grayson makes violent 
                         gestures for her to shut up.

                         as he handled Bingy, and lowers his

                         I have it here.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Good.
                                     
                         Grayson takes an envelope out of his 
                         pocket and hands it to Stew. Stew puts 
                         the book under his arm, takes the envelope 
                         and extracts the contents. It is another 
                         greenback.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (with interest)
                                     
                         Fifty bucks, eh?
                                     
                         He regards it a moment, then replaces 
                         the bill in the envelope. His voice 
                         is matter-of-fact, and almost casual.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Don't you know you should never offer 
                         a newspaper man more than two dollars? 
                         If you do, he'll think it's counterfeit. 
                         I don't need fifty dollars. As a matter 
                         of fact, I've got fifty dollars.
                                      
                         Grayson is considerably disconcerted. 
                         He tries again.
                                      
                         GRAYSON
                                     
                         The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly 
                         satisfied.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never 
                         saw fifty dollars before. You could 
                         have bought him for six bits. Funny 
                         thing about Bingy. The more he gets 
                         - the more he prints. He looks stupid, 
                         doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets 
                         when he bends over a typewriter.
                                      
                         He hands the envelope back to Grayson 
                         and turns away.

                         Schuyler group - taking his action with 
                         dismay. Stew starts walking back toward 
                         them, talking as he walks, Grayson beside 
                         him, considerably distracted.

                         So ten grand was the amount you gave 
                         the girl? Any other statement you folks 
                         would like to make?
                                      
                         There is an explosive chorus from the 
                         group.

                         That's not so!
                                     
                         We have nothing more to say!
                                     
                         We'll make no statements.
                                     
                         He turns to them, holding up his hand 
                         and speaking plaintively.

                         Wait a minute. Don't get excited. I 
                         wouldn't worry about it. A little publicity 
                         never hurt anybody.

                         She is on the point of an apopletic 
                         stroke. She advances menacingly toward 
                         Stew. She calls to Grayson.

                         Mrs. Schuyler, Michael, and Grayson. 
                         All watching the couple intently, hanging 
                         on the next wordswondering if Anne 
                         is going to succeed. They are tense 
                         and expectant.

                         He is looking down into her soft, melting 
                         eyes. Then he smiles.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         You know something, lady, if you sold 
                         life insurance, I'd go for a policy 
                         in sixty seconds.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.

                         The three. They relax and exchange relieved 
                         and triumphant glances. Apparently Anne 
                         has won.

                         Stew turns aside.

                         ANNE

                         Certainly. Right over there.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         You're all right.
                                     
                         She indicates. Stew starts for the telephone. 
                         Anne walks to her mother's side. Stew 
                         gets to the telephone and picks up the 
                         receiver.
                                      
                         STEW

                         (he turns to wink at the group)
                                     
                         That's an unlucky number. You know that, 
                         don't you?
                                      
                         45. CLOSE SHOT - STEW
                                     
                         At the telephone. He turns back to the 
                         instrument as he gets his connection.

                         Hello, Toots? Is Conroy there? Give 
                         me Conroy.
                                      
                         (pause)
                                     
                         He isn't? Try the washroom, will you?
 
                                                              
                         While he waits for the connection, he 
                         turns and addresses the group expansively.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Say, I interviewed a swell guy the other 
                         day - Einstein. Swell guy, a little 
                         eccentric, but swell. Doesn't wear any 
                         garters. Neither do I as a matter of 
                         fact. What good are garters anyway?
 
                                                              
                         (he turns back to the phone)
                                     
                         Hello, Conroy? This is Smith talking. 
                         I'm up at the Schuylers. No, I'm not 
                         having tea - that is, not yet.
                                      
                         (again, he winks expansively at the 
                         groupthen returns to Conroy)
                                      
                         Is she beautiful? Oh boss, her pictures 
                         don't do her justice. If I was that 
                         guy Ziegfield - what?
                                      
                         ? 19 ?

                         Anne smiles in spite of herself at this 
                         flattery. Stew's voice goes on.
                                      
                         STEW'S VOICE
                                     
                         Yes, it's easy to see where her beauty 
                         comes from. From her mother.
                                      
                         For the first time, Mrs. Schuyler unbends 
                         to the extent of giving forth a smile. 
                         She cannot help but be pleased at this 
                         compliment. The atmosphere is now very 
                         friendly. Everybody feels that everything 
                         is all right.

                         Stew at the phone
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Now wait a minute. Just hold on. Keep 
                         your shirt on. I'm coming to that. The 
                         Schuylers admit the story is true. Right. 
                         They gave the gal ten thousand bucks. 
                         But she's got some letters - and she's 
                         holding out for more dough - and it 
                         looks to me like she's going to get 
                         it.

                         Horrified and shocked at this betrayal 
                         and double-crossing.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (on the phonebreezily)
                                     
                         Right boss. I'll be right over. Right 
                         - no, I don't think I can get any pictures 
                         now. Right.
                                      
                         He casually hangs up and turns from 
                         the phone.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER

                         Anne confronts him as if he were a reptile 
                         of the lowest order.
                                      
                         ANNE

                         I've met some rotters in my time, but 
                         without a doubt, you're the lowest excuse 
                         for a man I've ever had the misfortune 
                         to meet
                                      
                         Stew starts walking toward the door, 
                         still holding his book. The family is 
                         tremendously indignant and agitated.
 
                                                              
                         Stew stops, turns, looks at them. He 
                         is met by icy glares. He indignantly 
                         takes a nickel out of his pocket and 
                         hands it to Grayson.

                         Well, if you feel that way about it, 
                         here's a nickel for the phone call.
 
                                                              
                         He glares at themturns and walks out.
 
                                                              
                         They watch him walk out, stunned and 
                         open-mouthed.

                         48. MEDIUM FULL SHOT
                                     
                         A reasonably respectable speakeasy, 
                         smoke-filled. Quite a number of men 
                         and a few women are leaning on the bar 
                         and seated around at the tables. Stew 
                         and Gallagher are seated at one of the 
                         rude round tables, smoking, drinks before 
                         them. Gallagher is reading the newspaper 
                         story.
                                      
                         49. CLOSE SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER
 
                                                              
                         She is grinning at the story.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         and she walked up to me and put her 
                         hand on my shoulder and said,
                                      
                         (mimicking Anne)
                                     
                         'Mr. Smith, You wouldn't print that 
                         story, would you?' Oh no, I wouldn't 
                         print it - read it!

                         Over Stew's shoulder. She laughs at 
                         his attempted imitation.

                         You're sure going to be poison to that 
                         Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         I hope not . . . I've got to call on 
                         her this morning!
                                      
                         Gallagher looks up in astonishment.

                         You what?
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. 
                         Her wounds need soothing.
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely 
                         bats? What for? I thought the story 
                         was cold. You can't go back there.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. 
                         I'm sizzling - look! Psst!

                         He moistens a finger, touches it to 
                         his wrist, and makes a sizzle noise.
 
                                                              
                         Gallagher looks over quizzicallya little 
                         suspiciousa little jealous.

                         Over Gallagher's shoulder.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, 
                         you've got to meet her. She's it

                         and that
                                     
                         STEW

                         and those and them.
                                     
                         Gallagher takes a sip of her drink before 
                         answering.
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         Well, I've seen her pictures, and I 
                         don't think she's so hot.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (disparaging gesture)
                                     
                         Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures 
                         don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, 
                         she's queenly - she is queenly - and 
                         I know queens!
                                      
                         (continues in exaltation)
                                     
                         And oh, has she got herself a nose - 
                         and I know noses too. That little snozzle 
                         of hers is the berries, I tell you. 
                         And is she cute when she throws that 
                         little snozzle to the high heavens!

                         Of course I haven't got a nose.
                                     
                         Stew gives her a hurt look.
                                     
                         STEW

                         Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. 
                         You've got a nose. But there's different 
                         women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery 
                         horses and thoroughbreds.

                         On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. 
                         I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.

                         And the rest of us are truck horses?

                         (a trifle resentfully)
                                     
                         Well!

                         Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then 
                         don't turn female on me.
                                      
                         During these last few speeches, Gallagher 
                         has been regarding him with a curious 
                         expression. She loves being his pal, 
                         but wishes he would realize she is also 
                         a woman.

                         Stew seems a little resentful of her 
                         attitude. He rises.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Pay that check, will you Gallagher? 
                         I'll give it back to you some time. 
                         Maybe.
                                      
                         He flourishes the book of Conrad, which 
                         has been lying on the table in front 
                         of him, and makes a grand gesture.

                         I go now - I go with Conrad in quest 
                         of my youth! Fry those tomatoes, will 
                         you, Gallagher?
                                      
                         He strikes a poseand exits.
                                     
                         Gallagher, sits, looking after him, 
                         considerably disturbed.

                         Sitting, looking dismally after Stew.
 
                                                              
                         She opens her bag and takes out a mirror, 
                         surveying herself with frank disapproval. 
                         She pulls out a curl of hair before 
                         each ear, tries to soften the severe 
                         brim of the hat. She puts a finger to 
                         the tip of her nose and tilts it up, 
                         studying the effect. Then, with a sigh 
                         of disgust, she throws mirror and bag 
                         onto the table.

                         Smythe, the butler, previously introduced, 
                         comes from the direction of the rear 
                         of the house, and proceeds down the 
                         long, vast hallway towards the front 
                         door. The bell keeps ringing steadily.
 
                                                              
                         The butler reaches the wide front door.

                         As the butler opens the door and reveals 
                         Stew standing outside, hatless, a book 
                         in his hand, a spring overcoat slightly 
                         askew, the pockets bulging with contents. 
                         The butler quickly tries to slam the 
                         door in Stew's face, but Stew's right 
                         foot comes forward with a practiced 
                         newspaperman's gesture and he forces 
                         his way into the room.

                         it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't

                         Mrs. Schuyler is not at home.

                         I know, I know. I waited outside till 
                         she went out. She's a very nice lady, 
                         but we don't vibrate well together.

                         Anne, dressed in smart sports clothes, 
                         starts to cross thru the hall. She stops 
                         as she sees the butler engaged in conversation 
                         with Stew.

                         Anne starts walking toward them. Stew 
                         spots her.

                         Now Jeeves, what would you call this 
                         - 'no one'?
                                      
                         Anne comes up to them.
                                     
                         59. CLOSER THREE SHOT
                                     
                         Anne looks up and sees that the butler 
                         is frowning and uncomfortable and addresses 
                         him.

                         Mrs. Schuyler left orders, Miss, that 
                         if this person came here again, I was 
                         to call the police.

                         That's a good idea - telephone the police. 
                         The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple 
                         of cops over and we can have a rubber 
                         of bridge.

                         The butler bows stiffly and exits.

                         What do you want?

                         Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was 
                         here, I had one of your books in my 
                         hand, and when I got outside, I realized 
                         I still had your book in my hand. So 
                         as long as I had your book in my hand, 
                         I thought I might as well take it home 
                         and read it. This morning, I got up 
                         and put your book in my hand, and here's 
                         your book in your hand.
                                      
                         He extends the Conrad book, and Anne, 
                         making no effort to take it, he throws 
                         it on the table.

                         That's considerate of you.

                         Yeah, that was considerate of me. I 
                         recommend you read it.

                         But Bobo is your brother, Michael. And 
                         of course nobody would ever guess who 
                         Babykins is.
                                      
                         Anne turns and stares at him, incredulously, 
                         for a moment.

                         Where did you get those letters?

                         I stole them when I was interviewing 
                         Babykins about Bobo.
                                      
                         Anne looks up coldly.
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I suppose you're going to print them?

                         No - give you another guess.

                         The two.
                                     
                         Anne surveys him with frank scorn and 
                         dislike.

                         Oh, I don't need another guess. It's 
                         quite obvious.

                         So, it's obvious, huh?
                                     
                         She turns toward the library.

                         Will you step into the library?

                         Anne walks majestically with head held 
                         highthru the hallthru the living room 
                         and to the library. CAMERA TRUCKING 
                         AHEAD OF THEM. This is a very long walk 
                         with Anne walking ahead, Stew trailing.

                         You know, the Indians used to walk like 
                         this.

                         You know why that was? That was in case 
                         of attack from the front.

                         Of course, if the attack was from the 
                         rear, she had to depend upon her papoose.

                         Oh yes, the papooses always had bows 
                         and arrows.

                         Anne sweeps in, followed by Stew. She 
                         walks directly to a desk, opens a drawer 
                         and takes out a large check book. She 
                         draws up a chair and seats herself.

                         Anne has been listening to him with

                         I know but that was news. This is blackmail

                         Anne is regarding him with searching

                         great favor. I wish there was something 
                         I could do for you
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Well, you could make this table a little 
                         - uh - a little less wide.
                                      
                         (he leans over closer to her)
                                     
                         There is something you can do for me, 
                         Miss Schuyler.
                                      
                         The smile goes out of Anne's eyesthe 
                         suspicion returnsshe is saying to herself"I 
                         was right the first time!"
                                      
                         STEW

                         I haven't had any lunch yet. Have you 
                         got anything in the icebox?
                                      
                         The hard, disdainful look leaves Anne's 
                         face as she stares at this incredible 
                         guy with his incredible request. With 
                         a twinkle in her eyes, she responds:

                         A lovely, sunny room, cretonne drapes 
                         and colorful painted furniture. Stew 
                         and Anne are sitting at the table. Anne 
                         looks amused and

                         definitely speculative. Stew has the 
                         manner of having lived in this house 
                         all his life. He draws the cup of tea 
                         to him and puts in a lump or two of 
                         sugar.
                                      
                         Between him and Anne on the corner of 
                         the table is a modernistic, squatty 
                         little tea-pot.

                         After years of research, I finally discovered 
                         that I was the only guy in the world 
                         who hadn't written a play, so believe 
                         it or not, in my spare time I'm now 
                         writing a play.

                         Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot 
                         yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.

                         me. Only one thing wrong with me

                         Stew helps himself to another lump of 
                         sugar.

                         Naw, that's just a symbol of my independence.
 
                                                              
                         He leans closer, looking directly into 
                         her face.

                         I'm color blind. That's what's wrong 
                         - I'm color blind. I've been sitting 
                         here for a half hour looking at you 
                         and I don't know yet whether your eyes 
                         are blue or violet.
                                      
                         Anne smiles at this unexpected statement, 
                         and stares at him very critically.

                         I'm just beginning to believe that something 
                         could be done with you.

                         Now getting back to those eyes of yours 
                         - would you mind if I kind of got closer 
                         so I could see them?

                         enters and stops in the doorway, surveying

                         I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but 
                         I get it. It's all right.

                         Mrs. Schuyler freezes in inarticulate 
                         anger, as Stew gives a courtly bow and

                         There is the sound of a piano chord 
                         being struck.
                                      
                         81. MED. FULL SHOT
                                     
                         Mrs. Baxter, the hostess, is standing 
                         importantly by the grand piano at which 
                         is seated an anaemic-looking young man. 
                         Beside her stands a stout, swarthy Italian 
                         with bristling mustachios. Mrs. Baxter 
                         bows toward the swarthy one, who bends 
                         almost double in acknowledgement. There 
                         is a polite scattering of applause, 
                         and some of the guests seat themselves.
 
                                                              
                         Martini starts to sing.
                                     
                         Unnoticed by the rest, Stew and Anne 
                         slip out of the door into the roof garden.

                         A most beautiful, romantic spot. Rose 
                         trees in blossom, a vine-covered pergola, 
                         a splashing fountain, a few choice marble 
                         statues, low, deep chairs placed to 
                         make a gorgeous spot. Stew and Anne 
                         enter from the direction of the house. 
                         The garden is dark except for the lights 
                         from the interior of the house. From 
                         within, comes the voice of the singer 
                         rendering an extremely romantic, sentimental 
                         Italian love song. This will continue 
                         to the FADE OUT of the scene.
                                      
                         Stew and Anne walk, still hand in hand, 
                         toward the edge of the pergola where 
                         the shadows are deeper and where a couple 
                         of glorified steamer chairs are placed. 
                         There is a full moon overhead.
                                      
                         She leads him toward a waterfall effect, 
                         a glass partition down which water trickles. 
                         They go behind the dimly lit fountain 
                         and sit
                                      
                         ? 33 ?
                                     
                         in a low, deep divan. We see them in 
                         silhouette as they go into a passionate 
                         embrace. All we hear is the faint voice 
                         of Martiniand the uninterrupted splashing 
                         of the fountain.

                         On divan, arms around each other.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Anne, pinch me, will you? Throw me out 
                         of here. Give me the air. Throw me out 
                         of this joint, will you?
                                      
                         Anne smiles happily and pinches his 
                         nose.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, 
                         darling?

                         Throw me out - because I'm beginning 
                         to get goofy ideas, and they concern 
                         you, Anne.
                                      
                         ANNE

                         None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, 
                         if they concern me.

                         My name is Smith - well, that you seem 
                         to have been able to stand for the last 
                         month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. 
                         I've never been in jail - that is, not 
                         often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. 
                         I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like 
                         black coffee and I hate garters. I make 
                         seventy-five bucks a week and I've got 
                         eight hundred and forty-seven bucks 
                         in the bank - and - I don't know yet 
                         whether your eyes are blue or violet.

                         (although he is very close to her)
 
                                                              
                         That's because you're too far away, 
                         Stew.
                                      
                         Throughout his speech, Anne never takes 
                         her eyes off him. As he fumbles now, 
                         he turns. Their eyes meet. His overwhelming 
                         desire for Anne overcomes him.
                                      
                         He dismisses as futile his effort to 
                         be practical, sweeps her into his arms 
                         and kisses her passionately.

                         Featuring Stew at his desk, which is 
                         directly in front of the battery of 
                         Morkrums whose clatter comes into the

                         Stew finishes up a phone call. He sits 
                         at his desk, staring pensively at his 
                         typewriter. He is smoking a pipe and 
                         is in his shirt-sleeves. His hair is 
                         rumpled, and strewn over the desk is 
                         a bunch of crumpled up pieces of paper, 
                         indicating that he has made numerous 
                         unsuccessful starts at writing something. 
                         A fresh blank sheet of paper is now 
                         in the typewriter.
                                      
                         Nearby, at another desk, asleep in a 
                         swivel chair, with his feet elevated 
                         to the desk, the low snoring of another 
                         reporter blends with the sounds of the 
                         Morkrums and other noises of the City 
                         Room. At the reporter's elbow is a telephone.

                         Desk of Conroy, the City Editor. A small 
                         upright plate on his desk indicates 
                         his position. This is near the copy 
                         desk. Characteristic activities are 
                         background for any action that may take 
                         place. Reporters come up to throw their 
                         stories on Conroy's desk; the phone 
                         rings, etc.
                                      
                         A boy comes in with a large number of 
                         newspapers under his arm which he throws 
                         on Conroy's desk. There are several 
                         copies of each of the rival newspapers 
                         in town. Conroy spreads them out and 
                         begins to examine them.

                         It is evident that he is nervous and 
                         jumpy about something. Finally he starts 
                         to pound the typewriter.

                         of the papers. The phone rings. Without 
                         looking at it, Conroy answers:

                         He is looking down at the papers and 
                         suddenly his eyes focus on something 
                         which causes the cigar to drop from 
                         his mouth and an expression of mingled 
                         amazement and rage comes into his face. 
                         We do not see at this point what it 
                         is he has read, but we know it must 
                         be something sensational. Abruptly he 
                         hangs up the phone.

                         Stew, as he studies his typewriter. 
                         Over his CLOSEUP comes the excited outraged 
                         voice of Conroy.

                         A look of infinite weariness and disgust 
                         comes over Stew's face and he grits 
                         his teeth.

                         His general expression registers "Good 
                         god, there he goes again." With one 
                         finger he pounds out four letters:

                         He yanks the sheet out of the typewriter.

                         Stew gets up from his machine, crumples 
                         the sheet of paper into a wad and flings 
                         it at the sleeping reporter. The wad 
                         strikes him in the face; he wakes abruptly 
                         and automatically reaches for the phone. 
                         He picks up the receiver and in a voice 
                         fogged with sleep calls a number. Stew 
                         exits.

                         is one of bitter reproach as he leans 
                         back in his swivel chair as Stew approaches 
                         and stands by the desk.

                         the copy desk, and perhaps a sob sister 
                         or two nearby, who look up with expectant 
                         interest, expecting to hear Stew get 
                         a bawling out.

                         Stew turns away from Conroy's desk, 
                         and a group of his confreres come up, 
                         surrounding him in a series of ad-lib 
                         congratulations. (Some slightly profane, 
                         pounding him on the back, whooping, 
                         and in general manifesting great surprise 
                         and glee.) This group is increased by 
                         copy readers, office boys and everybody 
                         jabbering and shouting at him.
                                      
                         GROUP

                         Stew manages to break thru them and 
                         exits from scene.

                         Gallagherto intercut with above scene. 
                         She gets up and goes over, CAMERA PANNING 
                         WITH HER and picks up another copy of 
                         the paper and reads the headlines.

                         about Stew's marriage. Abruptly she 
                         turns away, out of scene.

                         At Gallagher's empty desk. Stew comes 
                         in trying to stave off the mob. He turns 
                         on the congratulators, pushing them 
                         off.

                         What's the matter with you mugs? Can't

                         walks back toward the door, the last 
                         of the wisecracks and goodnatured jeers 
                         being flung after him.

                         Gallagher is seated alone at a table, 
                         looking very forlorn. Her life is suddenly 
                         empty. A drink is in front of her, untouched. 
                         She is fighting hard to keep her emotions 
                         under control.
                                      
                         Stew enters the speakeasy and mingles 
                         with patrons, who offer congratulations. 
                         He comes to a stop by the table. She 
                         looks up, forcing a smile.

                         There you are. What did you run away 
                         for?

                         Stew draws out the other chair at the 
                         table and sits down.

                         He looks across at her, grinning boyishly, 
                         utterly unaware that what he has done 
                         has hurt her deeply.

                         She puts her hand tenderly on his.

                         Stew expands under the comradeship of 
                         Gallagher. He wants to talk.

                         come down alone.

                         Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're 
                         a married man now. Mother always warned 
                         me never to run around with married 
                         men.

                         Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're 
                         not going to leave me flat?
                                      
                         Gallagher tries to be elaborately casual.

                         Oh, I'll call you up some time. And 
                         if your social duties permit - why -

                         Cut that out. Just because I'm married 
                         - there's no reason for that.
                                      
                         Gallagher looks up and off, seeing something 
                         that startles her.

                         Stew looks around, also startled.

                         Stew buries his head in the newspaper, 
                         in pretense of looking for something. 
                         Conroy appears at the table and stops. 
                         He indicates Stew.

                         the newspaper - his lost freedom?
 
                                                              
                         Stew slowly sticks his head up over 
                         the top of the table, looking up.

                         Well, if it isn't old Fagin[9] himself.
 
                                                              
                         Conroy sits down at the table.

                         Gallagher, self-conscious, realizes 
                         this tough old buzzard is on to her. 
                         She looks back at him for a moment - 
                         then drops her head. Stew is oblivious 
                         to this by-play. Conroy turns to Stew.

                         aside.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         You stay right here, Michael. Some day 
                         you'll be head of this family, but thank 
                         heaven I shan't be here when it happens. 
                         And I hope you never have a daughter 
                         who gives you gastritis as Anne has 
                         me!
                                      
                         She pulls the bell rope for the butler.

                         Now Mother, calm yourself. There's no 
                         use in getting so excited.

                         Mrs. Schuyler is vastly agitated.
                                     
                         MRS. SCHUYLER
                                     
                         Oh, isn't there?

                         (as Anne starts to get up)
                                     
                         Sit down!

                         The butler appears in the doorway.

                         Some bicarbonate - quick!

                         The butler bows and exits. She passes 
                         a nervous hand over her eyes. Anne comes 
                         up to her.

                         Mother, if you keep this up, you'll 
                         have a nervous breakdown before you 
                         go to Europe.

                         It's a good thing your father passed 
                         away before he saw insanity ravage the 
                         family. I can't imagine what made you 
                         do such a thing. A reporter! Of all 
                         things, a reporter! A barbarian who 
                         lets his socks come down!

                         Mother, I promise you that he won't 
                         be a reporter much longer. Once I get 
                         him away from that atmosphere and get 
                         him away from a man named Gallagher

                         The butler enters with a tray on which 
                         is a glass of bicarbonate of soda and 
                         brings it to Mrs. Schuyler. Walking 
                         immediately behind the butler is Stew, 
                         airily debonair. The butler glances 
                         somewhat uneasily at Mrs. Schuyler as 
                         he presents the tray. She glares blackly 
                         at Stew without a word of greeting, 
                         and taking the foaming glass from the 
                         tray, starts to lift it to her lips.

                         Drink hearty, Mother.
                                     
                         Once more, Anne starts to rise out of 
                         her seat.

                         Anne!
                                     
                         Mrs. Schuyler pauses - glowering at 
                         Stew. Stew nods perfunctorily to each 
                         member of the jury, the total innocent.

                         Hello, Anne. Mr. Grayson.

                         And you.
                                     
                         (to Mrs. Schuyler)
                                     
                         Mrs. Schuyler!
                                     
                         Grayson does not acknowledge the greeting. 
                         Mrs. Schuyler, having drained the glass, 
                         dismisses the butler with a wave of 
                         the hand, and directs her attention 
                         again to the matter at hand.

                         Well, what's to be done? He's here now.
 
                                                              
                         They are all silent - reluctant to speak 
                         in front of Stew. Stew looks at them 
                         all - a little puzzled - then he walks 
                         over toward Mrs. Schuyler.

                         Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer 
                         a suggestion. Do what about what?

                         Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, 
                         we don't want you to go to any trouble 
                         about that. We just want the usual blessings, 
                         that's all.

                         Mrs. Schuyler's eyes flash. She draws 
                         herself up with haughty dignity.

                         Young man, I want you to know that I 
                         object violently to this whole affair!
 
                                                              
                         This finally brings Anne out of her 
                         seat. She rises and crosses to Stew, 
                         making a show of embracing him.

                         Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly 
                         ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and 
                         I are married.

                         I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. 
                         I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, 
                         that you feel this way. I was in hopes 
                         that you would like me. I'm not the 
                         burglar that you think I am. After all, 
                         we're married. I think the thing to 
                         do is to kiss and make up - Mother.

                         This man's impossible! I can't talk 
                         to him. Grayson, let's go where we can 
                         talk - hic!
                                      
                         (she emits a burp, then fixes a glacial 
                         look at Anne)
                                      
                         See what you've done to me!?
                                     
                         Without another word, she turns and 
                         flounces angrily out of the room. Grayson 
                         follows her. At the doorway he pauses, 
                         starts to say something. They all look 
                         at him expectantly - but no words come 
                         out.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Got it too, huh?
                                     
                         Grayson gives a harrumph and exits.

                         Anne, Michael and Stew. Michael grins 
                         at Stew.
                                      
                         MICHAEL
                                     
                         Who won that round?
                                     
                         Michael starts moving toward the door.

                         I'm afraid your mother won that round 
                         - that is, she got in the last blow.
 
                                                              
                         MICHAEL
                                     
                         I don't feel the way they do. You're 
                         really not as bad as everybody thinks.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         (effusively - shaking his hand)
                                     
                         You're beginning to appreciate me, eh? 
                         Thanks!
                                      
                         MICHAEL
                                     
                         Don't worry too much about Mother - 
                         she's enjoying this. Come on upstairs, 
                         I'll give you a little -
                                      
                         He indicates a snifter, grins and exits. 
                         Anne crosses to Stew and puts her arm 
                         around his shoulder.

                         A little? Sure, I'll be right up.
 
                                                              
                         (to Anne)
                                     
                         He's all right. I like him.
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I'm glad.
                                     
                         He sees two figures pass above in a 
                         proscenium alcove, first Mrs. Schuyler, 
                         then Grayson. He makes an elaborate 
                         bow to each, and is impressed by Grayson's 
                         return bow.

                         Anne takes a step backwards and sits 
                         down with him on one of the divans. 
                         CAMERA TILTING DOWN WITH THEM. He puts 
                         an arm about her.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Come here baby!
                                     
                         Anne starts fussing abstractedly at 
                         Stew's tie. They kiss.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I haven't seen you for three hours. 
                         You're neglecting me already
                                      
                         During her speech she has been picking 
                         away at a stain on his tie. Stew looks 
                         down and notices it.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         What's the matter? Something I et, no 
                         doubt. Egg marks the spot
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         I don't need any new ties. I've got 
                         another tie - I've got another one besides 
                         this one. And it's a pip, too. There's 
                         only one thing wrong with it. You know 
                         what that is? It has a little weakness 
                         for gravy, and once in a while it leans 
                         a little toward ketchup. Of course that's 
                         only in its weaker moments. When you 
                         move down to my place, I'll show it 
                         to you.
                                      
                         Anne is somewhat taken aback at the 
                         suggestion that she's to move into his 
                         place.

                         Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't 
                         compare with this coliseum of yours 
                         here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill

                         The architecture has a little feeling 
                         of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture 
                         sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance 
                         - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.

                         Oh darling, of course it would. If it 
                         isn't - there are six rooms and two

                         will give us the blue room too, I think.

                         and a blue room. I guess she would let

                         He gets up and paces the floor. He looks 
                         at Anne and sees that she is taking 
                         him seriously. He drops down beside 
                         her.

                         on his arm. CAMERA TRUCKS BACK showing 
                         the magnificent bedroom, with carved 
                         wooden panellings, a raised, canopied 
                         bed. The clothes that Stew has taken 
                         off the night before are draped haphazardly 
                         about the room. When the Camera gets 
                         to a point that takes in a LONG SHOT 
                         of the room, the door to the hall opens 
                         and a correctly attired valet appears. 
                         He closes the door noiselessly, goes 
                         over to the windows, and draws the brocaded 
                         drapes aside. Then he crosses to a covered 
                         object and with a small flourish removes 
                         the cover - revealing a birdcage. He 
                         approaches the bed.

                         Stew kicks back the covers and sits

                         of slippers. The valet bends on one 
                         knee to help him.

                         dressing gown, but again the valet beats 
                         him to it - holding it for him and helping 
                         him slip into it.

                         The valet picks up his pants.

                         Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - 
                         she engaged me this morning, sir.
 
                                                              
                         Stew pulls out a cigarette. The valet, 
                         without missing a beat, leans over and 
                         offers a light. A wary Stew accepts.

                         Hmmm. So Mrs. Smith engaged me a valley, 
                         huh? That's very nice of Mrs. Smith 
                         - to engage me a valley.

                         Stew walks over and gets a cigarette 
                         out of a box on a small table, waving 
                         his hand in a gesture of dismissal. 
                         The valet is right behind him, holding 
                         up his bathrobe for Stew to step into.

                         Say, you are nice. You're all right. 
                         You'd make a good wife.

                         But not for me! Though I like you well 
                         enough. You're a nice fellow. You're 
                         all right. But I'm sorry I don't need 
                         any valleys today.
                                      
                         The valet pays no attention to him, 
                         but walks around the room, picking up 
                         the clothes that Stew has flung about.

                         mind my saying so. A gentleman's gentleman, 
                         as it were. Someone to draw your bath, 
                         lay out your clothes, help to dress 
                         you - it's really most essential, sir.
 
                                                              
                         Stew, with his cigarette between his 
                         lips, stands watching the valet as he 
                         retrieves the various articles of cast-off 
                         clothing. The valet's manner is somewhat 
                         patronizing. He walks over to a chifferobe 
                         and starts opening the drawers, preparatory 
                         to laying out fresh things for Stew. 
                         Suddenly, Stew stalks over to him, takes 
                         him by the shoulder, and yanks him around 
                         to face him.

                         The valet is astonished and somewhat

                         Stew is rapidly losing his temper.

                         The valet puts a bewildered hand to 
                         his face.

                         alarmed.

                         and Anne comes in, wearing a ravishing 
                         and revealing negligee. She carries 
                         a small jeweler's box in her hand. She 
                         crosses the room toward Stew.

                         She looks over and sees Dawson at the 
                         hall door.

                         Oh, Dawson, see that all Mr. Smith's 
                         clothes go to the cleaners this morning, 
                         please, will you?
                                      
                         The valet bows. Stew looks at her blankly.

                         He closes the door discreetly and goes 
                         out.

                         Stew flares in anger. Several of them

                         With a violent gesture, Stew kicks his 
                         foot forward and sends a couple of them 
                         sprawling. Stew gets to his feet.

                         I'm Miss Wilson - Mrs. Schuyler's social 
                         secretary.

                         I was sent from the Post in place of 
                         our social editor.

                         Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned 
                         me. Well, what would you like to have?

                         Why, a list of the guests. That's the 
                         usual thing, isn't it?
                                      
                         MISS WILSON
                                     
                         Yes, of course. I'll get it for you

                         In the meantime, would you like to take 
                         a look around?

                         Mr. Smith? Oh, you mean Ann Schuyler's 
                         husband?

                         He's probably very tired. You see, he's 
                         had to meet all these people personally 
                         tonight.

                         with him, don't you? What is it you 
                         call him - the Cinderella Man?

                         Moss and Fontana are just finishing 
                         their dance. Gallagher stands in doorway 
                         with Miss Wilson, watching them. Excited 
                         voices comment on the dance. Miss Wilson 
                         beckons to Gallagher to follow her.

                         in and out of crowd. Miss Wilson points 
                         out celebrated guests to her.

                         Gallagher steals a glance at the celebrated 
                         gentleman.

                         Miss Wilson laughs delightedly. At this 
                         point they are interrupted by a butler.

                         Miss Wilson follows butler out of scene. 
                         Gallagher is left alone. She wanders 
                         about the huge ballroom, peering here 
                         and there, searching for Stew. Finally 
                         she comes to a large open French door 
                         and steps out.

                         Several groups of men and women are 
                         seated at tables. Gallagher enters from 
                         ballroom, glances quickly at all the 
                         men. Disappointed at not finding Stew, 
                         she crosses terrace and descends broad 
                         stone steps and advances into garden.

                         Stew, his head cupped in his hands, 
                         is seated on a stone bench. Gallagher 
                         wanders into scene. She sees Stew and 
                         stops. Stew does not move. Gallagher, 
                         with a happy smile on her lips, moves 
                         closer to him. Stew suddenly becomes 
                         conscious of someone near him and looks 
                         suddenly up. He sees Gallagher; his 
                         face breaks into a happy grin.

                         raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't 
                         got no raw life up here.

                         No, no! Maybe we could interest you 
                         in some well done butterflies, or perhaps 
                         some slightly fried pansies, or better 
                         still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed 
                         every one of them will give you a good 
                         stiff pain in the neck.

                         Say, who's been tying your ties lately? 
                         It looks rotten.

                         different about Gallagher. He takes 
                         a step back so as to look her over carefully 
                         - blinks his eyes.

                         Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What 
                         are you doing to yourself?

                         Nothing.

                         What did you do to that hair? And where 
                         did you get that dress?

                         I dyed one and washed the other.

                         Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. 
                         Well! You certainly look good.

                         Anne is walking in direction of Stew 
                         and Gallagher. She stops suddenly when 
                         she sees them. Her body stiffens.

                         ANOTHER SHOT - STEW AND GALLAGHER
                                     
                         From Anne's angle. Gallagher is facing 
                         in the direction of Anne.

                         Don't turn around now - but there's 
                         a very beautiful girl up there who seems 
                         to be staring at us.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Staring at us?

                         My mistake - she's glaring.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Must be my wife.
                                     
                         He turns - sees Anne.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         It is my wife. Hi Anne. Don't go away. 
                         Stay right there, because I'm going 
                         to bring a friend up I want you to meet.
 
                                                              
                         They exit.

                         Standing as before. She is looking off 
                         with slightly narrowed eyes. Stew and 
                         Gallagher come up to her.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Anne, prepare yourself for the treat 
                         of your life. This is Gallagher.

                         Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing 
                         for the society editor tonight.
                                      
                         Anne turns an acid smile on the uncomfortable 
                         Gallagher.

                         Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?

                         Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
                                     
                         Anne winces slightly at this name.

                         There is a short, awkward pause.
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         (bitter-sweet)
                                     
                         You know, Stewart, you failed to mention 
                         that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful 
                         young girl.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Gallagher?
                                     
                         Gallagher flashes a look at Stew - seeing 
                         that he fails to get the dynamite behind 
                         Anne's casually pleasant phrases. Anne 
                         plunges ahead. Her tone is unmistakable 
                         now.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed 
                         to mention that Gallagher was a girl.

                         Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?

                         Stew is beginning to realize that all 
                         is not well as it could be.

                         You see, we never look at Gallagher 
                         as a girl
                                      
                         He breaks off.

                         No? What do you look upon her as?

                         Why, down at the office, we always look 
                         at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, 
                         that's all.

                         Goodbye, Stew
                                     
                         She leaves scene.

                         Stew turns and faces her.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         That was kind of a rotten thing to do, 
                         Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. 
                         The least you can do is be courteous 
                         to her.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll 
                         go and apologize.
                                      
                         He promptly walks away from her in Gallagher's 
                         direction.

                         Stewart, please!
                                     
                         She glares angrily at the departing 
                         Stew.

                         Gallagher has just reached the ballroom 
                         when Stew catches up to her.

                         I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am 
                         sorry.

                         (reassuringly)
                                     
                         Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. 
                         As far as she's concerned, I'm just 
                         part of the hired help.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne 
                         act that way before. (pause) It's funny 
                         I never thought to tell her you were 
                         a girl, isn't it?
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         Yes.

                         The butler is just opening the door. 
                         Bingy, looking more disreputable than 
                         usual, steps inside.

                         Hello, there, Meadows![13]

                         Who is it you wish to see, sir?
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         I want to see Stew Smith. Oh excuse 
                         me - I mean Mr. Smith.
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Pardon me, Mr. Smith is engaged. We 
                         are having a reception here this evening
 
                                                              
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Oh, a party! Great, great! Jolly times 
                         and merry pranks. That's me. I'm a guy 
                         who loves parties. You know
                                      
                         He is distracted by two elegantly-dressed 
                         ladies strolling by.

                         a beautiful pair of shoulders! But 
                         listen now, as a favor, will you please 
                         make it snappy, Laughing Waters,[14] 
                         and tell Stew Smith I gotta see him 
                         because if you don't my whole family's 
                         going to die.
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have 
                         a seat.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Well, I got a seat, but I have no place 
                         to put it.
                                      
                         The butler turns to leave, then turns 
                         back, his face expressing distinct disapproval.

                         Pardon me, sir, but I've heard that 
                         one before.

                         Stew and Gallagher standing together. 
                         The butler is seen leaving the scene, 
                         having just informed Stew of Bingy's 
                         presence at the reception.
                                      
                         STEW

                         Excuse me. I just want to make sure 
                         and see he doesn't take away any of 
                         the vases.
                                      
                         (starts to leave, then turns back)
 
                                                              
                         Well, well, well! My little pal, Gallagher, 
                         a girl, huh?
                                      
                         (unexpectedly, he bends to kiss her 
                         hand)
                                      
                         (tenderly)
                                     
                         That's just to give you an idea that 
                         I know how to treat a gal. Get fresh 
                         with me and I'll sock you in that little 
                         nose of yours. Excuse me. I'll be right 
                         back.
                                      
                         He exits. Gallagher is left staring 
                         at her hand wonderingly.

                         Bingy gets up from his throne chair, 
                         and crosses into the doorway of the 
                         library opposite him. He stops by a 
                         carved low-boy, and curiously examines 
                         a large antique vase. Stew comes in 
                         and stops with a smile as he sees him.
 
                                                              
                         Bingy, his hand on the vase, looks up. 
                         Stew walks over to him.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (referring to vase)
                                     
                         What's the matter, Bingy, a little clumsy 
                         to get in your pocket?
                                      
                         Bingy sets down the vase and surveys 
                         him.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         No. I was just looking at it. Pretty, 
                         ain't it? I was just looking for the 
                         price tag.

                         Bingy looks him up and down in silent, 
                         insolent scrutiny. Stew begins to burn.

                         What do you want?

                         Oh, nothing. I just blew over - I wanted

                         Mrs. Schuyler gets up. Paces wildly 
                         about room. In a frenzy.
                                      
                         MRS. SCHUYLER

                         She is interrupted by the entrance of 
                         Grayson, who dashes into the room, his 
                         eyes ablaze. In his hand he has a copy 
                         of the morning paper.

                         Stew, now dressed in a business suit, 
                         comes from the direction of the stairs 
                         and stops just before he gets to the 
                         door of the drawing room. From within 
                         there is an ominous silence. Stew looks 
                         longingly in the direction of the front 
                         door - then back at the drawing room, 
                         squares his shoulders and goes in.

                         As Stew stops just inside the doorway. 
                         He had been prepared for this, but it 
                         strikes terror into his soul, just the 
                         same.

                         From his angle in the doorway. The jury 
                         - Dexter Grayson, hands behind his back 
                         - is standing, gazing at Stew with a 
                         fishy eye. Mrs. Schuyler stares haughtily. 
                         Anne is crying softly.

                         Stew - looking around at the gallery

                         to his face as he starts to enter, whistling 
                         as he goes.

                         That's the fourteenth crack you've made 
                         to me. I'm keeping count. When you get 
                         to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right 
                         on the nose. As a matter of fact, I 
                         ought to sock you right now.

                         Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit 
                         there and watch this man insult us? 
                         Haven't you any decency left?

                         Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? 
                         And you might show some too, Mother. 
                         What do you expect a man to do when 
                         he's called such names?

                         I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. 
                         He deserved it.

                         Grayson turns to go, then braves the 
                         last word.

                         He leaves in a huff. Stew puts his arms 
                         around the crying Anne.

                         Six or eight people of distinction scattered 
                         around the room. All dressed in full 
                         evening clothes. Among them is Grayson, 
                         Anne, her mother, and one man in aviator's 
                         uniform. The men have their coats and 
                         hats in their hands, the women have 
                         their evening wraps on. Apparently they 
                         are ready to leave for someplace and 
                         are being detained. An indistinct murmur 
                         of ad-lib conversation is heard.

                         with his dress tie. He pauses, his hands 
                         still on his tie.

                         As he struggles with his collar, it 
                         springs off.

                         I've never wanted to go out with those 
                         social parasites, those sweet-smelling 
                         fashion plates. I don't like them. They 
                         bore me. They give me the jitters.

                         Do you know you're talking about my 
                         friends?
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Yes, I'm talking about your friends, 
                         and they still give me the jitters.

                         Well, are you going - or aren't you?
 
                                                              
                         Stew makes a move to embrace her.

                         Anne, come here. Listen

                         (sternly - slipping away from him)
 
                                                              
                         Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.

                         I'll tell you what. Let's you and me 
                         sneak out all by ourselves
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         (interrupting)
                                     
                         Are you crazy?
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Think of the fun we can have - we'll 
                         sneak down the back stairs and get in 
                         the valet's Ford. How's that?
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Will you stop being silly, Stewart?

                         (trying hard)
                                     
                         I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take 
                         you and introduce you to all my gang. 
                         Would you like that?
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         (hard)
                                     
                         But I don't want to meet your gang.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         I don't mean the newspaper fellows that 
                         you don't like. Another gang I know 
                         - you'd love them. They're writers and 
                         musicians and artists - a great crowd 
                         of people - people who do great things. 
                         People who are worthwhile.

                         ANNE
                                     
                         Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, 
                         I suppose?
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I

                         (interrupting belligerently)
                                     
                         That's exactly what you mean. Heaven 
                         knows you've made that clear to me often 
                         enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of 
                         it. I've given you party after party 
                         - I've taken you to some of the best 
                         houses in this town - and introduced 
                         you to people of importance - and are 
                         you grateful? No! You insult them and 
                         act like a bore. I'm sick and tired 
                         of having to make excuses for you and 
                         the things that you've done. Perhaps 
                         it's just as well you're not coming 
                         tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for 
                         once without having to worry about you, 
                         and what you're going to do.
                                      
                         With which violent declaration, she 
                         flounces out of the room, leaving Stew 
                         staring after her, angry and hurt. Impulsively, 
                         he follows her to the door - a retort 
                         on his lips. When he gets there, however, 
                         she has vanished. He returns to the 
                         room, wanders about thoughtfully, extracts 
                         cigarette from box, fumbles it - walks 
                         to window - stares out - turns back 
                         to room - heaves a lonely sigh.
                                      
                         He notices his reflection in the mirror, 
                         and gestures toward it.

                         As Stew sits in a typewriter chair. 
                         He rolls up the sheet in the machine 
                         so that he can read what is already 
                         written.

                         Strumming of guitars are dimly heard.

                         He studies it for a moment, frowning 
                         in dissatisfaction. He's stuck. He leans 
                         back in the chair and looks up for inspiration.

                         185. LONG SHOT
                                     
                         Of Stew Smith pacing the grand foyer. 
                         Seen from overhead, he is dwarfed by 
                         the surroundings. He tries hopscotching 
                         on the pattern of the floor. That wears 
                         thin quickly. Supremely bored, Stew 
                         gives a shout and is rewarded with a 
                         cavernous echo. Smythe the butler then 
                         appears, nervously crouched behind some 
                         grillwork.

                         Did you call, sir?
                                     
                         STEW

                         you.
                                      
                         (Smythe looks unenthusiastic.)
                                     
                         Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, 
                         I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this 
                         house! This big . . . come on, I'm not 
                         going to hurt you. Come on, what's the 
                         matter with you?
                                      
                         Stew gives another shout and is rewarded 
                         with another loud echo. This coaxes 
                         Smythe out from behind the grillwork.

                         SMYTHE

                         STEW
                                     
                         You try it.

                         Me, sir?
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Yeah.
                                     
                         Smythe gives it a timid try.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         No, no. Give it more volume.
                                     
                         Smythe gives a more satisfactory yell. 
                         Stew nods approval. Smythe begins yelling 
                         and shouting in earnest.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         No, that's enough. I just wanted you 
                         to get the idea. Now you know. This 
                         house is haunted.

                         No, sir!
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Yes. Have you looked in the closets 
                         all over . . .?

                         It's haunted just the same.

                         Smythe has heard enough. He turns to 
                         leave, but Stew grabs him.

                         Smythe, what do you do with yourself 
                         - I mean, when you're not carrying those 
                         double-strength - what do you do with 
                         yourself?

                         Well, sir, I putter.

                         Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and 
                         want to amuse yourself, then what?

                         I just putter.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to 
                         have a putter to putter?
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.

                         Well, isn't that nice? You just go right 
                         ahead and putter with your hands. That's 
                         all right. How do you do it?
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Well sir, I'll show you.
                                     
                         He demonstrates, touching objects on 
                         a table and blowing dust off a lampshade.

                         That's puttering, sir.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         No! Well, well, well! That's all right, 
                         if you like it. Can anybody do that?

                         Oh no, sir. Some people are natural 
                         putterers. Others can never master it.

                         Oh my. You mean, some people are born 
                         and never will become putterers?
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         Yes sir.

                         Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know 
                         that you could never be a putterer.

                         How about me? Do you think if I concentrated 
                         and put my whole soul into it, that 
                         some day I might be a putterer?
                                      
                         SMYTHE
                                     
                         You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a 
                         putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.

                         Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, 
                         I wouldn't want to putter. But why? 
                         What makes you think I couldn't be a 
                         good putterer?

                         Well sir, to be a putterer, one's mind 
                         must be at ease. A person with a problem 
                         could never be a putterer. For instance, 
                         sir, a fish can putter in water but 
                         not on land because he'd be out of place. 
                         An eagle can putter around a rugged 
                         mountaintop but not in a cage, because 
                         he'd be restless and unhappy. Now sir, 
                         if you will pardon me, with all due 
                         respect, sir, as a Smythe to a Smith, 
                         you are an eagle in a cage.
                                      
                         STEW

                         Stew rushes off upstairs. Smythe gives 
                         the echo one last try.

                         Yeah. Come on, don't be silly.

                         All right, if you feel like you need 
                         a chaper-one, call up Hank. Yeah. You'll 
                         find him at Joe's, no doubt. Yeah. Hank 
                         would be my idea of a perfect bodyguard.

                         Sure you would. I knew I could depend 
                         on you, old pal. Snap it up, will you,

                         She hangs up, joyful at the prospect 
                         of seeing Stew. She hums softly to herself 
                         as she picks up the receiver again.

                         him.

                         I sort of invited him along to bend 
                         an elbow. You don't mind, do you?

                         Joe appears in the open doorway. Stew 
                         sees him.

                         Hello kid, how are you? Glad to see 
                         you.
                                      
                         Stew starts to close the door.

                         Just a minute - Johnson's outside. You 
                         don't mind if he comes in and dips a 
                         beak[17] do you?

                         Johnson appears in the open doorway. 
                         Stew sees him.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Hello, Johnson.
                                     
                         JOHNSON
                                     
                         Hello, Stew, old pal. How are you?

                         Glad to see you. Come in, kid.
                                     
                         Stew starts to close the door.
                                     
                         JOHNSON
                                     
                         Wait a minute. I got two of the boys 
                         I brought along - they were cruising 
                         around with nothing to do. You don't 
                         mind if I bring them in?
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         You brought two of the boys? That's 
                         all right. Bring them in. What's the 
                         difference?
                                      
                         The two enter, followed in a single 
                         file by 12-14 men and women, all of 
                         whom greet Stew as they enter, ad-libbing 
                         hello's and hand-shakes. Stew stares 
                         at them dumbfoundedly.

                         They swarm into the hallway and overflow 
                         into the rooms on either side. The butler 
                         stands aghast at this invasion. Stew 
                         starts to close the door when three 
                         or four more troop in, shouting cheery 
                         greetings. Stew regards them in amazement.

                         the morning edition - but they'll be 
                         down later.

                         It will be lonesome without them.

                         Smythe gulps nervously, as he is dragged 
                         off by the revellers.

                         The gang have taken seriously Stew's 
                         suggestion that they make themselves 
                         at home. They have draped themselves 
                         about the place - a couple are strumming 
                         on the piano and others are inspecting 
                         the room in awe-struck attitudes. Smythe

                         Well, Gallagher, you certainly took 
                         no chances, did you?
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank 
                         did the rest.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         I see. Hank brought them all. That's 
                         all right. We'll give them a drink and 
                         throw 'em out. How's that?

                         Okay.

                         (as Smythe passes by, being propelled 
                         by revellers)
                                      
                         Smythe! Give them one drink and throw

                         Bingy pokes his head in the door, wearing 
                         a false beard.

                         Is there a green elephant standing beside 
                         that bwana?

                         No, it's just little Bingy Baker.
                                     
                         Stew rolls up his sleeves, preparatory 
                         to launching a punch.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         (warningly)
                                     
                         Uh-uh.
                                     
                         Bingy dons a pair of glasses, and points 
                         to them meaningfully. He enters, cautiously, 
                         watching Stew warily.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         (striking a pose)
                                     
                         Big Chief Bingy come to white man's 
                         tepee to make friends. Big Chief very 
                         sorry. To show how sorry - will bend 
                         over and let white man kick Big Chief 
                         where sun never shines.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss 
                         this one for the world.
                                      
                         He bends over, and Stew winds up and 
                         delivers a hard kick to his backside. 
                         Bingy straightens stiffly, then removes 
                         a bottle of alcohol from the target 
                         area.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Fire water all right.
                                     
                         (he takes a drink)
                                     
                         Both start laughing.
                                     
                         BINGY
                                     
                         Well, Stew, that's all thrashed out. 
                         By golly, I'm surely glad to see that 
                         you're not really sore. You know our 
                         racket - after all, news is news.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Sure, sure. That's all right. That was 
                         a great story, Bingy. A great story 
                         - wish I'd printed it.
                                      
                         BINGY
                                     
                         I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That 
                         hairy chest story!

                         (indicating Bingy's false beard)
                                     
                         You've raised it up to the chin, I see.

                         Go on in the other room and get yourself 
                         a drink.
                                      
                         Bingy emits a war-whoop and proceeds 
                         into the drawing room, where Smythe 
                         is still being held hostage by the party.

                         You know what I should do with you? 
                         I should sock you right in that funny 
                         little nose.

                         Yes - and I'd love it.

                         head upstairs, the party around them

                         Stew and Gallagher enter. Apparently 
                         they have been talking about Stew's 
                         play on the way upstairs.

                         How far have you gotten?

                         Well, I've just been able to get off 
                         that Norway coast - so far.
                                      
                         Stew gestures toward the typewriter 
                         from which a sheet of paper is protruding. 
                         Gallagher crosses to it. She rolls up 
                         the sheet so she can read what is typed 
                         on it.

                         of territory.

                         I don't know a thing about him, but 
                         isn't he the one you're always yelling

                         Stew is noticeably impressed with this

                         Shooting through into the drawing room. 
                         It is many hours later. The members 
                         of the party, including Smythe, are 
                         pretty well lit. On the floor of the 
                         entrance hall a dice game is in progress. 
                         In the drawing room four or five are 
                         hanging over the piano singing "The

                         As the scene opens a door-bell is ringing. 
                         A key is heard in the lock.

                         The outer door starts to swing open. 
                         One of the party guests, very wall-eyed 
                         now, and carrying a whiskey bottle in 
                         his hand, staggers toward the door. 
                         It opens wider, and Anne and Mrs. Schuyler 
                         and Dexter Grayson stand gasping in 
                         the opening. The guest comes up to them.

                         Say, you can't come in here - this is 
                         a private party.
                                      
                         Anne pushes the door violently, which 
                         sends the guest sprawling. He stays 
                         where he lands, holding the bottle in 
                         both arms across his chest. Anne and 
                         her mother advance into a CLOSE SHOT 
                         and look off with incredulous horror

                         He assumes an attitude of exaggerated

                         Very drunk.

                         Where is Mr. Smith?

                         And I don't care. Whoopee!
                                      
                         He jubilantly exits scene.

                         Very, very drunk.

                         Stew gets to his feet as an idea strikes 
                         him.

                         Now Gallagher, if we could only get 
                         a great scene - a tremendously emotional 
                         scene - some-
                                      
                         ? 87 ?
                                     
                         thing that would just wring the hearts 
                         out of the public - to bring the curtain 
                         down in the second act - that would 
                         be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your 
                         hat some place, could you?

                         Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks 
                         tonight.

                         Now, we've got it right up to where 
                         the boy's wearing his white spats and 
                         going to teas and the frau enters - 
                         how's that?

                         At the partially opened door into the 
                         hall. It opens wider, and Anne looks 
                         in. She stares in horrified amazement.

                         Gallagher, her shoes off, sprawled out 
                         on the chaise longue, stretches luxuriously 
                         and yawns. CAMERA PANS TO Stew at the 
                         typewriter, hair mussed, coffee pot 
                         and cups prominent, the dressing gown 
                         over the back of his chair. Neither 
                         of them has seen Anne.

                         Anne. She gasps as she quietly steps 
                         further into the room.

                         Gallagher, caught in the midst of a 
                         grand stretch, sits up abruptly, startled. 
                         She stares uncomfortably off at Anne.

                         At the typewriter. He glances up momentarily 
                         and very absently, and goes right on 
                         typing.

                         He types furiously.

                         Stewart looks up surprised at the tone 
                         of her voice.

                         Gallagher, sensing scene, starts hastily 
                         looking for her shoes. One of them has 
                         been shoved under the chaise longue 
                         and she has to get down on her hands 
                         and knees to retrieve it. Anne comes 
                         in and confronts them, her hands on 
                         her hips.

                         Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got 
                         so interested in the play I forgot all 
                         about them.
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I see.

                         STEW
                                     
                         Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we 
                         got a play! Of course most of it is 
                         Gallagher's. She did most of it. That 
                         brain of hers just snaps like that all 
                         the time.
                                      
                         He indicates by snapping his fingers. 
                         Gallagher quietly gathers up her things, 
                         apprehensive of the storm about to break.
 
                                                              
                         ANNE
                                     
                         (coldly)
                                     
                         I'm not interested in the way her brain 
                         snaps.
                                      
                         Stew stares at Anne as Gallagher, her 
                         hat in her hand, her coat over her arm, 
                         starts for the door.

                         I think I better go, Stew.
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         I think you should, Miss Gallagher.

                         Wait a minute, Gallagher.
                                     
                         Gallagher stops, transfixed by the new 
                         tone in his voice. He comes over to 
                         Anne.

                         What's the idea, Anne?
                                     
                         ANNE
                                     
                         The idea is simply this - that I want 
                         those people to leave here immediately.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Now wait a minute. Aren't you being 
                         a little unreasonable?
                                      
                         ANNE
                                     
                         Unreasonable! Have you any idea what 
                         the place looks like downstairs? Do 
                         you expect me to stand here and see 
                         this place turned into a cheap barroom?
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's 
                         no reason for that. Perhaps the boys 
                         have had a little too much to drink. 
                         That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go 
                         right down and throw them out. That's 
                         no reason for you to take this attitude. 
                         After all, I certainly have a right 
                         to invite a few of my friends to my 
                         house, haven't I?

                         you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, 
                         there. That's what I call getting me 
                         told, isn't it, Anne?
                                      
                         Anne remains silent. That's exactly

                         a long time ago, only I didn't have 
                         sense enough to do it. No, I had to 
                         stick around here to try and make a 
                         success of something that I knew darn 
                         well was a failure from the very beginning. 
                         But no more. No more! So that's that.

                         Stew is struck by a sudden idea as he 
                         regards the bum intently.

                         Stew raises one foot, then the other, 
                         and quickly removes the solid gold garters 
                         which he presses into the bum's surprised 
                         hand.

                         Just a minute.

                         He walks away, leaving the bum staring 
                         dazedly at the luxurious pair of garters.

                         and go down the street, arm in arm. 
                         As they get past the Camera, Stew is 
                         seen to square his shoulders and throw 
                         out his chest. He shakes first one leg, 
                         and then the other, as if he were throwing 
                         off shackles.

                         Stew and Gallagher moving along. Gallagher 
                         has a peculiar expression as she glances 
                         at Stew. She has been deeply affected 
                         by the scene she has just witnessed. 
                         Stew's face is very thoughtful.

                         I wouldn't worry too much about it, 
                         Stew. She'll see it your way.

                         (snapping out of it)
                                     
                         Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm 
                         worrying about that second act curtain, 
                         that's all.
                                      
                         Gallagher stares at him, realizing he 
                         is thinking more about the play than 
                         his split-up with his wife. Then she 
                         breaks into a grin.

                         Why, you're just a first-class chump! 
                         You just staged a scene that would play 
                         like a million dollars! How about that 
                         declaration of independence for the 
                         second act curtain?
                                      
                         Stew stops stock still and stares at 
                         her.

                         That's an idea, Gallagher - a great 
                         idea.
                                      
                         Gallagher happily links her arm in his

                         in his shirtsleeves. A battered old 
                         typewriter stands on the table with 
                         a sheet of blank paper in it. Stew is 
                         seated in a chair before it, and is 
                         picking out the letters, typing. He 
                         pauses, running up the roller to regard 
                         what he has written.

                         Gallagher, in a little apron, is frying 
                         some ham and eggs. She looks up as she

                         were coming, I would have thrown you 
                         up a waffle.

                         Grayson sits stiffly on one of the Grand

                         and waits silently for Grayson to speak. 
                         Grayson clears his throat.

                         75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have 
                         any part of that she wants, but she'd 
                         better hurry because I'm spending it 
                         awfully fast.

                         breaks into a broad grin. He sits down

                         to see the kid, see - to talk over the 
                         divorce. Then this guy insults the poor 
                         but honest boy by offering him alimony 
                         - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer 
                         in the nose and throws him out. How's 
                         that for the beginning of the third 
                         act, huh?
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         Well, from now on the play will be easy. 
                         All you have to do is bring the wife 
                         back, have her say she's sorry, and 
                         then your play's over.
                                      
                         230. CLOSEUP - STEW
                                     
                         He looks over at Gallagher with a peculiar 
                         expression.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (vehemently - as he scoops out some 
                         melon)
                                      
                         What's the matter? Do you think I'm 
                         going to let that guy go back to his 
                         wife? Not on your life. He's got to 
                         go to the other girl.
                                      
                         231. CLOSEUP - GALLAGHER
                                     
                         She almost drops her coffee cup in a 
                         wild gleam of hope as she looks back 
                         at him. Gallagher tries hard to keep 
                         her voice steady.
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         (not sure of herself)
                                     
                         What other girl?
                                     
                         232. MED. CLOSE SHOT OF THE TWO
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         The little O'Brien girl, of course - 
                         the one you suggested in the story.
 
                                                              
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         (ecstatic, but still fighting)
                                     
                         But that's ridiculous! You can't make 
                         a sudden change like that.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         Gallagher, what are you going to do 
                         - tell me how to write a play?
                                      
                         GALLAGHER
                                     
                         No.
                                     
                         STEW
                                     
                         There's nothing sudden about that
 
                                                              
                         (tensely)
                                     
                         He's always loved the girl, but he was 
                         such a sap he didn't have sense enough 
                         to tell her. Well, that's all right 
                         - we can fix that. He will
                                      
                         ? 97 ?
                                     
                         go to the little O'Brien girl, and - 
                         here, I'll show you.
                                      
                         He gets to his feet, and comes around 
                         to her.
                                      
                         233. CLOSE TWO SHOT
                                     
                         Gallagher watches him a bit uncertainly.
 
                                                              
                         STEW
                                     
                         (tenderly)
                                     
                         He goes to the little O'Brien gal and 
                         he says to her - in some pretty words 
                         of some kind - something that you can 
                         write - he'll say
                                      
                         (as if reading part - very emotional)
 
                                                              
                         Darling, I'm sorry. I've been a fool 
                         all my life. I've always loved you, 
                         only I didn't have sense enough to see 
                         it. As quick as I can get a divorce 
                         from my wife, I want you to marry me. 
                         Then she'll look at him that way - yeah 
                         - then they'll embrace, or something 
                         like that.
                                      
                         (they draw closer)
                                     
                         Then he'll kiss her, or something.
 
                                                              
                         To demonstrate the point, Stew takes 
                         her in his arms and kisses her. They 
                         hold the kiss longer than is justified. 
                         Stew is swept away by his sudden emotion 
                         and clings to her desperately, while 
                         Gallagher's arms instinctively go around 
                         his neck.
                                      
                         Gallagher chokes back tears that persist 
                         in coming. She stifles a sob. Stew folds 
                         her in his arms.
                                      
                         STEW
                                     
                         (tenderly)
                                     
                         What's the matter, Gallagher? What's 
                         the matter?
                                      
                         Gallagher buries her face in his shoulders.
 
                                                              
                         FADE OUT.

  --------------------------------------------------------------

  EXT. A HOUSE IN THE HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

  The view of downtown Los Angeles from the enormous, ornate house
  is extraordinary.  A small outdoor dinner party is in progress.

  A MAGICIAN is entertaining guests.  Playing cards and coins
  appear and disappear in his nimble hands.

  INT. HOUSE STUDY - NIGHT

    EDWARD HARRIS stands at the window, impassively looking down
  at the party.  Edward is a handsome, well groomed man of around
  forty.  He looks tired; the kind of fatigue that can't be cured
  by a night's sleep.

          EDWARD
      (a murmur)
    Left pocket.

  And indeed, down below, the magician pulls the coin from the
  left pocket of the incredulous WOMAN's silk blazer.  More
  laughter and applause.

  The study is in keeping with the rest of the house.  Luxurious.
  Everything the best.  WILLIAM STUCKEY, Edward's contemporary,
  is a crafty looking lawyer who is the party host.  VANCE is an
  investment banker.  His assistant JAKE, is a financial
  researcher.  The other men are INVESTMENT BANKERS.  They are
  in dark suits and power ties.  On the table are stacks of
  documents and folders, the name "KROSS INDUSTRIES" is prominent
  on many of the folders.

          INVESTMENT BANKER 1
    Our banks certainly doesn't want
    to discourage Harris Enterprises
    from investing in California.
    We think this is a great new venue
    for you but you've got to
    understand the mergers and
    acquisitions market is changing.
    With the upswing in inflation we
    have to make these offerings
    tempting to offset the risk.

          VANCE
    Look, we're talking about hard
    assets and a straight liquidation.
    We have over a thousand man hours
    in this deal.

          STUCKEY
      (losing patience)
    This is a "no brainer".  There's
    no risk for you.  No one has ever
    lost money backing Mr. Harris.

          INVESTMENT BANKER 2
    Not yet.  But ship building is
    a new endeavor for you...

          STUCKEY
      (cuts him off)
    Come on.  You know we're not
    going to go into ship building.
    Besides, you're the ones with the
    troubled track record, not us!

          INVESTMENT BANKER 3
    Bill, be reasonable.  If you're
    really going to digest Kross
    Industries that quickly eighteen
    should not be such a problem.
    Besides, I don't think there's
    anywhere else you can go for the
    money in the time you have.

          EDWARD
    It's unacceptable.

  Edward turns from the window.  He hasn't miss a thing.  All
  eyes are on him.

          EDWARD
    Draymen Heux has offered me
    seventy-five in the pool at
    sixteen and a half.  I can secure
    the other half personally.  You
    have until tomorrow morning to
    make me a better offer.

  The bankers speechlessly stare at him.

          EDWARD
    The meeting is over, gentlemen.

  He turns away.  The bankers look at one another.  They rise.
  Silence as they exit.  When the door closes.  Stuckey explodes
  with laughter.

          STUCKEY
    Hah!  Did you see the look on
    their faces?

          VANCE
    You don't think we pushed too
    hard?

          STUCKEY
    NO way!  They'll come back.  They
    can't afford not to.  Edward,
    that bluff was beautiful.

          EDWARD
    Maybe I should have made it
    rhyme.

  The others stare at him, uncertain.  Stuckey laughs.  The
  others follow suit.

          EDWARD
      (looking at his watch)
    Well!  It's late.  We've been
    at this long enough.

  Stuckey rises.  Edward ushers Vance and Jake toward the door.

          EDWARD
    Gentlemen, enjoy the party.  The
    magician's wonderful.

  Vance and Jake exit.

          EDWARD
      (calling after them)
    Watch your left pocket.

  A BUTLER has entered the room.

          BUTLER
    Phone call, Mr. Harris.  It's Miss
    Charles.

          STUCKEY
    Cynthia?  Is she coming out?

          EDWARD
    We're about to find out.  Go on.
    Take care of your guests.

  Stuckey exits the room as Edward crosses to the telephone.

          EDWARD
      (into phone)
    Where are you, Cynthia?
      (beat)
    I see.
      (pausing, getting angry)
    No, I don't expect you to be at
    my beck-and-call.  Are you coming
    or not?

  INT. HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT

  Edward descends the long, curved stairway.  He has Vance in
  tow.

          EDWARD
      (all business)
    Prepare the filing papers.  Have
    them ready by the middle of the
    week.  I'll tell you when to
    submit them.

  The PEOPLE talking and drinking on the stairway gravitate
  toward Edward.

          A MAN
    Edward!

          EDWARD
      (turning on the charm)
    Yes!

          THE MAN
    Will we see you at the polo
    matches Wednesday?

          EDWARD
    Wouldn't miss it.
      (abruptly; to Vance)
    I want this done fast and easy.
    No slip-ups.  I want to be back
    in New York by Saturday.  Got it?

  He deftly keeps making his way through the crowd.

  INT. HOUSE - THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

  Stuckey is sipping champagne and talking to a beautiful
  WOMAN in a tight sheath of an evening dress.  An elegant woman
      ELIZABETH STUCKEY approaches from behind him.  She taps him on
  the shoulder and he turns, startled.

          ELIZABETH
    Bill?

          STUCKEY
      (flustered)
    Oh... Hi, honey... Millicent,
    uh, uh, Millicent.

          MILLICENT
    Lowell.

          STUCKEY
    Lowell, right.  My wife,
    Elizabeth.

          ELIZABETH
      (ignoring her)
    Is Edward leaving?

  Stuckey looks up to see Edward moving quickly toward the door.
  Stuckey abruptly leaves the two woman together to follow Edward.

  EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

  Edward comes out of the house.  Jags, a limo with waiting
  DRIVER and two BMW's pack the circular driveway behind a black
  Ferrari.  The limo driver leaps to attention at the sight of
  Edward.  Edward stands, making an obvious effort to keep his
  impatience under control.  Stuckey comes out of the house and
  down the walk.

          STUCKEY
    What's up, where you going?

          EDWARD
    Give me your car keys, will you,
    I'm going back to my hotel.

          STUCKEY
    At least stay for a drink.  This
    party's for you.

          EDWARD
    Apologize to Elizabeth for me.

  Stuckey gropes uncertainly in his pocket for keys.

          STUCKEY
    Listen, there're some major local
    talent inside just dying to meet
    you...

          EDWARD
      (as if delighted)
    Really?  Some high class gold
    digger who speaks French better
    than I do?
      (turning away)
    No, thank you.  I just got off
    the phone with one.

          STUCKEY
    Cynthia's not coming?

          EDWARD
    No.

  Edward grabs the keys out of Stuckey's hand.  He crosses to a
  black Ferrari and gets in.

          STUCKEY
    Let your driver take you.  We'll
    move the cars...

  Edward starts the car.

          STUCKEY
    Can you drive a stick?

  The car lurches forward with a squeal of wheels and promptly
  stalls.

          STUCKEY
    Edward, give me a break!

  With a squeal of tires, the Ferrari bucks out of the driveway
  and... stalls again.

          EDWARD
    Love this car!  Is it new?

          STUCKEY
    Yes!  And you don't even know
    where you're going!

  Edward starts it again and heads uncertainly uphill.  Stuckey
  watching, throws up his hands.

          STUCKEY
    That's the wrong way!

  CREDITS BEGIN AS IN A SERIES OF CROSSCUTS:

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

  The Ferrari, moving fast through the Hollywood Hills, passes
  large, beautiful homes... Edward shifts, grinding gears...

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

  The Ferrari comes to a red light and pulls up next to a Dodge Colt.
  The GIRL in the Colt looks at Edward and his car admiringly.
  Edward feeling confident now, revs the engine.  The light turns
  green.  Edward immediately stalls the Ferrari.  The Colt leaves
  him in the dust.

  INT. FERRARI - NIGHT

  Edward drives.  He blinks, shakes his head as if trying to rid
  himself of his own tired thoughts.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

  The Ferrari comes to the intersection of OUTPOST and FRANKLIN,
  stops.  Edward gets out of the car.  He looks at the street
  signs.  He has no idea where he is.  He signs.  He gets back
  in the car and takes off on Franklin heading East.

  EXT. A SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

  A crumbling old apartment building.  Dark alley ways, deserted
  parking lot.

  The Ferrari -- blink and you miss it -- motors past the building,
  looking very out of place on the street.

  PANNING UP  A building facade of lit windows and metal fire
  escape.  One window in particular.  A GIRL stands there in a
  short kimono, looking down.  And then she turns away.

  INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  A SERIES OF SHOTS to see her dressing.

  INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

  VIVIAN turns and stares at herself in a grainy, cracked bedroom
  mirror.  She is twenty years old and a prostitute.  Make-up
  applied to give her a hard, older look doesn't quite succeed.
  She'd be innocently beautiful without it.  She is wearing tiny
  shorts, a tight tube top, thigh high boots.  She stares at
  herself, not really liking what she sees.  A moment.  She signs,
  turns off the light and walks out of the bedroom.

  INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - NIGHT

  Faded, peeling walls.  Thread bare, dirty carpet.  Vivian locks
  the apartment door behind her and starts down the dim hallway.
  A door suddenly opens, startling her.  An unshaved, enormously
  pot bellied MAN in a stained t-shirt stares at Vivian with pig
  eyes.

          LANDLORD
    Vivian.

  Vivian turns some "tough" on him.

          VIVIAN
    Yeah, what?

          LANDLORD
    Rent.  You're late.

          VIVIAN
    Don't give me that.  Kit gave it
    to you yesterday, cash.

          LANDLORD
    Kit give me nothin'.

          VIVIAN
      (suddenly uncertain)
    You bullshittin' me?

          LANDLORD
    Of rent I do not bullshit.

  Vivian hurries at a run back down the hallway.

          LANDLORD
    By the end of the week or you're
    otta here.
      (a beat)
    By the way, you look very nice
    tonight!

  INT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN

  Vivian pulls a coffee can off a shelf.  She pulls off the top.
  It's empty.  She tosses the can away, starts for the door.  She
  opens it.

  INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

  Down the hallway, the landlord is standing in front of his open
  doorway, talking to a FAT WOMAN.  They both glance up.

  Vivian quickly closes the door.  She doesn't want to deal with
  them.

  EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

  Vivian comes off the fire escape onto the sidewalk.  She hurried
  away.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT

  Vivian walks along, urgently looking for something... someone.

  A BABBLING STREET-TYPE goes by happily talking to himself.
  He wears an "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt.

  Vivian passes TOURISTS but doesn't notice them any more than
  she pays attention to the VAGRANT she passes further on, huddle
  in a doorway.

  A LONG-HAIRED KID on a SKATEBOARD goes by dropping off little
  bags to various STREET-TYPES.

  A BARKER-TYPE stands in front of a photo store urging tourists
  to come in and take a photo with a cardboard cut-out of a movie
  star.  Some go in.

  Vivian hurries past a group of rubbernecking JAPANESE TOURISTS.
  A BLACK PROSTITUTE in a mini skirt strolls toward her.  A car
  passes.  The DRIVER stares at Vivian with interest.  She ignores
  him.  The black prostitute approaches the car.

          PROSTITUTE
    Hey, baby, you lookin' for a date?

  The Driver looks her over.  The Black Prostitute gets in the
  car and it drives away.

  A GROUP OF MEN, mostly drug dealers, hang out at an all night
  coffee shop.  They WHISTLE and make obscene gestures and SOUNDS
  as Vivian hurries by.  She ignores them and goes next door into
  a falafel stand.  Half a dozen PEOPLE sit at dirty tables inside.

  INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT

  Behind the counter are a MAN and a WOMAN, Vietnamese cooks
  frying food, trying to ignore the unsavory crowd camped in the
  shop.

          VIVIAN
    Chan, you seen Kit tonight?

          COOK 1
    Hi, hi!  No see nothing.

          VIVIAN
    You do, tell her I'm looking for
    her.

          COOK 2
    Looking good, bay-bee.

          VIVIAN
    Yeah, you too, D'Nai.  If Kit
    comes in here, tell her stay.

  Both of them nod and smile at Vivian.  Vivian exits.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT

  Skateboard zips by a GROUP.  We SEE a police car parked at the
  entrance to an alcove.  Also, an ambulance.  The bubblegum
  lights are going.  A CROWD has gathered.  The happy man with
  the "I Love Hollywood" t-shirt and a POLICE OFFICER are engaged
  in tense conversation.

          COP
    They just pulled her out of a
    dumpster in the back.  Now talk
    to me.

          MAN
    I tell you, man, I don't know who
    she hang with.

          COP
    She have a pimp?

          MAN
    Cocaine her pimp, man.  She a
    strawberry.  She be out on these
    streets, day in, day out, tradin'
    her sorry ass for crack.  And
    now she dead from it.

  Vivian rushes up to join the outskirts of the crowd as the body
  of a YOUNG GIRL is pulled out of an open dumpster and carried
  towards the waiting ambulance.  For a moment Vivian thinks
  it's... no, Vivian turns grimly away.

  Vivian surveys the dark street.  And suddenly sees who's she's
  looking for.  Walks.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - WIG SHOP - NIGHT

  We SEE a young, tough-looking MAN and WOMAN trying on wigs.
  The STOREKEEPER is a man wearing a dress and wild wig.  The
  girl, KIT, is around 18, is dark haired and thin.  The young
  man, CARLOS, has his arm sloppily draped across Kit's shoulder.
  They giggle about something, both obviously high.  Kit looks
  up, bleary-eyed.  She stops.  Vivian is standing in front of
  her.

          VIVIAN
    You spent it on drugs, didn't you?

          KIT
    Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my
    roommate, Viv.

          CARLOS
    Lookin' good, baby.

          VIVIAN
      (ignoring him)
    Did you blow it all, Kit?  Is it
    all gone?

          KIT
    Carlos had some great rock.

          VIVIAN
    I bet.
      (beat)
    That was our rent!

  Carlos attempts to put an arm around Vivian's shoulders.

          CARLOS
    Calm down, Chica.

  Vivian throws him off.

          CARLOS
    Ey!  What is it you wan', baby?
    I can fix you up.

          VIVIAN
    Beat it, scum bucket!

          CARLOS
    You kiss your mother with that
    mouth?  Your frien' still owes
    me 200.

          VIVIAN
      (to Kit)
    Let's go.

  Skateboard appears suddenly, blocking Vivian and Kit's path.

          VIVIAN
    Get out of my face or I'll have
    those cops on your ass in two
    seconds.

  Carlos glares at her.  He looks down toward the lights of the
  cop cars.  One of the POLICEMEN looks towards them, curiously.
  Vivian waves at the cop.

          CARLOS
      (threatening to Vivian)
    Don't take no dates tonight,
    chica, you got one with me.

  Vivian grabs Kit by the arm and pulls her across the Boulevard.

  INT. FALAFEL STAND - NIGHT

  Vivian and Kit sit at a table sipping tea.  Vivian is still
  mad at her.

          VIVIAN
    We worked for that money.  We
    were gonna put together enough
    to get out of that dump we live
    in, get off this street.

          KIT
    Viv... don't be stupid.  We're
    whores.

  Vivian looks like she wants to weep.  Or scream.  She does
  neither.  She slowly nods.  Kit's sorry she said that.

          KIT (cont'd)
    So I blew our stash.  We could
    make it all back with one good
    night on the streets.

          VIVIAN
    I just saw somebody pulled out
    of a dumpster.  I wonder how much
    she made tonight?

          KIT
    Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay
    you back.  I promise.

          VIVIAN
    I thought you were giving up that
    drug shit.

          KIT
    I will.  I'm trying.
      (a beat)
    Meanwhile I got some crack left,
    you wanna get high?

          VIVIAN
    No, let's go to work.  Okay?

          KIT
    Okay.
      (then touches her hand)
    I'm sorry I said your dream was
    stupid.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT

  Edward's Ferrari turns onto Hollywood Blvd., finally out of
  the Hollywood Hills.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT

  Vivian and Kit are out trying to hustle John's in passing cars.
  Vivian strikes a sexy pose at the bus stop.  Kit is talking to
  another prostitute, RACHEL.

          KIT
    No no, honey.  You see these
    stars on the sidewalk.  Me and
    Vivian work from Don Ameche all
    the way up to Roy Rogers.
    This is our office.  We got
    seniority.  Get off our corner.

          RACHEL
    I was just taking a rest here.
    Besides, she's new.
      (points to Vivian)

          KIT
    But I'm old.  Go rest up by Monty
    Hall or Debra Paget where you
    belong.

  Rachel walks off.

          VIVIAN
      (looks at passing cars)
    Looks slow tonight.

          KIT
    Maybe we should get a pimp.
    Carlos likes you and --

          VIVIAN
    Forget it.  We work for it.  We
    keep it.

  They keep hustling.

          KIT
    I can't handle this tonight.
    I'm going home.

          VIVIAN
      (stares at her)
    That crack is burning a hole in
    your pocket.  There isn't even
    milk in the fridge.  The rent's
    due.  Now come on --

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - ANGLE ON FERRARI - NIGHT

          KIT (O.S.)
      (suddenly)
    Hey, hey -- There's a rent.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - BACK TO SCENE - NIGHT

          VIVIAN
    He's not gonna want us.

  The Ferrari goes by and stops.

          EDWARD
      (calls out to Vivian)
    Excuse me.

          KIT
      (excited)
    Don't take less than a hundred.
    You look hot tonight.  And
    remember, don't mouth off.  They
    don't like that.

          VIVIAN
    Okay.  Go home.  But take it easy
    on that shit.

  Kit gives Vivian a quick hug.

          KIT
    You're the greatest.  I'll wait
    up for you.

  And then Kit is off, moving quickly away.  Vivian turns.  She
  stares at the Ferrari, loathing it and all it represents.  And
  then it's as if Vivian turns a switch.  She fluffs her mane of
  hair, throws her shoulders back, thrusting her breasts out and
  sashays towards the car, a sexy, friendly smile on her face.

  In the driver's seat of the Ferrari, Edward is looking furious
  and distracted.  Vivian leans over the passenger window.

          VIVIAN
    Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?

          EDWARD
    What's that?

          VIVIAN
    You looking' for some company?

          EDWARD
    Uh, no.  How do I get to Beverly
    Hills?

          VIVIAN
    What?
      (dropping the come on)
    You gonna tell me you're lost?

          EDWARD
    Yes.

          VIVIAN
    Great.  What do I look like a
    tourguide?

  Edward takes a good look at her.

          EDWARD
      (a beat)
    No, you look like a hooker.

          VIVIAN
    Actually, I'm a movie star out
    for a walk.

          EDWARD
    Good.  Can you tell me how to
    get to Beverly Hills?

          VIVIAN
    Sure.  For five bucks.

          EDWARD
    That's ridiculous.

          VIVIAN
    The price just went up to ten.

          EDWARD
    Why don't you just do it out of
    the kindness of your heart?

          VIVIAN
      (sweetly)
    Sit... and spin.

          EDWARD
    Sit-and-spin.
      (amused)
    Alright... why not?

  He pulls out his money clip.

  Vivian suddenly freezes.  On the sidewalk up ahead, Carlos and
  Skateboard.  Carlos flashes an evil, menacing grin.  He motions
  to Skateboard, they start forward.

          EDWARD
      (holding up a bill)
    You have change for a twenty.

  Vivian pulls open the door of the car and jumps in.

          VIVIAN
    For twenty, Ill show you
    personal.  Drive.

  Edward stares at her.  She smiles sweetly.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Make a "U-ee".  Beverly Hills
    is the other way.

  The Ferrari pulls away, passing Carlos on the sidewalk.

  INT. FERRARI - MOVING - NIGHT

          VIVIAN
    Nice car.  Yours?

          EDWARD
      (as he grinds the
       gears; wincing)
    No.

          VIVIAN
    Stolen?

          EDWARD
    Not exactly.

  He smiles.  Vivian smiles back.

          VIVIAN
    Mind if I turn on some heat?

          EDWARD
    If you can figure it out, be my
    guest.

  Vivian reaches out, turns on the heat.

          EDWARD
    Very good.  You're obviously
    mechanical.

          VIVIAN
      (laughs)
    You're not from L.A., huh?

          EDWARD
    New York.

          VIVIAN
    What motel you staying at?

          EDWARD
    Hotel.

          VIVIAN
    Okay, what hotel?

          EDWARD
    Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet
    you know it.

          VIVIAN
      (annoyed at his tone)
    Yeah, I peed in the fountain there
    once.  Give me a break.

  Edward glances over, amused.  It hits him that she really is
  an attractive girl.

          EDWARD
    What's your name?

          VIVIAN
    What do you want it to be?
      (a beat)
    Vivian, my name's Vivian.

          EDWARD
    You like being a hooker, Vivian?

          VIVIAN
    It pays.

          EDWARD
    So do day jobs.

          VIVIAN
      (sarcastic)
    Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.
      (a beat)
    Turn right.

  EXT. SANTA MONICA BLVD. - NIGHT

  The Ferrari glides along a seedy, West Hollywood section of
  Santa Monica.

  INT. FERRARI - MOVING - NIGHT

          EDWARD
    Must be dangerous.  Hooking.

          VIVIAN
    Tell me about it.  L.A. is
    suffering from a wacko epidemic.
    And who knows where half the guys
    I pick up have been.  I mean, I
    use condoms.  Always.  And I get
    checked out once a month at the
    free clinic.  Not only am I better
    in the sack than an amateur, I'm
    probably safer.

          EDWARD
    Very good.  You ought to have
    that printed up on your business
    card.

          VIVIAN
      (a moment)
    If you're making fun of me, I
    don't like it.

          EDWARD
    Sorry.  If I did, I didn't mean
    to.

  Vivian unconsciously bites her fingernails.

          EDWARD
    Ugly habit, biting your nails.

          VIVIAN
    You don't know habits, you think
    this is ugly.

  But she puts her hands in her lap.  She looks out the window.
  She's safe from Carlos.

          VIVIAN
    Okay, pull over.  Let me out.
    I've got to get back to work.

  Edward pulls the Ferrari to the curb and stops.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Stay on this street and you'll
    hit Beverly Hills.

          EDWARD
    What do you charge for company,
    Vivian?

          VIVIAN
    Company would cost you... a
    hundred dollars.

          EDWARD
    For the whole night?

          VIVIAN
    For an hour.

          EDWARD
    You're joking.

          VIVIAN
    I never joke about money.

          EDWARD
    Neither do I.
      (a moment; amused)
    A hundred bucks an hour though.
    That's pretty stiff.

  She reaches across the seat.  Her hand goes in his lap.

          VIVIAN
    No, but it's getting there.

          EDWARD
    Vivian, how much to put up with
    me for the entire night?

          VIVIAN
    You couldn't afford it.

  Vivian starts to get out of the car.

          EDWARD
    Try me.

  A moment.  Vivian's sexy smile comes on.

          VIVIAN
    Three hundred.

          EDWARD
    Fine.

          VIVIAN
    What's your name, lover.

          EDWARD
    Edward.  My name is Edward.

          VIVIAN
    Edward... you got it!

  Edward gets out of the car.  Vivian looks at him confused.

          EDWARD
    Get in.  This side.

          VIVIAN
    What?

          EDWARD
    You know how to drive a stick?

  Vivian moves around the car.

          VIVIAN
    Better believe it.

          EDWARD
    Then let's go.  It's worth 300
    just so I don't have to drive.

  They get in the car.

  INT. FERRARI - NIGHT

  She starts the car, revs it.

          VIVIAN
    Here we go Edward.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - NIGHT

  The Ferrari peels out, fishtails madly and SCREAMS up the
  street.

  EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - NIGHT

  Thousands of tiny white lights sparkle along the walls of the
  Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel.  Bright flags are illuminated
  by carefully placed spotlights.  The Ferrari SCREAMS into the
  driveway and comes to a jarring stop by the front door.

  INT. FERRARI - NIGHT

  Edward takes a moment to get his breath.  He gestures toward
  the back.

          EDWARD
    My raincoat's in the back.  Put
    it on.

          VIVIAN
    Why?

          EDWARD
    You may feel more comfortable.
    This is not the kind of place that
    rents rooms by the hour.

          VIVIAN
    You mean they don't have hookers.

          EDWARD
    Every place has hookers, but if
    this hotel has hookers, they don't
    look like they're...

          VIVIAN
    Off the boulevard.

          EDWARD
    Exactly.

  INT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

  As they walk in, Vivian is tying the trenchcoat.

          VIVIAN
    Great.  Now I took like a hooker
    in a trenchcoat.

  She looks up.  She stops in her tracks.  The lobby is bright
  and spacious, filled with thick carved wood paneling.  Even at
  this hour there is a great deal of activity.  MEN in business
  suits and WOMEN in furs and jewels are passing by.  Vivian's
  face quickly conceals the sudden awe she feels at the sight of
  all this luxury.  Vivian matter of factly reaches out and takes
  Edward's arm.

          VIVIAN
    So let's go.

  Edward guides them across the lobby.  They reach the elevators
  and go inside.

  INT. HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

  The young ELEVATOR OPERATOR is dressed in a clean red uniform
  that seems just a bit too tight.  As the elevator doors close
  he nods toward Edward.

          OPERATOR
    Evening, sir.

          EDWARD
    Good evening.  Penthouse.

          VIVIAN
    Penthouse.  My, my.

  She sees the operator glancing at her.

          VIVIAN
    The penthouse.  And step on it.

  INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

  Edward and Vivian come out of the elevator into a hallway
  leading to a single doorway with two heavy wood doors.  Edward
  pulls out his key and unlocks the doors.  With a gentle push
  the door slide open in unison.  Edward gestures to Vivian to
  go inside.  She does.  Edward closes the doors behind her.

  INT. HOTEL - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

  As Vivian steps into the room she has the sensation of falling
  off the top of the building.  In front of her is a sunken living
  room with massive windows revealing the sparkling lights of the
  city below.  For the first time, she is speechless.  Edward
  closes the door and walks past her down the steps to the living
  room.  Edward picks up a phone.  Vivian checks out the room.

          EDWARD
      (into the phone)
    Room service.
      (to Vivian)
    What do you drink?

          VIVIAN
    Diet coke.

          EDWARD
      (into the phone)
    Send up a bottle of Crystal
    champagne.

          VIVIAN
    Can I have some chips?

          EDWARD
      (into the phone)
    -- and a bowl of strawberries.
    Thank you.

  Vivian makes her way down the steps to the living room.  She
  stares at the view.

          EDWARD
      (to Vivian)
    Impressed?

  Vivian is impressed but she's not going to admit it.

          VIVIAN
    You kidding?  I come here all the
    time.  As a matter of fact they
    do rent this room by the hour.

  Edward smiles.  He sits down in a comfortable chair and leans
  back.  Vivian looks at him.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Well, now that you have me for
    the night, what are you going to
    do with me?

          EDWARD
    Want to know something?  I don't
    quite know.  I hadn't planned
    this.

          VIVIAN
    Do you plan everything?

          EDWARD
      (a small smile)
    Always.

          VIVIAN
    Well, the meter's running, it's
    your money.  Speaking of which,
    cash'll do.  In advance.

          EDWARD
    Fair enough.

  He rises.  Takes out his wallet.  Standing over her, he drops
  THREE crisp, new hundred dollar bills in Vivian's lap.  She
  picks up the bills, stares at them, trying not to be impressed.
  She puts the money in her jacket.  She realizes Edward is
  standing over her as if waiting.

  She leans forward, reaches out to unzip his pants.  He abruptly
  turns away.

          EDWARD
    Let's talk some more first.

          VIVIAN
    Right.
      (brightly)
    So!  In town on business?

          EDWARD
      (taking off his jacket)
    Uh-huh.

          VIVIAN
    Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.

          EDWARD
      (loosening his tie)
    And why do you say that?

          VIVIAN
      (a small smile)
    I dunno... you have that sharp,
    useless look.

  Edward almost smiles.  He sits across from her again.

          EDWARD
    Sounds like you've known a lot
    of lawyers.

          VIVIAN
    I've known a lot of everybody.

  A chime goes off to indicate there's someone at the door.

          EDWARD
    Champagne.

  He starts to sit up.  Vivian motions for him to stay put.

          VIVIAN
    Hey.  I might as well make myself
    useful.

  Edward sits back down.  Vivian waltzes up the steps and opens
  the front door.  A WAITER comes into the room with a silver
  cart; on it is a bucket of champagne and a covered bowl.

          WAITER
    Where would you like it?

          VIVIAN
    Where would we like it?

          EDWARD
    Where would we like it?  Here'll
    be fine.

  The Waiter carries it down the steps and sets it in the middle
  of the living room.  He turns and heads back up the stairs and
  pauses near Vivian, staring.  Vivian stares back at him.

          VIVIAN
    What are you looking at?

  The Waiter glances away uncomfortably and exits.  Vivian closes
  the door behind him.  Vivian marches back down the stairs.

          EDWARD
    I think he wanted you to tip him.

          VIVIAN
    Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think
    he had change for a hundred.

  Edward crosses to the silver stand.  Vivian watches with
  interest as he twirls the champagne bottle in the ice bucket.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    You have a wife?  Girlfriend?

          EDWARD
    I have both.

  Edward lifts the bottle out.  He deftly pops the cork on the
  bottle without losing a drop of champagne.

          VIVIAN
    Where are they?  Shopping
    together?

          EDWARD
    They should be.  They're both good
    at it.

  Edward pours the champagne into a single long stemmed glass and
  hands one to Vivian.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    My ex-wife lives in London in what
    used to be my home.
    My girlfriend is in New York
    moving out of my apartment even
    as we speak.  Cheers.

  He drinks, nods approvingly.

          EDWARD
    It's a very good year.

          VIVIAN
    Oooh, thank god.

  Edward laughs softly.  She sips it.  To her surprise, really
  likes it.  Edward lifts a lid on a silver bowl to reveal a dozen
  enormous strawberries.

          EDWARD
    Try a strawberry.

          VIVIAN
    Why?

          EDWARD
    Because they bring out the flavor
    of the champagne.

          VIVIAN
    Jesus, you act like you're
    seducing some Valley girl you
    picked up in a dance club.

          EDWARD
    Vivian... the meter's running...
    cooperate.

  A moment.  She slowly eats a strawberry.  The juice of it stains
  her lips.  Her eyes are like smoke as she takes a sensuous sip
  of champagne, licks away the stain of the strawberry.  His eyes
  haven't left her.

          EDWARD
      (softly)
    You really are a very beautiful
    girl.

          VIVIAN
      (husky-voiced)
    Just a romantic, that's you.

          EDWARD
    Yes...

  Her mouth is so wet and inviting... he leans closer...

          VIVIAN
    Me too.

  He's about to kiss her...

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Not on the lips.

  He freezes.  She pulls his head down to her breast.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Edward and Vivian on the bed.  He is on his back, his shoulder
  and head resting against the headboard.  She is astride him,
  hands resting on his chest, rocking... in control, confident...
  very much liking the fire she's kindled in his eyes.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - CLOSE ANGLE ON THEIR FACES - NIGHT

          EDWARD
      (touching her breasts)
    What do you like?

          VIVIAN
    If I want you to turn me on I'll
    pay you three hundred.  Just lay
    back and let me drive.

  Smiling, Vivian reaches behind her, touching him.  He tries not
  to groan.  She's moving faster now.  Edward suddenly pulls her
  violently to him, he rolls her over...

  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - SHOWER - NIGHT

  A heavy spray of water comes down upon Edward.  He stands there
  quietly letting it wash over him.  He turns off the shower,
  steps out of the stall, picks up a towel and dries himself.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Edward stares.  His expensive clothes are on the floor,
  haphazardly dropped everywhere.  Vivian's clothes, as tattered
  as they are, are neatly folded and piled on a chair.  The
  incongruity of it touches Edward in a sad way.  He looks toward
  the bed.  Vivian is fast asleep.  Her heavy makeup has long since
  been rubbed off.  Asleep, her wary, smart-ass attitude is gone.

  She looks like a sweet, gentle girl.  He stares at her a moment
  longer.  He turns, goes into the living room.  Vivian opens her
  eyes.  Through the open door she sees Edward sitting in a living
  room chair.  He is reading contracts.

  EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - MORNING

  The sun is coming up as HOTEL EMPLOYEE hoses down the sidewalk
  in front of the hotel.

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - MORNING

  A WOMAN EMPLOYEE is vacuuming the lobby.  She sees something
  and pauses.  She pulls a dead leaf from one of the potted
  plants.

  INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - MORNING

  The elevator doors open and A WAITER rolls a cart out into the
  hallway.  He takes it to the doors of the penthouse.  He rings
  the bell.

          EDWARD (O.S.)
    It's open.

  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING

  The Waiter wheels in a table of food, coffee, champagne and
  orange juice.  Edward dressed in suit pants, white shirt and
  suspenders, stands in the living room talking into a cordless
  phone.  Edward points the Waiter to the dining table.

          EDWARD
      (into the phone)
    Sorry.  Go ahead.

  INT. STUCKEY'S HOUSE - MORNING - INTERCUT

  William Stuckey is behind his desk.

          STUCKEY
    Kross knows we're after his
    company.  He wants to talk with
    you.  I don't think you should.

  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MORNING

  The Waiter returns.  Edward signs the bill.  The Waiter exits.

          EDWARD
    I want to.

          STUCKEY
    Edward, if the three of us sit
    down together we might as well
    announce our plans in the Wall
    Street Journal.

          EDWARD
    I'll see him alone.  Everyone
    knows you're my muscle.  We'll
    make it social.  Tell Kross I'll
    meet him for dinner.  Tonight if
    you can arrange it.

          STUCKEY
    You shouldn't go alone.  He might
    claim that you tried to black mail
    him.

          EDWARD
    Bill, we're businessmen, not the
    damn mafia.  I'll see you in the
    office.  By the way, about your
    car...

          STUCKEY
    Oh, god, what?

          EDWARD
      (smiling)
    I'll bring it back.

  Edward hangs up.  He pours a glass of orange juice and takes
  a sip, thinking.  Something makes him turn.  Vivian, wearing
  a monogrammed hotel terry robe, is standing uncertainly in the
  bedroom doorway.

          EDWARD
    Good morning.

          VIVIAN
    You didn't wake me.  I'll be out
    of here in a minute.

          EDWARD
    No hurry.  Would you like some
    breakfast?

  She's hungry and the breakfast looks great.

          VIVIAN
    Only if you do.

  Edward sits.  Waits.  Vivian sits across from him.  Edward
  serves them breakfast.

          EDWARD
    Did you sleep well?

          VIVIAN
    Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where
    I was.

          EDWARD
    Occupational hazard?

  She looks at him sharply, sees that he means no offense,
  relaxes.

          VIVIAN
    Where'd you go?

          EDWARD
    I took the couch.  I had some work
    to do.
      (hesitating)
    About last night...

          VIVIAN
    Oooh, Baby, you were the best.
    I was beside myself.

          EDWARD
    Mmm, I could tell.

          VIVIAN
    I just hope it was worth three
    hundred bucks.

          EDWARD
    I'd say you give a good dollar
    value.

  They share a small smile.  They eat.

          EDWARD
    Do you ever... enjoy it?

          VIVIAN
    I like guys if that's what you're
    asking.  Not that I trust'm.

          EDWARD
    No?  Why's that?

          VIVIAN
    "Occupational hazard".

  A moment.  Edward chuckles.  Vivian grins.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    what do you do anyway?

          EDWARD
    I buy companies.

          VIVIAN
    No shit.  They expensive?

  He almost smiles.  She almost smiles back.

          EDWARD
    The one I'm buying this week will
    cost around 150 million.

          VIVIAN
    ... dollars?

  He nods.  This time Vivian is impressed.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    You are major league, baby.  Your
    mother must be very proud.

  Edward is oddly pleased at her reaction.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY

  The closet door is open.  Edward reaches for a tie.  In the
  closet are about a dozen expensive looking suits, shirts, shoes,
  etc.  She follows him in.

          VIVIAN
    So what a ya do with the companies
    once you buy'm?

          EDWARD
      (fumbling with the tie)
    I sell them.

          VIVIAN
    What?  Why?

  She undoes his knot and starts over.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    At ease, let me do that.  Part
    of the all night services.

          EDWARD
    By breaking up a company's assets
    --

          VIVIAN
    What are assets?

          EDWARD
    Vivian --

          VIVIAN
    C'mon, I might buy a company some
    day.

          EDWARD
    Assets are anything of value a
    company owns.  Sometimes the
    pieces are worth more than the
    whole.  By selling them off, I
    make a profit.

          VIVIAN
    Sorta like stealing cars and
    selling'm for parts, huh?

          EDWARD
    Not... quite.

          VIVIAN
    There, see?  Now the emblem is
    right in the middle of the knot.

          EDWARD
    Where'd you learn to do this?

          VIVIAN
      (sarcastic)
    I fucked the debate team in high
    school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa.
    He liked ties on Sundays.  You
    mind if I take a swim in your
    bathtub before I hit it?

          EDWARD
    Don't drown.

  Vivian turns and heads toward the bathroom.  He follows her
  into the bathroom.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

  Vivian turns on the water in the tub.  It fills the tub in a
  torrential rush.

          VIVIAN
    You could hold a pep rally in
    here!

  The phone on the marbled bathroom wall suddenly rings.  Edward
  reaches for it.

          EDWARD
      (into the phone)
    Yes.

  INT.  STUCKEY'S HOUSE - INTERCUT

  Stuckey is walking around his desk.

          STUCKEY
    Edward, it's me.  Kross is all
    set for tonight.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

  Vivian stares curiously at the bidet.

          STUCKEY
    Listen, I gotta say this again,
    I don't like you going alone.

  She turns it on.  The water hits her in the face.

          EDWARD
      (stifling a chuckle)
    I'm a big boy.

  There are lotions and shampoos and bubblebaths on the edge of
  the tub.  Vivian regards them like a kid in a candy shop.

          STUCKEY
    Let me at least get you a date.
    Keep it social.

  Edward watches as Vivian smells some bubble bath.  She smiles.
  Her eyes ask Edward if it's okay to...?  He nods.

          STUCKEY
    Edward, did you hear me?

          EDWARD
    I'm here.

          STUCKEY
    I know a lot of nice girls.

  Vivian pours the bubblebath into the swirling water.  There's
  something about the look on her face... the way she bites her
  lower lip... curious, sensual...

          EDWARD
    I have one.

  Edward hangs up the phone as Vivian curiously turns on the
  television.  The sound blares.  She fumbles to turn it down.
  Edward reaches over and turns it off.

          EDWARD
    All right.  How much for the week?

          VIVIAN
    What?

          EDWARD
    I'm in town until Saturday.

  She look at him like he isn't speaking English.

          EDWARD
    Do-you-want-to-stay-here-
    for-the-week?

  It takes Vivian a moment to respond.

          VIVIAN
    It'd cost you.

          EDWARD
    Of course.  How much?

          VIVIAN
    Five full nights... days too?

  Edward nods.  Vivian hesitates... it's got to be enough to
  really change things... She shoots for the moon again.

          VIVIAN
    Four thousand.

          EDWARD
    Vivian, may I point out five more
    nights at three hundred a night
    is only 1,500.

          VIVIAN
    But you want days too.

          EDWARD
    All right, two thousand.

          VIVIAN
    Three.

          EDWARD
    Done.

          VIVIAN
    Holy shit.

  And then, quickly getting herself back together, she flips on
  the sexy smile.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Sugar, you got it.  I will treat
    you like a prince.  Anything,
    anyway you want.

          EDWARD
    I'm not just talking about sex.

          VIVIAN
    Look butthead, I'll treat you so
    nice you'll never want to let me
    go, okay?

          EDWARD
    Three thousand for five days.
    And Vivian, I will let you go.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

  Edward comes out into the bedroom.  Vivian quickly follows.
  They move through the bedroom into the living room.

          EDWARD
    I'll be out most of the day.

  He reaches into his pocket for a money clip.  He peels off
  bills.  He hands the cash to Vivian.

          EDWARD
    I want you to go out and buy some
    decent clothes.

  Vivian's eyes go wide at the amount of money.

          EDWARD
    Nothing too flashy, not too sexy.
    Conservative.  Understand?

  INT. PENTHOUSE ENTRANCE WAY - DAY

  They're at the front door.

          VIVIAN
    Yeah, you want me to dress like
    your high class girlfriend.
    You're wasting your money though.
    All I'm gonna do is hang around
    the hotel.  As a matter of fact,
    I may never get out of that
    bathtub.

  Edward opens the door, he starts to exit.  He turns back.

          EDWARD
    Think again.  I'm taking you out
    to an important dinner with me
    tonight.

  The door closes in her face.

  INT. OUTSIDE THE PENTHOUSE DOOR - DAY

          VIVIAN (O.S.)
      (from inside)
    What?  Are you crazy?

  Edward smiles to himself.

          EDWARD
    Probably.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

  Vivian is stretched out in the hot bubble bath.  The TV is on.
  She clicks the remote control in her hand.

          VIVIAN
    Three thousand...

  She lies back into the soapy water and disappears.  She suddenly
  pops back up, laughing.

          VIVIAN
    Three thousand!

  A thought occurs to her.  She reaches for the cordless phone.
  She dials.  She waits.  She is about to disconnect when the
  phone is answered.

          KIT (O.S.)
    'Lo.

          VIVIAN
    Kit!  Where've you been?

          KIT (O.S.)
    I was asleep.  You woke me.  You
    okay?

          VIVIAN
    Kit, listen, the guy last night,
    the one in the Ferrari, I'm at
    this hotel, the Regent Beverly
    Wilshire, it's this absolutely
    unbelievable place and he's hired
    me for a whole week and Kit,
    listen, he's paying me three
    thousand bucks!  We can get out
    of the apartment.  We can get out
    of this town.  We can do anything!
      (silence)
    Kit?  Hey, you there?

          KIT (O.S.)
    Why'd he want you?

  That hurts.  Perhaps because Vivian's been wondering the same
  thing.

          VIVIAN
    He... he just does.

          KIT (O.S.)
    I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been
    on my back.
      (a beat)
    Did you get the money up front
    like I taught ya'?

          VIVIAN
    Three hundred for last night and
    he gave me extra to buy some
    clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna
    leave an envelope for you at the
    front desk.
    Give me two hundred to the scum
    bucket and the other hundred to
    that asshole landlord for part
    of the rent.  Spend it on drugs
    and I'll pull your hair out.

          KIT
    I'm getting dressed now.  I'll
    be over.  Bye.

          VIVIAN
    Hey Kit, where do I go for the
    clothes?  Good stuff on him.

          KIT (O.S.)
      (brightening)
    In Beverly Hills?

          VIVIAN
    Yeah.

          KIT (O.S.)
    Baby!  Rodeo Drive.

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

  Vivian comes out of the elevator and crosses the lobby.  She
  is back in her hooker clothes.  She leaves an envelope at the
  front desk.

  MR. THOMAS, the prim, middle-aged hotel manager, steps out from
  his office.  He stares in surprise and displeasure as he sees
  Vivian exit out the front door.  Vivian doesn't notice the odd
  stares she gets from two well-dressed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN who are
  just entering.

  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

  Vivian is looking wide-eyed and delighted and yes, more than
  a bit overwhelmed.  She passes store windows... and MORE STORE
  WINDOWS... and still MORE STORE WINDOWS.  Each display is more
  beautiful and expensive than the one before.

  Vivian is also aware that she is getting odd looks.  From
  PASSERBY'S.  Two beautiful dressed GIRLS her own age look at
  her, turn away and giggle.  The uniformed GUARDS that stand at
  attention in front of many of the stores, stare at her
  suspiciously.

  Feeling more and more uncomfortable, Vivian comes to a posh
  woman's boutique.  She hesitates for a moment.  She enters.

  INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

  Vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the
  disapproving stare of a SALESWOMAN standing behind the counter.

          SALESWOMAN
      (cooly)
    May I help you?

          VIVIAN
    I'm just looking, thanks.

  Vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with
  delicate glass objects.  She cautiously examines a dress.  The
  Saleswoman quickly comes around the counter and approaches her.

          SALESWOMAN
    Are you looking for something in
    particular?

          VIVIAN
    Yes.  Something... conservative.

          SALESWOMAN
    Yes...

  Vivian eyes the Saleswoman, puzzled at her tone.  She examines
  a dress.

          VIVIAN
    You have beautiful things.
      (no reply)
    How much is this?

          SALESWOMAN
    I don't think it would fit you.

          VIVIAN
      (beginning to get the
       drift)
    I didn't ask if it would fit.
    I asked how much it was.

          SALESWOMAN
    It's very expensive.

  Vivian's body tenses as she stares at the Saleswoman.

          VIVIAN
    What is with you?

          SALESWOMAN
      (unblinking)
    Excuse me?

          VIVIAN
    I'm going to spend money.

          SALESWOMAN
    I don't think we have anything
    for you here.  You're obviously
    in the wrong place.

  Vivian is speechless.  She turns and stomps toward the door.
  She stops and spins around staring at the Saleswoman.  Vivian
  flips her off.  She throws the door open and storms outside.
  The Saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns
  to her place.

  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

  Vivian comes out onto the street and stands, lost.  She takes
  a deep breath, trying to control herself.  Two WOMEN, in elegant
  designer outfits, stroll by, eyeing Vivian as if she were a
  freak.  Vivian suddenly feels naked.  She turns and hurries
  away.

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

  Vivian enters the lobby, upset, nervous and paranoid.  She feels
  an emptiness in her stomach at the sight of all the luxury
  around her.  She hurries toward the elevators.

  At the front desk, Mr. Thomas, once again spots her.  He crosses
  the lobby and deftly cuts her off from the elevator.

          MR. THOMAS
    May I help you Miss?

  Vivian stops, practically shaking with terror.

          VIVIAN
    I'm just going to my room.

          MR. THOMAS
    You're a guest here?

          VIVIAN
    I'm -- I'm with a friend.

          MR. THOMAS
    And who is that?

          VIVIAN
    I... Edward...

  Vivian's face is filled with confusion.  She doesn't know his
  name.  The elevator doors open behind them.  She spots the
  Operator.

          VIVIAN
      (blurting it out)
    He knows me.

  Mr. Thomas turns and eyes the Operator curiously.  The Operator
  looks back at them innocently.  With a smooth gesture Mr. Thomas
  waves the Operator over.

          MR. THOMAS
    Do you know this young lady?

  The Operator nods.

          OPERATOR
    She's with Mr. Harris.

          MR. THOMAS
      (surprised)
    Mr. Harris?

          OPERATOR
    She apparently joined him last
    night.

  Mr. Thomas waves the Operator away.

          MR. THOMAS
    Why don't you come with me.  We'll
    chat for just a moment.

  He takes Vivian gently but firmly by the arm and leads her off.

  INT. HOTEL OFFICE - DAY

  In a richly furnished office, Mr. Thomas places Vivian in a
  comfortable chair and then leans against the edge of his desk.

          MR. THOMAS
    What's your name?

          VIVIAN
    Vivian.

          MR. THOMAS
    Miss Vivian... things that go
    on in other hotels don't happen
    at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

  Vivian says nothing.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    Mr. Harris, however, is a very
    special customer.  And we like
    to think of our special customers
    as friends.  As a customer, we
    would expect Mr. Harris to sign
    in any additional guests.  But
    as a friend, we're willing to
    overlook it, I'm assuming you're
    a... relative?

  Vivian finds herself nodding.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    I thought so.  You must be his...?

          VIVIAN
    Niece?

          MR. THOMAS
    Of course.  Naturally when Mr.
    Harris leaves, I won't see you
    in this hotel again.

  Vivian bites her lower lip, nods.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    Good.  We understand one another.
      (as a gentle
       afterthought:)
    I would also encourage you to
    dress in a more appropriate
    manner.

  Vivian's face screws up as she tries hard not to cry.

          VIVIAN
    That's what I was trying to do.

  She can't help it, the tears come.  Vivian pulls out the money
  Edward gave her.  She drops it on the desk.  It's a moist-
  looking wad now.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    I was trying to get some other
    clothes... but...
    they wouldn't... they made me feel
    like shit...

  She can't go on.  Mr. Thomas politely glances at the money.
  He unfolds it, smoothes it and hands it back to her.  He sighs.
  He picks up the phone.  He dials.

          MR. THOMAS
      (into the phone)
    Women's clothing.
      (beat)
    Bridget, please.

  Vivian is staring at him.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    Bridget, hello, this is Barnard
    Thomas over at the Regent Beverly
    Wilshire.  Well, thank you, that's
    flattering.  I'd like to ask a
    favor of you.  I'm going to send
    someone over.  Her name is Vivian.
    She's a guest of ours.  A very
    special guest.

  He glances at Vivian.  With those simple words, he'd made her
  feel better.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    She's from out of town and she
    needs a little help in dressing.
    Perhaps you could help her out.
    Thank you very much.  She'll be
    right over.

  He sets the phone down and smiles patronizingly at Vivian.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    There you are.  If you have any
    other problems, come ask for me
    personally.  I'm Mr. Thomas.

          VIVIAN
    Barney.

  She smiles mischievously.

  EXT. FORT OF LOS ANGELES - DAY

  A sleek corporate helicopter flies over the port.

  EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - DAY

  Edward, Vance, Stuckey and Jake walk toward the building's
  edge.  They look out over the empty shipyard as Vance describes
  it.

          VANCE
    Okay... this is the jewel in
    Kross's crown.  We can strip out
    all the heavy equipment.  Some
    of the cranes are very valuable
    overseas.  The Japanese are
    salivating for them.

          STUCKEY
    Prime industrial property
    straddling the Port of Long Beach
    and Los Angeles.  It gives me a
    hard-on.

  Edward points toward one of the edges of the shipyard.

          EDWARD
    What's that long building over
    there?

          JAKE
    Storage, I think.

          EDWARD
    Not with those smokestacks it's
    not.

          VANCE
    Let me check.

  Vance pulls out a notebook.

          JAKE
    The real estate possibilities
    are endless.  Most of the yard
    we'll just level.  I talked to
    a couple of developers, under the
    table, of course, and they said
    --

          EDWARD
    You what?

          JAKE
    I talked to some developers about
    the land.

          STUCKEY
    What kind of an idiot are you?
    You don't talk about this to
    anyone.

          JAKE
    They're close friends, they'd
    never breathe a word --

          STUCKEY
      (to Vance)
    Where did you dig this moron up?

          VANCE
    He's right, Jake, that was an
    incredibly stupid thing to do.
    It won't happen again, Edward.
    I'll pull him off the project
    immediately.

          EDWARD
    Don't bother.

          STUCKEY
    What!?

          EDWARD
    We don't have the time to bring
    someone new up to speed.
    Besides...
      (not unkindly, to Jake)
    You've already impressed everyone
    you need to, haven't you?

          JAKE
    It won't happen again, Mr. Harris.

  Vance has found what he was looking for in his notebook.

          VANCE
    This is interesting.  That
    building is storage now, but it
    used to be a smelting plant.  They
    closed it down after World War
    II.

          EDWARD
    I want our lawyers to check into
    the toxic waste licences on them
    right away.  I want to know if the
    permits are still valid and what
    kind of limits are on them.

          STUCKEY
    Jesus, yes.  It's a long shot but
    if the permits are still in
    effect, they're worth a fortune.

  He turns away.  The other follow Edward back toward the
  stairs.

          EDWARD
    What time's diner tonight?

          STUCKEY
    Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing
    his son.  Very bright kid, watch
    yourself with him.  Who's this
    girl you're taking?

          EDWARD
    No one you know.

  INT. SAKS - SECOND FLOOR - DAY

  The elevator opens and Vivian walks out and surveys the room
  nervously.  She walks toward the women's clothing section.
  BRIDGET, a large friendly woman, spots her and quickly
  approaches.

          BRIDGET
    You must be Vivian.

  Vivian nods.

          BRIDGET (cont'd)
    Let's look at you...

  She steps back, regards Vivian with a professional eye.

          BRIDGET (cont'd)
    Where are you from, dear?

          VIVIAN
      (pause)
    Georgia.

          BRIDGET
    No wonder.  For starts, you should
    know that hot pants are horrid,
    even when you do have the legs
    to carry them off.  What are your
    plans while you're in town?

          VIVIAN
    Well... I might be going out to
    dinner.

          BRIDGET
    You'll want a cocktail dress
    then.  Turn.  You have a beautiful
    figure.  A little too out in the
    open but simply lovely.  Size six?
    Do you need shoes?

          VIVIAN
    I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather
    boots go with a cocktail dress?

          BRIDGET
      (calling out)
    Philip!  We'll need shoes!

  Bridget leads Vivian towards the racks of clothes.  She pulls
  out a dress.

          BRIDGET
    Your uncle will like this.

          VIVIAN
    He's not really my uncle.

          BRIDGET
    They never are, dear.

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON

  Mr. Thomas is behind the desk.  He looks up.  Vivian is standing
  there, a happy look on her face.  She holds up a garment bag.

          VIVIAN
    I got a dress.

          MR. THOMAS
      (dryly)
    I rather hoped you'd be wearing
    it.

          VIVIAN
    I didn't want to get it messed.
    I got shoes too.  Wanna see?

          MR. THOMAS
    That's all right.  I'm sure
    they're quite lovely.

          VIVIAN
    They were real nice to me there.
    They treated me, y'know... nice.
    Thanks, Barney.

  Mr. Thomas tries not to wince at the familiarity.

          MR. THOMAS
    You're very welcome, Miss Vivian.

  She smiles at him.  He watches as Vivian turns and walks toward
  the elevator.  The provocative way her hips move just naturally
  attracts the attention of a MALE PASSERBY.  And the white gloved
  ELEVATOR MAN literally leaps to press the elevator button for
  Vivian who rewards him with a happy smile.  Mr. Thomas sighs.

  INT. PENTHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

  The phone is ringing Vivian enters.  She hurries to pick it up.

          VIVIAN
    Hello?

  The phone keeps ringing -- it has more than one line.  Vivian
  frantically punches buttons.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Hello?  What?  Hello?

  INT. STUCKEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON - INTERCUT

  Edward is in a private office.

          EDWARD
    Never answer the phone.  Ever.

          VIVIAN
    Tsk, believe me, this will be the
    last time.

          EDWARD
    Did you buy some clothes?

          VIVIAN
    I got a dress, yeah.

          EDWARD
    Just one?  Christ... I hope it's
    appropriate.

          VIVIAN
    It's very tasteful.  I think
    you'll especially like the zipper
    in the crotch.
      (silence)
    I'm -- joking.

          EDWARD
    Let's hope so.  You'll get some
    more clothes tomorrow.  I'll be
    pushed for time so meet me in the
    hotel lobby at seven forty-five
    sharp.  Got it?

          VIVIAN
    No, I don't "got it".  Even the
    farmboys back in Georgia come to
    the door when they're taking you
    on a date.

          EDWARD
    This isn't a date.

          VIVIAN
    Go by yourself then.  Where you
    taking me anyway?

          EDWARD
    The Rex.

          VIVIAN
    Any good?

          EDWARD
    I think you'll approve.

          VIVIAN
    ... all right.  I'll meet you in
    the lobby.  But only cause you're
    paying me to.

          EDWARD
    Thank you very much.

  Vivian slowly sets the phone down.  The phone rings again.
  Vivian, very carefully, punches the flashing button and picks
  it up.

          VIVIAN
    Hello?

          EDWARD
    I thought I told you not to answer
    the phone.

          VIVIAN
    Oooh!

  Edward hangs up.  He smiles to himself.

  Vivian bites her fingernails, looking nervous.  The doorbell
  RINGS.  Vivian looks up, startled.  She rises, moves to answer
  it.

  It's the Spanish MAID.  She nods politely at Vivian.

          MAID
    Housekeeping.  I come to turn
    down the bed.  5:00, I turn down
    the bed.

          VIVIAN
    What?

  The Maid points to her hotel badge, trying to explain.

          MAID
    Housekeeping.  I come to turn
    down the bed.

          VIVIAN
    Okay.

  The Maid enters.

          VIVIAN
    Is there a trick to it?

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

  The Maid turns down the bedspread.

          VIVIAN
    Is that all?  You just fold back
    the bedspread?

          MAID
    I also place las chocolates on
    the pillow.

          VIVIAN
    Oooh, I love those.

          MAID
    I leave extras, miss.

          VIVIAN
    Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich
    people so lazy they can't do this
    on their own?

  Consuelo shrugs.

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON

  Mr. Thomas is still behind the desk, working when a soft voice
  startles him.

          VIVIAN
    Barney.

  He looks up.  He sighs.  Vivian still hasn't changed.

          MR. THOMAS
    What is it, Miss Vivian?

          VIVIAN
    Edward is taking me to some fancy
    place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever
    been there?

          MR. THOMAS
    It's a bit beyond my... range,
    shall we say.

          VIVIAN
    Yeah, mine too.  Is it like,
    y'know, normal?

          MR. THOMAS
    I think you'll find it normal
    enough.

          VIVIAN
    Will I like it?

          MR. THOMAS
    You'll like it fine.

          VIVIAN
    Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're
    the best.

  She turns away.

          MR. THOMAS
    Just mind which fork you use.

  Vivian turns abruptly back, a horrified look on her face.

          VIVIAN
    Fork?

  INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

  CLOSE ANGLE - PLACESETTING

  An elegant formal placesetting complete with a myriad of
  different size forks, spoons, stacked china plates and crystal
  glassware.

  ANGLE ON MR. THOMAS AND VIVIAN

  sit across from one another at a fully set table.

          MR. THOMAS
    In fifteen minutes I can teach
    you everything you need to know
    to dine with the Queen.  First,
    as you pick up the knife you shift
    your fork to the left hand.

          VIVIAN
    But I always eat like this.

          MR. THOMAS
    Either you're European or badly
    brought up.

          VIVIAN
    Hmmm... I vonder vich.
      (giggles)

          MR. THOMAS
    Actually, some of the richest
    people I know have the worst
    manners.  Of course, Mr. Harris,
    being of old money, knows his way
    around a table.  All right now,
    pay attention please.  Salad fork.

          VIVIAN
    What if they serve soup?

          MR. THOMAS
    They will serve salad.

          VIVIAN
    But what if they serve soup?

          MR. THOMAS
    Then you use your soup spoon.

          VIVIAN
      (smiles)
    I like steak.

          MR. THOMAS
      (picking up the
       appropriate utensil)
    Then you would use your--

          VIVIAN
    Steak spoon!
      (laughs)

  Mr. Thomas swallows his exasperation.

  WE PULL BACK from their table to reveal the cavernous, empty
  banquets room, each table is set and ready for the dinner
  service.

          MR. THOMAS
    Miss Vivian --

          VIVIAN
    Maybe I'll just order a burger,
    Barney, that way I can eat with
    my hands.

          MR. THOMAS
    Miss Vivian... there's a salon
    here in the hotel.  Instead of
    worrying unnecessarily about table
    manners, why don't you just have
    your hair done instead?

          VIVIAN
    Professionally?

  INT. SALON - LATE AFTERNOON

  Vivian sits in a salon chair.  The last customer, THANE, a
  young man of about twenty with his long hair pulled back in a
  pony tail, tilts her head one way and then another, eyeing her
  professionally.

          VIVIAN
    I have a friend who has a friend
    who does Cher's wigs.

          THANE
    I hate him already.
      (a beat)
    All set?

          VIVIAN
    Yeah... what a ya say we chop
    it all off and bleach the tips.

          THANE
    Darling?  Trust me.

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

  Edward enters and looks around the lobby.  No Vivian.  Annoyed.
  Edward crosses to a house phone and picks it up.  He's about
  to dial when:

          MR. THOMAS
    Good evening, Mr. Harris.

  Edward looks at him blankly.

          MR. THOMAS
    Barnard Thomas, manager of the
    hotel.

          EDWARD
    Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse
    me just a moment --

          MR. THOMAS
    I have a message for you from your
    "niece", sir.

          EDWARD
    My what?

          MR. THOMAS
    The young lady staying in your
    room?

  Edward's eyes narrow.  He hangs up the phone.

          EDWARD
    I think we both know she's not
    my niece.

  Mr. Thomas looks uncomfortable.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    Does this hotel have any problem
    with that?

          MR. THOMAS
    Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is
    a guest of ours and shall be
    treated accordingly.  The young
    lady asked me to tell you that
    she is waiting for you in the
    lounge.

          EDWARD
    Thank you.

  He starts towards the lounge.

          MR. THOMAS
    Very intriguing young woman, Miss
    Vivian.

  His tone stops Edward in his tracks.

          MR. THOMAS (cont'd)
    Have a good evening, sir.

  And off he goes, leaving Edward to wonder what the hell
  transpired during the afternoon.

  INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT

  Edward enters the lounge.  He looks around, not seeing Vivian.
  And suddenly his eyes go back to... the beautiful girl with the
  beautifully styled hair in the beautiful black cocktail dress
  at the piano bar.  Edward tries to hide his surprise as Vivian
  rises, moves elegantly towards him.  She smiles.

          VIVIAN
    You're late.

  Such a beautiful woman deserves an apology and so, without
  thinking:

          EDWARD
    I'm sorry.

          VIVIAN
    You're forgiven.

  She waits expectantly.  He holds out an arm.  She takes it.

  INT. REX RESTAURANT - NIGHT

  Vivian comes out of the ladies room.  She walks forward past
  the MAITRE'D'S station.  She stops.  She takes a breath... and
  then walks forward.

  INT. REX - ANOTHER ANGLE - LOOKING DOWN

  Vivian moves down a marble starircase, through the elegant
  restaurant toward a far table.  Her beauty and natural grace
  draw approving stares.  She is like a queen moving through a
  ballroom.

  At a secluded table, Edward sits in conversation with two men.
  JAMES KROSS, in his early 70's, a bulky self-made millionaire
  industrialist.  Sitting next to him is his son and second in
  command, DAVID KROSS, a handsome man in his early thirties.
  All of them rise as Vivian comes to the table.  David Kross
  holds out Vivian's chair for her.  Surprised, she nods her
  thanks.  In front of her is an enormous placesetting.  She
  smiles down at the utensils, filled with confidence.

  Waiters have placed a delicate salad down in front of each of
  them.  Vivian proudly reaches for her salad fork.  But then she
  sees that Kross has picked up the fork closest to his plate and
  is digging into his salad with that.

  Vivian looks to see what Edward will do.  He doesn't seem
  interested in eating yet.  Neither does David Kross.  Feeling
  a sudden panic, Vivian puts her fork down.

          KROSS
    So young man, I understand you
    are trying to take over my
    company.

  A moment.  The abruptness of the question takes Edward back for
  a moment.  But then he almost smiles.

          EDWARD
    Please don't patronize me, Mr.
    Kross.  Our ages mean nothing
    here.

  Kross and David look at each other.

          DAVID
    Mr. Harris, we know you've
    purchased at least twenty percent
    of our stock.  We also know you
    plan to file a formal bid for a
    majority share.

          EDWARD
    Twenty-five percent.

          KROSS
    Mr. Harris, I built Kross
    Enterprises myself.  I know every
    man who ever worked there by his
    first name.  I know their wives...
    and their children.  If your
    intention is to take over my
    company and turn it into a
    glorified real estate deal, think
    again.

  Edward, thankfully, now reaches for his salad fork and begins
  to eat.  Relieved, Vivian picks up hers.  They all eat for a
  moment.

          EDWARD
    What do you suggest, Mr. Kross?

  WAITERS approach, some to clear the salad plates, some to put
  down the next course.  Vivian, thinking she's got to finish,
  quickly stuffs her mouth with the rest of her salad.  She is
  reluctant to let the Waiter take her fork.

          KROSS
    What would it take to buy our
    stock back?  Name your price.

          EDWARD
    To get me in a mood to sell --
    double what I paid.  But your
    company doesn't have enough
    capital right now to buy anything.

          DAVID
    We're on the verge of closing
    a large navy contract.  Double
    is ridiculous but we can assure
    you a healthy profit on your
    shares.  We would give you a
    promissory note...

          EDWARD
    You're not getting any navy
    contracts.

  Vivian can see that both father and son are stunned by this
  news.

          DAVID
    There's no way you could know
    that.

          EDWARD
    But I do know.  I also know your
    lines of credit are over-extended.
    If I don't buy your company,
    someone else will...
      (looking up)
    Ah, the escargot.

  Escargot are put down in front of everyone.  Vivian stares at
  them dubiously.  She picks up what she assumes is the next
  "right" fork.  She picks up a snail.  The two do not fit.
  Flustered, she doesn't know what to do.  No one else seems to
  be eating.  And now a Waiter comes and places escargot forks
  at each place.  Vivian picks it up with a sigh of relief.

          VIVIAN
      (softly, to the Waiter)
    Scume me, what are these things?

          WAITER
      (bending to whisper)
    Escargot, mademoiselle.

          EDWARD
      (leaning close to
       whisper)
    Snails.

  Vivian stares at them, horrified.  She, like James and David
  Kross, no longer seem interested in eating.  Edward eats with
  pleasure.

          EDWARD
    Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell
    you my stock.  On the contrary,
    I'm here to buy yours.

          KROSS
      (angry)
    You've got a lot of nerve.

          EDWARD
    No.  What I have is a lot of
    money.

          KROSS
    I know all about you, Mr. Harris.
    When you buy companies, they have
    a way of disappearing.  Even the
    pension funds are stripped clean.
    The last three companies you took
    over were cut up in so many
    pieces, widows were left without
    their retirement checks.

          EDWARD
      (calmly)
    What I did with those companies
    was perfectly legal.

          KROSS
    I don't question the legality
    of what you do.  It's your
    morality that makes me sick.  I
    will not allow my company to be
    raped by a man like you.

          EDWARD
      (angry now)
    It is not your company.  It's a
    public company.  And I am going
    to acquire it.  Either I buy from
    the other stock holders, or I buy
    from you.

  Vivian struggles with her escargot.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    I would suggest that you and your
    board cooperate with me, rather
    than fight a battle you don't have
    the ammunition to win.

  Vivian suddenly ZINGS her snail across the table.  Everyone
  looks to her.

          VIVIAN
    Slippery little suckers...

  Kross rises.

          KROSS
    If you'll excuse me young lady,
    Mr. Harris...
      (turns to David)
    Deal with this, David, you know
    where we stand.  I need to go
    someplace and puke.

  He rises.  He exits.

          DAVID
      (to Edward and Vivian)
    Men like my father built this
    country.  He was no saint.  He
    screwed people.  But for every
    guy he stepped on, he gave a
    hundred a good job.

  Edward is silent.

          VIVIAN
    He seems like a nice man.

  David looks at Vivian as if seeing her for the first time.

          EDWARD
    We can reach an understanding on
    this.

          DAVID
    I don't think so.  You should
    know we're going to fight you with
    every resource we have.

          EDWARD
    Do what you have to do.  I don't
    take it personally.

          DAVID
    I do.  I take it all very
    personally.
      (to Vivian)
    Very nice meeting you, Vivian.

  David Kross gets up and leaves.  Vivian and Edward sit in
  silence.

          EDWARD
      (a beat)
    And that's the way the game is
    played.

          VIVIAN
    Some game.  Screwin' some poor
    slob out of his retirement.

  Edward says nothing.  But Vivian can see she's hit a nerve.

          VIVIAN
    Snails for dinner.  No wonder
    everybody is in such a bad mood.

  A Waiter appears at the table.

          WAITER
    Are we ready for the next course,
    sir?

          EDWARD
    No.  Bring a check, please.

  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  Edward's face is pensive and thoughtful as he stares out of
  the glass window down at the city lights.  He quickly drains
  his champagne glass.  Vivian moves to stand next to him.
  She refills his glass from the bottle.

          EDWARD
    Thank you.

  He drinks.  Silence.

          VIVIAN
    You're upset, huh?

          EDWARD
    Upset.  No.  I never get upset
    about business.

          VIVIAN
    You liked the guy, though.

          EDWARD
    Whether I liked him or not is
    irrelevant.  It's business.
    There's no emotion involved in
    business... if you want to
    survive.

          VIVIAN
      (excited)
    We're the exactly the same!  Kit
    keeps telling me don't get
    emotional when you turn tricks
    -- that's why no kissing -- it's
    too personal.
    The key is like you're saying,
    stay numb, don't get involved --
    when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot,
    I just do it.
      (realizing what she's
       saying and quickly
       recovers)
    Except with you.  At your price
    I give my all...

  Edward laughs.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Let's not talks about this heavy
    stuff.  Come on, relax.

  Vivian comes up behind him.  She begins to rub his shoulders.

          EDWARD
    That... is very good.

  A moment.  Edward is silent.  Turns him, unknots his tie,
  unbuttons his collar.

          VIVIAN
    Know what we're gonna do in a
    little while then?  We're gonna
    call Domino's and have'm deliver
    a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat
    it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out
    and watch television.

          EDWARD
    Television?

          VIVIAN
    Yeah, it's this box, it has
    pictures, sound.  You don't have
    to use your brain at all.

          EDWARD
    I have work to do.

          VIVIAN
    Uh-uh.  No work.

  Smiling, she softly kisses his throat.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    See... what you haven't figured
    out yet...

  She kissed his neck.  She fumbles with his belt.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    Is that while you're the boss
    everyplace else... I'm the one
    in charge here.

  She kisses his chest.

          VIVIAN (cont'd)
    You... just think you are.

  She starts to kneel down.  He stops her.  They stare at one
  another for a moment.  He releases her.  She smiles.  She
  starts to undress him.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

  Vivian is asleep.  She turns over, slowly waking.  Her hand
  goes out to touch Edward and encounters nothing but empty bed.
  Vivian comes awake with a sudden start.  She look around
  momentarily frightened, not sure where she is.  Sighing with
  relief, she lies back down.  She sees Edward's American Express
  card on the pillow next to her.

          EDWARD (O.S.)
    Wake up, Vivian.  Time to shop.

  Edward comes out of the bathroom and moves toward the bed.
  He is tying his tie.  Vivian sits up and ties it for him.  He
  smiles at her.

          EDWARD
    I still don't understand why you
    only bought one dress.

          VIVIAN
    I wasn't as much fun as I
    thought it was going to be.

          EDWARD
    Why not?

          VIVIAN
    Well, you know those cold bitches
    that work in those stores and try
    to intimidate you?  It works.

          EDWARD
    Was someone rude to you?

          VIVIAN
    I had a little problem in one
    store.  I wasn't dressed right.
    I don't know what to say.  I don't
    belong there.  Maybe I'll just
    go back to Bridget.  She was cool.

          EDWARD
    Vivian, you belong wherever you
    are.  I don't care how you were
    dressed, they were the ones who
    were wrong, not you.

  Edward sits on the bed.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    People aren't going to respect
    you unless you respect yourself.
      (a beat)
    The next time someone is rude to
    you, you stare at them right here.

  He softly touches her, right between the eyes.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    It's an old trick I use,
    especially with bankers.  Works
    every time.  Will you try it?

          VIVIAN
      (confidently)
    Okay.

          EDWARD
    Good.

          VIVIAN
      (a beat)
    Come with me?

  Edward looks at his watch.  Vivian covers it with her hand.

          VIVIAN
    Please.

  INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

  A beautiful, chic women's shop.  The haughty SALESGIRL
  approaches Vivian near a rack of dresses.  Edward hovers in the
  b.g.

          VIVIAN
      (nervous)
    Hello.  Can you help me?

  The Salesgirl looks Vivian up and down.  A Pause.  Vivian gives
  her "the stare" and straightens up.  We see the Salesgirl's
  reaction change.

          VIVIAN
      (confidently)
    I'm looking for a dress, nothing
    too flashy, not too sexy,
    conservative.  In a size six.

          SALESGIRL
      (uncomfortable under
       Vivian's stare)
    Do... do you have a charge
    account with us?

  Vivian smiles and draws out Edward's American Express card.
  The Salesgirl nods and quickly moves to a rack of dresses to
  find Vivian's size.

  INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY - IN A SERIES OF CUTS

  Vivian tries on different clothes under Edward and the
  Salesgirl's supervision.

  Vivian comes happily out of the dressing room wearing a low
  cut, spangled and fringed outfit.  Edward shakes his hand.  The
  Salesgirl holds a classic tweed ensemble over Vivian's outfit.
  Vivian scowls.

          VIVIAN
      (sighing)
    I look like fucking Nancy Reagan.

  INT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE

  The Salesgirl shows Edward clothes by Ann Taylor.  He turns
  to find Vivian happily holding up a tiny, low cut leather dress.
  Edward shakes his head in mock disapproval.  Vivian scowls.

  INT. BOUTIQUE - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATER

  Vivian is wearing an elegant pastel dress.  Edward is standing
  at the store's bar, watching and talking on the telephone.

  INT.  STUCKEY'S OFFICE - DAY - INTERCUT WITH EDWARD

  Stuckey and Vance are pouring over stock reports, talking to
  Edward on the speaker phone.

          VANCE
    Kross came out of his corner
    swinging.  He started buying up
    all available stock as soon as
    the market opened.

          EDWARD
      (almost to himself)
    He's a tough old son of a
    bitch...

  Edward is watching Vivian.  She pulls the hem of her skirt up
  to mid thigh.  She looks hopefully over to Edward.  Edward
  shakes his head.

          VANCE
    It's up to ten and a quarter.

          EDWARD
    Offer nine and a half.  Bring
    them back down to earth.

          STUCKEY
    Goddamit!  Where is he getting
    the money to fight?

          EDWARD
    Someone's loaning it to him.
    Get on it right away.

          STUCKEY
    Our contract guys are working
    on the Kross pension funds.
    There's another forty million
    there.  We can bleed'm dry.

  There is a sudden hesitation in Edward's eyes.  He watches as
  Vivian tries on a hat.  She preens for him.  He smiles.

          EDWARD
      (to Vance & Stuckey)
    Put the pension funds on hold
    until I say otherwise.

          STUCKEY
      (surprised)
    We're letting them slide?

          EDWARD
    I want the treatment plant
    licenses to be top priority right
    now.

          STUCKEY
    But, Edward...

          EDWARD
    Do it.

  Edward hangs up and takes a long look at Vivian.  She moves
  to him.

          EDWARD
      (looks at his watch)
    You're on your own now, Vivian.
    I've got to get to work.  Be
    sensible and you can keep
    everything.  Spend too much and
    it all goes back.

  Vivian hugs him again.

  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

  Vivian walks along Rodeo Drive.  She looks lovely in the pink
  dress and new, white shoes.  A pretty, white hat is the final
  touch.  She carries a bag containing her old clothes.  She stops
  at a trashcan and ceremonially throws the offending items away.

  INT. TORIE STEELE BOUTIQUE - SHOPPING MONTAGE

  We SEES Vivian in each department within the store with
  different SALESPEOPLE.  She happily and confidently tries on
  a variety of dresses, hats, shoes, accesarries, etc.

  1)  Vivian is in a dressing stall.  She tosses a dress out
  to a waiting SALESWOMAN.

          VIVIAN
    Not me!

  2)  A SALESWOMAN holds a long, purple evening gown.

          VIVIAN
      (imitating Bridget)
    Horrid!

  3)  Vivian is admiring a pair of beautiful suede dress pumps.
  Her attention is drawn to the SALESMEN'S exotic hand-painted
  tie.

          VIVIAN
    Where'd you get your tie?

  4)  Vivian stands in front of an enormous tie rack with the
  Salesman, a dozen wild, swirling designed ties are hanging over
  his outstretched arm.  Vivian picks out the brightest one and
  smiles.

  EXT. RODEO DRIVE - DAY

  Vivian's arms are filled with clothing boxes and bags.  She
  feels like she owns the block.  A well-dressed MAN passes by,
  smiling politely.  Vivian's nose lifts as she happily ignores
  him.

  Suddenly Vivian stops.  She's about to pass the shop she was
  thrown out of.  Vivian takes a breath and enters the shop.

  INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

  Vivian enters.  The moment she steps through the door, Vivian's
  courage leaves her.

  The saleswoman is waiting on a CUSTOMER.

          SALESWOMAN
      (to the customer)
    Isn't this lovely?  I think it
    would look wonderful on you.

  Vivian musters her courage.  She takes a deep breath and starts
  forward.

          SALESWOMAN
      (to her customer)
    Would you like to try it on?

          VIVIAN
    'Scume me.

  Both the saleswoman and her customer look up.  The saleswoman
  smiles pleasantly.

          SALESWOMAN
    Yes?

          VIVIAN
    Do you remember me?

          SALESWOMAN
    No, I'm sorry, I don't.

          VIVIAN
    I was in here yesterday.

  Vivian slowly raises her middle finger.  The recognition starts
  to dawn in the saleswoman's eyes.  Vivian's courage begins to
  return.

          VIVIAN
    Yeah.  That's right.  It's me.
    I want you to know something.
    You made me feel terrible. I
    wasn't dressed right and you said
    I didn't belong here.  Well, I
    do.  You're the one that was
    wrong, not me.  And I want to tell
    you something else.  I'm never
    gonna shop here again as long as
    I live.

  And with that, Vivian turns and walks out.

  The saleswoman is stunned.  A beat.  The customer thrusts the
  dress into the saleswoman's arm as if offended by Vivian's
  speech and leaves the store also.

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

  Mr. Thomas looks up from the desk.  And stares.  Vivian and a
  BELLHOP stroll through the hotel entrance and across the hotel
  lobby to the elevator.  The bellhop's arms are packed with boxes
  and shopping bags.  Mr. Thomas can't help it.  He smiles to
  himself.

  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

  Vivian opens the front door for the Bellhop who carries in her
  packages.  She motions for him to place them on the couch.  He
  does.  Vivian happily tips him with a five dollar bill.  He
  exits.  The door closes.

          VIVIAN
    Wheee!!!

  Vivian does a giddy spin and falls onto the couch.

  INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE MEETING ROOM - DAY

  Stuckey enters.  Edward is standing at the end of a long
  meeting table.  He is serving himself coffee from a tray.

          STUCKEY
      (gloating)
    You were right.  Kross mortgaged
    everything he has down to his
    grandson's college tuition to
    secure loans from a bank.  Not
    just any bank.  One we do business
    with.

  Edward just sips his coffee.

          STUCKEY (cont'd)
    It goes without saying that your
    business means a great deal more
    to them than our friend Kross's.
      (a beat)
    All you have to do is make a call.

  Edward is silent.  Stuckey is again surprised.

          STUCKEY
    Excuse me for saying this but what
    is wrong with you this week?
    First, you go soft on the pension
    funds.  Now, you're giving him
    the chance to get away?  As of
    two minutes ago, you are committed
    to the tune of over fifty million
    dollars --

          EDWARD
    Come on, Bill, don't talk to me
    about how much money's involved.
    It's my money.

          STUCKEY
    And some of it's mine.  Edward,
    his jugular's exposed.

  Edward hesitates.  Then:

          EDWARD
    Get the bank on the phone for me.

  INT. PENTHOUSE - EVENING

  Edward enters.  He closes the door.  He turns.  And stops.  A
  beautiful, candlelit, food laden table has been set up in the
  middle of the room.  Champagne and wine chills in a bucket.
  A fire burns in the fireplace.  Music is playing.

          VIVIAN (O.S.)
    Hi.

  Edward turns.  And stares again.  Vivian stands in the bedroom
  doorway.  She is wearing an exquisite silk dressing gown.  She
  looks incredibly beautiful.

          VIVIAN
    I thought maybe you'd like dinner.

          EDWARD
    Thank you.  I would.
      (he fingers her dressing
       gown)
    Nice.

          VIVIAN
    Wait till you see what I have
    on underneath.

          EDWARD
    Please.

  She opens the dressing gown.  What she has on underneath is
  absolutely nothing.  Edward crosses to her.  Taking her in his
  arms, he lifts her up and kisses her breasts.

          VIVIAN
    What about dinner?

          EDWARD
    Dinner can wait.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT

  The bathroom is lit by candles.  Vivian and Edward are in the
  marble tub.  Vivian sits behind Edward.  She lazily washes his
  shoulders and back with a large sponge.

          VIVIAN
    You always been rich?

          EDWARD
    No.

          VIVIAN
    Seems like it.  I guess it's easy
    to get used to, huh?

          EDWARD
    Easier than learning how to be
    poor.
      (a moment; and then:)
    My father's family was wealthy.
    When I was young there were cars
    and houses, private schools,
    nannies.  But then my father
    divorced my mother to marry
    another woman.  And he took his
    money with him.

  Silence.

          VIVIAN
    Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.

          EDWARD
    Not much to tell.  I went to
    public school.  Went to
    university on scholarship.  Went
    to work for an investment firm.
    In eight years I owned it.
      (and then; growing very
       quiet)
    My father was chairman of the
    board of the third company I ever
    went after.  I swallowed that
    company and shit out the pieces.
    One of the pieces was him.

  Vivian softly traces small patterns on Edward's shoulders with
  a finger.

          VIVIAN
    You still mad at'm?

          EDWARD
    He died a long time ago.

  She gently rests her head on his back.

  EXT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

  PANNING BELLIES  People are sunbathing by the pool.
  Overweight... lobster red... old and stretch-marked... fishy
  white... and then gorgeous.  The gorgeous is Vivian.  She is
  wearing a miniscule bikini and sunglasses.

          WAITER (O.S.)
    Miss Vivian?

  She looks up.  A young WAITER, looking a little dry-mouthed at
  the sight of her, is holding a telephone.

          WAITER
    You have a call.  Mr. Harris.

          VIVIAN
      (taking the phone)
    Hi, baby.
      (a moment)
    I'll be ready.  Bye.

  She hangs up.  She looks at the Waiter, confused.

          VIVIAN
    What do you wear to polo?

  EXT. THE LOS ANGELES EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON

  Horses and riders crash and careen on the playing field.  An
  enthusiastic crowd cheers.

  DOWN OFF THE EDGE OF THE FIELD

  a tailgate party using Cadillacs and Rolls Royces is in
  progress.  Horses and riders thunder by a crowd of very
  well-dressed, successful-looking people -- celebrities, execs,
  socialites, aficionados -- most of whom ignore the game.  They
  are there to see and be seen much more than to watch a polo
  match.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATER AFTERNOON

  Vivian and Edward make their way towards the party.  Edward is
  wearing his new tie.  Vivian is looking very chic and beautiful
  in one of her new outfits.  Not that it's helping -- the place,
  the people, the wealth -- everything here suddenly has her
  overwhelmed.  She suddenly stops.

          VIVIAN
    You're really pushing it,
    bringing me here.

          EDWARD
    I think it's exciting.

          VIVIAN
    What id we run into someone I
    know?

          EDWARD
    I really doubt anyone here
    frequents Hollywood Boulevard.

          VIVIAN
    You did.

  A VOICE calls out.

          STUCKEY (O.S.)
    Edward!

  They turn.  William Stuckey is with a group of people.  He waves
  them over.

          STUCKEY (cont'd)
    Come on!  Over here!

  Edward takes Vivian's arm and leads her forward.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON

  Stuckey grins and shakes Edward's hand.

          STUCKEY
      (looking at Vivian)
    Well, well, well...

  Vivian dislikes this guy on sight.  Dislikes the frosty looking
  woman at his side.

          EDWARD
    Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.

          STUCKEY
      (holding out a hand;
       smiling)
    Bill Stuckey, Vivian.  My wife,
    Elizabeth.

          VIVIAN
    Hi.

  Elizabeth Stuckey stretches her thin lips in a cold smile.

          STUCKEY
    Lots of fun people here.  Let me
    get you two some champagne.

  He moves quickly away.

          ELIZABETH STUCKEY
    Excuse me.

  She moves to greet someone else.  Vivian and Edward survey the
  milling CROWD.

          VIVIAN
      (sarcastic)
    Real genuine guy.

          EDWARD
    He's good at what he does.

          VIVIAN
    You could freeze ice on his wife's
    ass.  She anything like your ex?

          EDWARD
      (a small smile)
    Shall we mingle?

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ON THE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

  A goal is scored.

  IN A SERIES OF CUTS

  Edward watches and guides her, Vivian sips champagne and meets
  and chats and wins over different PEOPLE.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON

  A group of PEOPLE.

          WOMAN
    I simply love your dress, Vivian.

          VIVIAN
    This old thing?

          WOMAN
    Of course, a figure like yours
    can wear anything.  You must work
    out constantly.

          VIVIAN
    I lead a very physical life.

          OLDER MAN
    Are you into running, Vivian?

          VIVIAN
    I'm into walking.  I walk a lot.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON

  In another group of PEOPLE.

          ANOTHER MAN
    You look awfully familiar, Vivian.
    Haven't we run into one another
    at the spa in La Costa?

          VIVIAN
    Well, I do often spa there.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON

  Edward and Elizabeth Stuckey watch Vivian laugh and chat with
  a group of WOMEN.

          ELIZABETH STUCKEY
    Edward, she's marvelous.  Warm
    and witty and down to earth.

          EDWARD
      (with pleasure)
    She is, isn't she.

          ELIZABETH STUCKEY
    So unlike your usuals.  Where on
    earth did you find her?

  Edward smiles enigmatically.  Taking an hors d'oeuvres off a
  passing WAITERS's tray, he starts forward.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON

          A WOMAN
    We're good together.  He has to
    admit it.  I've been just what
    he wants me to be.  I say the
    right things, I know the right
    people, I give wonderful parties.
    No question, no arguments, no
    embarrassments.  It works for both
    of us.

  That makes Vivian think.  And then she smiles as she sees Edward
  approaching.  Vivian moves to him.

          VIVIAN
    Edward, these women here, I don't
    think any of'm like the guys
    they're with.  They're just into
    it for the money.

          EDWARD
    I'm sure that's true for some of
    them.

          VIVIAN
    I thought I was the pro.  These
    women make me feel like an
    amateur.

          EDWARD
      (a beat)
    Ready to stomp sod?

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ON THE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

  IN A SERIES OF SHOTS TO MUSIC

  The CROWD engages in sod stomping.  They drink champagne.  They
  make a dance out of it.  They laugh.  Shoes get stuck in the
  mud.  It's ludicrous -- these people in their suits and fancy
  clothes, replacing divots and stepping over the horse shit.
  In a corner of the field, grazing horses stare, seemingly in
  disbelief.

  Vivian is having a wonderful time.  And then, as she moves
  towards the outside of the crowd she sees someone staring at
  her from over among some of the riders and grazing horses.
  David Kross smiles at Vivian.  She hesitates... and then she
  crosses towards him.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON

          DAVID KROSS
    Hi.

          VIVIAN
    Hi.  I never thought stomping
    in grass could be so much fun.

          DAVID
      (laughs)
    I like your hat.

          VIVIAN
    Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?
      (pleased; a moment)
    Uhm... how're... business things
    going.

          DAVID
    Let's not talk about it, it's too
    depressing.  Come on, I'll show
    you Thunder.

          VIVIAN
    Please, we hardly know each other.

          DAVID
    Thunder's a horse.  Come on.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANOTHER ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON

  They approach the sweating mount.  David Kross caresses the
  horses muzzle.

          DAVID
    Hey, big guy, you getting tired,
    yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.
      (a beat; and then:)
    You two been together long?  You
    and Edward?

          VIVIAN
    No.

          DAVID
    Hope to be?

  To Vivian's surprise, the question causes a pang inside.

          VIVIAN
    It's... it's not like that.

          DAVID
    I see.  Well.  Maybe that means
    you'd have lunch with me sometime
    then.

  Vivian is suddenly silent.  She looks away.

          DAVID (cont'd)
    I'm sorry, am I being too forward?

          VIVIAN
    You don't know anything about me.

          DAVID
    I'd like to find out.  You don't
    know anything about me either.
    That's why people have lunch.

  But something holds Vivian back, a feeling.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - IN THE CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON

  William Stuckey turns... stops... stares.  He sees Vivian and
  David Kross standing together.  He stares, his mind racing, and
  anxious, angry look on his face.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON

  Stuckey has Edward off to the side.  He is talking to him in
  a low, earnest voice.

          STUCKEY
    Fill me in on this.  How'd you
    and Vivian meet?

          EDWARD
    We just did.

          STUCKEY
      (grinning)
    Come on, you can tell me.  I sure
    would like to know where a guy
    runs into a girl as attractive
    as this.

          EDWARD
    The night I left your house, I
    was lost.  I was looking for
    directions.

          STUCKEY
    And you just happened to run into
    her.  Great.  What's she do?  She
    work?

          EDWARD
    Yes...

          STUCKEY
    Doing what?

          EDWARD
    Vivian's in sales.

          STUCKEY
    Sales, really?  That's great.
    What does she sell?

  Edward's eyes narrow.

          EDWARD
    Why do you want to know?

          STUCKEY
    Hear me out.  I've known you a
    long time.  I see a difference
    in you this week.  Like that tie.
    I'm suddenly wondering if this
    girl's not the difference.
    Especially when I see her talking
    with David Kross.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN

  Vivian turns away from the bar, now holding two glasses of
  champagne.  She scans the crowd for Edward.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON EDWARD AND STUCKEY

          EDWARD
    She met him at dinner last
    night... I like this tie.

          STUCKEY
    So now they're best friends?
    Edward, this girl appears out of
    nowhere and now I see her talking
    to a guy whose company we're
    trying to buy.  It's too
    convenient.

          EDWARD
    You're being ridiculous.

          STUCKEY
    Industrial espionage is not
    ridiculous.  Edward, how do you
    know she hasn't attached herself
    to you so she can bring Kross back
    information?

          EDWARD
    Christ, Bill, she's not a spy,
    she's a hooker.  I picked her up
    off Hollywood Boulevard.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON VIVIAN

  as she hear loud sudden LAUGHTER.  She turns.  She sees that
  it's Stuckey laughing.  Smiling, Vivian starts towards them with
  two glasses of champagne.

  EXT. EQUESTRIAN CENTER - ANGLE ON STUCKEY AND EDWARD

          STUCKEY
    I swear to God, you are the only
    millionaire I ever heard of who'd
    go looking for a goddam bargain
    streetwalker!

  Edward sees Vivian coming.

          EDWARD
    Let's drop it, shall we?

  Edward turns.  He smiles gently as Vivian quietly approaches
  and hands him his glass of champagne.

  A group of BUSINESSMEN are standing a short distance away.
  One of them calls out:

          MAN
    Edward!  May we have your opinion
    on something?

          EDWARD
      (to Vivian and Stuckey)
    Excuse me a moment.

  He moves to join the group of men.  Stuckey gives Vivian a
  broad smile.

          STUCKEY
    Having a good time, Vivian?

          VIVIAN
    Yeah.  Thanks.

          STUCKEY
    All this must be quite a change
    from Hollywood Boulevard.

  Vivian looks as if she's been struck.

          VIVIAN
    What?

          STUCKEY
    It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your
    secret's safe with me.

  Stuckey runs his hand up her arm.

          STUCKEY (cont'd)
    What do you charge, Vivian?
    Maybe you and I could get together
    after Edward leaves.

          VIVIAN
      (forcing a bitter smile)
    Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me
    at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.

          STUCKEY
    I just might do that.

  He moves away.  Vivian turns.  Edward looks up from his
  conversation, sees her looking at him.  He smiles, raises his
  glass in a small toast.  A moment.  Vivian toasts him back.

  INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

  They enter.  Edward switches on a light.  Vivian comes down the
  steps into the room.  Edward follows after her.

          EDWARD
    You're awfully quiet.  You haven't
    said a word since the party.

  As Edward touches her shoulder, Vivian suddenly spins and
  explodes with anger.

          VIVIAN
    You asshole!  I can't believe what
    a --!

          EDWARD
    Vivian, what the --

  Tears well in Vivian's eyes as she yells at him.

          VIVIAN
    Clean the slut up, take her out,
    huh?!  What are you trying to
    prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat
    for you to offer to your friends!

          EDWARD
    I don't know what you're talking
    about.

          VIVIAN
    I've been with stinking old men
    who've made me want to puke but
    I've never had anyone make me feel
    as dirty as you did tonight.

          EDWARD
    Would you please calm down.  Tell
    me what happened.

          VIVIAN
    Stuckey!  He wants an
    "appointment" with me after you
    leave.  You my pimp now or did
    he think that up on his own?

  Edward looks guiltily away.

          EDWARD
    What was I supposed to do?
      (a beat)
    I told the truth.  Why should the
    truth upset you?  It's not as if
    you're from a convent.

          VIVIAN
    I want my fucking money.  I'm
    getting out of here.  I don't want
    anything more to do with you.

          EDWARD
    Can we talk about this?  Can you
    just try to calm down?

          VIVIAN
    Your goddamned friend, he thinks
    the only reason I'm with you is
    for the money.

  A tear falls from Vivian's eyes.

          VIVIAN
      (defiantly)
    Well, it's true.  Just pay me
    what you owe me and I'm gone.

          EDWARD
    Vivian...

          VIVIAN
    Pay me!  Before I pick up this
    chair and smash your face in.

          EDWARD
    Fine.  I'm only here a couple
    of more days and I'm not going
    to spend them fighting with you.

          VIVIAN
    Fuck off.

          EDWARD
    I'll call you a cab.  If you want
    the clothes, pack them up.

  Vivian stands quietly for a moment.  And then she turns and
  walks into the bedroom.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

  Vivian starts roughly picking up her clothes in the dim light
  of the bedroom.  As she does she starts crying.  With each item
  of clothing the tears come down harder.  Edward appears at the
  doorway.  His face is genuinely concerned.

          EDWARD
    Vivian... I'm sorry.  I wasn't
    prepared for questions about us.
    It was an idiotic and insensitive
    thing I did.  I should have known
    that it would hurt you.

          VIVIAN
    I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt
    you when somebody pisses on you,
    it just pissed you off.

          EDWARD
    I really am sorry.

  Vivian lets the clothes fall from her arms.  Sobbing, she stands
  limply.

          VIVIAN
    You hurt me.

  Edward goes to her and wraps his arms around her shoulders.
  She touches his hand.  He sits on the bed.  He pulls her to him
  and wraps his arms around her, holds her tight.

          EDWARD
    I'll make it up to you.

  INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY

  Edward, carrying a briefcase, moves jauntily down a long
  hallway.  Stuckey trails after him.

          STUCKEY
    This is no time to disappear.
    We're in too far.

          EDWARD
    Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross
    isn't going anywhere and I don't
    need to spend the rest of the day
    watching his stock go down.  I'll
    be in the office tomorrow.

          STUCKEY
    Promise me you'll read those
    contracts by then.

          EDWARD
    Goodbye, Bill.

  Stuckey stops.  He calls after Edward.

          STUCKEY
    Shit... By tomorrow, Edward!

  Edward hurries on.

  EXT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE - DAY

  Edward exits out of his limo and walks to the front doors.

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

  Edward smiles, moving jauntily to the elevators.  Mr. Thomas
  at the front desk notices Edward's happy mood.

          MR. THOMAS
    Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.

          EDWARD
    Afternoon.

  Edward's attention is taken by the glittering jewelry display
  in the hotel jewelry store window.  He detours from the
  elevators and moves to the window for a closer look.  He thinks
  a moment and enters the jewelry store.

  INT. PENTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

  Vivian comes out of the bedroom into the living room wearing
  an elegant red sequined evening dress.  She looks incredibly
  beautiful.  She sees the phone.  A thought occurs to her and
  going to it, she picks it up.  Waits.

          VIVIAN
    C'mon, Kit...

  No answer.  She hears someone at the door.  She hangs up.
  Edward enters.  He is carrying a small case.  He stops at the
  sight of Vivian.

          VIVIAN
    Do I look okay?

          EDWARD
      (a small smile)
    Hmm... let's see... no, there's
    something missing.

  He holds up the small case.

          VIVIAN
    What's that?

          EDWARD
    I don't want you to get too
    excited... these are on loan...
    however...

  Vivian's jaw drops.  Edward is holding a diamond and ruby
  necklace in his hands, holds it as if it might melt if he
  breathed too hard.  Edward behind Vivian, fastens the
  necklace around her neck.

          EDWARD
    This is made for a princess.
    I think she'd approve of you
    wearing it tonight.  There.
    Come look.

  He leads her to a mirror.  She stares at her reflection.

          VIVIAN
    Edward, I can't.

          EDWARD
    Shush.  Of course you can.

          VIVIAN
    What if I lose it?

          EDWARD
    You won't.

          VIVIAN
    What if someone tries to steal
    it?

          EDWARD
    I'll guard them and you with my
    life.

  EDT. BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

  A limo pulls onto the tarmac at Burbank Airport.  A PILOT in
  a leather jacket and sunglasses hurries forward to open the limo
  door.  Edward -- now wearing evening clothes -- and Vivian climbs
  out of the limo.

          PILOT
    Your plane is ready to go, Mr.
    Harris.

          EDWARD
    Very good.

          VIVIAN
    Plane?

  Taking her arm, Edward leads her across the tarmac.

          EDWARD
    You don't want to go all the way
    to San Francisco in a limousine,
    do you?  I don't.

          VIVIAN
    Where are you taking me!?

          EDWARD
    To meet some friends.  Rudolpho,
    a poet... Benoit, a landlord...
    Mimi, a flower maker...

          VIVIAN
    Huh?

          EDWARD
    The opera.

  Up ahead is a waiting private jet, its engines already HUMMING.
  She is speechless.  Edward grins, loving the look on her face.

  EXT. BURBANK AIRPORT - DAY

  The corporate jet takes off down the landing strip.

  INT. CORPORATE JET - DAY

  Edward and Vivian are alone in the passenger lounge of the jet.
  Vivian can't believe the cabin.  It is a comfortable room
  featuring a long couch that curves across two walls, built in
  bar, television and stereo.  Edward is once again, going over
  papers.

          VIVIAN
    I've never been on a plane
    before.

          EDWARD
    I'm glad you like it.  Now be
    quiet, I've really got to read
    these.

  Vivian fluffs her hair up.  She makes a happy, excited growling
  sound -- Rrrrr!  A wicked gleam comes to her eye.

  She walks over to Edward and stands in front of him.  He looks
  up.  She parts the thigh high slit in her gown to expose silken
  quarters.  She begins to unfasten the garters one at a time.

          EDWARD
    Vivian, what do you think you're
    doing?

  Edward watches silk stockings slide down Vivian's lovely legs.

          VIVIAN
    Being quiet.

  She reaches out and gently caresses Edward's face.  Edward sets
  down his papers.

  EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - SUNSET

  The setting sun casts an incredibly glow over the city and the
  coast.

          VIVIAN (O.S.)
    You ever been in love with
    anyone?

  INT. CORPORATE JET - SUNSET

  Vivian is at the window, looking out.  She carefully puts her
  earrings back on.  She stares, mesmerized by the skyline, the
  golden gate bridge in the distance.  She turns.  Edward is
  buttoning his shirt.  He is silent.

          VIVIAN
    Sorry.  You're not paying me to
    ask you question like that.

          EDWARD
    Vivian.  I'm paying you to be
    you.  Be you.
      (a beat)
    Have you?  Ever been in love with
    anyone?

          VIVIAN
    You mean, besides Elvis?
      (turning back to the
       window)
    I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once.
    First time I ever ran away from
    home, I got as far as Atlanta.
    I met this boy.  He'd been with
    his parents on their way to
    Chicago.  They stopped at a gas
    station.  He went to the john.
    When he came back they'd split.
    We sorta started looking out for
    each other.  Aw, he was sweet.
    And boy, was he good looking,
    y'know, dark hair and eyes.
    The chicken hawks were on him all
    the time.  He hated that.
    Sometimes we'd find a safe place
    to crash nights and we'd curl up
    together and we'd talk about all
    these crazy things.  The two of
    us getting married someday.
    Having kids.  Stupid stuff.

          EDWARD
    What happened to him?

  A moment.  Vivian shrugs.

          VIVIAN
    My father found me.  Dragged me
    home.  I don't know why, he never
    seemed to like me much when I was
    there.
      (a bitter smile)
    'Cept when he was drunk, then he
    liked me a whole lot.
      (a moment)
    I made it back to Atlanta a year
    later.  Andy was gone.

  Silence.  Vivian stares out the window.

          VIVIAN
    Aw, but things sure look fine
    when you're sitting way up high.

  Edward moves close to Vivian and putting an arm around her
  shoulders, stares with her out at the view.  Vivian rests her
  head against him.

  EXT. SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT

  An airport limo pulls to a stop in front of the San Francisco
  Opera House.  The DRIVER walks around back and opens the
  passenger door.  Edward emerges and helps Vivian out.

  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - NIGHT

  Edward puts his hand on Vivian's elbow as they walk through
  the elegant lobby.

          EDWARD
    Some people say that opera is an
    acquired taste, but I don't
    believe it.  You can always tell
    when someone goes to the opera
    for the first time.  They either
    love it or hate it.  Those who
    love it will always love it; those
    who hate it might come to
    appreciate it, but they'll never
    truly love it.

  Vivian is wide eyed as they walk past a beautifully lit
  fountain with several graceful statues in its center.
  Everywhere she looks she sees elegantly dressed WOMEN and
  prosperous looking MEN.  It makes her nervous.  Without
  realizing it, she raises a protective hand up to her necklace.
  She looks as if she suspects someone is going to step up and
  steal it.

          EDWARD
    Viv?  I really doubt if anyone
    here is going to try and grab it.

  Vivian reluctantly lowers her hands.

  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE LOBBY - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

  A crowd of PEOPLE mill around the lobby, heading toward their
  seats.  Vivian is aware of the looks she draws as she passes
  -- curious, even envious looks from the WOMEN, appreciative
  glances from the MEN.  Her hands again rises nervously to her
  necklace.

          EDWARD
    They all think you look very
    beautiful, Vivian.

  Vivian gives him a grateful look.  Relaxing, she lowers her hand
  from the necklace.  With a flourish, he offers his arm.  She
  takes it.  They start forward.

  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT

  Edward and Vivian take their seats in a box high above the
  stage.

          VIVIAN
    If it's in Italian, how will I
    know what they're saying?

          EDWARD
    I'll whisper some of the main
    parts of the story to you.  But
    you'll be surprised how much you
    understand.  The music conveys
    the story more powerfully than
    any words.

          VIVIAN
    But don't they have it in
    English?

          EDWARD
    Vivian, don't be afraid of what
    you don't know.  That's the fun
    of it.

  The lights dim.

          VIVIAN
      (resigned)
    Okay.  Even if I hate it, I'm
    glad you brought me.

  The orchestra begins to play.  Vivian's eyes focus intensely
  on the stage, as if a new world is about to be revealed to her.

  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE STATE - NIGHT

  IN A MONTAGE OF IMAGES AND MUSIC - LA BOHEME is performed.

  The lights from the stage dance across Vivian's face.  Edward
  leans over to translate the tenor's aria.

          EDWARD
    What am I?  I am a poet.  Not
    a man of wealth but one rich in
    dreams.  You have come to replace
    my vanished dreams.  I dwell now
    only in your eyes.

  The MUSIC ebbs and swells.  The sets and costumes change.  The
  story continues.

  Edward again leans close to Vivian.

          EDWARD
    And now she asks Rudolpho if he
    still thinks her beautiful --

  Vivian raises a hand and gently covers Edward's mouth.  Her eyes
  are fixed on the stage.  She doesn't need his help.

  The emotions building inside Vivian swell as the music is
  reaching its tragic climax.  Her lips tremble.  Her eyes fill
  with tears.  Edward glances at her.  He studies her a long
  moment, watching the emotions play unashamedly across her face.
  Strangely moved, he takes Vivian's hand.

  As the opera ends, they are both swept away by it.

  INT. S.F. OPERA HOUSE BOX - NIGHT

  As the lights come up, Vivian wipes off her tear-ruined
  mascara.  She sighs, happy.  The WOMEN in the next box smile
  at her.

          OLDER WOMAN
    Did you enjoy the opera, dear?

          VIVIAN
      (tearfully)
    It was so beautiful I just about
    pissed my pants.

  Edward smiles at the now shocked looking Older Woman and he
  and the still misty Vivian exit.

  INT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT - LATER

  Edward and Vivian sit side by side.

          EDWARD
    If you'd gone on about how much
    you liked it, I'm not sure I'd
    have believed you.

          VIVIAN
    I more than liked it.

          EDWARD
    I know.  I'm glad.

          VIVIAN
    Did you?

          EDWARD
    Yes.  I've never enjoyed it more.
    Thank you.

  Vivian looks at him a moment.  And then, leaning slowly forward
  she kisses him gently on the mouth.  He looks at her surprise.
  He puts his arms around her and kisses her back.  It is the
  first time they've kissed and they make it very special.

  EXT. CORPORATE JET - NIGHT

  The plane flies in the night.  Back to L.A.

  INT. REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

  IN A SERIES OF CROSS FADES Edward and Vivian make love.
  Equally giving, equally taking.  No masks, no shields.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

  In the darkened bedroom, Edward and Vivian lie together.
  Edward cradles Vivian.  Her back rests against his chest.  His
  arm is over her body.

  She takes Edward's hand in her hands and carefully examines
  it; marveling at the fingers, the tiny hairs on the back.  She
  gently kisses the palm.

          VIVIAN
    Love you...

  She clutches Edward's hand tightly to her breast.  She closes
  her eyes, ready to sleep now.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - ANGLE ON EDWARD - NIGHT

  His eyes open.  Vivian's whispered endearment has filled with
  him with sudden confusion and uncertainty.  He stares into the
  dark, wondering what to do with the woman in his arms.

  INT. PENTHOUSE - OUTDOOR PATIO - MORNING

  The phone rings.  Edward immediately reaches out and picks it
  up.  He is dressed in a robe.  Breakfast is on the umbrella'd
  table in front of him.

          EDWARD
    Yes?

  INT.  STUCKEY'S HOME - LIBRARY- MORNING - INTERCUT

  Stuckey, not even dressed yet, paces around his desk.

          STUCKEY
    Did I wake you?

          EDWARD
    I'm up.

          STUCKEY
    I had to call.  I jus got off
    the phone with James Kross.  Get
    this.  He wants to see you.
    Today.

          EDWARD
    Why?

          STUCKEY
    He wouldn't say.  Edward... I
    think we got him.  His nuts are
    on the block and we got him.
      (silence)
    You there?

          EDWARD
    Give me twenty minutes.

          STUCKEY
    We'll be there.  Listen, if he's
    really caving in, we'll go from
    there down to the office.  I want
    him to commit his stock to us this
    morning.

  Edward hangs up.  His mind seems on other things.  He rises.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

  Vivian is still asleep.  She is face down on the bed, the
  sheets just covering her to her waist.  Edward stares down at
  her.  He gently reaches out and runs a finger down the soft line
  of her spine.  Vivian murmurs contentedly.

          VIVIAN
    Mmm.
      (opening her eyes;
       looking at him)
    Hi.

  Edward smiles at her softly.  And then:

          EDWARD
    Better get dressed.  We're having
    guests.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY

  Vivian is wearing her yellow dress.  She stares at herself in
  the bedroom mirror.  Her hair... her make-up... she realizes
  how different she is now, realizes that she likes it.

  Edward comes out of the bathroom.  He crosses to the closet
  for a tie.

          VIVIAN
    Here.  Let me.

  She comes over, starts to tie his tie for him.  He is very
  aware of the closeness of her.  She smiles at him.  He smiles;
  puts his hand on her stopping her for a moment.  Looking up,
  she sees that he is serious now; no more jokes.  He releases
  her hand.

          EDWARD
      (quietly)
    One more night and you're finally
    rid of me.

          VIVIAN
    Yeah, you've been pretty tough
    to take.

          EDWARD
    I have to go to New York
    tomorrow.

  Vivian says nothing.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    But I'll be back in Los Angeles.
    Soon.  I'd like to see you again.
    I thought we could work out
    something... An arrangement.

  Vivian is silent.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    I'll get you an apartment, buy
    you a car --

  Vivian sighs, letting something go inside.  Finished with his
  tie, she turns away.

          EDWARD (cont'd)
    What is it?

          VIVIAN
      (not unkindly)
    What else?  You gonna leave some
    cash by the bed when you pass
    through town?

          EDWARD
    It wouldn't be like that.  I want
    to get you off the street.  You'll
    have a different kind of life.
    What's wrong with that?

          VIVIAN
    I'm sorry.  That's very sweet,
    Edward, and I know you mean it...

  She is silent.

          EDWARD
    Vivian, I've thought about this
    a lot.  This is the best solution.

          VIVIAN
      (shakes her head "no,"
       then continues tying
       his tie)
    When I was a little girl, my
    mother locked me in the attic when
    I was bad, which was pretty often.
    I'd stare out the window up there
    and make believe I was a princess
    trapped in the tower by the wicked
    queen.  Then suddenly a knight
    on a white horse with his bright
    colors flying would ride up.
    Rescue me from the tower, and then
    we'd ride off... but never, ever
    in all the times I had that dream
    did the knight say, "Come on baby,
    I'll put you up in a great condo."

  She finished his tie.

          EDWARD
    Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.

          VIVIAN
      (softly; to herself)
    I know.
      (a beat)
    Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being
    stupid.
      (more)
    I'll think about it, okay?  It's
    a real good offer for a whore.

          EDWARD
    I've never treated you like a
    whore.

          VIVIAN
      (not mean)
    You just did.

  The doorbell suddenly rings in the living room.

  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

  Edward enters the living room.  Vivian slowly enters behind
  him.  Edward opens the front door.  Mr. Kross slowly enters.
  He looks very old and tired; so much so that Edward has to mask
  his surprise.

          KROSS
    Mr. Harris.

          EDWARD
    How are you, Mr. Kross.

          KROSS
    Not bad for a man who hasn't
    slept in four nights.  I'll get
    used to it.

  An angry, reluctant looking David Kross is behind his father.
  Stuckey brings up the rear.  Edward and David give one another
  perfunctory nod.  Stuckey smugly winks at Edward.  Edward closes
  the door and leads them all down the stairs.

  Vivian is very troubled at Kross's appearance.  He gently nods
  at Vivian.

          KROSS
    Young lady.

          VIVIAN
    Hello.
      (to David)
    Hi.

          DAVID
    Hello, Vivian.

          STUCKEY
    Let's not waste time here, shall
    we?  Mr. Kross, you said this
    morning, you wished to speak with
    Mr. Harris.  Mr. Harris is now
    listening.

  Kross has to fight down his humiliation at Stuckey's tone.  He
  turns to Edward.

          KROSS
    Yes.  I'm here to tell you that
    I've reconsidered my position on
    your acquisition offer.

          EDWARD
    Expected... offer.

          KROSS
    Of course, yes.  After the
    expected filing period is over,
    I'm going to recommend to the
    board that we accept your bid.

          EDWARD
      (a moment)
    You're making the right decision,
    sir.

  Stuckey glances triumphantly at Edward.  He is surprised to
  see that there doesn't seem to be any victory in Edward's face.
  Edward is silent.  Kross interprets his silence as second
  thoughts.

          KROSS
    I'll see you on one condition.
    I'm not so concerned for me but
    the people who have worked for
    me...

  Vivian is disturbed watching this tired looking man.

          STUCKEY
      (quickly)
    They'll be taken care of.  Won't
    they, Edward?

  Kross ignores Stuckey.  He looks to Edward.  Edward slowly
  nods.

          KROSS
    I'll sign anything you want then.

          STUCKEY
    Today.

  Kross nods tiredly.  His voice is very soft.

          KROSS
    Today.

  Vivian abruptly turns and disappears into the bedroom,
  obviously upset.  The men all watch her go.  Edward hesitates.
  He turns to Kross:

          EDWARD
    Excuse me, please?

  He heads to the bedroom.

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - DAY

  Vivian is sitting on the bed, on the phone.

          VIVIAN
    Hello.  Is Kit DeLuca there?
    When she comes in will you have
    her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000.
    Yes.  Okay.

  She hangs up as Edward comes in.

          VIVIAN
    What did you do to him?

          EDWARD
    What do you mean?

          VIVIAN
    Last time I saw him he was this
    strong guy.  Now he's beaten.
    And you liked him.

          EDWARD
    Vivian, I want you to listen to
    me.  The man realized that it
    would be better for his future
    and his son's future, if he
    cooperated.

          VIVIAN
    Right.

          EDWARD
    It's not your concern.  It's...
    business, that's all.

          VIVIAN
    Business.

          EDWARD
    Yes.  The man made a business
    decision.

          VIVIAN
    It's all just business to you.
    Him.  Me.  Your life.
    Everything's business.

          EDWARD
    It's what I do for a living.
    It's how I make money.

  Silence.

          EDWARD
    I'll be back in a few hours.
    We'll talk about this later.

  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

  Edward enters the living room.  The men look at him
  expectantly.

          EDWARD
    We'll continue this down at the
    office.

  He heads for the door.

  EXT. PENTHOUSE PATIO - DAY

  Vivian stands at the railing, unhappily looking out at the city
  beyond.  The phone RINGS.  She turns and hurries inside.

  INT. PENTHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY

  Vivian answers the phone.

          VIVIAN
    Lo?

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY - INTERCUT

  Mr. Thomas is standing behind the front desk, a rather strained
  expression on his face.

          MR. THOMAS
    Barnard Thomas here.  Miss
    Vivian, I wonder if you might come
    down to the front desk.  There's
    someone here to see you.

          VIVIAN
    Me?

          MR. THOMAS
    I'd send them up, but sadly, I
    don't trust the young lady to find
    you on her own.

  A hand reaches out and wrenches the phone away from Mr. Thomas.
  Kit, heavy make-up, skimpy outfit, chewing gum, cigarette and
  all, keeps her voice just below a bellow.

          KIT
    Viv?  Where are you, babe?
      (glaring at Mr. Thomas)
    The sphincter-police won't let
    me through.

  INT. HOTEL LOUNGE - DAY

  Kit finishes slurping on a big, frosty ice cream soda.  She
  smacks her lips like a happy, little girl.  Vivian isn't having
  anything.

          VIVIAN
    Yes, I'm glad you're clean but
    I've been calling and calling.

          KIT
    Was that you?

          VIVIAN
    Who did you think?

          KIT
    Carlos.  I still owe him two
    hundred bucks...

          VIVIAN
    Kit, I left that money for you
    days ago.

          KIT
    Yeah.  I just got it.

  An OLDER COUPLE walk past the table.  They stare at Kit.

          KIT
    Fifty bucks, grampa.  For
    seventy-five, the wife can watch.

  Horrified, the elderly couple hurry away.

          VIVIAN
    Kit...

          KIT
    Everybody keeps starin' at me.

          VIVIAN
    Yeah... I know what you mean.

          KIT
    What do you know?  You look good.
    All dressed up.
      (meaning it)
    You clean up real nice.
      (giggling)
    You sure don't fit in down on
    the Boulevard, lookin' like you
    do.  Not that you ever did anyway.

          VIVIAN
    You think I fit here where they
    just about chew your food for you?

          KIT
    Where do you fit?

  Vivian is silent, then.

          VIVIAN
      (suddenly)
    I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.

          KIT
    Honey, you're not supposed to
    do that.

          VIVIAN
    I know.  I stopped pretending
    and started liking it with him
    for real.

          KIT
    Oh, my god, you mean it was good?

          VIVIAN
      (miserably)
    It was great.

          KIT
    Dummy.

          VIVIAN
    He wants to set me up in a place,
    give me some money.

          KIT
    I pray for that.

          VIVIAN
      (nods)
    All I'm doing is feeling lousy
    about it.  I don't know what to
    do.  What do I do, Kit?

          KIT
    Go for the bucks.

          VIVIAN
    I don't care about bucks.
      (a beat)
    I might love this guy.

          KIT
    Wow, are you in deep shit.
      (a sigh)
    You know he'll break your heart.

  Vivian is silent again.

          KIT (cont'd)
    I blame myself here.  First time
    I laid eyes on ya', I knew you
    were too complicated to be a
    whore.

  Vivian nods.  Her face is filled with confusion.

  INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

  Edward stands at the window looking out.  There is something
  about his somber demeanor that both reflects the look we've just
  seen on Vivian and suggests the way we saw him at the top of
  the story.

  Jake enters, a pile of papers under his arm.  He begins laying
  them out on the conference table.

          JAKE
    Congratulations, sir.

          EDWARD
    What?

          JAKE
    Mr. Kross is just getting off
    the phone with his stock broker.
    It's finished.  You've won.

  Edward says nothing.

          JAKE
    Who are you going after next, sir?

          EDWARD
    Who indeed...

  He turns as Stuckey, James and David Kross, and Vance enter
  the room.  They surround a conference table.  Kross sits, the
  papers laid out in front of him.  Stuckey hands Kross a pen.
  A SECRETARY lays out finger food.  They wait for her to leave
  before they speak.

          STUCKEY
    If we can get these letters of
    intent out of the way now... Mr.
    Harris and I would like to ask
    you some questions about your
    company.

          DAVID
    Dad, excuse me, but that's
    inappropriate.  You're under no
    obligation to answer any questions
    at all.

          KROSS
    Could we at least wait till after
    the filing period?

  Stuckey glances to Edward for help.  Edward is silent; indeed
  it's as if something is twisting inside of him.  Stuckey plunges
  ahead.

          STUCKEY
    Mr. Harris is preparing a bid
    based on our speculation of the
    corporation's net worth.  The
    price he ultimately pays for your
    father's stock will be based on
    that bid.  The more we know, the
    higher our bid can be.

          KROSS
    It's in my best interest to
    cooperate, David.

          DAVID
    If he throws himself on your
    sword, you promise to take care
    of him and his family, huh?

  David stares at him.

          STUCKEY
    That's unfair!

          DAVID
    You bed it is.
      (to Edward)
    You're everything he said you
    were.
      (to his father)
    Do what you have to do, Dad.
    Just don't expect me to watch it.

  He exits.  A moment.  Kross looks at Edward with a resigned
  smile.

          KROSS
    He's young.  He hasn't learned
    how to lose gracefully yet.  I'll
    sign your papers.  And I'll answer
    your questions.  Whatever you
    want.

  He sighs.  He picks up the pen.  He's about to sign.

          EDWARD
    Stop.  For just a moment.
      (a moment)
    Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you
    a few questions before you sign.
    You realize that you're a target.
    If you weren't mine, you'd be
    someone elses, correct?

          KROSS
    Yes.

          EDWARD
    If you had a... reprieve, what
    would do?

          STUCKEY
      (quickly)
    I don't think there's any sense
    in --

          EDWARD
    Let him answer.

          KROSS
    I... I would take advantage of
    it.

          EDWARD
    How?

  Kross looks uncertain.  He gropes for an answer.

          KROSS
    I... I don't know.  There...
    there wasn't time...

          EDWARD
    I suppose you'd find out soon
    enough that you have assets you
    presently don't seem aware of,
    wouldn't you?  The waste
    processing licenses at that
    abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd
    certainly find out about that.

  Surprise suddenly flares in Stuckey's eyes.

          STUCKEY
    Oh, my god... Edward, no!

          EDWARD
    I suppose you'd use them as
    collateral on new loans, wouldn't
    you?

          STUCKEY
    Have you lost your mind?

          KROSS
      (to Stuckey)
    Quiet.
      (to Edward)
    Would I get the loans?

          EDWARD
    This time I imagine you would,
    yes.
      (as if thinking about
       it)
    Hmm...
      (a moment)
    With all this in mind, Mr. Kross,
    I can't logically make a formal
    bid on your company, can I?

          KROSS
      (a small smile)
    You'd be initiating a financial
    battle you'd ultimately lose, Mr.
    Harris.

          EDWARD
    You're very right.  I think the
    best thing we could all do is go
    home.

          STUCKEY
    What!?

          EDWARD
    Have a good day, gentlemen.

  He exits from the room.  Stuckey follows.

  INT. BROKERAGE HOUSE - DAY

  Edward is walking down the hall.  Stuckey comes out of the
  office and calls after him.

          STUCKEY
      (calls)
    Edward, what happened?  What kind
    of move was that?

  Edward silently goes into the elevators.  The doors close.

          STUCKEY
      (yells)
    Dammit Edward, speak to me.

  Stuckey heads back to the conference room.

  EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON

  Edward comes out of the building.  His Chauffeur leaps to open
  the limo door.

          EDWARD
    No... take the car back to the
    hotel.  I need to walk.

  He sets off across Century Park East.

  INT. PENTHOUSE - EVENING

  Vivian is in the living room, pacing, edgy, the doorbell rings.
  She turns.  It rings again.

  She opens it.  Stuckey is standing outside with a small
  briefcase.  He looks agitated.  He tries to hide it.

          STUCKEY
    Well, well... Hello again.  I'm
    looking for Edward.

  Vivian just stares at him.

          VIVIAN
    Edward's not back.  I thought
    he was with you.

  Stuckey walks past her and down the steps into the living room.

          STUCKEY
    No, I'll just have to wait then,
    won't I?

  There is a bar set up.  Stuckey sets his briefcase down.  He
  crosses to the bar.

          STUCKEY (cont'd)
    Mind if I have a drink?

          VIVIAN
    No.

  He pours liquor in a glass.  He fires it down.  It seems to
  calm him a bit.

          STUCKEY
    Do you want to know what he did?
    Do you want to know what the crazy
    son of a bitch did?  He handed
    the whole thing back to Kross!
    On a silver platter.  For no
    reason!  What was he thinking,
    I mean, what was going through
    his goddam head?  Why?
      (pours another drink)
    What was all that benevolent
    crap?  What are we going to
    become, a philanthropic
    foundation?  I'll probably be the
    director of several worthwhile
    charities.

          VIVIAN
    I think it's great.

  Stuckey glares at Vivian.

          STUCKEY
    I bet.  A lousy whore and you're
    the gum in a hundred million
    dollar deal.

          VIVIAN
      (mocking)
    Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just
    business.

  He looks at her a moment.

          STUCKEY
    But what do I know, maybe you're
    worth it.  Come on, show me.
    Let's see your act.

  He grabs her wrist.

          VIVIAN
    Get out!

          STUCKEY
    Don't worry.  I'll pay for it.
    What a you charge?  Huh?  Twenty,
    thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  Are
    you a fifty dollar whore?

  He tries to kiss her and pulls her down on the couch on top
  of him.

          VIVIAN
    Are you crazy?

  She bites his hand.  Stuckey slaps her.  Vivian starts flailing
  back.  But Stuckey is too strong.  Vivian staggers back at the
  force of another slap.  Stuckey slams her up against a wall and
  starts rubbing up against her.

          STUCKEY
    You got a mean streak in you,
    don't you.

  He tries to kiss her again.

          STUCKEY (cont'd)
    Is that what he likes about you?
    Huh?  Answer me!

  And suddenly a HAND lands on Stuckey's shoulder.  Stuckey turns
  his head, startled.

  INT. PENTHOUSE - REVERSE ANGLE - STUCKEY'S P.O.V.

  Edward, murder in his eyes, belts Stuckey across the room.

  INT. PENTHOUSE - NIGHT - BACK TO SCENE

  Stuckey falls on the ground.  Edward rushes forward, berserk
  with rage, to hit Stuckey again.  His fist hits the top of
  Stuckey's head, hurting Edward's hand more than Stuckey's skull.

  Vivian rushes out of room to bathroom.  Again Stuckey tries
  to rise.  Edward kicks him in the butt, sends him headfirst into
  the bar.  Glasses and bottles CRASH to the floor.  Stuckey again
  tries to rise.  And collapses.  Edward rubs his fist.  They're
  not used to this violence and both stare at each other panting.

          STUCKEY
    You broke my nose.

          EDWARD
    I think I broke my hand.
      (a beat)
    You're fired.

          STUCKEY
    Edward, we've been together ten
    years.

          EDWARD
    And I don't like what we've
    become.  I'll cover any losses
    you have on this one.  Now get
    out, you asshole!

          STUCKEY
    All this because of that whore!

          EDWARD
    Yes.

  Edward pushes Stuckey out the door and throws his briefcase
  after him.

          STUCKEY
    Edward, think about what you're
    --


  Edward slams the door in his face.  Edward stands there,
  reflecting on what he's done.

          EDWARD
      (to himself, almost
       proud)
    Well, I didn't plan that!

  INT. PENTHOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

  Edward holds an icepack to Vivian's cheek.

          VIVIAN
    Why do guys always know how to
    hit a woman?  Right across the
    cheek, wham, so it feels like your
    eye is gonna explode.  What do
    they do, take you all aside in
    high school and show you how?
    It pisses me off!

          EDWARD
    Not all men hit.  And no one is
    going to hit you anymore.

          VIVIAN
    Right.
      (softening)
    You're quite the Sir Galahad
    today, aren't ya'?
      (a beat)
    I heard what you did with Kross.

          EDWARD
    It was a business decision.

  Vivian looks at him.

          EDWARD
    I got tired of hating my father.

          VIVIAN
      (a small smile)
    It was good.

          EDWARD
    It felt good.

  Edward looks on the bed at her suitcases.

          EDWARD
    You're packing.

          VIVIAN
      (nods)
    I'm leaving.
      (a moment)
    Don't ya see?  If I stay with
    you like you want me to, there'll
    always be some guy, your friends
    eve, treatin' me like that...
    thinkin' they're allowed to.  What
    are you gonna do, fight'm all?
    No.  I'll take my money now,
    please.

  A moment.  Edward reaches for his wallet.  He counts out bills.
  He places them in Vivian's suitcase.  He puts his arms around
  Vivian.

          VIVIAN
    Aw, don't... no...

          EDWARD
    Stay with me tonight.  Not
    because you're being paid to.
    Stay with me because you want to.

          VIVIAN
    I do.  I do want to.  That's why
    I'm leaving.
      (turning to him)
    That's what you given me, see?
    I know what I want now.  I want
    a guy like you for real.  Not
    because you buy me things and give
    me money.  The nicest thing you
    ever done for me is hold my hand.
    You gonna give me that?

  Edward is silent.

          VIVIAN
    I didn't think so.

          EDWARD
    Vivian...

          VIVIAN
    It's not your fault.  You're
    right.  Kit's right.
      (looks him right in the
       eye)
    But I want the fairy tale.

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

  Vivian comes out of the elevators.  A BELLMAN sees her and
  springs forward, reaching for her bags.

          BELLMAN
    Let me take those, miss.

          VIVIAN
    Thanks.

  Vivian sees Mr. Thomas behind the front desk.

          VIVIAN
    I'll be out front in a minute.
    I got a cab comin'.

  The bellman moves away.  Vivian walks to the front desk.

          VIVIAN
    Hi, Barney!

          MR. THOMAS
      (looking up)
    Miss Vivian.

          VIVIAN
    Look I just wanted to say
    goodbye.

          MR. THOMAS
    Mr. Harris doesn't check out
    until tomorrow.

          VIVIAN
    Yeah, well, I check out today.

          MR. THOMAS
    You're not accompanying him to
    New York?

          VIVIAN
      (lightly)
    Come on, Barney, you and me live
    in the real world.
      (a beat)
    You don't know how to treat a girl
    like anything but a lady, Mr.
    Thomas.

          MR. THOMAS
    Certain ladies make that very
    easy... Vivian.
      (turning to the desk
       clerk)
    John, call a limousine for our
    guest, please.  Have it take her
    anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill
    the hotel.
      (turning back to Vivian)
    See you again sometime soon.

  Vivian smiles softly at him.  She turns and walks for the door.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - DAY

  A long silver limo drives down Hollywood Blvd.

  INT. LIMO - DAY

  The LIMO DRIVER pushes the button that rolls down the screen
  between back and front seats.

          DRIVER
    You're sure this is the right
    street, ma'am?

          VIVIAN
    Yes. 1312.  It's a big apartment
    building.

  EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

  The limo pulls to a stop in front of a rundown apartment
  building on a dirty Hollywood side street.  The Limo Driver,
  a large Latino man, steps out of the car and walks around to
  the passenger door.  As he does, he surveys the surroundings
  uncomfortably.  Ths is rough neighborhood.  He opens the door.
  Vivian steps out.

          LIMO DRIVER
    Maybe I should go with you.  This
    doesn't look like a good place
    for a lady to be alone.

  Several PEOPLE pass.  All of them stare at the car, at the
  driver, at Vivian in her lovely clothes.

          VIVIAN
    I'll be okay.  I'm home.  Thank
    you.

  The driver, confused, watches her hurry up the steps to the
  apartment building.  He drives off.

  INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - DAY

  Vivian walks toward her apartment.  The Landlord is sitting
  at the front desk in a dirty undershirt.

          LANDLORD
    Hey, we announce guests here.
    You a relative of somebody?

  Vivian lowers her sunglasses.

          LANDLORD (cont'd)
    Viv -- is that you?

          VIVIAN
    Yeah, it's me.

  She keeps walking.

          LANDLORD
    You lookin' good, Viv'.  Nice
    threads.  I gotta find time to
    shop.

  INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY

  Edward stands at the penthouse window, looking out.  He is
  dressed now, ready for travel.  There is something about his
  expression, his somber demeanor that suggests the way we saw
  him at the very top of the story.  A BELLMAN enters from the
  bedroom, rolling a luggage loaded dolly along in front of him.

          BELLMAN
    Is that everything, sir?

          EDWARD
      (turning from the
       window)
    That's everything.

  The Bellman exits, closing the door behind him.  The phone
  rings.  Edward crosses to it, picks it up.  The Maid comes in,
  looks around.

          MAID
    The lady, she go?

          EDWARD
    Yes.  She go.

  INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

  Edward with the Bellhop heads to the front door.  He's leaving.

          BELLHOP
    Do you have a car taking you to
    the airport, sir?

          EDWARD
    Yes.

  INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

  Vivian, looking fresh scrubbed without make-up, is wearing
  clean jeans, a nice looking shirt and a suit jacket.  Her
  bureau's are open.  She is packing.  Kit is watching.  She takes
  the photo of her and Kit dressed up hot in hooker clothes and
  packs it.

          KIT
    So whatta' you going to do in
    San Francisco?

          VIVIAN
    Get a job and probably go back
    to school.  Figure out what I'm
    gonna be.

          KIT
    What kind of school?

          VIVIAN
    School, school.  Regular.  I used
    to get pretty good grades in
    school, you know.

          KIT
    So did I.  I made it with the
    principal.
      (recites)
    Study hard And get a "B."  Lift
    your dress and an "A" you'll see.

  They both laugh but too hard.

          VIVIAN
    Want a pair of boots?

          KIT
    Do I!?  Momma!

  Taking them, she sits on the bed and puts them on.

          VIVIAN
    You sure you won't come with me?

          KIT
    And leave all this?  Not in a
    million.

  They laugh together.

          KIT (cont'd)
    What time's your bus?

          VIVIAN
    Couple a hours.

          KIT
    Yeah.  Well... I gotta split.
    Goodbye's make me crazy.

          VIVIAN
    Cool your jets a second.
      (going to her purse)
    Here's some money.

          KIT
    No.  You took care of rent,
    that's enough.

          VIVIAN
    I want to.  For food, got it?
    Eat something before the wind
    blows you away.

          KIT
    I'm gonna pay you back next time
    I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm
    gonna do something real nice for
    you some day.

  They hug.

          KIT (cont'd)
    Shit, I'm gettin' all weepy now.

  Kit begins backing out of the room.

          KIT (cont'd)
    Take care of you, okay?  Take
    care of you.  Love ya...

  Kit turns and hurries out of the apartment.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY

  Kit enters the falafel stand on Hollywood Boulevard.

  INT. FALAFEL STAND - DAY

  Kit enters, sits at the counter.

          KIT
    Coffee, Chan.  And maybe a
    grilled cheese on white, okay?

  A very young GIRL is sitting just down the counter from Kit.
  Kit nods at her.

          KIT
    Hey, how you doin'.  You new,
    huh?

          GIRL
    Yeah.  Got a cigarette?

          KIT
    Sure.

  She passes the girl down the pack.  She strikes a match, lights
  her cigarette for her.  The girl inhales deep, lets it out with
  a sigh.  She looks towards the window.

          GIRL
    Jeez, did the wacko in the suit.

  Kit turns to look.

  KIT'S P.O.V. - HOLLYWOOD BLVD.

  Outside, across the street, Edward has accosted two
  PROSTITUTES; one blonde, one a red haired black one.

  INT. FALAFEL STAND - DAY - BACK TO SCENE

  Kit rises.

          KIT
    Chan?  Keep the sandwich warm,
    I'll be back.

  She heads out the door.

  EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY

  Edward is still talking to the prostitutes.

          EDWARD
    I'm looking for a girl, Vivian,
    young, dark hair, big eyes...?

  They shake their heads.

          EDWARD
    She's mouthy.  Sort of
    difficult...?

          PROSTITUTE 1
    Ain't seen her, wouldn't know
    her.

          PROSTITUTE 2
    What's wrong with us, man?  Two
    for the price a one, what ya say?

          EDWARD
      (disappointed)
    Thank you.  No.

  They turn and walk away.  Edward stands there, not knowing
  what to do next.  He looks discouraged and lost.

          KIT (O.S.)
    Edward Harris, as I live and
    breathe!

  Edward quickly turns to find Kit staring at him.  Kit smiles,
  triumphantly.

          KIT (cont'd)
    Yeah.  Boy, you're just like she
    said.

  She turns and starts away.  She stops, turns back.

          KIT (cont'd)
    You comin' or not?  I don't got
    all day, I got a grilled cheese
    waitin'.

  Edward follows Kit.

  INT.  VIVIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

  Vivian sits on her bed, lost in thought.  Her bags are packed,
  ready to go.  With a sigh she rises.  She picks up the bags,
  exits the room.

  Vivian stands in the dreary living room, looking at it, taking
  it all in for the last time.  She suddenly looks more than a
  little bit frightened to be leaving.  She musters resolve.  She
  goes to the door, opens it and exits, closing it behind her.
  Silence.  Vivian suddenly comes back in.  She puts down her
  bags.  She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee
  can/piggy bank from the shelf.  She puts some more bills into
  it, places it back where Kit will find it.

  She turns and starts again for the door.

  She stops.  She hears something.  MUSIC.  An aria from La
  Boheme.  Faint.  Seemingly coming from nowhere.  She dismisses
  it -- she's hearing things.  She opens the door.  Stops.  The
  music is louder and getting louder now -- it's not her
  imagination.  She hurries over to the window.

  EXT. VIVIAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

  Vivian comes out onto the fire escape.  She stares in wonder.

  A snow white limo comes up the street.  A necktie has been tied
  to the antennae like a knight's token.  The MUSIC from La Boheme
  is BLARING from the car's stereo.  Edward is standing on the
  car's seat, his head and body up through the open sunroof.  The
  wind blows at his hair.  He is smiling.

  Everywhere on the street people are staring; the BUMS, the
  PUSHERS, the PASSERBY'S, the TOURISTS.

  Vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry.

  The car comes to a stop in front of the Vivian's building.
  Vivian's landlord comes out the front door.  His eyes go wide
  in disbelief.

  Edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the
  sunroof.  He leaps nimbly to the ground.  He crosses to the entrance
  of the alleyway, looking up at Vivian on the fire escape.

          VIVIAN
    You are really lost this time.

  Edward wordlessly holds up a hand for her.

  With a sudden cry of joy, Vivian comes down the fire escape.
  She stops at the bottom stair.  Edward comes forward and sweeps
  her into his arms.  They kiss.

  He carries her to the limo as if she's weightless.  Her feet
  never touch the ground.

  The car door closes behind them.  The limo drives away.

  The people of the street watch it go.

          THE END

      From the original script written by J.F. Lawton, with the help of
      Stephen Metcalfe, Barbara Benedek, Robert Garland and probably
      Garry Marshall (the director of the film) himself. This original
      script itself was adapted from Lawton's first script called «Three
      Thousand», which was a much darker story about prostitution and
      drugs.

           Broke in right on the two of them. Caught them.

           No matter what they say, it's all about money.

                         

                         FADE TO :

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - PATIO - EXTERIOR DAY

          We are in Philip Stuckey's residence on the Hollywood Hills.
          Apparently, a party is in progress.

                         
          Close Up on the Magician's hands and the hands of two ladies. The
          magician is doing tricks with coins in the ladies' hands.

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           So let's imagine, ladies, that you're a Savings and Loan
           officer. Watch. One, two, three. See ?

                         
          On lady has got three coin in her hand, and the other one only
          one. The magician takes the three coins from the first lady's
          hand, and closes it. Then he takes the only coin from the other
          lady's hand, but leaves it open. He puts the four coins in his
          hand and closes it.

                         
          Credits appears in white capital letters on the screen.

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           You've got it all, and we've got nothing. And you have all
           four. Just take a look.

          He opens his hand, which is empty. Then he opens the first lady's
          hand, which contains the four coins.

                         
                          WOMAN (voice over)
           Oh !

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           But I wouldn't trust you with real gold. That's why this
           one's only worth about a penny.

                         
          He takes one of the coins from the first lady's hand, hides it in
          his hand, and makes it appears again changed into a huge penny
          coin.

                         
          End of the first set of credits.

                         
                          MAN (voice over)
           Hmm.

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           And if you wonder where the other one went, watch.

                         
          His left hand moves to the first lady's' ear, and gets the missing
          penny out of it.

                         

                          PHILIP
           A penny from the ear. How much for the rest ?

                         
          Philip Stuckey, the host, walks behind the magician. Philip is a
          short man in his forties, with receding hair. He looks, at the
          same time, obsequious and domineering. His guests laugh at his
          joke. Philip moves toward a young man.

                         
          The camera follows Philip.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Have you seen Edward ?

           THE YOUNG MAN
           No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Well, my wife went to a lot of trouble : she called a
           caterer.

                         
          He walks to a group of guest gathered around a large buffet table.
          Behind the table, the balustrade of the patio, and in the
          background, Hollywood Hills.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Excuse me, Ann. Howard, how are you ?

                         

                          HOWARD
           Philip, good. Hey, I understand Edward's taking over Morse
           Industries.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Yeah, well, he's not here to get a suntan.

                         

                          HOWARD
           Can I get in on it ?

                         

                          PHILIP
           Yeah. Call me.

                         

                          HOWARD
           When ?

                         

                          PHILIP
           Just call me.

                         
          He turns to another guest and shake hands with him.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Uh, hi. I'm Philip Stuckey, Edward Lewis's lawyer.

                         

                          THE GUEST
           Hey, where's the guest of honor anyway ?

                         

                          PHILIP
           Well, if I know this fellow, he's probably off in a corner
           somewhere charming a very pretty lady.

                         
          He turns to a charming lady talking with a man.

                         

                          PHILIP
           How are you ?

                         
          He gives her a kiss.

          Very modern design. An artistic picture of a nude girl on the
          wall.

                         
          Medium shot of Edward Lewis standing near the desk, talking on the
          telephone. He is a very handsome man in his early forties. He is
          very elegantly dressed, apparently with a very expensive suit.

                          EDWARD
           I told my secretary to make the arrangements. Didn't she
           call you ?

                         
           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak
           to you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I see.

                         
           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           I have my own life too, you know, Edward.

                         

                          EDWARD
           This is a very important week for me. I need you here.

                         
          He walks to the large bay window, overlooking Hollywood Hills.

                         
           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           But you never give me any notice. You just think I'm at
           your beck and call.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I do not believe that you are at my beck and call.

                         
           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           Well, that's the way you always make me feel. Maybe I
           should just move out.

                         

                          EDWARD
           If that's what you want, yes.

                         
           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           All right, when you get back to New York, we'll discuss it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Now is as good a time as any.

                         
           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           That's fine with me, Edward. Good-bye.

                         
          She hangs up.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Good-bye, Jessica.

                         
          Edward looks down, through the bay window, to the party still
          going on on the patio on the floor below. We can hear the chatter
          from the party.

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - STAIRWAY - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Edward is going down the stairs followed by a young blonde man,
          wearing a very elegant suit.

                         

                          YOUNG MAN
           Phil suggested that maybe I should take a lawy...

                          EDWARD
           Phil is just my lawyer, okay ?

                         

                          YOUNG MAN
           Yes, sir.

                         

                          EDWARD
           How did the Morse stock open at the Nikkei ?

                         

                          YOUNG MAN
           I don't know.

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DOWNSTAIRS HALL - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          They have reached the downstairs hall. Edward looks at his watch
          and then turns toward the young man. He is looking slightly angry.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You don't know ? Tokyo opened maybe ninety minutes ago. You
           have to keep on top of these things, all right ?

                         

                          YOUNG MAN
           Done.

                         
          Two charming women walks near the two men. One of the woman turns
          toward Edward.

                         

                          CHARMING WOMAN
           Hello, Mr. Lewis.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Hi. How're you doing ?

                         
          Edward shakes the woman's hand, who walks away, and turns back to
          the young blonde man.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I want this whole thing... wrapped up as soon as possible.
           I gotta get to New York by Sunday. I got tickets to the
           Met.

                         

                          YOUNG MAN
           Yes, sir.

                         
          He moves across the crowd of guests, and reaches a servant, who
          gives him his coat.

                         

                          SERVANT
           Your coat, Mr. Lewis.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you.

                         
          He starts walking away with his coat in his hands, when he turns
          around to the sound of a feminine voice.

                         

                          SUSAN
           Edward !

                         

                          EDWARD
           Susan !

                         
          Susan is a beautiful woman, in her late thirties, wearing an
          elegant yellow silk blouse.

                         

                          SUSAN
           Hi.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Hi.

                         
          They kiss on both cheeks.

                         

                          SUSAN
           I was sorry to hear about Carter.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh, yeah. Thanks. Heard you got married.

                         
          They start walking slowly toward the exit of the house, Edward's
          arm around Susan's waist.

                          SUSAN
           Well... yeah. I couldn't wait for you !

                         
          She laughs.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mmm... Mmm... Susan, tell me something.

                         

                          SUSAN
           Yes ?

                         
          They stop walking, and Edward faces Susan.

                         

                          EDWARD
           When you and I were dating, did you speak to my secretary
           more than you spoke to me ?

                         

                          SUSAN
           She was one of my bridesmaids.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Hmm. Your husband's a very lucky guy.

                         
          They kiss again on the cheeks.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Bye.

                         

                          SUSAN
           Thanks, bye.

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium shot of Philip seated in an armchair, talking to a
          beautiful red-hair woman, seated in another armchair.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Do you ?

           THE RED-HAIR WOMAN
           Absolutely.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Wonderful.

                         
          Elizabeth, Philip's wife, walks rapidly toward Philip's armchair
          and taps him on the shoulder. Elizabeth is a red-hair woman in her
          forties. She is still nice-looking, and very elegantly dressed,
          but she doesn't have anymore the attraction that a younger woman
          can have on Philip.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           He's leaving. Edward's leaving.

                         
          Philip looks toward the entrance of the house, and stands up.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Excuse me.

                         

           THE RED-HAIR WOMAN
           Sure.

                         
          Philip walks rapidly away while Elizabeth looks at him with both
          hand on her hips.

          Close shot on a beautiful car : a grey Lotus Esprit.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Is this Mr. Stuckey's car ?

                         
          Medium shot of two Japanese parking valets, wearing white shirts,
          black bow-ties and black vests, looking at him. One of them
          answers him in Japanese. We don't understand what he says, but we
          understand the word «Stuckey» in his sentence.

                         
          Medium shot on Edward standing near Philip's Lotus. Edward turns
          around just as Philip is rushing toward him.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Edward, where you going ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           You got the keys to your car ?

                         

                          PHILIP
           Why, what's wrong with the limo ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Look, the limo is buried back there. Darryl can't get it
           out.

                         
          Darryl, Edward's chauffeur, is reading a newspaper, next to
          another chauffeur. Darryl is a very tall and very strong-looking
          Afro-American man. He raises his hand to show his helplessness
          about the situation.

                          PHILIP
           Mmm.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Please give me the keys.

                         
          Philip gives his car keys to Edward.

                         

                          PHILIP
           All right, look. I don't think you should drive. You're a
           little excited. Don't drive my car. Let me work something
           out here.

                         
          Philip runs toward the Japanese valets.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Fellas, what kind of a system is this ? Can you move these
           cars out of here ?

                         
          Meanwhile, Edward has seated himself in the driver seat of the
          Lotus Esprit. Philip comes back to him as Edward closes the door
          of the car.

                          PHILIP
           Look, Edward. Edward... Uh, are you familiar with a stick
           shift ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh, yeah.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Have you driven a shift ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Listen, all right. Just be ginger with it. Don't...

                         
          We hear the gears of the manual box clashing under Edward's
          unexperienced hand.

                         

                          PHILIP
           It's a new car. Don't, uh... Just don't...

                         

                          EDWARD
           Okay. I can do it.

                         
          Tires squeal as the car rushes forward.

                         
          The Japanese valets look up at the noise.

                         
          Edward has stopped after a couple of feet, and Philip runs to the
          driver's door.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Edward ! Give me a break, please !

                         

                          EDWARD
           I love this car.

                          PHILIP
           I love it too. Look, you don't even know where you're
           going. You're gonna get lost in the dark !

                         
          The car rushes forward. Tires squeal as Edward accelerate down the
          hill road.

                         
          The sky is slightly darker. Night is falling.

                         

                          PHILIP (YELLING)
           Beverly Hills is down the hill !

          Full shot of the Lotus Esprit driving along the streets of
          Hollywood Hills. Edward has switched the lights on.

                         
          We hear the song «King of Wistful thinking», performed by Go West.

                         

                          LYRICS
           I don't need to fall at your feet. Just 'cause you cut me
           to the bone. And I won't miss the way that you kiss me.

                         
          The sky is getting darker, and apparently, Edward doesn't know his
          way very well around Hollywood Hills.

                         
          Long shot on the famous «HOLLYWOOD» sign up on Hollywood Hills

           EDWARD (voice over)
           Oh, shit.

          Aerial overview of Hollywood.

                         
          The last set of credits starts in white capital letters on this
          overview.

                         
          The music keeps on playing.

                         

                          LYRICS
           We were never carved in stone. If I don't listen to the
           talk of the town. Then maybe I can fool myself. I'll get
           over you I know I will. I'll pretend my ship's not sinking.
           And I'll tell myself I'm over you.

                         
          The overview now shows Hollywood Boulevard.

          The credits are still appearing and disappearing on the screen.

                         
          A man is selling maps, advertised by a huge board he is carrying,
          and on which is written in red letters : «Maps of the Stars

          Another very short view of Hollywood Boulevard, showing a Close
          shot on a Chinese Restaurant. An then, a very fast horizontal
          panning of the camera, which gives us a blurred picture. The
          panning stops in :

                         

          SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Medium long shot on a very quiet side street near Hollywood
          Boulevard. The street seems even much quieter after all the noise
          and the hustle we've seen on the Boulevard itself.

                         
          The credits are still appearing and disappearing on the screen.

                         
          An ambulance is driving very fast along the street, with its siren
          wailing. On the side of the ambulance is written : «Los Angeles
          Fire Department», and below : «Paramedic».

                         
          The camera lets the ambulance go and moves to show us a shady-
          looking building with a vertical neon sign saying «HOTEL», but
          only the «H» and the «O» are lit, the others letters being out of
          order.

                         
          The music fades out.

                         
          This building actually is partly a regular hotel, and partly a
          place that rents small apartments on a monthly basis.

                         

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          We are in the small apartment rented by Vivian Ward and Kit De
          Luca, two young prostitutes, whom we are going to know better
          later on.

                         
          Close Up on a pretty woman buttocks, just covered by a very small
          black lace panty.

                         
          An alarm clock is ringing.
          The woman turns around, and shows us her stomach and her navel,
          showing from under a pink T-shirt.

                         
          The camera pans up to the woman's arm and hand stopping the alarm-
          clock.

                         
          Close-Up on several familial pictures pinned on the wall.

                         
          Close-Up on the woman putting on a white sleeveless close-fitting
          T-shirt over her black lace bra. But we don't see the woman's
          head.

                         
          Close-Up on the woman's hand picking up cheap jewels from a table,
          and putting them on. On the table there is also an empty bottle of
          a strong alcoholic beverage.

          The Lotus is driving through a crossroad. The tires screech, and
          the car swings a little. Apparently, Edward is still having
          problems with his gear shift.
          The camera follows the car for a couple of seconds.

          moves backward and we see her in full. Another woman is going up
          the stairs.

          A dark street around Hollywood. The Lotus is driving slowly. The

          the hotel, and walks away on the street. The camera tilts slightly
          up and we see a painted inscription on the wall of the hotel that

          The camera pans around and comes down to street level.

                         
          The music fades out.

                         
          We hear the voice of an Afro-American man yelling.

                         
           THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)
           Welcome to Hollywood ! Everybody comes to Hollywood got a
           dream. What's your dream ? What's your dream ?

                         
          A young man with a red T-shirt and a white cap crosses the
          boulevard on a skateboard. He reaches the sidewalk and gets lost
          in the crowd. We see the Afro-American man. He is wearing a flashy
          printed shirt. He crosses the boulevard coming toward us.

                         

                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN
           Hey, mister ? Hey, what's your dream ?

                         
          Medium shot on a group of three young men seated on the sidewalk.
          One of them is the skateboard man we've just seen crossing the
          boulevard.

                         
          The young man stands up. He has apparently given something
          (drugs ?) to the two other ones.

                         

                          SKATEBOARD MAN
           Have a good one.

                         
          He jumps on his skateboard and rolls away. He passes Vivian who is
          walking toward us.

                         
          With the street lights, we get a better view of Vivian. She is a
          young woman in her early twenties. She is very tall and slim. She
          is a beautiful woman, even though her prostitute outfit and heavy
          make-up makes her a little less beautiful than she actually is.
          She is wearing a red jacket and a man's very large cap on her
          blonde wig. Underneath the jacket she is wearing her very short
          sleeveless white top, which is attached to her also very short
          blue skirt with a big metal ring. She is carrying a big bag
          strapped on her shoulder.

                         
           A WOMAN (voice over)
           What happened ?

                         
           A MAN (voice over)
           Some chick. She bought it over there.

                         
          Medium shot just a little further on the street. A young plain-
          cloth policeman is showing his badge to an afro-american man.

                         

                          THE POLICEMAN
           Detective Albertson. What do you know about that girl ?

                         

                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN
           I tell you, man. I don't know who she hang with.

                         
          Vivian walks behind them. She gives them a quick look, but doesn't
          stop.

                         

                          THE POLICEMAN
           Come on, guy. We just pulled her out of a Dumpster in the
           back. Who was her pimp ?

                         
          The camera follows Vivian, but we keep hearing what the two men
          are saying.

                         
           THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)
           Cocaine her pimp. She a strawberry. She be out on these
           streets day in, day out, trading her sorry self for some
           crack.

                         
          Vivian stops, and looks at something we don't see on the sidewalk.
          She turns her head away, not feeling well because of what she has
          just seen.

                         
           THE POLICEMAN (voice over)
           And what do you do ?

                         
          Back to the two men.

                         

                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN
           I'm cool.

                         
           THE POLICEMAN (snickering)
           Oh, I'll bet.

                         
          He turns around. Two tourists, a male and a female are taking
          snapshots of what is down on the pavement, and which we still
          haven't seen.

                         

                          THE POLICEMAN
           Hey, hey, hey ! Excuse me ! Excuse me ! What are you, from
           the press ?

                         

           THE FEMALE TOURIST
           No, no. We're from Orlando.

                         
          The policeman looks at his uniformed colleague.

                         

                          THE POLICEMAN
           Oh, I don't believe this. Do you... I got tourists
           photographing the body, Al.

                         
          The uniformed policeman starts pulling the tourists away.

                         
          Close-Up shot on a lit sign that says «The Blue Banana Club»,

                         
          Full shot from across the street, showing the entrance of the
          club, with the sign, that we've just seen, above the door.

                         
           WOMAN (voice over)
           What happened ?

          THE BLUE BANANA CLUB - MAIN ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Close up on a woman's hips moving in rhythm with the sound of the
          music. The camera tilts up and we discover she is painting a
          fresco on the wall of the club. The fresco represents various
          hippy-looking characters.

                         
          The camera pans along the fresco and then moves back into the
          crowd of the club. People are dancing. We hear the song «Show Me
          Your Soul» performed by Red Hot Chili Peppers.

                         

                          LYRICS
           In a world that can be so insane. I don't think it's very
           strange for me to be in love with you.

                         
          Vivian crosses the dance floor and stops near a staircase leading
          to the upper floor. She looks around, visibly looking for someone.

                         

                          LYRICS
           I wanna know more than your brain.
          Vivian walks to the bar. The bartender is an older man, nicknamed
          «Pops».

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hey, Pops, has Kit been in here ?

                         

                          POPS
           Upstairs in the poolroom.

                         
          Vivian goes to the staircase and start walking upstairs.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Not something that I respected. And now I smile for your
           affection. We have made a soul connection.

          Close shot on Kit De Luca sitting down, and bobbing her head up
          and down in rhythm with the music.

                         
          Kit is a girl in her early twenties. She is clearly shorter than
          Vivian, and has dark hair. She looks a bit Latino. Actually she
          from Italian origin. She is pretty, but not as beautiful as
          Vivian, and more vulgar. She is wearing sunglasses and is absently
          combing the front of her hairline.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Just for whom does your bell toll. Don't be cruel. Show me
           your soul.

                         
          Kit suddenly realizes that someone is standing near her and
          looking down at her. She stops combing her hair and looks up. She
          takes her glasses off and smiles.

                         

                          KIT
           Yo, Viv !
          Vivian doesn't smile back at her, and looks even a bit angry.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Is it all gone ?

                         
          Instead of answering her friend's question, she points to the
          people around her.

                         

                          KIT
           Carlos, you know my roommate, Vivian. This is Angel. That's
           the Dude.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I know everybody ! Is it all gone, Kit ?

                         

                          KIT
           Carlos sold me some great shit. We just had this party. I
           was the hostess.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I can't believe you bought drugs with our rent. What is
           going on with you, Kit ?
          Vivian grabs Kit's arm and makes her stand up.

                         

                          KIT
           I needed a little pick-me-up.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, we need rent money !

                         
          Carlos stands up and faces Vivian. He is a young Latino man.

                         

                          CARLOS
           Yo, calm down, chica. She only owes me 200 more.

                         

                          KIT
           Carlos !

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Another 200 dollars ?

                         

                          KIT
           That was from way before.

                         

                          CARLOS
           That's right, 200, Vivian. But if you wanna work off her
           money with me, we can work something out.

                         

                          KIT
           That's a very sweet offer, Carlos, but not now.

                         
          She grabs Vivian's arm and leads her to the staircase.

                         

                          KIT
           Come on, Viv. Come downstairs.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Work out... Work out what ? What are we gonna work out ?
          When they are gone, the girl named «Angel» looks at Carlos.

                         

                          ANGEL
           You really like her, Carlos ?

                         
          The music fades out.

                         

          THE BLUE BANANA CLUB - MAIN ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Vivian and Kit are walking down the staircase.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You took it while I was sleeping ?

                         

                          KIT
           You were unavailable for consultation.

                         
          Kit walks to the bar, and makes Vivian follow her.

                         

                          KIT
           Hey, let's go. Snack ! Snack !
          She has reached the bar and starts picking bits of food in plates
          on the counter.

                         

                          KIT
           Besides, it's my apartment.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah, well, I have to live there too, Kit.

                         

                          KIT
           Look, you came here. I gave you some money. I gave you a
           place to stay...

                         
          Close Up on Kit's hands picking food (olives, onions, cherries...)
          in the snack plates, and putting them on a paper napkin.

                         

                          KIT
           ...and some valuable vocational advice. He was on my case.
           I had to give him something.

                         
          Back to the two girls behind the bar.

                         

                          KIT
           So don't irritate me.

                         

                          POPS
           This ain't a buffet, Kit.

                         
          Kit moves around Vivian, sits on a stool at the bar, and starts
          eating.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Irritate you ? Irritate you ? I just saw a girl pulled out
           of a Dumpster.

                         
          She sits down on another stool.

                         

                          KIT
           I know. Skinny Marie. But... she was a... a flake. She was
           a crack head. Dominic was trying to straighten her out for
           months.

                         
          We hear people shouting in the background and glass being broken.
          The two girls turns their heads around for a second and then come
          back to their conversation at the bar.

           Don't you want to get out of here ?

                         

                          KIT
           Get out of where ? Where the fuck you wanna go ?

          Medium full shot on Vivian and Kit standing near a table on which
          a man is selling some souvenirs. Another prostitute is leaning on
          a tree. Kit walks toward the prostitute.

                         

                          KIT

          She is mentioning the stars of the Walk of Fame, embedded in the
          sidewalk of the boulevard.

           Brothers, we work Fred Astaire, we work all the way down to
           Ella Fitzgerald. This is our turf. We got seniority. You
           better get off our corner.

                         

                          RACHEL
           Forgive me. I was just taking a rest here. Besides, she's
           new.

                         

                          KIT
           Yeah. Well, I'm old, so go rest up by Monty Hall or Esther
           Wilson.

                         

                          RACHEL

                          KIT
           Esther Williams ! Where you belong !

                         

                          RACHEL
           Back off, Kit. You know, you're really becoming a grouch.

                         
          She walks away on the boulevard. Kit turns toward Vivian.

                         

                          KIT
           Am I really a grouch ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yes. Sometimes.

                          KIT
           Well, just 'cause I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get something to
           eat.

                         
          We hear someone whistling, and then :

                         
           MAN (voice over)
           Hey, girls.

                         
          Kit turns toward the boulevard, where the voice is coming from.

                         

                          KIT
           Hey, yo, baby !

                         
          Medium shot on an open convertible red car driving along the
          boulevard. In the car, three young men, two in the front, one in
          the back. The man sitting next to the driver, yells to the girls.

                         

           MAN IN THE CAR
           How about a freebie ? It's my birthday.

                         
          The car keeps on moving on the boulevard and out of view.
          Back on Vivian and Kit.

                         

                          KIT
           Dream on !

                         

                          VIVIAN
           It's looking really slow tonight.

                         
          She takes her cap off.

                         

                          KIT
           Yeah, well... maybe we should get a pimp, you know. Carlos
           really digs you.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           And then he'll run our lives and take our money. No.

                         

                          KIT
           You're right. We say who, we say when, we say how much.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Do you think I look like Carol Channing ?

                         
          Kit puts her hands on Vivian's blonde wig.

                         

                          KIT
           No ! I love this look. It's very glamorous. Glamour choice.

                         
          We hear brakes screeching. Kit turns around toward the noise.

                         

                          KIT
           Oh, yo, oh, yo. Catch this !

                         
          Full shot on the boulevard. The Lotus is driving along the
          boulevard. The car bounces a little, while the gears are grinding.

                         
          Back to the two girls watching the car. Vivian points to it.

                          VIVIAN
           Wait a minute. That's a Lotus Esprit.

                         
          We see the car passing in front of the girls. Apparently, it has
          stopped a little further on the boulevard, because we hear its
          brakes screeching.

                         
          Reverse angle shot showing the two girls with the stopped car
          behind them.

                         

                          KIT
           No, that's rent. You should go for him. You look hot
           tonight. Don't take less than a hundred. Call me when
           you're through. Take care of you.

                         
          Vivian hugs Kit.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Take care of you.

                         
          She takes her jacket off and puts it across her bag. She walks
          slowly toward the car.

                         
           KIT (voice over)
           Work it. Work it, baby. Work it ! Work it. Own it.

          Edward is sitting behind the wheel.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes, you can handle this.

           First is here somewhere.

                         
          We hear the gears grinding, but the shift doesn't want to move
          into first gear position.

                         
          Back to Edward sitting in his car. We see Vivian's back bending to
          look through the passenger's window.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hey, sugar, you looking for a date ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, I wanna find Beverly Hills. Can you give me
           directions ?

           Sure. For five bucks.

                          EDWARD
           Ridiculous.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Price just went up to ten.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You can't charge me for directions.

                         
          Reverse angle shot on Vivian's face.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I can do anything I want to, baby. I ain't lost.

          people, including Carlos, is looking at the scene.

                         

                          CARLOS

          Vivian grabs the 20 dollars bill, and puts it away.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           For twenty, I'll show you personal. Even show you where the
           stars live.

                         

                          EDWARD

          On the other side of the boulevard, the little group is still
          looking at the scene. They start crossing the boulevard.

           Vivian, did you forget ? I told you don't take no dates
           tonight.

          Edward tries to start the car, but he just starts the windshield
          wipers !

           Look, I use condoms always. I get checked out once a month
           at the free clinic. Not only am I better in the sack than
           an amateur, I am probably safer.

           I like that. That's very good. Should have that printed on
           your business card.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.

           sorry.

                         
          Back on the boulevard. A traffic light going from amber to red. We
          hear the tires screeching as the car stops.

           Down the block, right at the corner.

           They bought them cheap and fixed them up. I paid attention.
           So how is it you know so little about cars ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           My first car was a limousine.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh.

                         

                          EDWARD
           So where is this...

                         
          He tries to shift gears and gets another grinding noise.

                         

                          EDWARD
           ...heavy metal... home ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Milledgeville, Georgia. You know, I think you left your
           transmission back there. You're not shifting right. This is
           a standard «H».

                         

                          EDWARD
           Standard «H». Like I know what that means.

                         
          She laughs.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Have you ever driven a Lotus ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You're gonna start right now.

          HOLLYWOOD - A WIDE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Back on the shot through the windshield.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You're joking.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No. It's the only way I can get you off my coat.

                         
          Medium shot on a lingerie shop.

                         
          We see Vivian's head, and then the camera follows her as she
          climbs into the driver's seat. Edward closes his door on the
          passenger's side. Vivian closes her door and puts her seat belt
          on.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Fasten your seat belts. I am taking you for the ride of
           your life. I'm gonna show you what this car can really do.
           Are you ready ?

                          EDWARD
           I am ready.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hang on.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Okay.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Here we go.

                         
          She adjusts the back-view mirror.

                         
          Medium close-up shot of the car seen from the back with the camera
          set on the road. The car starts very fast, but also very
          smoothly : it is now driven by very expert hands.

                         
          Several shots of the car racing along the streets.

                         
          Shot of the the couple through the windshield.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           This has pedals like a race car. They're really close
           together. So it's probably easier for a woman to drive,
           because they have little feet. Except me. I wear a size
           nine.

                         

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You know your foot's as big as your arm from your elbow to
           your wrist ?

                         
          She shows her arm to Edward, who chuckles.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Did you know that ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, I didn't know that.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           It's a little bit of trivia.

                         
          Edward looks at her and smiles.

                         

          HOLLYWOOD - A WIDE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Shot of the couple seen through the windshield.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Tell me, what kind of... what kind of money you girls make
           these days ? Ballpark.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Can't take less than a hundred dollars.

                         

                          EDWARD
           A hundred dollars a night ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           For an hour.

                         

                          EDWARD
           An hour ? You make a hundred dollars an hour and you got a
           safety pin holding your boot up ? You gotta be joking.

                         

          LOTUS ESPRIT - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I never joke about money.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Neither do I. Hundred dollars an hour. Pretty stiff.

                         
          She puts her right hand on Edward's zipper.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, no. But it's got potential.

                         
          Edward doesn't react, but he looks at her in such a way that she
          feels she has better take her hand off his zipper.

                         

          BERVERLY HILLS - EXTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Several shots of the car driving fast in Beverly Hills.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          The tires of the car squeal as it makes a last fast turn to stop
          in front of the hotel.

                         
          Full shot. The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel is a very luxurious
          hotel, certainly one of the most expensive hotel of the Los
          Angeles area.
          Medium shot on a uniformed attendant, who is standing near the
          entrance of the hotel, and rushes to Edward's car.

                         
          Medium full shot on the Lotus parked in front of the hotel. The
          attendant opens the passenger's door of the car, while Vivian
          comes out of the car on her own.

                         

                          HOTEL ATTENDANT
           Good evening, Mr. Lewis. Will you be needing the car
           anymore tonight ?

                         

                          EDWARD (LAUGHING)
           I... I hope not !

                         
          He gets out of the car. The attendant closes the door and then
          moves away, while Vivian joins Edward on the sidewalk.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Ah. You're here.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yeah.
          He looks at her for a couple of second, before talking again.

                         

                          EDWARD
           So you'll be all right ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah, I'm gonna grab a cab with my twenty bucks.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Go back to your office.

                         
          She laughs.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah. My office. Yeah.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, thanks for the ride.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           See you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Good-bye.

                         
          Edward starts turning around to go inside the hotel, but doesn't
          do it, and instead looks back in Vivian's direction.

                         
          Medium shot on Vivian seated on the backrest of a public bench,
          with her feet resting on the bench itself. She puts her cap back
          on.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           No taxis ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No, I like the bus.
          Edward walks to the bench on which Vivian is sitting.

                         
          Quick medium shot on the uniformed attendant watching the scene
          with curiosity from the entrance of the hotel.

                         
          Back to Vivian and Edward.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I was thinking... Did you really say a hundred dollars an
           hour ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yeah... Well, if you don't have any prior engagements, I'd
           be very pleased if you would accompany me into the hotel.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You got it.
          She gets off the bench and laughs.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What is your name ?

                         
          They start walking toward the entrance of the hotel

                         

                          EDWARD
           Edward.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world !

                         
          He smiles.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No ?!

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I tell you what, this is fate, Edward. That's what this is.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why don't you put this on ?

                         
          He puts his coat, which he was carrying on his arm, on Vivian's
          shoulders, and then wraps it around Vivian's body, in order to
          cover as much as he can of Vivian's very conspicuous outfit.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Why ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, this hotel is not the kind of establishment that
           rents rooms by the hour.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Ah.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Medium shot on Edward and Vivian crossing the hotel lobby. While
          walking, Vivian puts her arms into the sleeves of the coat. Then
          she raises her eyes to look at the luxury around her.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Wow !

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           It's all right.

                         
          Medium full shot on the guests seated in comfortable armchairs
          near the front desk. All these guests are very elegantly dressed,
          and mostly middle-aged. They all look with curiosity at the
          strange couple that just walked in.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           Holy shit.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You're gonna be fine. Come with me. And stop fidgeting.
          Another medium shots on seated guests staring at the couple.

                         
          Edward walks to the reception desk, with Vivian following him. A
          very neatly dressed female receptionist is behind the counter.

                         

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
           Good evening, Mr. Lewis.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Hello. You have messages ?

                         

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
           Yes, we have several.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you.

                         
          While Edward is looking through his messages, Vivian is leaning on
          the wall near the reception desk and looks around her. She takes
          her cap off, but one still can see her strange outfit underneath
          the slightly open coat. She stares at a passing female guest who
          stares back at her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please ?

                         

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
           Of course.

                         
          She picks up the phone.

                         

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
           Room service for Mr. Lewis, please.

                         
          Edward slowly walks away from the desk, taking Vivian along with
          him.
          Medium shot on the elevator doors. Edward and Vivian reach the
          elevator, and Edward presses the call button. A middle-aged couple
          is already waiting for it. They both look at Vivian. Vivian turns
          around and notice their disapproving look. She raises her leg and
          puts the tip of her boot on the high ash-tray set near the door of
          the elevator, showing her thigh to the couple, and especially to
          the man.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh, honey. You know what's happened ? I've got a runner in
           my pantyhose.

                         
          She laughs and turns to the middle-aged couple.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm not wearing pantyhose.

                         
          We hear the ding of the elevator bell. Vivian puts her leg down.
          The elevator door opens on Dennis, the young elevator attendant.
          Vivian is the first one to walk in.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, color me happy ! There's a sofa in here for two.

                         
          Edward wants to let the middle-aged couple enter the elevator
          first. The man starts to move, but his wife holds him back.

          Reverse angle shot on Vivian sitting on the sofa at the back of
          the cabin. She puts one leg on the sofa. Dennis looks at her and
          smiles.

          Back on the entrance of the elevator. Edward starts to walk in the
          cabin. The middle-aged couple remains outside.

                         

                          EDWARD
           First time in an elevator.

                         

           THE FEMALE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE
           Ah...

                         
          She turns her head toward her husband.

                         

           THE FEMALE OF THE MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE
           Close your mouth, dear.

                         
          The door of the elevator closes.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Dennis doesn't look at the couple behind him, but he still has a
          very broad smile. Vivian stands up from the sofa.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Sorry, I couldn't help it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Try.

                         
          The elevator moves up. Dennis tries to look casual, but doesn't
          really succeed.

          Close shot on the elevator door. It opens.

                         

                          DENNIS
           Penthouse.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           The penthouse. Mmmm !

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes.

                         
          Vivian gets out of the elevator.

                         

                          EDWARD
           To the left.

                          VIVIAN
           Oh.

                         
          Edward gets out of the elevator. Dennis can't keep his eyes off
          Vivian, and watches her walking in the hallway. Edward turns
          around and looks at him a bit severely. Dennis wipes the smile off
          his face, goes back into the cabin of the elevator and closes the
          doors. The camera follows Edward walking away to the door of the
          penthouse, where Vivian is waiting for him. He gets his magnetic
          card out of his pocket.

                         
          Close Up on Edward's hands trying to insert the magnetic card into
          the slot in the lock of the door. He sighs.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh, I miss keys.

          Medium shot on the penthouse living room with the front door in
          the background. Everything - the rug on the floor, the furniture -
          is nice and very classy. All the lights are on. The front door
          opens.

                         
          Edward walk in first, followed by Vivian. He switches more lights
          on. Vivian closes the door and starts walking around the huge
          living room. Edward looks at her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Impressed ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You kidding me ? I come here all the time. As a matter of
           fact, they do rent this room by the hour.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Sure they do.
          Edward has been taking a newspaper left by an attendant on a small
          table near the front door. He crosses the room and and drops the
          newspaper on the desk. He sits down behind the desk, and starts
          looking through his mail, while Vivian walks out on the terrace.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace)
           Wow, great view ! I bet you can see all the way to the
           ocean from out here.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'll take your word for it, because I don't go out there.

                         
          Vivian walks in the room through another French window-door on the
          other side of the desk. She puts her bag on an armchair.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Why don't you go out there ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm afraid of heights.

                          VIVIAN
           You are ?

                         
          Edward nods his head.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So how come you rented the penthouse ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the
           first floor, but I can't find one.

                         
          Vivian takes off Edward's coat and puts in on a sofa.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do
           with me ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Want to know something ? I don't have a clue.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I hadn't exactly planned this.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, do you plan everything ?

                         
          She takes her red jacket off.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Always.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah. Me too.
          She sits down on an armchair.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was
           a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of «fly by the
           seat of my pants» girl. You know, moment to moment. That's
           me. That's... Yeah.

                         
          Edward, still seated behind his desk, watches her with a strange
          look in his eyes. He suddenly realizes that perhaps he hasn't done
          something very wise in bringing Vivian with him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe
           break the ice.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

                         
          He takes his wallet out of this jacket.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Cash works for me, yeah.

                         
          She stands up and walks to the desk. Edward puts the money on the
          desk. She takes the money and sits on the desk. She puts the money
          in one of her high boots.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You're on my fax.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, that's one I haven't been on before.

                         
          She doesn't stand up but moves slightly in a very suggestive way.
          Edward takes his fax, but doesn't seem to react at Vivian's
          suggestive movements.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Cute. Very cute. Thank you.

                         
          She laughs, and zips one of her boots down. Out of the boot, she
          takes several condoms wrapped in cellophane paper.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I
           got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold
           circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and
           only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you
           say ? Hmm ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           A buffet of safety.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm a safety girl.

                         
          Edward stands up from his desk. Immediately Vivian reaches for his
          zipper.

                          VIVIAN
           All right, let's get one of these on you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, no. I...

                         
          He laughs awkwardly.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay ?

                         
          He takes his jacket off, and puts it on the back of the desk
          chair.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh,
           business or pleasure ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Business, I think.

                         
          He walks away from the desk across the room.

                          VIVIAN
           Business, you think.

                         
          She zips her boot back up, stands up and follows him across the
          room.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well... let me guess.

                         
          Edward, now in his shirtsleeves, but still with his necktie and
          his vest on, has seated himself in an armchair.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           That would make you... a lawyer.

                         
          She sits downs on a low pouf in front of his armchair.

                         

                          EDWARD
           A lawyer ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Mm-hmm.

                         

                          EDWARD
           What makes you think I'm a lawyer ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I've known a lot of everybody.

                         
          The doorbell chimes. They both stand up.

                          VIVIAN
           What is that ?

                         
          He turns around and find his face very close to Vivian's face, and
          seems a little disturbed by it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Champagne.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load
           off.

                         
          The doorbell chimes again.

                         
          Vivian runs across the room to the front door and opens it. A room
          service male attendant comes in carrying a loaded tray. Vivian
          closes the door behind him.

                         

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
           Good evening.

                          VIVIAN
           Hi.

                         

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
           Uh, where would you like it ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Where would we like it ?

                         
          Edward has seated himself back in the armchair.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh, over by the bar.

                         
          The attendant seems a little surprised by Vivian's outfit, but,
          being a good luxury hotel attendant, he pretends not to notice,
          and carries the tray onto the bar. After he has put the tray down,
          he turns around and almost bumps into Vivian, who was standing
          behind him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Excuse me !

                         
          She giggles.

                         

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
           It'll be on your bill, Mr. Lewis.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you.

                         
          The attendant doesn't move away and remains close to Vivian,
          staring at her.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What are you looking at ?

                         
          The attendant clears his throat.

                          VIVIAN
           What is he looking at ?

                         
          Edward walks toward the attendant, and gives him some tip money.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.

                         

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
           Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice night.

                         
          The attendant walks out of the room. Edward walks to the bar.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh.
           (in a much softer voice)
           Stupid.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Don't worry about it.
          Edward sets the champagne glasses on the bar.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You mind if I take my boots off ?

                         
          She sits down on the steps that run across the room, separating it
          in two slightly different levels.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Not at all.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ?

                         
          She zips one of her boots down.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I have both.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Where are they ? Shopping together ?

                         
          She takes her knee-length sock off. We hear the champagne bottle
          cork popping off.

                         

                          EDWARD
           My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home...
           with my ex-dog.

                         
          He brings her a glass of Champagne, which he sets down on the
          floor besides her. Vivian is taking her other boot off.

                         

                          EDWARD
           There you go.

                         
          He walks back to the bar to take his own glass.

                         

                          EDWARD
           My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York... moving out of
           my apartment even as we speak.

                         
          He looks at her, a bit surprised.

                         
          Vivian is draining her glass empty. Edward comes near her, with a
          silver bowl in his hands. In the bowl are some fresh strawberries.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why don't you try a strawberry ?

                         
          He takes the lid off the bowl and shows it to her.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Why ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           It brings out the flavor in the champagne.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh, groovy.
          She takes a strawberry and eats it. Edward closes the bowl and
          brings it back on the bar. He sits down on a stool.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Pretty good. Don't you drink ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           No.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Listen, I... I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've
           got going, but let me give you a tip : I'm a sure thing,
           okay ? So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it
           along ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue
           with you.

                         
          He stands up.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why don't we just get through that right now ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Great, let's get started.

                         

                          EDWARD
           How much for the entire night ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Stay here ?

                          (SHE SNICKERS)
           You couldn't afford it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Try me.

                          VIVIAN
           Three hundred dollars.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.

                         
          He takes the glass off her hand. She stands up.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night ? I
           mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way.

                         
          She walks to the bar, where Edward is filling the glass with
          Champagne.

                         

                          EDWARD
           To tell you the truth, I don't feel like being alone
           tonight.

                         
          He gives her the glass, and she immediately drinks it. He sits
          down on the stool.

                          VIVIAN
           Why ? Is it your birthday or something ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           No.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I mean, I have been the party at a couple of birthdays.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I bet you have.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So what do you want me to do ?

                         
          He doesn't answer immediately, remains pensive for a couple of
          seconds, and then looks at her. He laughs.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I don't know. I really don't know.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Close Up on the sink, and Vivian's hands been washed. She turns
          the faucet off and takes an white towel to dry her hands.

                         
          The camera tilts up to Vivian's face, who walks to the door.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to
           me.

                         
          She closes the door, and goes back to the sink. Edward re-opens
          the door and enters the bathroom.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I didn't hear you. What did you say ?
          Vivian hides something behind her back, but her hand in her back
          can be seen in one of the bathroom mirror.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Uh... I said I'd be out in just a minute.

                         
          Edward looks worried. He points to her

                         

                          EDWARD
           What is... What do you have in, uh, your hand there ? What
           are you hiding ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Nothing.

                         
          He walks toward her and sighs. He grabs her by the arm and moves
          her toward the door. He takes her hand bag

                         

                          EDWARD
           All right, look. I do not want any drugs here. I don't want
           any of this. Get your things and your money and please
           leave.
          She gets rid of his hand.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I don't do drugs, all right ? I... I stopped doing drugs
           when I was fourteen.

                         

                          EDWARD
           What is this ? What is this ?

                         
          Close Up on Vivian's hand, which Edward is opening by force. She
          was hiding a little box of dental floss. Edward has put Vivian's
          bag under his arm.

                         

                          EDWARD
           This is dental floss.

                         
          She takes her dental floss back.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah ? So ? I had all those strawberry seeds. And you
           shouldn't neglect your gums.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm sorry. Please continue.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Thank you.

                         
          She walks to the sink. He start walking across the room, but stops
          in his tracks, and looks at her. She turns around from the sink
          and looks at him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Are you gonna watch ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, I'm going.
          He gives the handbag back to her.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Thank you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           It's just that, uh, very few people surprise me.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah, well, you're lucky. Most of them shock the hell out
           of me.

                         
          He nods his head. She goes back to the sink and brings a piece of
          dental floss to her mouth, stops, and brings it down. She turns
          around.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You're watching.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm going.
          He closes the door. Vivian starts cleaning her teeth with dental
          floss.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Close Up shot on the TV screen, where an old black and white
          episode of «I love Lucy» is being played. It is episode 23 from
          Season 5, called «Lucy's Italian Movie». Lucy is standing close to
          a huge bucket full of grapes, and seems a bit reluctant to climb
          into it. Behind her, a fat Italian lady is speaking Italian to
          her.

                         
          We hear recorded laughs coming from the TV set.

                         
          The camera moves away from the TV set.

                         
          We hear Edward's voice speaking on the telephone.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Yes, that may be true, Vance.

                         
          We hear Vivian laughing.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Yes, I know, but I still need the numbers on Morse
           Industries.

                         
          On the TV screen, the Italian fat lady is climbing into the bucket
          full of grapes.

                         
          The camera keeps on moving away from the TV set, and we discover
          Vivian sitting on the floor and drinking Champagne. And, behind
          her, we see Edward sitting on an armchair near a small table on
          which the telephone set is resting. Edward is writing on a
          document resting on his laps.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh-huh. I've got them from London. I need them now from
           Tokyo. I'll call down and get them when I want them. Thank
           you very much.

                         
          He puts the phone down back on its hook.

                         
          Medium high angle shot on Vivian sitting on the floor, with all
          kinds of goodies around her, including the Champagne bottle in its
          bucket.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I have a little carpet picnic here. Are you sure you don't
           want a drink ?

                         
          Back on Edward, still writing on the document on his laps. He
          snorts.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm high on life. Can't you tell ?

                         
          Quick shot on Vivian laughing.
          Medium shot on the TV screen, where Lucy is putting a reluctant
          foot in the bucket. Close Up on her foot reaching into the grapes.
          She screams with a wide open mouth.

                         
          Back on Vivian changing position and lying on her stomach to be
          more comfortable to watch TV. She laughs.

                         
          Edward watches her without moving from his armchair.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           You know, I never saw this episode.

                         
          Edward chuckles. And then he stands up.

                         
          Vivian is still lying on the floor, laughing. Edward sits down on
          the sofa next to her.

                         
          Shot on the TV screen, where Lucy is stomping the grapes, with a
          disgusted face. We hear Vivian laughing very loudly.

                         
          Close Up on Vivian's face laughing and holding the glass of
          Champagne. She looks up at Edward, still seated on the sofa.

                         
          Close shot on Edward looking at Vivian

          face.

                         
          Close Up shot on Edward's face looking at Vivian.

                         
          Back to Vivian. We hear the recorded laughs coming from the TV
          set. Vivian stands up on her arms and knees and walks on all four
          toward the sofa.

                         
          Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and the other woman are
          stomping the grapes.

                         
          High angle shot on Vivian on her knees near the sofa. She puts a
          hand up inside Edward's pants leg. Edward snorts.

                         
          On the TV screen, Lucy now seems to be enjoying her grapes
          stomping.

                         
          Still resting on her knees, Vivian is taking her white top off her
          shoulders. She slips it down, and because the top is attached to
          the skirt, the skirt comes down with it. Vivian is now wearing
          only her black lace underwear and bra. Vivian puts the top and the
          skirt away from her on the floor, and bends down on the seated
          Edward. Suddenly, she stands up and walks away. Edward seems
          surprised. But she comes back with a cushion that she drops on the
          floor, and then kneels on it. She takes the TV remote control from
          the table by the sofa, and presses a button on it.

                         
          On the TV screen, Lucy and the Italian lady are still stomping the
          grapes, but the sound shuts off.

                         
          Back to the sofa. Closer shot. Vivian puts the remote control back
          on the table. Then she leans on Edward, and starts taking his
          necktie off. Edward puts his hand on her hair, and seems
          surprised : he hadn't realized it was a wig.
          Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and her Italian friend are
          now dancing on the grapes.

                         
          Back to the sofa, where Vivian is taking Edward's pants off. She
          opens his shirt on his chest, and bends on it.

                         
          Close Up on their two faces, very close to each other.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What do you want ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           What do you do ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Everything. But I don't kiss on the mouth.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Neither do I.

                         
          She bends on his chest and starts kissing him on the chest, going
          down. She stops to look at the TV.

                         
          On the TV screen, the Italian lady is throwing grapes in Lucy's
          face.

                         
          Back to Vivian, who smiles and resumes her kissing job on Edward's
          chest.

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Edward is in the shower, hot water pouring on his head. He opens
          his eyes and seems to think about what just happened. He turns
          around to turn the water off.

          head.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Edward is just out of the bathroom, wearing a white bathrobe. He
          puts his towel around his neck. He bends on the armchair, and
          picks up one of Vivian's bracelet. The camera pans away from the
          armchair, showing Vivian's clothes and stuff scattered around,
          including her blonde wig.

                         
          Edward looks at Vivian's things, then turns his head around toward
          the bed. He looks at the bed for a couple of seconds without
          moving, then starts walking toward the bed.

          bed, her long red hair scattered around her head.

                         
          Edward walks away from the bed.

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          Early morning.

                         
          Full shot on the façade of the hotel. Two men are cleaning the
          sidewalk in front of the hotel, one with a water hose, the other
          one with a big broom. A uniformed attendant is watching them,
          standing near the main door of the hotel. The man holding the
          broom walks toward the attendant.

                         

           THE MAN WITH THE BROOM
           Hey, how you doing there ?

                         

           THE UNIFORMED ATTENDANT
           All right.

          Medium full shot of the lobby.

                         
          At his early hour, there are not many guests in the lobby of the
          hotel, only a chambermaid dusting a table, and three uniformed
          attendants talking together.

                         
          Barnard Thompson, the manager of the hotel, crosses the lobby,
          wearing a very elegant dark suit, and carrying a black briefcase.

                         
          Barnard Thompson will be later in the film nicknames «Barney» by
          Vivian. It is this nickname that we shall use to refer to him in
          the dialogues.

                         

                         

                          BARNEY
           Good morning, gentlemen.

           ONE OF THE UNIFORMED ATTENDANT
           Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Good morning, good morning.

                         
          He keeps on walking toward the reception desk.

                         

                          ANOTHER ATTENDANT
           Good morning, sir.

                         
          Behind the desk, three clerks, two females and one male

                         

           ONE OF THE FEMALE CLERKS
           Good morning.

                         

           THE OTHER FEMALE CLERK
           Good morning, Mr. Thompson.

                         
          A chambermaid is cleaning some leather armchairs around a low
          table in front of the desk. Without interrupting his walk, Barney
          turns his head toward her.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Good morning, Marjorie.

                         
          She waves her hand to him.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          A uniformed waiter, with white glove, is setting the breakfast
          table. Edward enters the room, wearing a dark-colored night-robe,
          and with a wireless telephone receiver stuck between his head and
          his shoulder.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Of course Morse is going to fight. It's to be expected.
           He's run his company for a very long time now. I don't
           think he's ready to have his name taken off the stationery.

                         
          Edward signs the bill the waiter has shown to him.

          Medium shot of Philip sitting behind the breakfast table. He is
          talking to Edward on the telephone. On the table in front of him,
          a cup, white china pots and a glass of orange juice.

                         

                          PHILIP
           He wants to meet you face to face, hmm...

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
           EDWARD (whispering to the waiter)
           Okay.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over from the telephone)
           I wouldn't do it.

                          EDWARD
           Sure, you wouldn't. But do it anyhow. Tonight. Dinner. Set
           it up.

                         
          Edward sits on a chair at the breakfast table.

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         

                          PHILIP
           Oh, Edward, Edward. I... Look, it's really not a good idea
           that you see him.

                         
          A middle-aged maid walks behind him with a glass jar of coffee,
          fresh from the percolator. She wants to pour some coffee in
          Philip's cup, but, with his free hand, he moves her away.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Definitely not alone.

                          (HE CHUCKLES)
           You know ? He's a feisty old guy. You know, we say the
           wrong thing...
           (He snaps his fingers)
           ...we could wind up in court.

                         
          The maid walks out of the room.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, you know, there's always a possibility things are
           gonna go wrong.

                         
          The waiter leaves the room, and Vivian walks in from the bedroom,
          wearing a white bathrobe.

                         

                          EDWARD
           That's why I enjoy this so much. Oh, by the way, Phil,
           about your car.

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Suddenly, Philip has a worried look on his face.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Oh, God. What ?

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Vivian stops in the middle of the room, behind Edward's back.

                         

                          EDWARD
           It corners like it's on rails.

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         

                          PHILIP
           What ? What does that mean ?

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
           PHILIP (voice over on the telephone)
           Edward ? Edward !

                         
          He presses the «off» button on the telephone and puts it on the
          table. He picks up his newspaper. Vivian has not moved from the
          spot where she had stopped in the middle of the living room.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hi.

                         
          Edward turns around and smiles to Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, good morning.

                         
          She slightly touches her hair.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Red.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Better.

                          VIVIAN
           Y...You didn't wake me. I can see you're really busy. I'm
           gonna be out of here in just a minute.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, there's no hurry. Are you hungry ? You must be.

                         
          He stands up from the table.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why don't you sit and have something to eat ?

                         
          She walks slowly to the table.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I, uh, took the liberty of ordering everything on the menu.

                         
          Close Up shot on the table. Edward takes off the metal lids that
          were covering two plates. One has scrambled eggs and bacon, the
          other one has pancakes and strawberries.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I didn't know what you'd like.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Thanks.

                         

                          EDWARD
           All right ? Good.

                         
          Edward puts the lids on the table. Vivian takes a pancake and
          walks slowly to the terrace. She seems embarrassed.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Did you sleep well ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah, too good.

                         
          Vivian enters the terrace.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace)
           I forgot where I was.

                         
          Edward has seated himself at the breakfast table and is working on
          some documents.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Occupational hazard ?

                         
          She comes back into the room and chuckles.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah. Did you sleep ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh, yes, a little, on the couch.

                         
          She sits down on the table near Edward.

                          EDWARD
           I was, uh, working last night.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You don't sleep, you don't do drugs, you don't drink, you
           hardly eat. What do you do, Edward ? Because I know you're
           not a lawyer.

                         
          He laughs.

                         

                          EDWARD
           That's right.

                         
          He looks at her sitting on the table, and points to the chairs
          around the table.

                         

                          EDWARD
           There are four other chairs here.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh.

                         
          She stands up and walks to an empty chair. She sits on it with one
          foot on the chair and her knee up above table level. She goes on
          eating breakfast.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So what do you do ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I buy companies.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What kind of companies ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh, I buy companies that are in financial difficulty.

                          VIVIAN
           If they have problems, you must get them for a bargain,
           huh ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, the company I'm buying this week, I'm getting for the
           bargain price of about one billion.

                         
          She almost chokes on her pancake.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           A billion dollars ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Wow. You must be really smart, huh ?

                         
          He chuckles.

                          VIVIAN
           I only got through the eleventh grade. How far did you go
           in school ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I went all the way.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Your folks must be really proud, huh ?

                         
          He doesn't answer and just smiles.

                         
          She keeps on eating and tries to peak at the documents in front of
          him.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Edward is in shirtsleeves and vest, in front of the mirror,
          knotting his tie. Vivian walks in.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So you don't actually have a billion dollars, huh ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, I get some of it from banks, investors. It's not an
           easy thing to do.

                         
          She sits down on the table in front of him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           And you don't make anything.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           And you don't build anything.

                          EDWARD
           No.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So what do you do with the companies once you buy them ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I sell them.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Here, let me do that.

                         
          She grabs his necktie and starts knotting it properly.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You sell them ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, I... don't sell the whole company. I break it up into
           pieces... and then I sell that off. It's worth more than
           the whole.
          Close Up shot on Edward's necktie, and Vivian's hands knotting it.

                         
          Back on a medium shot of Vivian working on Edward's tie.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So it's sort of like, um, stealing cars and selling them
           for the parts, right ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yeah, sort of. But legal.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mm-hmm.

                         
          Close Up on Edward's tie, which is now very well knotted.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           There. See, now it's perfect.

                         
          Edward puts a final hand on his tie.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Not bad. Not bad at all. Where'd you learn to do that ?

                         
          She stands up and goes out of the room.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, I screwed the debate team in high school.

                         
          She comes back with his jacket, and helps him put in on.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I had a grandpa ! He was nice to me. He liked ties on
           Sundays. Mind if I, um, take a swim in your tub before I
           go ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Not at all. Just stay in the shallow end.
          He goes out of the bathroom, followed, a couple of seconds later,
          by Vivian.

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          The breakfast has been cleared away. Philip's expensive leather
          attaché-case is lying on the table, supporting a big agenda.
          Philip is on the phone.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over on the phone)
           Hello ?

                         

                          PHILIP
           Edward, it's Phil. Listen, I'm running out the door.

          Medium shot. Edward is speaking on a regular cord phone.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           I just wanted to let you know, Morse is all set for
           tonight.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh, that's good.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           He's bringing his grandson.

                          PHILIP
           He's grooming him to take over. I don't know.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         

                          EDWARD
           Ah, yes. Very intense young man named David. He plays polo.

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         

                          PHILIP
           Look, I gotta say this again. I don't like you going alone,
           you know.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          In the background, we hear Vivian singing «Kiss» by Prince... not
          very well !

                         
           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)
           I just want your extra time and your...

                         
          The rest of the song is covered by what Philip is saying to Edward
          over the phone.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           Look... Well, I just think it'd be better if you... if you
           went with a date.
           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)
           Uh-oh !

                         
          Edward walks out of the bedroom, carrying the telephone set.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           You know ? Keep it social.

                         
          He chuckles in the phone.

                         
           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)
           Uh - uh - uh !

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Still carrying the phone set and with the phone receiver on his
          ear, Edward enters the bathroom.

                         
           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)
           Got to know talk, baby, baby !
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           Edward ? Did you hear me ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm here.

                         
          He walks to the bathtub, where Vivian is immersed in a foam-bath.
          She has earphones on her ears, and she is singing with her eyes
          closed.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)
           If you want to impress me...

                         
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           What is that ?

                         
          Edward is standing near the bathtub, but Vivian, because of the
          loud music in her earphones and her closed eyes, doesn't seem to
          notice him.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)
           Oh-oh-oh...

                         

                          EDWARD
           Housekeeping is singing.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)
           Got to be too flirty, Mama...

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Philip seems a bit surprised by what he hears over the telephone.

                         
           VIVIAN (singing in voice over in the phone)
           I know how to undress me...

                         
          Philip tries to concentrate on what he is saying to Edward.

                          PHILIP
           Yeah... listen.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Edward is still standing near the bathtub with the telephone to
          his ear.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           Edward, I know a lot of nice girls.

                         
          Edward snorts.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, you don't.

                         
          Medium shot on the bathtub, where Vivian is still singing with her
          eyes closed. We see the yellow walkman lying on the bathtub edge
          near her head. She is holding the water faucet with one hand.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)
           I just want your extra time and your...
          She makes loud kisses with her mouth.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)
           Kiss...

                         
          Back to Edward standing near the bathtub.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Besides, I already have one.

                         
           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)
           If you want to impress me...

                         
          Edward starts walking around the bathtub to get closer to Vivian's
          head.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You just concentrate on finding out what Morse is up to.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)
           Uh-uh, you can't be too flirty, mama.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm on my way.

                         
          High angle close-up shot on Vivian's head.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)
           I know how to undress me Mm-hmm...

                         
          Slight low angle shot of Edward. He has put the telephone set down
          somewhere, and he is looking at Vivian, smiling.

                         
           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)
           Yeah, baby...

                         
          He sits down on the bathtub edge.
           VIVIAN (singing in voice over)
           I want to be your fantasy. Well, maybe you could be mine.

                         
          Back to Vivian singing in the bathtub.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SINGING)
           Mm-hmm You just leave it. All up to me.

                         
          She opens her eyes and notices Edward sitting on the edge of the
          bathtub close to her. She laughs.

                         
          Edward also laughs looking at her.

                         
          Vivian takes off her earphones, and puts them on the edge with the
          Walkman.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Don't you just love Prince ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           More than life itself.

                          VIVIAN
           Don't you knock ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Vivian, I have a business proposition for you.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What do you want ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm gonna be in town until Sunday. I'd like you to spend
           the week with me.

                         
          Vivian smiles, not believing what she just heard.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Really ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes. Yes, I'd like to hire you as an employee. Would you
           consider spending the week with me ?

                         
          She laughs awkwardly.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I will pay you to be at my beck and call.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Look, I'd love to be your «beck and call girl», but, uh,
           you're a rich, good-looking guy. You could get a million
           girls free.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I want a professional. I don't need any romantic hassles
           this week.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           If you're talking twenty-four hours a day, it's gonna cost
           you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh, yes, of course !

                         
          He stands up.

                         

                          EDWARD
           All right, here we go. Give me a ballpark figure. How
           much ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Six full nights, days too. Four thousand.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Six nights at three hundred is eighteen hundred.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You want days too.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Two thousand.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Three thousand.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Done.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Holy shit !

                         
          She laughs, and dives her head underwater.

                         
          Medium full shot of Edward bending over the bathtub.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Vivian ?

                         
          He talks louder for her to be able to hear him underwater.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Vivian, is that a yes ?

                         
          She taps her feet on the bottom of the bathtub.

                         
          Closer shot of Vivian coming out of the water, her face all
          covered with foam.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yes.

                         
          She brushes the foam off her face. Edward dries her face with a
          white towel. She spits water and laughs.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yes !

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
          Edward is coming out of the bedroom, followed by Vivian. Vivian is
          wearing a white bathrobe, and her head is wrapped in a white
          towel.

                         
          Edward has taken his wallet out of his pocket and he is giving
          several banknotes to Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'll be gone most of the day. I want you to buy some
           clothes.

                         
          Vivian looks at the thick wad of banknotes he just gave her.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You really should think about traveler's checks.

                         
          Edward keeps on walking across the room, with Vivian following
          him.

                         

                          EDWARD
           We may be going out evenings. You'll need something to
           wear.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Like what ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh, nothing too flashy. Not too sexy.

                         
          He stops at the breakfast table, put some documents back in his
          brief-case and closes it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Conservative. You understand ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Boring.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Elegant. Any questions ?

                         
          He picks up his brief-case and walks to the front door.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Can I call you Eddie ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Not if you expect me to answer.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I would've stayed for two thousands.

                         
          He had almost reached the door, but he comes back to face her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I would've paid four. I'll see you tonight.

                         
          He walks to the front door.

                          VIVIAN
           Baby, I'm gonna treat you so nice, you're never gonna wanna
           let me go.

                         
          He has opened the door but he turns around.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Three thousand for six days. And, Vivian, I will let you
           go.

                         
          He goes out and closes the door. Vivian smiles and speaks very
          quietly.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           But I'm here now.

                         
          She laughs and runs toward the bedroom.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          She laughs and screams, and jumps on the bed. Still laughing
          wildly, she rolls on the bed.

                          VIVIAN
           Three thousand dollars !

                         
          She kicks the bed with her foot. Then she remains quiet for a
          couple of seconds, gets rid of the towel on her head, and sits up
          on the bed.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oof !

                         
          She picks up the telephone set on the night table and puts it on
          the bed.

                         

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - KIT'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Kit is asleep with a scarf spread on her head. She is wearing a
          blue T-shirt. On the night table, various fast food items. The
          phone rings. Kit starts up, and gets rid of the scarf. She pushes
          the covers away, and, in the bed with her, we discover a Teddy
          Bear with a red sweater. She picks up the phone from the floor.

                         

                          KIT

          Vivian is still seated on the bed, with the phone receiver on her
          ear.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I called and called. Where were you last night ?

                         

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - KIT'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Kit sits up on her bed, suddenly worried.

                         

                          KIT
           Ma ?

           It's Viv.

                         
          Kit relaxes.

           Oh, man. Are you ready for this ? The guy ? The Lotus ? I
           am in his hotel room in Beverly Hills. The penthouse. His
           bathroom is bigger than the Blue Banana !

          Kit has taken a big paper cup, with a straw stuck in it, from the
          night-table.

                          KIT
           Do I have to hear this ?

          Vivian is getting very serious.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Kit, he wants me to stay the whole week. And you know what
           he's gonna give me ?

           Guess. You'll never guess.

                         
          Kit drinks some soda from her cup.

           Three thousand dollars.

          between her head and her shoulder.

          Kit enters the kitchen and puts her soda cup on the table. The
          room is a mess. Dirty dishes in the sink. Table covered with food
          and junk. Clothes hanging to dry in the shower cubicle.

                         

                          KIT

           Yeah.

                         

                          KIT

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium shot. Near the reception desk, the hotel manager, Barnard
          «Barney» Thompson is talking with an Italian male guest and an
          older lady seated in a wheelchair. The Italian guest is showing a
          business card to Barney and talking in Italian.

                         
          Vivian crosses the lobby, dressed in the same prostitute outfit as
          the day before, but without her wig. She has her large handbag
          across her shoulder and her red jacket is tied around her waist.
          Barney gives her a quick look, but goes back to his conversation
          with the Italian guest. He takes the card the Italian is holding.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Ah !

                         
          Medium shot on the reception desk. Miss Wilson, a blonde
          bespectacled receptionist girl is behind the desk.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hi.

                         

                          MISS WILSON
           Yes, ma'am. May I help you ?

                         
          Vivian puts an envelope on the desk.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah, I'm leaving this here for Kit De Luca. She's gonna
           pick it up.

                         
          The receptionist takes the envelope and looks at it.

                          VIVIAN
           Don't open that.

                         

                          MISS WILSON
           No, ma'am.

                         
          Back on Barney and the Italian guests.

                         

                          [ SPEAKING ITALIAN ]

                         

           THE ITALIAN GUEST
           Multo Grazie. Arrivederci.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Arrivederci.

                         
          Vivian walks near them, with the high heels of her boots clicking
          on the floor. The Italian starts pushing the wheelchair. Barney
          looks at Vivian.

                         

           THE ITALIAN GUEST
           Andiamo.

                         
          Reverse angle shot on the lobby. Vivian keeps on walking quite
          fast, and barely avoids bumping into an uniformed hotel attendant
          loaded with luggage.

                         
          Reverse angle shot on Barney still standing at the same place. He
          turns his head toward the desk.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Miss Wilson, do you know that lady ?

                         

                          MISS WILSON
           No, sir.

                         
          Barney turns back toward the departing Vivian.

          Full shot of the building of the hotel.

                         
          We hear the song «Wild Women Do», performed by Natalie Cole.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Wild women do. And they don't regret it.

                         
          The camera pans down to street level and away from the hotel into
          Rodeo Drive.

                         

          RODEO DRIVE - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          The camera pans along the expensive shop along Rodeo Drive. Many
          well-dressed people are walking on the sidewalk. Several are
          carrying bags from the shops.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Wild women show what they're going through.
          The camera crosses the street on a crosswalk. Vivian is walking on
          this crosswalk.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Ooh ! Wild women do what you think you'll never.

                         
          Vivian looks at the pedestrians, so different from the ones she is
          used to see on Hollywood Boulevard.

                         
          Several quick Close Up shots on various emblems above the shops :
          «Louis Vuitton», «Chanel», «Diamonds on Rodeo» «Gucci»

                         

                          LYRICS
           What you only dream about wild women do.

                         
          Mediums shot. Vivian stops near a jewel shops and looks in the
          window at the expensive jewels. She then moves away, looking
          around and smiling.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Oh, yes, they do.
          Vivian keeps on walking looking up at the emblems. She apparently
          doesn't notice that several pedestrians are looking at her,
          surprised by her «costume».

                         

                          LYRICS
           You tell me you want a woman who is simple as a flower.

                         
          Close shots on the beautiful clothes in the windows and then at
          Vivian smiling and looking at the clothes.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Well, if you want me to act like that, you've got to pay me
           by the hour.

                         
          A convertible BMV drives on the street. Both the male driver and
          the female passenger are talking on their cell phones.

                         

          BOUTIQUE - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          A very expensive «boutique». A saleswoman and an old lady are
          seated on a sofa. The saleswoman is showing some items of clothing
          to the old lady. Through the window, we see Vivian walking toward
          the entrance of the shop.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Wild women do and they don't regret it.

                         
          Close shot on another saleswoman, who is arranging some flowers in
          a big vase. She is very neatly dressed and looks a bit snobbish.

                         
          Vivian enters the shop. The saleswoman seated on the sofa looks up
          at her.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Oh, wild women show what they're going through.

                         
          A third saleswoman, wearing a black jacket and standing behind a
          counter, looks up at Vivian. The saleswoman, who is arranging the
          flowers, also looks at Vivian.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Oooh-whoo ! Ooh, yeah.

                         
          Vivian stops to look around and then walks to dresses hanging on a
          rail, and starts looking at them.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Wild women do what you think you'll never.

                         
          The music fades out.

                         
          High angle shot on the whole shop. The saleswoman (Saleswoman #
          1), who was arranging the flower, is now standing behind Vivian.

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           May I help you ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, I'm just checking things out.

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           Are you looking for something in particular ?

                         
          Medium shot on Vivian and the saleswoman. Vivian has moved away
          from the hanging rail.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No. Well, yeah. Uh... something... conservative.

                         
          She looks at a dummy wearing a very elegant suit. The saleswoman
          looks up and down at Vivian's «costume», and answers with a forced
          smile.

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           Yes.

                         
          Vivian walks away to watch other items in the shop.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You got nice stuff.

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           Thank you.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           How much is this ?

                         
          Vivian looks at another dummy wearing a very elegant light-colored
          dress. The saleswoman (Saleswoman # 2) with the black jacket has
          joined them.

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           I don't think this would fit you.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it
           was.
          The saleswoman # 1 turns toward her colleague.

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           How much is this, Marie ?

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 2
           It's very expensive.

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           It's very expensive.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Look, I got money to spend in here.

                         
          She starts walking nervously around the shop.

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           I don't think we have anything for you. You're obviously in
           the wrong place. Please leave.

                         
          The two saleswoman are staring at Vivian, who seems thunderstruck
          by this unexpected blow. She walks to the door, and leaves the
          shop.

                         

          RODEO DRIVE - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          Vivian is walking on the sidewalk of Rodeo Drive, among the very
          elegantly dressed pedestrians. She has put her red jacket back on
          and is keeping it close to her waist with one hand. She walks very
          nervously, and her high heels don't help her to walk in a very
          elegant way.

                         
          We catch snatches of the conversations taking place around Vivian.

                         

                          WOMAN'S VOICE
           Doctor's office ? Two blocks down and to your left.

                         

                          MAN'S VOICE
           Thank you.

                         
          Vivian seems almost annoyed by those uninteresting bits of
          conversation. She keeps on walking.

          Two businessmen in grey suits are talking just near the entrance
          of the hotel.

                         

           ONE OF THE BUSINESSMEN
           Tiffany is taking the corner space. They like the project.
           We're very excited about the whole thing. Did you realize
           that Via Rodeo is the first new street... in Beverly Hills
           in seventy-five years ?

                         
          Closer shot of Vivian entering the hotel under the surprised stare
          of the uniformed attendant at the door.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY
          Vivian crosses the lobby. Barney, the manager, who was standing
          near the open door of an office, walks toward her.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Excuse me, miss, may I help you ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm going to my room.

                         
          She keeps on walking and Barney follows her.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Uh, do you have a key ?

                         
          She stops walking and turns around to face Barney.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh. I forgot that cardboard thing. I'm on the top floor.

                         

                          BARNEY
           You're a guest here ?

                          VIVIAN
           I'm with a friend.

                         

                          BARNEY
           And who would that be ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Edward.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Edward ?

                         
          The elevator bell dings and the elevator door opens.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Edward... Edward, uh...

                         
          Barney nods his head.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Mm-hmmm.

                         
          Dennis comes out of the elevator. Vivian points at him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           He knows me.

                         
          Barney turns toward Dennis.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Dennis.

                         
          Dennis walks toward his boss.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Dennis, did you just come off the night shift ? Hmm ?

                         

                          DENNIS
           Yes, sir.

                         
          Barney buttons the collar of Dennis' uniform.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Do you know this young lady ?

                         

                          DENNIS
           She's with Mr. Lewis.

                         
          Dennis speaks with a croaky voice, because Barney is slightly
          strangling him while buttoning his uniform.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Mr. Lewis ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           That's it. Edward Lewis ! Thanks, Dennis.

                         
          She slaps Dennis' shoulder, and moves into the elevator.

                         

                          DENNIS
           Evidently she joined him last night.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Thank you.

                         
          Barney moves away from Dennis and joins Vivian into the elevator.
          Dennis puts his hands on his collar to open it and be able to
          breathe properly.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over from the elevator)
           Oh, God ! What now ? What ? What ?

                         
          She comes out of the elevator, with Barney holding her elbow.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What is with everybody today ?

                         
          They walk along the lobby, away from the elevator. Dennis looks at
          them and smiles. Two business men, going into the elevator, also
          look at them, surprised.

                         

                          BARNEY
           No, no. It's all right. Just come with me. We'll have a
           little chat. Thank you. Dennis, thank you.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm coming. I'm coming.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - MANAGER'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Close Up shot on a green plant, with, next to the plant, a metal
          pot that looks a bit like a coffee pot. Barney's hand takes the
          pot and starts watering the plant.

                         
           BARNEY (voice over)
           Uh, what is your name, miss ?

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           What do you want it to be ?

                         
          Full shot of the office. Vivian is seated on a leather armchair in
          front of an expensive-looking wooden desk, on which several
          documents are scattered. On the left-hand side of the desk, the
          total upper half of the wall is a large bay window protected from
          the outside by vertical Venetian blinds. Under the bay window, a
          small table on which is the plant Barney is watering.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Don't play with me, young lady.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Vivian.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Thank you. Vivian.

                         
          Barney puts the pot down on the table and sits down on the desk
          itself just in front of Vivian.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Well, Miss Vivian. Things that go on in other hotels don't
           happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Now, Mr. Lewis,
           however, is a very special customer, and we like to think
           of our special customers as friends. Now, as a customer, we
           would expect Mr. Lewis to sign in any additional guests,
           but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it. Now, I'm
           assuming that you're a...

                         
          Barney bends his head down, and Vivian also bends her head down
          before answering.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Relative ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yes.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Mm-hmmm. I thought so. Then you must be his...

                         
          Same game of bending heads down.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Niece ?

                         

                          BARNEY
           Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see
           you in this hotel again. I assume you have no other uncles
           here.

                         
          Vivian shakes her head. She suddenly seems a bit tired by the
          situation.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Good ! Then we understand each other. I would also
           encourage you... to dress a little more appropriately.
           that'll be all.
          Vivian raises her hands and her voice.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried
           to go... get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women
           wouldn't help me. And I have all this money now and no
           dress !

                         
          Vivian takes the loose jumbled banknotes from her bag and shows
          them to Barney.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this,
           okay ? I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight. And nobody
           will help me.

                         
          Barney takes the money out of Vivian's hands, then takes a white
          handkerchief out of the breast pocket of his jacket and gives it
          to Vivian. Then he gives her her money back.

                         
          He walks around his desk, and picks up his telephone.

                          VIVIAN
           Oh, man, if you're calling the cops. Yeah, call the cops.
           That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Women's clothing.

                         
          Vivian looks up, a bit surprised.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Bridget, please.

                         
          Vivian looks at him, and then takes the handkerchief and loudly
          blows her nose.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Yes, Bridget. Hello. This is Barnard Thompson here at the
           Regent Beverly Wil...

                          (HE CHUCKLES)
           Well, thank you. Yes, but I'd like you to do a favor for
           me, please. I'm sending someone over. Her name is Vivian.

                         
          Vivian looks at him and smiles.

                         
           BARNEY (voice over)
           She's a special guest. She's the niece of a very special
           guest.

                         

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Full view of a screen, on which a film is being projected. This
          film shows an aerial overview of the port of Long Beach and Los
          Angeles, with a lot of industrial buildings along the wharves.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over)
           Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown : prime industrial
           properties straddling the port of Long Beach and Los
           Angeles.
          Full shot of the meeting room, with the screen in the background.
          Because of the dark in the room, people around the table are only
          shadows. Edward is standing up near the screen.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over)
           The real estate possibilities are endless, but most of the
           yard we'll just level.

                         
          A young man, one of Philip's assistants, walks into the room and
          to the place where Philip is seated. He bends down to whisper to
          Philip.

                         

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT
           We just got the information, Mr. Stuckey.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Edward, we just got the Morse update. Don, can you hold the
           projection, please ?

                         
          The projection stops. Philip stands up and switches the lights on.
          He sighs and turns toward the young man.

                          PHILIP
           Yeah, what ? Speak.

                         

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT
           Old Man Morse just got the inside track on a 350 million
           dollar contract to build destroyers for the Navy.

                         
          Edward looks very pensive.

                         
          Philip snickers, and looks at the young man.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Navy contract. I can't believe this shit. I thought you
           said they had nothing in the hopper on this one !

                         

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT
           I thought they didn't.

                         
          Shot on another man, named Mark, seated at the table.

                         

                          MARK
           Hey, you know, if that's true it could cost a lot more.
           Those stocks could go through the roof.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Yeah, no shit, Sherlock.

                         
          The young man walks toward Edward, still standing up.

                         

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT
           Maybe we're lucky to get this information now, sir. See, we
           can still walk away from it.

                         
          Edward doesn't answer and remains pensive.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Walk away ? Hey, forget it, pal. We got a thousand man-
           hours in on this ! Nobody's walking away from anything !

                         
          Philip sits down at the table, next to Mark.

                         

                          MARK
           Philip, I think he's right.

                         
           PHILIP (raising his voice)
           Forget it, Mark.

                         
          The two men start arguing, and since they are talking loudly
          together, we don't understand what they say.

                         
          Edward, with a glass of water in his hand, comes to the table and
          raises his voice.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Gentlemen, relax !

                         
          The arguments between Philip and Mark stops

                         

                          EDWARD
           Relax ! Who do we know on the Senate Appropriations
           Committee ?

                         

                          PHILIP
           Senator Adams.

                         

                          EDWARD
           All right, Senator Adams. Let's find out where he is.

                         
          Philip stands up and the young man sits down in his chair.

                         

                          EDWARD
           The Navy's not going to spend 350 million dollar on
           anything without going to Appropriations first.

                         
          He drinks his water.

                         

                          PHILIP
           I don't understand what's going on here today, gentlemen.

                         
          The young man is on the phone, trying to reach someone.

                         

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT
           Hello ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           That's why I hired you, Phil, to do my worrying for me.

                         
          He picks up his briefcase.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'll be in your office. Bob, if you want to send over the
           geologicals ?

                         
           BOB (voice over)
           No problem.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you.

                         
          He goes out of the room. Philip follows him.

                         
          Mark and the young blonde man sitting next to him are working on
          the documents in front of them.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over)
           Edward.

                         

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - RECEPTION HALL - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Edward is about to enter Philip's private office. Philip is
          standing behind him.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Listen, everything all set for the meeting tonight ?

                         
          Edward turns around to face Philip.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mm-hmm.
          We hear faint voices coming from the meeting room.

                         
           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over)
           Yes, Senator Adams, please.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Who... Who is this girl you're going with ?

                         
           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over)
           Yes.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Nobody you know.

                         
          He enters Philip's private office. Philip turns around to go back
          in the meeting room, with a worried look on his face.

                         
           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT (voice over)
           Yes, Edward Lewis Enterprises. Phil Stuckey. Yes, I have
           him right here.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - WOMEN'S CLOTHING SHOP - INTERIOR

                         DAY

                         
          Full shot of the Women's clothing shop inside the hotel. Several
          women and even one man walking around. Counters and shelves full
          of women's clothing items. Hanging rails with dresses hanging on
          them.

                         
          Vivian walks into the shop and starts looking around. Bridget
          comes into the shop with a Mrs Rainey, a customer.

           Don't worry, Mrs. Rainey, I'll call you the minute it comes
           in.

                         

                          MRS RAINEY
           Thank you.

          The customer walks away and Bridget stops near Vivian who is
          looking at something on a counter.

          Bridget bends over the mirror.

                         

                          BRIDGET
           Hello. You must be Vivian. My name's Bridget.

                         
          They shake hands.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah, hi. Barney said you'd be nice to me.
          They both laugh.

                         

                          BRIDGET
           He's very sweet. What are your plans while you're in town ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           We're gonna have dinner.

                         
          She is ready to sit on the glass covering the counter, but Bridget
          prevents her from doing so.

                         

                          BRIDGET
           Oh, don't sit on there, dear !

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh !

                         

                          BRIDGET
           You're gonna go out ? Dinner ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Mm-hmm.

                         

                          BRIDGET
           Well, you'll need a cocktail dress then. Come with me.

           Now, I'm sure we're gonna find something here that your
           uncle will love. You're a size six, right ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah. How'd you know that ?

                         

                          BRIDGET
           Oh, that's my job.
          They start walking upstairs to the upper level.

           Bridg, he's not really my uncle.

          Barney is going around a huge bunch of flowers, followed by two
          Japanese, one male and one female. The man is speaking Japanese to
          Barney. Vivian walks between them, carrying a garment bag over her
          shoulder.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Barney !

                         
          She quickly looks at the Japanese man.

           Sorry, mister.

                         
          Barney says a few words in Japanese to the Japanese guests.

           Well, I'd rather hoped you'd be wearing it.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh, no, I didn't want to get it messed up ! Listen, I got

                          BARNEY
           No, that won't be necessary. I'm sure they're quite lovely.
           Thank you.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Okay, well, listen. I didn't mean to interrupt you, but
           Bridget was really great... and I just wanted to say
           thanks. You're cool.

                         

                          BARNEY
           You're welcome, Miss Vivian.

                         
          She walks away, and Barney looks at her, with a slight smile on

          low table in the forefront of the screen. Vivian drops her handbag
          on the floor, rushes to the phone and picks it up.

           EDWARD (voicer over on the phone)
           Did you buy clothes today ?

                         
          She squeezes the phone receiver between her head and her shoulder
          to have a better look at the garment bag.

          underneath it : «Lewis enterprises, inc.», and below : «Philip

          The receptionist picks up the phone and starts dialing.
          A blonde female secretary walks behind Edward and bends down to
          speak to him.

                         

                          THE SECRETARY
           Mr. Stuckey wanted to see you.

           Yes, tell him I'm in the middle of a very important phone

          The camera pans away and we discover Vivian seated at the table in
          front of the plate. She puts the napkin on her laps and then her

           Good. Elbows off the table.

          the dining room. Uniformed waiters are setting tables behind
          Vivian and Barney, who is standing up behind Vivian. He points to
          the different forks on the table.

           Shrimp fork, salad fork, dinner fork.

           I definitely have the salad fork. The rest of the
           silverware is a little confusing.

                         
          The camera moves back again giving a full view of the dining room,
          with Barney and Vivian's table in the forefront. A black case is
          open on the table : inside a impressive collection of silver
          cutlery.

                         
          Barney picks up the different forks and shows them to Vivian.

           All right, if you get nervous, just count the tines. Four
           tines : dinner fork. And sometimes there are three tines in

          again, still looking around him. Barney catches up with him.
          Edward doesn't stop walking, and Barney has to talk while walking.

          bit worried.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Yes, um, sir. I have a message for you, sir.

                         

                          EDWARD
           From who ?

                         

                          BARNEY
           From your niece, sir.

                         
          Edward, for the first time, looks at Barney. His finger is on the
          dial of the phone, but he doesn't dial.

                         

                          EDWARD
           My what ?

                         

                          BARNEY
           The young lady who's staying with you in your room, sir.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh. Hmm.

                         
          Edward smiles and puts down the telephone receiver which he had
          already put to his ear.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I think we both know that she's not my niece.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Of course.

                         

                          EDWARD
           The reason I know that is that I am an only child.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Yes, sir.

                          EDWARD
           What's the message ?

                         

                          BARNEY
           She's waiting for you in the lounge. Intriguing young lady,
           Miss Vivian.

                         
          Edward remains pensive for a couple of seconds before answering.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Intriguing.

                         
          Edward picks up his briefcase which he had put on the telephone
          shelf.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Have a good evening, sir.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you, Mr... ?

                         
          He walks away.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Thompson. I'm the manager...

                         
          He takes his business card out of the pocket of his vest to give
          it to Edward, but Edward is already gone.

                         

                          BARNEY
           ...manager of the hotel, sir.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOUNGE - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          The lounge of the hotel is a cosy place with potted green plants,
          comfortable armchair and soft piano music.
          Medium shot of Edward entering the lounge. The camera then follows
          Edward crossing the lounge toward the bar.

                         
          Larger shot of the lounge, with the bar in the background. There
          are not many people at this early time of the evening.

                         
          Medium shot of the bar. Only one person is seated on a stool at
          the bar. Even if we see only her back, we guess she is Vivian. But
          Edward doesn't seem to recognize her, because he keeps looking
          around for her.

                         
          As Edward is looking the other way from the bar, Vivian turns
          around and looks at him. Edward walks a couple of steps toward the
          door, and then turns around and eventually notices Vivian.

                         
          Medium shot on Edward. There is a look of surprise in Edward's
          eyes when he recognizes Vivian.

                         
          Back to Vivian still seated at the bar. She doesn't look like the
          Vivian we were used to see. She is wearing a very elegant dark-
          colored cocktail dress. Her hair also has been very elegantly
          styled.
          Edward looks at her without moving for a few seconds.

                         
          She stands up from the bar and walks toward him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You're late.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You're stunning.

                         
          She laughs.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You're forgiven.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Shall we go to dinner ?

                         
          He gives her his arm. She puts her arm inside his arm and they
          walk across the lounge toward the exit.

                         

          RESTAURANT «LE VOLTAIRE» - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          High angle shot of the whole restaurant. It looks like a very
          expensive place. Tables are scattered around the room and on the
          gallery, but not too close to one another. In the middle of the
          room, a larger table used only by the waiters.

                         
          We see Edward and Vivian crossing the room, with a maitre d'hotel
          walking in front of them.

                         

                          MAITRE D'HOTEL
           This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Stop fidgeting.
          Closer high angle shot of Vivian and Edward walking toward a table
          where two men, an old one and a younger one, are already seated.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mr. Morse.

                         
          The two men stand up. The older one is James «Jim» Morse and the
          younger one is his grandson, David Morse.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

                         
          They shake hands.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           This fireball is my grandson, David.

                         

                          DAVID MORSE
           Well, I don't know about the fireball part, but grandson is
           true enough.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm pleased to meet you both. This is a friend of mine,
           Vivian Ward.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mr. Morse. David.

                         
          She shakes hands with both men.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Please, sit.

                         
          The maitre d'hotel pulls the chair for Vivian. The men wait for
          Vivian to be seated to sit down. Vivian has James Morse on her
          right, Edward on her left, and David in front of her.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SOFTLY)
           Excuse me.

                         
          She stands up. Immediately, the maitre d'hotel pulls her chair,
          and the three men stand up, to Vivian's surprise.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Where are you going ?

                         
          She smiles to the two other men.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm going to the ladies' room.

                         
          The two Morse men smile back to her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Upstairs, to the right.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Okay. Excuse me.

                         
          She starts walking away.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Shall I order for you ?

                         
          She turns around.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah.

                         
          She stops, exhales, and says, in a more polite tone :

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Please do so. Thank you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'll do that.

                         
          She walks away. The three men sit down.
          Close Up shot on a plate being laid in front of one of the guests.
          On the plate, four appetizers, actually four canapés.

                         
           DAVID MORSE (voice over)
           Mr. Lewis, my grandfather believes the men who create a
           company...

                         
          The camera moves up from the plate to the guest's face. The guest
          is Vivian, and she looks a bit worried by what has been brought to
          her.

                         
           DAVID MORSE (voice over)
           ...should control its destiny.

                         
          Vivian turns to Edward.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Where's the salad ?

                         
          David looks at Vivian, a bit surprised by what she just said.

                         
          Edward whispers to Vivian

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh, the salad comes at the end of the meal.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           That's the fork I knew.

                         
          David smiles.

                         
          Vivian takes one of her forks and looks at it, then she puts it
          back.

                         
           DAVID MORSE (voice over)
           Let me, uh, put it another way. Between your public
           statements and the rumors flying around on this thing, we
           find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions
           are.

                         
          Sensing Vivian's embarrassment, James Morse smiles to her.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           I don't know about you, but I've never been able to figure
           which goes with what !

                         
          He points to the different forks around his plate. Vivian laughs.

                         
          David seems a bit annoyed by the fact that the conversation keeps
          on deviating on menial subjects.

                         
          James Morse takes one of the canapés with his fingers and eats it.
          Vivian smiles, and also takes the canapé with her fingers. She
          wipes something out of it before eating it.

                         
          Edward smiles. He is happy that Vivian and James are getting along
          so well.

                         
          Close Up on the table in front of Vivian. We see the waiter's hand
          putting down a plate of snails in their shells.
           DAVID MORSE (voice over)
           You know, there was a time when we built ships the size of
           cities. Men like my grandfather made this country.

                         
          Vivian looks at the snails and then at the waiter.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Who ordered this ?

                         
          David seems more and more annoyed by the situation with Vivian.

                         
           THE WAITER (voice over)
           The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appétit.

                         
          Edward looks at Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a
           delicacy. Try it. David ?

                         
          David bends down on the table. His grandfather looks at him.

                         

                          DAVID MORSE
           Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control... and I don't think
           you will... but if you did, what do you plan to do with the
           company ?

                         
          Vivian is trying to figure out how to work the snail pincers.

                         
          Edward looks at David

                         

                          EDWARD
           Break it up and sell off the pieces.

                         
          Edward is trying to mime to Vivian how to use the snail pincers.

                         
          Closer shot on James Morse.

                          JAMES MORSE
           I'm sure you'll understand I'm not thrilled at the idea...
           of your turning forty years of my work into your garage
           sale.

                         
          Vivian is still fighting with her snail pincers.

                         
          Close Up on Vivian's plate and her hands trying to use the snail
          pincers.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr. Morse, you are
           going to be a very rich man.

                         
          James Morse looks at Edward.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           I'm rich enough. I just want to head my shipyard.

                         
          Eventually, Vivian had succeeded in fitting one snail into the
          snail pincers, but it flies away from the pincers.
          The waiter, a white-hair man with a gentle face, catches it.

                         
          Edward looks at the waiter and then at Vivian.

                         

                         VIVIAN SMILES

           Slippery little suckers.

                         
          Both Morse gentlemen smile.

                         
           THE WAITER (smiling)
           It happens all the time.

                         
          Close Up on the table in front of Vivian. A ball of green ice
          cream, in a silver cup, is being put down on the table.

                          JAMES MORSE
           I met your father. What's his name ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Carter.

                         
          Vivian bits in a piece of leaf that was on the table, makes a
          face, and takes it out of her mouth.

                         
           JAMES MORSE (voice over)
           Yeah. Carter. Carter Lewis.

                         
          Medium shot on James Morse. Then medium shots on whomever is
          talking.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           He's not quite the bastard everybody says he is.

                          EDWARD
           No, I have the franchise on that.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           Does that make him proud ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I doubt it. It doesn't really matter now. He passed away.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           Oh, I hadn't heard. I'm sorry.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm sorry too.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mr. Morse, you asked for this meeting. What can I do for
           you ?

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           Leave my company alone.

                          EDWARD
           I can't do that. I own ten million shares.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           I'll buy your stock back.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You don't have the money.

                         

                          DAVID MORSE
           We will. We're getting a contract to build ten destroyers.

                         

                          EDWARD
           There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in
           Appropriations Committee. And it will remain there.

                         

                          DAVID MORSE
           And how the hell did you pull something like that ? You got
           dirty politicians in your pockets now or something ?

                         
           JAMES MORSE (voice over)
           Easy, easy, calm down. Calm down, David.

                         
          Quick shots at Edward with a slight ironical smile on his face,
          and then at Vivian, looking embarrassed.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           Mr. Lewis plays hardball.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes, yes, I do.

                         
          David slams his napkin on the table

                         

                          DAVID MORSE
           I've heard enough of this. Vivian, it was a great pleasure
           to meet you. I'm sorry, Grandfather. I've gotta get some
           air. Mr. Lewis.
          He stands up and walks away.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           I'd better join my grandson. You two enjoy your dinner.

                         
          He stands up.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           I'm sure it'll be delicious. Good luck, miss.

                         
          Edward stands up. James Morse comes close to him.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           Watch out, Lewis. I'm gonna tear you apart.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I look forward to it, sir.

                         
          He walks away.

                         
          Vivian looks more and more embarrassed.

                          EDWARD
           Rich people throw their napkins a lot, don't they ?

                         
          He sits down.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           He seems like a nice man.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I guess three thousand dollars does not buy loyalty, does
           it ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I just mean it's sweet the way he's crazy about his
           grandson.

                         
          Two waiters puts down plates in front of Edward and Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh, his grandson thinks he's a relic. He hates that he
           does, but he does.

                         
          He makes a sign to the waiters who were wondering about the
          missing guests.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, just the two.

                         
           THE WAITER (voice over)
           Yes, sir.

                         
          From her purse, Vivian takes out a little ketchup sealed pack, as
          found in fast food restaurants, and starts tearing it open.

                         
          Edwards looks at her and smiles.

                         
          Close Up on Vivian's plate, where there are a piece of meat, a cob
          of corn, a jacket potato sliced in two halves, and some salad. We
          see Vivian's hand pouring ketchup from the pack on her meat.

          whispering in his ear. The waiter nods his head toward Vivian.

                         
          Close Up on Vivian's plate. She spread the ketchup on her meat
          with her fork.

                         
          The maitre d'hotel walks away, bobbing his head in a deprecating
          manner.

                         
          Vivian looks around and senses that something is wrong.

                         
          Edward smiles and looks at the waiter.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           It's ketchup.

                         
          The waiter smiles.

                         

                          THE WAITER
           Yes, sir.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Check, please.

                         

                          THE WAITER
           Yes, sir.

                         
          The waiter walks away to get the check.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Haven't they ever seen ketchup before ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Not in this building.

          Edward, still wearing his jacket and tie, is seated at the
          entrance of the terrace, the back of his chair against the open
          French window.

                         
          Vivian walks toward him, still wearing her cocktail dress.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Edward, you said you never come out here.

                         
          He looks down at the feet of his chair.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, I'm only halfway out.

                          VIVIAN
           Didn't say much in the car on the way home. You thinking
           about dinner ? I was a maniac.

           I mean, the business was good, I think. You know ?

                         
          Vivian sits down on the balustrade of the terrace.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           He's in trouble. You want his company. He doesn't want to
           let it go.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thanks for the recap.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           The problem is, I think you liked Mr. Morse.

          Edward points his finger toward Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           What I would like is for you to get down from there. You're
           making me very nervous. Please come down.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           It's making you nervous ? What if I just leaned back a
           little bit like this ?

                         
          She starts leaning back a little.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Would you... Would you rescue me if I fell ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Vivian, I'm serious. Come... I'm not looking.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           It's really high.

                         
          She takes her hands off the balustrade, and waves them up in the
          air.

                          VIVIAN
           Look, no hands, no hands ! Okay, all right. I'm sorry.

          She sits back and holds the balustrade with both hands.

                         

                          EDWARD
           The truth is, it really is totally irrelevant whether I
           like this man or not.

           I will not let myself become emotionally involved in
           business.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I know. Kit's always saying to me, «Don't get emotional
           when you turn tricks». That's why no kissing. It's too
           personal.

                         
          Edward is smiling.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           It's like what you're saying : You stay numb, you don't get
           involved. When I'm with a guy, I'm like a robot. I just do
           it.

                         
          Edward looks at her with an ironical smile on his face.
          Vivian sighs and smiles.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I mean... except with you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh, of course, not with me. You and I are such similar
           creatures, Vivian. We both screw people for money.

                         
          Vivian looks embarrassed.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I was sorry to hear about your dad. When did he die ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Last month.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Do you miss him ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I hadn't spoken to him in fourteen and a half years. I
           wasn't there when he died.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Do you want to talk about this ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           No.

          Vivian drops down from the balustrade, walks toward Edward and
          kneels down beside his chair.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, I tell you what, 'cause I got an idea.

           Let's watch old movies all night. We'll just veg out in
           front of the TV.

                         

                          EDWARD
           «Veg out» ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay like broccoli.

                         
          He stands up.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Look, I'll tell you what. I'll be back. We'll do broccoli
           tomorrow.
          He strokes her chin very delicately. She stands up.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Where are you going ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm going downstairs for a while.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Later in the night.

                         
          Close Up on the TV screen. We see the closing scene of the film
          «Charade», directed in 1963 by musical comedy actor Stanley Donen.
          Regina (played by Audrey Hepburn) is talking with Peter (played by
          Cary Grant).

                         
           REGINA (voice over from the TV)
           Did you say marriage license ?

                         
           PETER (voice over from the TV)
           Now, don't change the subject, just give me the stamp.

                         
          Regina throws her arms around Peter's neck

                         
           REGINA (voice over from the TV)
           Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter, Brian, whatever your
           name is.

                         
          The picture from the film, who was filling the whole TV screen,
          suddenly becomes a smaller one in the center of the TV screen.
          Four other pictures, from four other films, appears in each corner
          of the TV screen.

                         
           REGINA (voice over from the TV)
           Oh, I love you.

                         
          The camera moves back and we see the back of the sofa. There is
          some stirring in the sofa, and we see Vivian's arm holding the
          remote control and pressing on a button. The TV shuts off.

                         
          Close Up on Vivian's hand putting the remote control down next to
          a clock that says three o'clock.

                         
          Medium shot on Vivian, wearing a white bathrobe, and putting her
          hand through her hair. She picks up the telephone next to the
          sofa, and presses a button on the telephone set.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hi, uh, I'm in the penthouse. The guy that was here, Mr.
           Lewis, have you seen him down there anywhere ?

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium shot on the door of the elevator. It opens, revealing
          Dennis, the elevator attendant, and, behind him, Vivian in her
          white bathrobe. He takes her by the arm and guides her away from
          the elevator.

                         
          They cross the lobby, where, at this time of the night, there are
          only uniformed maids cleaning the place. Dennis guides Vivian to
          the door of a room, from which piano music is coming out.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - MUSIC LOUNGE - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Full shot of the room, which is very dark. In the background, we
          see a stage with music stands on it. In front of the stage,
          Edward, in shirtsleeves, is playing on a concert piano.

                         
          Closer shot on Edward playing the piano.

                         
          The actor Richard Gere, who plays the character of Edward,
          actually plays live on the piano in that sequence. More, he
          composed the piece he is playing.

                         
          Medium shot on the cleaning crew listening to him while working.

                         
          Vivian walks slowly toward the piano.

                         
          She stops behind Edward and folds her arms. Edward stops playing.

                         
          Full shot of the room. The cleaning crew applauds Edward. Vivian
          walks closer to the piano.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you. Thank you very much.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I didn't know you played.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I only play for strangers.

                         
          Closer shot on the piano. Vivian leans on the piano.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I was getting lonely upstairs all by myself.
          Edward turns around.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Gentlemen, would you mind leaving us, please ?

                         
          Full shot of the room. The cleaning crew is leaving the room.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you.

                         
          Close Up shot on Vivian's face.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           People always do what you tell them to do ?

                         
          Medium shot. Edward grabs Vivian by the waist and sets her in
          front of him. We hear the piano keys as they are pounded by
          Vivian's buttocks. Edward puts his forehead on Vivian's belly.

                         
          Vivian, her hand on his hair, looks down at him, with a strange
          expression in her eyes.
          Edward looks up and starts untying Vivian's bathrobe belt. Under
          the bathrobe, Vivian is still wearing her cocktail dress.

                         
          Close Up on Vivian's face as Edward lifts her dress up.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I guess so.

                         
          Edward grabs her, lifts her, and sits her on the piano. We hear
          the piano keys being pounded by Vivian's feet.

                         
          Edward strokes her hair. He wants to kiss her, but she moves away.
          Eventually, she puts her head into his neck, and kisses him on the
          neck.

                         
          The bathrobe has fallen down on the piano. Edward spreads Vivian's
          legs apart, and squeezes himself between those open legs.

                         
          Vivian lies down on the piano, while Edward is having sex with
          her.

                         
          The camera slowly moves away from the piano, giving us a full shot
          of the entire room.

                         
          We hear the piano key being pounded, and the camera goes down
          behind some unspecified piece of furniture, making a fade-out to
          black screen.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Vivian is asleep in bed. We hear the curtains being pulled, and we
          see the daylight coming on Vivian's face. Vivian wakes up, scratch
          her head and looks around her.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Wake up. Time to shop.

                         
          Edward sits on the bed, and Vivian turns around to face him.
          Edward has a MasterCard in his hand. He shows it to Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Now, if you have any trouble using this card, have them
           call the hotel. All right ?

                         
          Vivian takes the card and sits up in bed.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh ! More shopping.

                         
          Edward ties his shoelaces.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mm-hmm. I'm surprised you didn't buy more than one dress
           yesterday.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Wasn't as much fun as I thought it was gonna be.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why not ?

                          VIVIAN
           They were mean to me.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mean to you ?

                         
          Edward looks very surprised. Vivian nods «Yes».

                         

          RODEO DRIVE - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium full shot of Edward and Vivian crossing the street, holding
          hands. Vivian is still wearing her blue very short skirt, but the
          upper half of her body is covered by a white shirt, knotted at the
          waist and with the sleeves rolled back on her arms. She is also
          wearing regular woman's shoes, so she doesn't look like a
          prostitute any more.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           People are looking at me.

                         
          They now walk on the sidewalk.

                         

                          EDWARD
           They're not looking at you. They're looking at me.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Stores are never nice to people. They're nice to credit
           cards.

                         
          He stops walking and Vivian also stops.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Okay, stop fidgeting.

                          VIVIAN
           All right.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Get rid of your gum.

                         
          She spits her gum, almost hitting two female pedestrians. One of
          them jumps up.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I don't believe you did that.

                         
          Edward pulls her by the hand and they enter an expensive clothing
          store.

                         

          CLOTHING STORE - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium shot of Vivian and Edward standing near a hanging rail full
          of dresses. Edward is holding Vivian's hand, who seems a little
          embarrassed. A young well-dressed man approaches them : he is Mr.
          Hollister, the manager of the store.

                          EDWARD
           Yes ?

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           I am Mr. Hollister, the manager. May I help you ?

                         
          Edward shakes hand with him.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Edward Lewis.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Ah, yes, sir.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You see this young lady over here ?

                         
          Vivian joins the two men with a broad smile.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Yes.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is ?

                         
          Vivian puts her head on Edward's shoulder.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Oh, yes.

                         
          Hollister understand he has made a blunder.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Oh, no ! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as
           beautiful as she would want them to be. That's the point I
           was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that.
           That's why when you came in...
          Edward takes Hollister's elbow and walks slightly away.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here ?

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           ...we knew from the first...

                         

                          EDWARD
           We're gonna need a few more people helping us. I'll tell
           you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of
           money in here. So we're going to need a lot more help
           sucking up to us. That's what we really like. You
           understand that.

                         
          Vivian smiles behind Edward.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Sir, if I may say so, you're in the right store and the
           right city for that matter.

                         
          Later.
          Medium shot of Vivian seated in a comfortable armchair with a
          catalogue on her laps and Hollister kneeling at her side.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Anything you see here, we can do, by the way. Get ready to
           have some fun. Okay ?

                         
          Vivian smiles.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Okay.

                         
          Hollister makes a sign with his hand.

                         
          Full shot of the store. In the forefront, Edward is standing
          behind a counter with a cordless telephone in his hand. He dials
          on the telephone.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it !

                         
          He stands up. A saleswoman is running toward Vivian with a dress
          in her hands. She puts it on Vivian's laps, who puts the catalogue
          away.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Come on. Bring it out, girls.

                         

                          THE SALESWOMAN
           Oh, this is absolutely divine.

                         
          Another saleswoman, also with a dress in her hand, is coming from
          the other side.

                         
          Medium shot on Edward behind the counter. In the background, we
          hear female voices, but we don't understand the words.
          Hollister walks toward Edward.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Excuse me, sir, uh,

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yeah ?

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking
           about ? Just profane or really offensive ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Really offensive.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           I like him so much !

                         
          Edward takes the phone to his ear, and Hollister walks away.

                         
          We hear the orchestral music from the title song : «Pretty Woman»
          Vivian is still seated on her armchair, looking at all the clothes
          that the saleswomen are bringing to her.

                         
          She has a very bright red dress in her hand and she looks at
          Edward.

                         
          Edward makes a face and nods «No».

                         
          A saleswoman put a black hat on Vivian's head.

                         
          Edward smiles and nods «Yes».

                         
          Hollister sits down near Vivian and a saleswoman brings a grey
          dress. Vivian points to the dress and looks at Edward.

                         
          Edward makes a face and a «So-So» sign with his hand.

                         
          Slightly later.

                         
          Edward is standing near the counter, drinking coffee. In the
          background, we see Vivian surrounded by saleswomen. Hollister
          walks toward Edward.

                         
          The music stops.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it going so far ? Pretty
           well, I think.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I think we need some major sucking up.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Very well, sir. You're not only handsome, but a powerful
           man. I could see the second you walked in here, you were
           someone to reckon with...

                         
          Edward has put the coffee cup down and has taken the telephone
          again. He turns toward Hollister.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Hollister.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Yes, sir.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Not me. Her.

                         
          He points toward the group of saleswomen surrounding Vivian.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

                         
          He walks away from Edward and toward the group of saleswomen.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           How we doing, ladies ?

          He presses a button on the telephone set to cut the call.

                         

          CLOTHING STORE - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Edward gives his credit card to Vivian. Vivian is now dressed in a
          very elegant brown suit, with a grey shirt underneath.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You're on your own. I have to go back to work. You look
           great !

                         
          He walks toward the exit of the store, and near Hollister.

                         

                          EDWARD
           She has my card.

                          HOLLISTER
           And we'll help her use it, sir.

                         
          Slightly later.

                         
          We hear the song «Oh, Pretty Woman», performed by Roy Orbison.

                         
          Vivian, wearing a black short dress, is dancing on the rhythm of
          the music, surrounded by two saleswomen.

          Another department of the store : the shoe department. Vivian,
          wearing a white suit with thin vertical stripes, is surrounded by
          shoes. Hollister is kneeling beside her, and a salesman is helping
          her try a new pair of shoes. Vivian smiles and looks at the
          necktie worn by the salesman.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Edward would love that tie.

                         
          Hollister turns toward his salesman.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Would you give her the tie ?

                         

                          THE SALESMAN
           The tie ?

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Take off the tie. Give her the tie.

                         

                          THE SALESMAN
           The tie.
          He starts taking off his tie.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           He really wants to do this, by the way.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           He would go crazy about this tie.

                         
          A saleswoman walks toward them, carrying a large pizza in an open
          cardboard box. Hollister looks worried.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Who ordered pizza ?

                         
          But Vivian seems very happy about the pizza.

                         
          The volume of the music goes back up.

          Close Up on a white parasol with flowers printed on it, looking a
          bit Japanese. The parasol moves away from us and we discovers we

          The camera moves away from the parasol, and Vivian appears on the
          screen. She is wearing a very elegant white suit, long white
          gloves, and a black hat.

          The camera backs up away from Vivian, and we notice she is
          carrying several bags, certainly full of clothes. Men turn their
          head to look at her.

                          LYRICS

          BOUTIQUE - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          We are back inside the boutique, from which Vivian was very rudely
          ejected, the day before, by some snobbish saleswomen. Through the
          shop window, we see Vivian walking on the sidewalk.

                         
          She stops and looks inside the boutique.

          boutique.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Pretty woman, say you'll stay with me.

                         
          The volume of the music goes down, as Vivian enters the shop.
          Saleswoman # 2 walks toward her.

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 2
           May I help you ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No, thank you.

                         
          Vivian keeps on walking until she reaches Saleswoman # 1, who is
          working on a hanging rail. Saleswoman # 1 was the one who actually
          ejected Vivian from the boutique.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hi.

           Hello.

                         
          The saleswoman has a broad smile.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Do you remember me ?

                         
          Apparently, the saleswoman doesn't recognize this very elegant
          woman as being the one she was rude to the day before.

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           No, I'm sorry.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I was in here yesterday. You wouldn't wait on me.

                         

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           Oh.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You work on commission, right ?

                          SALESWOMAN # 1
           Uh, yes.

                         
          Vivian shows her all the bags she is carrying.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Big mistake. Big. Huge ! I have to go shopping now.

                         
          She walks away, leaving the saleswoman with a very surprised look
          on her face.

                         
          The volume of the music goes back up.

          behind him.

           Wait... Thank you.

                         
          The attendant walks away. Vivian takes her hat off and falls into
          an armchair.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Oh, oh, pretty woman.

                         
          End of the music.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          The modern building, where Edward's office in L.A. is located. The
          number above the main entrance says «333». We hear male voices
          over. We don't understand everything they are saying.

                         
           MAN (voice over)
           Mister Lewis.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Gentlemen.

                         

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Edward is standing up with his briefcase, smiling to the men of
          his team around him. He moves to his chair at the meeting table.
          Philip is trying to herd all his assistants out of the room.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Fellas, let's finish this up this afternoon, huh ?

                         
          Edward sits down. A blonde secretary joins the leaving group.

                          PHILIP
           Jake, set something up with Blair. Around two o'clock, two-
           thirty, would be good.

                         
          They all go out, leaving Edward and Philip alone.

                         

                          PHILIP
           You were right about Morse. He mortgaged everything he
           owns, right down to his underwear, to secure a loan from
           the bank.

                         
          He sits down next to Edward.

                         

                          PHILIP
           And it's not just any bank. Plymouth Trust, huh ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Hmm.

                         
          Edward seems to be very pensive.

                         

                          PHILIP
           So, it goes without saying... that your business means a
           lot more to them than our friend, Mr. Morse. So, all you
           gotta do is call the bank.

                         
          He puts his hands on the telephone.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yeah.

                         
          Still, a very tepid reaction from Edward. He just takes a small
          glass and puts it in front of him on the table.

                         
          Philip looks at Edward with a worried look. He stands up.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Edward, excuse me for saying this, but what the hell is
           wrong with you this week ? Are you giving Morse a chance to
           get away ?

                         
          Edward has put another glass on top of the first one, and now he
          puts a third one on top of the two other ones.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You know what I used to love when I was a kid, Phil ?

                         
          He puts a fourth glass on top of the other ones. Philip sighs.

                         

                          PHILIP
           What ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Blocks. Building blocks. Erector sets.

                         

                          PHILIP
           So, I liked Monopoly. Boardwalk, Park Place. Wh-What's the
           point ?

                          EDWARD
           We don't build anything, Phil. We don't make anything.

                         

                          PHILIP
           We make money, Edward. We worked for a year on this deal.
           It's what you said you wanted. I'm handing it to you.

                         
          Edward looks up at Philip.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Morse's jugular is exposed. It's time for the kill. Let's
           finish this. Call the bank !

                         
          He moves the telephone toward Edward. Edward just smiles but
          doesn't pick up the phone.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Close Up on a big Hi-Fi tuner-amplifier. We see Vivian's hand
          setting the power on. Lights appear on the amplifier screen. A
          sign says «102.70 Mhz». We hear some soft easy music. Vivian's
          hand sets the volume a little higher.

                         
          Medium shot on a table, on which everything has been set for a
          dinner for two. Three candlesticks with lighted red candles in
          them are also set on the table. Vivian is seated on one of the
          chair by the table. We see her from the back, but she seems to be
          almost naked, except for what looks like a tie around her neck.

                         
          We hear a door opening, and then closing. Vivian puts her feet up
          on the table. She is wearing black shoes. She puts the end of the
          tie on the table : it is the tie she took from the salesman in the
          store.

                         
          Edward crosses the room, without apparently noticing Vivian.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           How was your day, dear ?
          Edward stops and looks at her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Nice tie.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I got it for you.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Close up shot on the bathtub faucet. We see Vivian's foot reaching
          for the faucet, and the thumb of the foot trying to fit inside the
          faucet.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Well, my mother was a music teacher... and married my
           father...

                         
          Close Up on Edward naked chest floating in the bathtub. Vivian's
          hand is rubbing a washcloth on the chest.
           EDWARD (voice over)
           ...whose family was extremely wealthy.

                         
          Medium shot on Vivian lying in the tub with Edward lying on top of
          her. Her legs are spread open and her knees comes out of the water
          on either side of Edward's body.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Then he divorced my mother to be with another woman. And he
           took his money with him.

                         
          Vivian puts the washcloth down on the edge of the tub. She takes a
          sponge.

                         
          Close Up shot on Edward's chest. Vivian rubs it with the sponge.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           And then she died. I was very angry with him.

                         
          Medium shot of the tub seen from the foot of the tub.

                         

                          EDWARD
           It cost me ten thousands dollars in therapy to say that
           sentence : «I was very angry with him». I do it very well,
           don't I ? I'll say it again. «I was very angry with him».

                         
          Vivian laughs, and Edward smiles.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Hello, my name is Mr. Lewis. I'm very angry with my father.

                         
          The camera moves slowly around the bathtub.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I would've been angry at the ten thousands dollars.

                         

                          EDWARD
           My father was president of the third company I ever took
           over. I bought it. I sold it off piece by piece.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What'd the shrink say ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           He said I was cured.

                         
          Now the camera has come near the faucet.

                         
          Edward takes Vivian's hand in his.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, so you got even. That must've made you happy.

                         
          Medium shot of Edward and Vivian in the tub.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Did I mention my leg is 44 inches from hip to toe, so,
           basically, we're talking about 88 inches of therapy...

                         
          She brings her feet up and wraps her legs around Edward's body.

                          VIVIAN
           ...wrapped around you for the bargain price of...

                         
           EDWARD & VIVIAN (together)
           ...three thousands dollars.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah.

          LOS ANGELES EQUESTRIAN CENTER - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          Close Up shot on the lawn of the polo field. We hear an air-horn
          blowing, and horses galloping.

                         
          The small polo white ball is in the middle of the shot. We see the
          hooves of several horses approaching the ball. Then a mallet comes
          down and strikes the ball away.

                         
          Medium shot on horse-backed players galloping on the field.

                         
          We hear the announcer on the Public Address.

                         
           ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)
           Ebersol of the Falcons passes to Kennan.

          the horses coming toward us.

          well-dressed, and evidently belong to the upper class of society.
           ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)
           ...giving you play-by-play of this marvelous charity event.

                         
          Full shot of a lawn used as a parking lot with car parked among
          people sitting in folding chairs and picnicking.

                         
          Philip and his wife Elizabeth are crossing the lawn. Philip is
          carrying a basket and Elisabeth is carrying a large piece of
          printed cloth, to be used as a tablecloth to picnic on it.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Watch where you're walking, because, if you step in
           something, we're not going back in the car.

                         
          Elizabeth is ready to set the cloth at the foot of a tree.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Not too near the tree. I don't like the ants.

                         
          Polo players are galloping in the background. A couple approaches
          Philip and Elizabeth. They all shake hands.

                          PHILIP
           Hello. Have you seen Edward anywhere ?

                         
          Medium shot on Edward and Vivian standing near a car. Edward is
          wearing a very elegant light-grey suit, and Vivian is wearing the
          brown dress with white dots that we've seen her buy on Rodeo
          Drive. She's also wearing a very elegant beige hat with a ribbon
          matching her dress. And Edward is wearing the necktie Vivian gave
          him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What if someone recognizes me ?

                         
          Larger shot of the couple.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Not likely. They don't spend too much time on Hollywood
           Boulevard.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You did.

                         
          He puts his hands around Vivian's waist, to grab her hands behind
          her back.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Come on. Let go. Let go.

                         
          She eventually let him take her hands.

                         

                          EDWARD
           All right. You look great. You look like a lady. You're
           gonna have a wonderful time.

                         
          Medium shot on the couple. She makes a face. He takes her hand and
          drags her behind him

                          EDWARD
           Okay. Don't fidget and smile.

                         
          She makes a broad smile, and walks behind him.

           ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)
           Humboldt's coming around to this side.

                         
          On the edge of the field, two well-dressed gentlemen, a young one
          and and older one, are watching the game.

                         
           ANNOUNCER (voice over from the P.A.)
           Toquenee is on Kennan. Penalty on that play.

                         
          The two gentlemen walk away from the field. The camera follows
          them around a platform with a canopy above it. On the platform,
          the announcer, a white-haired gentleman, is sitting at a table in
          front of a microphone. On the other side of the platform, the
          camera lets the two gentlemen go on their way and stops on a group
          of four people : Edward, Vivian, Gwen and Gretchen. The two last
          ones are the Olsen sisters, two very elegant blonde women, known
          to be the gossip champions of Los Angeles upper class society.
          Gwen is seated on a chair on the platform, next to the announcer,
          when Gretchen is standing at the foot of the platform.

                         

                          EDWARD
           This is Gwen and Gretchen, the infamous Olsen sisters, who
           have made marrying well an art form.

                         

                          GWEN
           Edward.

           Be back in just a second. Hold on.

                         
          He walks away and Vivian remains with the Olsen sisters. In the
          background, a waiter is working on a buffet table.

                         

                          GWEN
           So, you're the flavor of the month. Hmm.

                         
          She turns back to the man seated in front of the microphone.
          Vivian looks a little disturbed by what Gwen just said.

                         

                          GRETCHEN
           Uh, she's just being testy. Edward's our most eligible
           bachelor. Everybody is trying to land him.

                         
          Vivian nods her head and answers Gretchen with a sardonic tone.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, I'm not trying to land him. I'm just using him for
           sex.

                         
          She walks away. Gretchen laughs.

                         
          Medium shot on the edge of the field. A middle-aged couple is
          seated on two chairs and looks at the game. Edward is standing
          behind them. The couple claps their hands and yell to support
          their favorite team. Vivian joins Edward behind the couple. Edward
          claps his hands.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well done.

                         
          Vivian claps her hands louder than Edward, and then yells with
          wide movements of her hand.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well done. Whoo, whoo, whoo !

           Tell me again why we're here.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Business.

                          VIVIAN
           Business mingling ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yeah.

                         
          We hear an air-horn blowing noisily.

                         
          Close Up on the field. We see the legs of a horse galloping on the
          field.

          them, Philip, with sunglasses on his nose, and a glass of
          Champagne in his hand. He leaves the group.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Excuse me. Edward !

           Edward. Over here.

                         
          Edward walks in with Vivian. He shakes hands with Philip.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Phil.

                          PHILIP
           Ah, good to see you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Me too. I want you to meet a new friend of mine, Vivian
           Ward.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Well, hi. Philip Stuckey, Vivian. This is my wife,
           Elizabeth.

                         
          Vivian shakes hands with Philip, then with Elizabeth.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           It's always a pleasure meeting one of Edward's girls.

                         
          A very elegant blonde lady walks toward them and then away from
          them. Elizabeth turns around to look at her.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           Oh, my God ! It's Tate Whitley Wallington.
          She runs after Tate.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           Tate ! It's me, Elizabeth, from Workout World.

                         
          The two men and Vivian watch her go.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Sort of an aerobics queen. Feel the burns. Well, let me get
           you something to drink. Vivian, why don't you start with
           that. Okay ?

                         
          He gives his Champagne glass to Vivian.

                         

                          PHILIP
           I'll be right back. Did you notice Senator Adams is here ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mm-hmm. I asked him.

                         

                          PHILIP
           That is why I have pledged my eternal love to you. Mmm !

                         
          He walks away.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Real genuine guy. Who is he ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           He's my lawyer. He's all right.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Maybe we'll try that later.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Are these people your friends ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I spend time with them, yeah.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, no wonder.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No wonder what ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No wonder why you came looking for me.

           GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)
           We need you to help replace some of the divots out here on
           the grass.

                         
          Medium shot on guests seated around a table. They all stand up,
          some still carrying their glass of Champagne.

                         
           GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)
           So come on out now.

                         
          Medium full shot on the field. All those very elegant people from
          the upper class society, with their glass of Champagne in hand,

          gentleman is sitting at the table on the platform, with Gwen at
          his side. But he is not talking in the microphone. Another bearded
          man, standing in front of the platform, is talking in a wireless
          microphone. In front of the platform, people are walking under the
          white ribbon to go on the field.

          loudly, and Edward takes her in his arms.

          convertible car. Her hat is on the trunk near her. A man takes one
          of Vivian's shoes off to clean it. A woman is standing near the
          car, watching the scene.

                         

                          THE MAN
           No, it's all part of the game of polo. You get to have your
           shoes polished by a member of the club.

                         
          He looks at a dirty spot on the shoe.

                         

                          THE MAN
           I think I got something in the car that will buff that up.
          He walks away with the shoe.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Thank you.

          his polo player outfit : red shirt, with the name of his team
          «L.A. Gems» and his number in the team «2», and white pants. He is
          holding his helmet, his leather gloves and his riding crops in one
          hand.

          woman, who was talking with her, walks away.

                         

                          THE WOMAN
           Excuse me.

                         
          Vivian takes her hat, jumps from the car down on the ground, and
          walks toward David.

                          VIVIAN
           David.

                         

                          DAVID MORSE
           How are you ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm okay.

                         
          David looks at the hat Vivian is holding

                         

                          DAVID MORSE
           I thought that was you. I like this hat.

                         

                          VIVIAN

           ELIZABETH (voice over)
           I'm going for a ride with the Ritter's in their new car.
           Okay, hon ?

                         
          Back on Philip. Elizabeth gives Philip a kiss on the cheek

                         

                          PHILIP
           Uh-huh.

                         
          Elizabeth understands that Philip has not heard a word of what she
          just said.

                         

                          ELIZABETH
           Philip, I'm going to rip off all my clothes and do a naked
           belly dance for the polo players.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Have fun.

                         
          Elizabeth walks away, looking a bit furious.

                         
          Back on Vivian and David, as watched by Philip. They are now
          standing in front of David's horse, held by a young blonde girl.

                          DAVID MORSE
           Come meet my horse, Vivian.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, Edward's waiting for me. I don't want to...

                         

                          DAVID MORSE
           Come on. He's right here.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Okay, I'll... Just for a second, though.

                         
          She walks toward the horse, looking back to watch for Edward.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I didn't know you were playing today.

                         
          Medium shot of Philip and Edward walking between the stands.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh... I was asking for directions. There she was.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Oh, so you just ran into her ? That's great, Jesus !

                         

                          PHILIP
           So anyway, what does she do ? Does she... does she work ?

                         
          They stop walking in front of a stand, where waiters are pouring
          Champagne for the guests.

                         

                          EDWARD
           She's in sales.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Sales ? That's terrific. That's good. What does she sell ?

                          EDWARD
           Why do you want to know ?

                         

                          PHILIP
           Now just hear me out on this, okay ? I've known you a long
           time. I... I see some differences in you this week, like
           the tie, and, uh... I'm wondering if maybe this girl isn't
           the difference, especially when I see her talking to David
           Morse.

          to David in the background. Edward turns around to look at them.

          at Edward, with an inquisitive expression in his eye.

                         
          Closer shot on David and Vivian talking together near the horse,
          still held by the young girl.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           I introduced them at dinner the other night.
           PHILIP (voice over)
           So what ? Now they're best friends ?

                         
          Back on Edward and Philip talking together.

                         

                          PHILIP
           I mean, this girl appears from out of nowhere. Now she's
           talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. That's
           a little convenient, don't you think ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Don't be ridiculous.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Edward, how... how do you know that this girl... hasn't
           attached herself to you because she's bringing information
           back to Morse ? This happens ! Industrial espionage...

                         

                          EDWARD
           Phil, Phil, Phil ! Phil, listen to me.

                         

                          PHILIP
           What ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           She's not a spy. She is a hooker.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Oh !

                         

                          EDWARD
           She is a hooker. I picked her up on Hollywood Boulevard. In
           your car.

                         
          Philip laughs.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Oh, you are...

                          EDWARD
           Yes, yes.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Oh, man !

                         
          He keeps on laughing louder. He snorts.

                         

                          PHILIP
           You know, you're the only millionaire I ever heard of...
           who goes looking for a bargain basement streetwalker, you
           know ?

                         
           SENATOR ADAMS (voice over)
           Edward !

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm sorry I told you.

                         
          Edward walks toward Senator Adams, who is calling him. Philip
          keeps on laughing.

                          EDWARD
           Senator. Senator Adams, I'm pleased you could make it.

                         
          Medium shot on the Senator. Edward walks to him and shakes his
          hand.

                         

                          SENATOR ADAMS
           Thank you. I hope the information I gave you was helpful.

                         
          Back on Philip, who walks away with a laughing face.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Oh, absolutely, yes, and thank you for it.

                         
          Back on Edward with the senator.

                         

                          EDWARD
           There's no change, is there ?

                         

                          SENATOR ADAMS
           No, it's still bogged down.

                         
          Medium shot on Vivian, standing near a tree, with her hat in her
          hand. She is smiling.

                         
          Philip walks behind her. Vivian stops smiling.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Having a nice time, Vivian ?

                         
          She smiles again.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah, I'm having a great time.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard, hmm ?
          She stops smiling and shows a very sad and worried face.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What ?

                         

                          PHILIP
           Yeah, Edward told me. But don't worry : you're secret is
           safe with me. Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could get
           together sometime...

                         
          He touches her bare arm with his sunglasses.

                         

                          PHILIP
           ...after Edward leaves.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah, sure. Why not ?

                         
          We sense that Vivian feels like crying, but she masters her
          emotions and looks at Philip.

                          PHILIP
           We'll just have to do that, hmm ?

                         
          He puts the tip of his fingers on her bare shoulder.

                         
           ELIZABETH (voice over)
           Philip !

                         
          Philip turns around to look at his wife. Then he walks away.
          Vivian remains on the same spot, with a very sad face.

                         
           GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)
           Hi, tailgaters. I'd like to mention a couple of our silver
           sponsors...

                         
          Close shot on Edward looking at Vivian. He smiles.

                         
           GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)
           ...Jacobs Distributors, Norrell Saddlery, and we'd like to
           give a great big thanks to our platinum sponsor...

                         
          Back to Vivian. She doesn't look at Edward and keeps the same
          sullen sad face.

                         
           GWEN (voice over from the P.A.)

          Applause and air horn blowing.

                         
          Vivian crosses her arms, but doesn't look at Edward.

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

                         
          Medium shot on the main door. It opens and Edward comes in,
          followed by Vivian.
          Vivian closes the door, and Edward looks at his mail lying on a
          small table. Vivian throws her hat and gloves on another table
          with a nervous movement. Edward turns around to look at her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You all right ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm fine.

                         
          She walks away.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Fine. That's good. Seven «fines» since we left the match.

                         
          Edward picks up his mail and newspaper, and walks behind her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Could I have another word, please ?

                         
          The camera follows Edward in the room. In the background, across
          the open door of the bedroom, we see Vivian entering the bathroom.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Asshole ! There's a word.

                         
          She slams the bathroom door.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I think I liked «fine» better.

                         
          Edward drops his mail and newspapers on the desk.

                         
          Vivian opens the bathroom door, and stands near the open door.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You know what ? Just tell me one thing : Why did you make
           me get all dressed up ?

                         
          Edward walks toward her. The camera follows him.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, for one thing, the clothing was appropriate.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

                         
          Edward takes his jacket off.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No, what I mean is, if you were gonna tell everybody I'm a
           hooker, - why didn't you just let me wear my own clothes,
           okay ?

                         
          Edward sits down on the bed.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I did not... I did not...

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I mean, in my own clothes, when someone like that guy
           Stuckey comes up to me, I can handle it, I'm prepared.

                         
          Edward starts unlacing his shoes. Vivian walks away toward the
          living room. The camera follows her.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

                         
          Vivian is trying unsuccessfully to open a bottle of Coca-Cola. In
          the background, Edward is still sitting on the bed, taking his
          shoes off.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm very sorry. I'm not happy with Stuckey at all for
           saying or doing that. But he is my attorney. I've known him
           for ten years.

                         
          Edward stands up and walks toward Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           He thought you were some kind of an industrial spy. The
           guy's paranoid.

                          VIVIAN
           What are you, my pimp now ?

                         
          She puts the unopened bottle back on the table.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You know, you think you can pass me around to your
           friends ? I'm not some little toy !

                         
          She walks away toward the bedroom.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Look, you're not my toy, I know you're not my toy.

                         
          He walks behind her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Vivian ! Vivian, I'm speaking to you. Come back here !

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

                         
          Vivian was ready to enter the bathroom, but she turns around.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I hate to point out the obvious, but you are, in fact, a
           hooker ! And you are my employee !

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Look, you don't own me. I decide, okay ? I say who. I say
           when. I... I say who...

                         

                          EDWARD
           I refuse to spend the next three days fighting with you. I
           said I was sorry. I meant it. That's the end of it !

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm sorry I ever met you.
          She walks away into the bathroom

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm sorry I ever got into your stupid car !

                         
          He walks toward the bathroom, enters it and starts taking his tie
          off in front of the mirror.

                         

                          EDWARD
           As if you had so many more appealing options.

                         
          Vivian comes back to the bathroom door, carrying a bunch of
          clothes.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I've never had anyone make me feel as cheap as you did
           today.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Somehow, I find that very hard to believe.
          She gets out of the bathroom with her arms full of clothes. She
          picks up a small handbag and puts it on her shoulder. Then she
          tries to pick up a larger handbag.

                         
          Close shot on the handbag, stuck under an armchair. We notice that
          Vivian is bare feet.

                         
          Vivian finally succeeds in picking up the bag and put the straps
          over her shoulder, on top of the smaller bag. Edward walks out of
          the bathroom and joins her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Where are you going ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I want my money. I want to get out of here.

                         
          She crosses her arms on her bunch of clothes. She has a very
          sullen, sad face. Edward doesn't move for a couple of seconds,
          then walks to the bed, to pick up his jacket. He gets his wallet
          from the inside pocket of his jacket. He opens the wallet, and
          gets a large wad of banknotes out of it.

                         
          Close up shot on the bed. We see the wad of banknotes falling on
          the bed. They are all hundred-dollar bills.

                         
          Edward walks away toward the living room, and Vivian remains
          without moving with her sullen sad face. She looks down at the
          bed.

                         
          Close up shot on the wad of banknotes on the bed.

                         
          Back to Vivian, who hasn't moved. She starts walking away toward
          the living room, without taking her money.

          Edward is standing near the desk, looking at his mail. Vivian
          walks behind him, coming from the bedroom and going away toward
          the front door. We hear the door opening. Edward looks up toward
          the door. The door closes, and Edward looks very pensive. He looks
          back into the bedroom.

          Medium shot on Vivian, standing near the elevator, and nervously
          pressing on the elevator call button.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Come on !

                         
          Medium close shot on Vivian. We hear the penthouse door opening,
          but Vivian doesn't look at it and keeps looking at the elevator in
          front of her.
          Larger shot. Edward is coming out of the penthouse, and he has
          left the door open. He walks toward Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared to answer questions about us.
           It was stupid and cruel. I didn't mean it. I don't want you
           to go. Will you stay the week ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Why ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I saw you talking to David Morse. I didn't like it.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           We were just talking.

                         
          He chuckles.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I didn't like it.

                         
          The elevator bell dings. The elevator door opens, and a smiling
          Dennis appears.

                         

                          DENNIS
           Down ?

                         
          Close shot on Edward's face, and then on Vivian's face.

                         
          Dennis feels some tension between Edward and Vivian and stops
          smiling. He goes back into the elevator, presses a button and the
          door closes.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You hurt me.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Don't do it again.

                         
          They look at each other for a couple of seconds, then slowly,
          Vivian walks back to the penthouse. Edward follows her and takes
          one of her handbags from her shoulder. They both enters the
          penthouse and he closes the door behind him.

          High angle shot above the bed. Edward and Vivian are lying in the
          bed, presumably naked, but covered by a sheet from their waist
          down. They are facing each other and talking.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           First guy I ever loved was a total nothing. Second was
           worse. My mom called me a bum magnet. If there was a bum
           within a fifty-mile radius, I was completely attracted to
           him. That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number
           three.
          Slowly, the camera moves closer to them.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mm.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So here I was : no money, no friends, no bum.

                         

                          EDWARD
           So then you chose this as your profession ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I worked at a couple fast food places, parked cars at
           wrestling. And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed
           to go home. That's when I met Kit. She was a hooker and
           made it sound so great. So one day I did it.

                         
          The camera stops moving forward, having reached a medium close
          shot, showing Vivian and Edward's heads and shoulders.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I cried the whole time. But then I got some regulars and,
           you know... It's not like anybody plans this. It's not your
           childhood dream.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You could be so much more.

                          VIVIAN
           People put you down enough, you start to believe it.

                         
          Reverse shot on Edward's face.

           I think you are a very bright, very special woman.
          Reverse shot on Vivian's face.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           The bad stuff is easier to believe. You ever notice that ?

          Medium full shot on Philip, standing in front of the desk, and
          talking to the receptionist girl.

                         

                          PHILIP
           No, I don't want to talk to him now. Tell him I'll call him
           on Monday.

                         
          He walks away from the desk.

                         

                          THE RECEPTIONIST
           Yes, sir.

                         
          A blonde female secretary walks into the room, carrying a thick
          pile of documents.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Where are you going ? Did he sign these ?

                         

                          THE SECRETARY
           No, he said he had to leave.

                         
          Philip walks nervously across the room.

                         

                          PHILIP
           He had to...

                         
          He meets Edward coming out of an office.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Edward, you can't disappear now. We're in this too deep.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Don't panic, Philip. Morse isn't going anywhere. I'll be
           back here in the morning.

                         
          He stops at the reception desk.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Did you send the tickets to the hotel ?

                         

                          THE RECEPTIONIST
           Yes, sir.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you.

                         
          He starts walking out of the room.

                          PHILIP
           Where are you going ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I have a date.

                         

                          PHILIP
           With the hooker ?

                         
          Edward stops walking. He doesn't seem very happy by what Philip
          just said. He slowly turns around, facing Philip.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Be careful, Philip.

                         
          He walks away. Philip slowly turns around and walks into his
          office.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR EVENING

                         
          Medium shot of Edward standing in front of the closed bedroom
          door. He is very elegantly dressed in black tuxedo and bow-tie.
          When he hears the bedroom door opening, he crosses his arm and
          leans on the bar.

                         
          The door opens and Vivian appears. She is very elegantly dressed
          in a long red evening dress. She is also wearing long white
          gloves. She walks into the room. She stops in front of Edward and
          faces him. Edward moves around her.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Do I look okay ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mmm.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Mmm ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Something's missing.

                         
          She looks at herself and at her tight-fitting dress.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, nothing else is gonna fit into this dress. I'll tell
           you that.

                         
          Edward picks up a mauve-colored box on the bar.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, maybe something in this box. I don't want you to get
           too excited. This is only on loan.

                         
          He opens the box : it's a jewel box. Vivian comes closer to the
          box and looks into it. What she sees looks like a very beautiful
          and expensive necklace. She moves her hand to touch delicately the
          necklace, but Edward snaps the lid of the box shut, almost
          squeezing her finger into it.

                          VIVIAN
           Oh !

                         
          She bursts out laughing loudly. Edward opens the box again.

                         
          Close shot in front of a mirror. Edward is fixing the necklace
          around Vivian's neck.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           They really let you borrow this from the jewelry store ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm a very good customer.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           If you were gonna buy this, how much would it cost ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Quarter of a million.

                         
          Vivian laughs nervously.

                          VIVIAN
           A quarter of a million dollars ?

                         
          Edward turns around Vivian, and his black-colored back blocks
          completely our view of the scene, making some sort of fade-out /
          fade-in with the next scene.

          Edward's back is still blocking completely our view of the scene.
          But then Edward moves to stand beside Vivian in the back of the
          cabin of the elevator. She is carrying a small golden purse.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So, where are we going ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           It's a surprise.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           If I forget to tell you later, I had a really good time
           tonight.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you.

          We hear the beginning of the orchestral music of «Fallen», written
          and performed by Lauren Wood.

                         
          Vivian and Edward are getting out of the elevator and they start
          crossing the lobby. Dennis comes out of the elevator to have a
          better look.

          near the desk. Another man, wearing a suit, is standing behind the
          desk, and checking things in an open ledger. All three of them
          look at the passing couple.

                         
          Vivian and Edward keep on walking across the lobby. He looks at
          her. She touches her necklace.

                         
          Medium shot on the reception desk. Miss Wilson and another female
          receptionist are standing behind the desk, talking with a guest.
          They look at the couple and smile.

                         
          Barney is standing near a wall tapestry, talking to a guest. He
          looks at the couple and seems very happy by what he sees.

                         
          Back on Vivian and Edward crossing the lobby.

                         

                          EDWARD
           When you're not fidgeting, you look very beautiful... and
           very tall.

                         
          Vivian laughs.

          The big grey limousine, that Edward uses all the time, is leaving
          the curb in front of the hotel.

          Long shot of the airport. The limousine enters the airport field,
          and stops near a corporate jet plane. A red carpet is lying on the

          Medium full shot on the car. Edward comes out of the back of the
          limousine. Darryl comes out of the driver's door and holds the
          door for Vivian, who looks surprised to see the plane.

           you ?

                         
          Darryl closes the back door, and stands near the car.

          Edward walks, on the red carpet, toward the plane, followed by
          Vivian. They talk together, but the lyrics of the song cover their
          voices.

           PILOT (voice over)
           Well, it should be a pretty smooth flight, Mr. Lewis. The
           weather is clear all the way up to San Francisco. We should
           be there in about fifty minutes.

          Full shot on the lobby, which is almost empty. Apparently, Edward
          and Vivian are among the last spectators. Vivian, who seems a bit
          nervous, is holding Edward's arm very tightly.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           We're late.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, it's all right. Opening night never starts on time.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Okay.

                         
          They walk near a stand, where a girl, wearing black tuxedo and
          bow-tie, is distributing programs. Edward takes a program.

                         

           THE PROGRAM ATTENDANT
           Program, sir.

           Thank you.

                         

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - BOX - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          The camera pans, from right to left, a succession of private boxes
          in the medium upper level of the theatre. All the men are wearing
          black tuxedoes and bow-ties, and all the women are wearing very
          elegant and very expensive evening dresses.

                         
          We hear the instruments of the orchestra warming up.

                         
          The third box is empty, but an usher shows Edward and Vivian
          through the door of the box.

                         

                          USHER
           Right this way, Mr. Lewis, sir.
          Vivian enters first, followed by Edward. Vivian looks down from
          the balustrade of the box. Edward shakes hand with Doris, an old
          lady in the next box.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Doris.

                         

                          DORIS
           Edward, how are you ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           How nice to see you. Nice to see you.

                         
          The camera starts going away and down from the box.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Sir.

                         
          He shakes hands with Doris' husband.

                         

                          DORIS' HUSBAND
           Good evening, Edward.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Wonderful news. Congratulations.

                         
          Meanwhile, Vivian has moved to the corner of the balustrade.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hey, come here. You gotta look at this.

                         
          Medium close shot on the box. Edward, who, as we already know it,
          is afraid of heights, doesn't want to move any closer to the
          balustrade.

                         

                          EDWARD
           It's all right. I've already seen it.

                          VIVIAN
           If you're afraid of heights, why do you get seats up here ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Because they're the best.

                         
          He sits down, and Vivian also sits down. The ushers, who had
          remained behind them, slightly bends down toward Edward.

                         

                          USHER
           Is there anything else, sir ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, thank you.

                         
          He shows them something underneath the balustrade, and then moves
          away.

                         

                          USHER
           The glasses are there. Enjoy the opera.

                          VIVIAN
           Oh !

                         
          She picks up the opera glasses.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So, you said this is in Italian.

                         
          She tries to look through the glasses, but doesn't succeed in
          setting them right on their handle.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mm-hmmm.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So how am I gonna know what they're singing. These are
           broken.

                         
          Edward takes the glasses from Vivian's hand.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Mine are broken.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, no. That's okay It's all right.

                         
          He sets them right on their handle, and gives them back to Vivian.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You'll know. Believe me, you'll understand.

                         
          Vivian looks through the glasses, while the lights are switching
          off and on, to warn the spectators that the opera is about to
          begin.

                          EDWARD
           The music's very powerful.

                         
          Mediums full shot on the two next boxes on the right of Edward's
          box. The spectators, who understood the lights signal, are sitting
          down.

                         
          Back to Edward's box. Medium close shot on Vivian and Edward.
          Vivian is looking through her glasses.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           There's a band !

                         
          Medium shot on the two other boxes. The light are definitely
          switched off, and ushers are closing the curtains on the exit
          doors.

                         
          Back to Vivian and Edward. We hardly see them in the dark.

                         

                          EDWARD
           People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is
           very dramatic. They either love it or they hate it. If they
           love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may
           learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of
           their soul.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Mmm.

                         
          The orchestra plays the overture of «La Traviata».

                         
          The lights, coming from the stage, enable us to see Vivian and
          Edward's faces. Vivian is smiling broadly. Edward is concentrated
          on the music and serious.

                         
          Close shot on Vivian's face. Still smiling broadly, she turns
          briefly toward Edward, and then goes back looking at the stage.
          She bends down on the balustrade to have a better look at the
          stage.

                         

          SAN FRANCISCO OPERA HOUSE - STAGE - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          The sets and the costumes are beautiful and very classic in their
          design. We see and hear the Love Duet of Act One in Violetta's
          sitting room.

                         
          Violetta walks to the forefront of the stage, and the camera moves
          away from her, showing, seen from the stage, Edward and Vivian in
          their box.

                         
          The picture and the music dissolve to the Second Act in Violetta's
          garden. Violetta is bending on Alfredo and singing.

          Violetta kisses Alfredo on the mouth, and then walks away.

                         
          The music dissolves on the Final Scene of the Third Act, and the
          picture dissolves on :

          Vivian's face : she is crying.

                         
          Close shot on Edward's face : he looks at Vivian.
          Back on Vivian's face, crying.

          applauding, sitting in front of the balustrade. The two husbands
          are standing up behind them and also applauding.

                         
          Back to Edward's box. Close shot of Vivian standing up. She still
          has tears in her eyes. She walks away from her seat, coming near
          Doris' box.

                         

                          DORIS
           Did you enjoy the opera, dear ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh, it was so good, I almost peed in my pants.

                         

                          DORIS
           What ?

                         
          She seems a bit surprised by what she just heard. Vivian walks
          away, and Edward turns toward Doris.

                         

                          EDWARD
           She said she liked it better than Pirates of Penzance.

                         

                          DORIS
           Oh !
          Edward walks away, leaving a very pensive Doris. Apparently she
          doesn't completely believe Edward's translation of Vivian's
          words !

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes. Good-bye now.

                         
          Still very pensive, Doris absently waves her hand to him.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Long shot from across the street. We see the limousine parking in
          front of the hotel.

                         
          Medium long shot on the limousine parking. We hear Edward and
          Vivian's conversation in voices over.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           No, don't touch..

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           I moved the queen. I like the queen.
           EDWARD (voice over)
           You can't move the queen.

                         
          Vivian laughs, still in voice over.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Vivian and Edward are seated on either side of a round table,
          playing chess. The room is very dimly lit, and there are two lit
          candles on the table. They are still wearing their opera clothes,
          but Edward has taken his jacket off.

                         
          Slowly, the camera moves forward from an medium full shot of the
          table and the two characters on either side of it, to a close shot
          on the chess board.

                         

                          EDWARD (LAUGHING)
           Did you really do that ? Why don't we finish this
           tomorrow ? It's really late, and I have to work.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Why don't you not go to work tomorrow. Take the day off.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Me, not work ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I do own the company.

                         
          The picture dissolves into :

          twins towers.

                         

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - PHILIP'S ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          High angle shot on Philip's desk. Various documents are spread on
          the desk. But set above these documents, there is a miniature
          billiard table. And Philip is practicing his billiard with a
          miniature billiard cue. He makes a shot and then looks at a
          printed document lying next to the miniature table. He then moves
          a ball on the billiard table.

                         
          A female secretary comes into view on the left of the screen. She
          is handing some documents to Philip.

                         

                          SECRETARY
           Here are the storage reports you wanted, and Mr. Lewis
           called.

                         
          Philip doesn't take the documents and she puts them on the desk.

                         

                          PHILIP
           What'd he say ?

                          SECRETARY
           He said he's taking the day off.

                         
          Philip looks very surprised.

                         

                          PHILIP
           He's taking the day off ?

                         

                          SECRETARY
           That's what he said.

                         
          She walks away, leaving a very perplexed Philip.

                         

          LOS ANGELES - A PUBLIC PARK - EXTERIOR DAY

          pool.

                         
          Full shot of Edward and Vivian walking along the fountain, Vivian
          walking on a low wall, and Edward walking in the lane. Vivian is
          wearing a white dress with thin vertical stripes, and carrying a
          little black purse. Edward is wearing a very elegant grey suit,
          and he is carrying his leather briefcase.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm starving. There's a snap dog vendor over there. Do you
           have any money ?

                         
          She jumps down from the low wall and takes Edward's arm.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I have money. I don't know what a snap dog is, but I have
           money.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, I'm gonna give, um... you'll buy a snap dog. We'll
           cop a squat under a tree somewhere.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Cop a what ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Cop a squat.

                         
          Later on a lawn in the park.

                         
          Medium close shot on a tartan red blanket spread on the lawn.
          Vivian is kneeling on the blanket, with Edward seated next to her.
          She has already taken one of Edward's shoes and socks off, and she
          is taking the other sock off. Edward is talking on his cellphone.

                         

                          EDWARD
           All right, read the first two pages.

                         
          Medium full shot of the lawn. We see that Vivian and Edward are
          sitting under a tree. Vivian takes the other sock off.

                          EDWARD
           Okay... Mmm...

                         
          Vivian stands up, and takes Edward's cellphone away from his ear,
          and shuts it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I was talking to someone.

          Closer shot on Edward and Vivian. Vivian is apparently explaining
          something to Edward with a lot of hand movements.

          LIMOUSINE - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Edward and Vivian are seated next to each other inside the
          limousine. Edward is wearing a suit and a tie, and Vivian is
          wearing a purple dress.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Did you know that two of the Bach pieces that we heard
           tonight... were found by Felix Mendelssohn in a butcher's
           shop ? They were wrapping meat with the sheet music.

                         
          Vivian is not listening to Edward and she keeps looking through
          the car window. She seems nervous.

                          EDWARD
           What's with you ? You're fidgeting. What's wrong ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Um... There's a club up here that I'd like to stop into for
           a second to see my roommate, if that's okay ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Absolutely.

                         
          He raises his voice.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Darryl !

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Uh, Darryl, can you just pull up into the back alleyway,
           please ?

           You say this is a nice place. I'm sure it's a very nice
           place.

                         
          He closes the door of the car.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I just wanna run in for a minute and see if she's there, so
           just stay here.

                         
          A quick shot on people exchanging «things», maybe drugs.
          Back to the limousine.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm hoping they don't spot this limousine as it is.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'll block it with my body.

                         
          He leans on the limousine.

                         
          Vivian walks away toward the entrance of the night club.

          Vivian enters the room, looking for Kit.

                         

                          LYRICS

           Hey, Viv, you looking good, man. What'd you win, the
           lottery or what ?
          Vivian walks toward Rachel, one of the dancing girls.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hey, Rachel, have you seen Kit ?

           No, not since, uh, Tuesday. Hey, and Carlos is looking for
           her too.

                         
           A CUSTOMER (voice over)
           Hiya, honey, you look great.

                         
          Vivian walks toward the bar and Pops, the bartender, standing
          behind it.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hi, Pops. Thanks. Have you seen Kit ?

           Hi.

                         
          We hear the muffled sound of the music, coming from the club.

                         

          THE BLUE BANANA CLUB - MAIN ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          We hear the music loud again.

                         
          Medium shot of Vivian, still standing near the bar and facing
          Pops. She is writing something on a piece of paper.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Here's my number where I'm gonna be for the rest of the
           week. Have her call me or come by, okay ?

                         

                          POPS
           Okay, honey. Thanks.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Thanks.

                         
          She walks away from the bar.

                         

          BACK ALLEYWAY - EXTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Muffled sound of the music coming from inside the night club.

           Fame, what you like is in the limo. Fame.

                         
          Mediums shot of Vivian coming out of the club. On the door, a sign
          says «I.D. Required». Vivian stops when she sees the strange crowd
          around Edward, then she starts walking again. She stops when she
          gets near Edward. Among the tough-looking guys around Edward, we
          recognize Carlos, still wearing his eternal hat, and another guy,
          one of Carlos' lieutenants, wearing a leather jacket, and holding
          a long stick in his hands.

                         

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What's going on out here ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I don't know. You left and all of a sudden I'm in the
           middle of West Side Story.

                         

                          CARLOS
           I think you owe me some money, baby.

           THE GUY WITH THE STICK
           Two hundred dollars.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why don't you go to school tomorrow ?

                         
          A girl, standing behind the group, starts giggling very stupidly.

                         

                          CARLOS
           Now I hear you got yourself a new job ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Let's just leave.

                         
          She starts walking away, but Carlos puts himself in her way.

                         

                          CARLOS
           You ain't going no place.

                         
          Edward takes a step forward.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey...

                         
          The guy, standing next to Carlos, takes a very long knife out of
          his skateboard.

                         

                          CARLOS
           You're out of your neighborhood, home boy. This ain't no
           Beverly Hills !

                         

                          EDWARD
           I don't believe this. He has this knife coming out of his
           skateboard. He's going to stab me.

                         
          He turns toward the guy with the stick.

                         

                          EDWARD
           What are you gonna do, you gonna strangle me with a
           Slinky ?

                         
          The stupid girl giggles again. Carlos turns toward her.

                         

                          CARLOS
           Shut up !

                         

                          EDWARD
           All right, okay, this is what's happening. You believe that
           this person owes you money, right, two hundred dollars ?

                         

                          CARLOS
           That's right.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why ?

                         

                          CARLOS
           Because this is my block.

                         
          Edward turns toward Vivian.

                          EDWARD
           His block ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           He's a drug dealer. It has to do with Kit. Let's just go,
           Edward.

                         
          She starts walking away. But Carlos is in their way.

                         

                          CARLOS
           Edward. So how's it feel to be a trick ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I am not a trick. This is a trick.

                         
          He points his hand toward Darry.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Darryl ! Left pocket.

                         
          Medium close shot on Darryl, standing near the limousine. He opens
          his jacket, revealing a holster with a gun inside.

                         
          Back to the group around Vivian and Edward.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Isn't that incredible ? And he does have a permit. Thank
           you, gentlemen.

                         
          He pushes Vivian in front of him and crosses the group. He stops a
          couple of seconds near Carlos.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Don't you ever go near her again.

           VIVIAN (voice over)
           Does Darryl always carry a gun ?

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           When he drives me, yes, always.

                         
          The picture dissolves into :

                         

          PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          Through the open door of the bathroom, we see Vivian getting ready
          for the night. She is wearing a sleeveless nightdress. She
          releases her hair, which were tied in a bun, and walks out of the
          bathroom. She stops and looks at the bed.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           He sleeps.

                         
          Reverse close shot on Edward asleep half-sitting in the bed. He is
          bare-chested. Vivian walks between him and the camera. She sits
          down on the bed.

                         
          Reverse close shot on Vivian's face. She is smiling. She gently
          kisses her index finger.

                         
          Medium shot of Vivian and Edward. Vivian puts her finger on
          Edward's lips. She slowly bends down toward his face, and kisses
          him on the cheek, hesitates a second, then kisses him on the lips.
          He slowly wakes up, and blinks his eyes. He answers to Vivian's
          kisses. He raises up from the bed, kissing Vivian passionately.

                         
          The camera moves around the bed, while the couple is lying on it,
          kissing passionately.

                         
          Vivian removes her nightdress, and goes back kissing Edward.

                         
          Later.

                         
          The camera tilts down from the head of the bed.

                         
          Edward is asleep, holding Vivian is his arm. She is still awake
          and smiling. She gently strokes his arm.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I love you.

                         
          She closes her eyes.

                         

          PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium shot on Edward seated at the breakfast table.

                         
          Edward is fully dressed, but without his jacket. He is eating
          breakfast.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           What are you thinking about sitting here all by yourself ?
          Full shot on the breakfast table. Vivian is wearing a black
          nightgown with flowers printed on it. She is looking at the
          newspaper.

                         

                          EDWARD
           The fact that this will be our last night together, and
           you'll finally be rid of me.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, you've been pretty tough to take.

                         
          She sits down on a chair.

                         

                          EDWARD
           My business is almost over, so I'll be going back to New
           York.

                         
          Quick close shot on Vivian's face, who seems very pensive.

                         
          Back to Edward.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'd really like to see you again.

                         
          Vivian smiles.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You would ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes. Yes, I would, so I've arranged for you to have an
           apartment, to have a car...

                         
          Vivian's smiling face saddens a bit.

                         

                          EDWARD
           ...to have a wide variety of stores guaranteed to suck up
           to you anytime you want to go shopping. Everything's done.

                         
          Vivian takes her head in her hand and bends down on the table. She
          exhales.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What else ? You gonna leave some money by the bed when you
           pass through town ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Vivian, it really wouldn't be like that.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           How would it be ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, for one thing, it would get you off the streets.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           That's just geography.

                         
          Vivian stands up and walks to the terrace.

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium full shot of Vivian walking out of the penthouse on the
          terrace. In the background, we see Edward still seated at the
          breakfast table. Vivian bends on the balustrade. Edward stands up,
          and walks toward Vivian.

                         
          Slight low angle shot taken from outside the terrace, showing
          Vivian bending on the balustrade.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Vivian, what is it you want ?

                         
          Medium close shot on Edward standing by the terrace door.

                         

                          EDWARD
           What do you see happening between us ?

                         
          Back to Vivian bending over the balustrade.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I don't know. When I was a little girl, my mama used to
           lock me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty
           often. And I would... I would pretend I was a princess...
           trapped in a tower by a wicked queen.

                         
          Edward is seriously listening to Vivian.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           And then suddenly this knight...

                         
          Back to Vivian bending over the balustrade.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           ...on a white horse with these colors flying would come
           charging up and draw his sword. And I would wave. And he
           would climb up the tower and rescue me.

                         
          She walks away from the balustrade and toward Edward.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           But never in all the time... that I had this dream did the
           knight say to me, «Come on, baby, I'll put you up in a
           great condo».

                         
          The phone rings inside the penthouse. After a couple of seconds,
          Edward walks into the penthouse, and picks up the phone.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes.

                         
          Vivian starts walking into the room.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           I had to call.

          standing near the sink in his bathroom. On the counter next to the
          sink, a lot of bottles and jars : perfumes and cosmetics. Philip
          is calling from a wireless telephone.

                         

                          PHILIP
           I just got off the phone with James Morse. Get this.

          Back to the same scene, with Vivian standing near the terrace
          door, and looking a bit sad, and, in the background, in the
          living-room, Edward on the telephone.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           He wants to meet with you today.

                         

                          EDWARD
           What about ?

                         
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           He wouldn't say.

                         

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY
          Philip, the phone receiver stuck between his shoulder and his
          head, is drying his hands on a white towel.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Edward, I think we got him. His nuts are on the block. We
           got him !

                         
          He slams his towel on the counter.

          Same shot. We hear Philip's laugh on the phone.

                         
           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           Look, if he's really caving in, I want to get him to commit
           his stocks to us this afternoon. Hmm ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, it's no good. If he's really caving in, I don't want to
           wait until this afternoon. Have Morse meet me downtown this
           morning. Good-bye.

                         
          He puts the phone down and grabs his jacket from a chair. He puts
          his jacket on while walking toward Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I have to go now, but I want you to understand... I heard
           everything you said. This is all I'm capable of right now.
           It's a very big step for me.

                         
          She absently straightened his tie.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I know. It's a really good offer for a girl like me.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I've never treated you like a prostitute.
          He looks at her, then walks away toward the front door. Out of his
          hearing, Vivian whispers :

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You just did.

                         
          We hear the front door closing.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium shot on the front desk. Miss Wilson, the receptionist, is
          standing behind the counter. She doesn't wear her large glasses,
          but she looks a bit worried.

                         
          The camera slowly pans across the counter, and we discover Barney,
          the manager, talking on the phone.

                         

                          BARNEY
           It's Barnard Thompson here, Miss Vivian.

                         
          The camera keeps on panning and we discover Kit, chewing gum, and
          looking in a bad mood. On the top half of her body, she is only
          wearing a bra made into a fabric with a panther-skin motif

                         

                          BARNEY
           Could you come down to the front desk ? There's someone
           here who wants to speak to you. She says her name is Miss
           De Luca...

                         
          Kit extends her hand to take the phone.

                         

                          KIT
           Let me talk to her. Let me... Let me just talk to her.

                         
          Barney gives the phone to Kit.

                         

                          KIT
           Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here ? The sphincter
           police won't let me through. Okay.

                         
          She gives the phone back to Barney.

                         

                          KIT
           She's on her way.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Fine.

                         
          An uniformed attendant walks to the counter.

                         

                          THE ATTENDANT
           Mr. Thompson.

                         
          Barney turns toward him and Kit replaces the phone receiver on its
          hook.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Yes.

                          THE ATTENDANT
           The window washer is refusing to come down.

                         
          The attendant walks away.

                         

                          BARNEY
           It's a Saturday. Wait here, please.
           (to Miss Wilson)
           Watch her.

                         
          Barney walks away.

                         
           MISS WILSON (voice over)
           Yes, sir.

                         
          Kit bends down on the counter polished surface and blows on it.

                         
          Miss Wilson looks at her with a perplexed eye.

                         
          Kit stands up and smiles to Miss Wilson. Further along the
          counter, a couple of middle-aged customers stare at her. She turns
          her face toward them.

                          KIT
           Fifty bucks, Grandpa. For seventy-five, the wife can watch.

                         
          The couple walks away.

                         
          Miss Wilson looks at the leaving couple, then looks at Kit with a
          suppressed smile.

                         
          Kit smiles back at her.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          Long shot on the swimming pool, seen from the terrace above the
          pool. A woman in bathing suit is coming up the stairs to the
          terrace, drying her daughter with a pink towel.

                         
          Reverse medium shot on the stairs. Vivian and Kit are coming down
          the stairs. The mother and her daughter are coming up. Vivian is
          wearing a very elegant dark pink suit with a white shirt. Kit has
          put a grey denim jacket over her panther-decorated bra, but she is
          also wearing a very short and tight black skirt. Vivian has put
          her arm in the crook of Kit's elbow.

                         
          The camera follows Kit and Vivian.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Listen, I've been calling you.

                         

                          KIT
           Yeah, I know. They told me at the Banana you were looking
           for me.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You were supposed to come by Tuesday. I left the money at
           the desk.

                         

                          KIT
           I was hiding out from Carlos.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, if you picked up the money, you wouldn't have to
           hide.

                         

                          KIT
           Hey, I was busy. I had a life, you know. Nino got beat up.
           We had to visit him in the hospital. Rachel got arrested.
           It was a mess. Anyway, I got the money.

                         
          Kit waves the envelope with the money inside.

                         

                          KIT
           Thank you very much for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get
           off of it.

                         
          Now the two girls have reached the bottom of the stair, and they
          are walking between the dinner tables surrounding the pool.

                         

                          KIT
           You know, he was talking about you last night. He would
           bust something if he saw you in this outfit.

                         
          Reverse shot. The camera is a couple of yards in front of Vivian
          and Kit, and we see the two girls coming toward us.

                         

                          KIT
           I was afraid to hug you up there. I might wrinkle you !

                         
          Vivian lets go of Kit's arm and laughs.

                         

                          KIT
           You look really good.

                         
          Vivian points to a table.

                         

                          KIT
           No, something with shade.

                         
          Vivian points to another table.

                         

                          KIT
           You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the
           Boulevard looking like you do, not that you ever did.

                         
          Kit sits down. Then Vivian also sits down.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, thanks, but it's easy to clean up when you got money.

                         

                          KIT
           Yeah. So, when does he leave ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Tomorrow.

                         

                          KIT
           You get to keep the clothes ?

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah. Edward asked me if I wanted to see him again. But I
           think... I think definitely no. I mean, it's just another
           week, right ?

                         
          Kit has put her chewing gum into a teaspoon and she puts the spoon
          on the table.

                         

                          KIT
           «Definitely no».

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah.

                         
          Kits looks worried.

                         

                          KIT
           Oh, no.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What ?

                          KIT
           I know this weepy look on your face.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh, no, you don't !

                         

                          KIT
           You fell in love with him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No. Kit, please. Stop it.

                         

                          KIT
           You've fallen in love with him ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Kit !

                         

                          KIT
           Did you kiss him ? On the mouth ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Uh, yeah, yeah... I did.

                         

                          KIT
           You kissed him on the mouth ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I did. It was nice.

                         

                          KIT
           You fall in love with him, and you kiss him on the mouth.
           Did I not teach you anything ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Look, I'm not stupid, okay ? I'm... I'm not in love with
           him. I just... I like him.

                          KIT
           You like him ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah.

                         

                          KIT
           You definitely like him. Well, he's not a bum. He's a rich,
           classy guy.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Who's gonna break my heart, right ?

                         

                          KIT
           Oh, no. Come on. You don't know that. Hey, he asked you,
           right ? Maybe you guys could, like, um, you know, get a
           house together. Like, buy some diamonds and a horse. I
           don't know.

                         
          Vivian laughs.

                         

                          KIT
           Anyway, it could work. It happens.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           When does it happen, Kit ? When does it really happen ? Who
           does it really work out for ? Did it work out for Skinny
           Marie or Rachel ? No !

                         

                          KIT
           Those were very specific cases of crackheads.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I just wanna know who it works out for. You give me one
           example of somebody that we know that it happened for.

                         

                          KIT
           Name someone ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah, one person that it worked out for.

                         

                          KIT
           You want me to give you a name or something.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah. I'd like to know.

                         
          Kit presses her hands on her temples.

                         

                          KIT
           Oh, God, the pressure of a name.

                         
          She sighs and takes her hands out of her temples.

                         

                          KIT
           Cinder-fucking-rella.

                         
          Vivian laughs. Kit starts laughing too.

          EDWARD'S OFFICE IN L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          The sidewalk in front of Edward's office building.

                         
          Medium shot of Edward walking from the curb, carrying his
          briefcase. He climbs the stairs that reaches to the upper level of
          the sidewalk and the entrance of the building. He slows down when
          he hears a father talking to his son

                         
           THE FATHER (voice over)
           If you do, I'll give you a piggy-back ride when you... See,
           I told you so... Not quick enough for the old man !

                         
          He laughs. Edward stops to look at him.

                         
          Reverse shot on the father and his son. The father is wearing a
          dark-blue tracksuit with advertisements printed on it. The son,
          about ten year-old, is wearing a white shirt and beige slacks. The
          father is carrying a cheap briefcase. They are running around a
          lamp-post.

                         

                          THE FATHER
           Winner gets a piggy-back. Come on, saddle up, boy.

                         
          He bends down for his son to climb on his back. The son jumps on
          his back. The father sighs.

                         
          Back on Edward, standing in the middle of the stairway, and
          looking at the father with a smile.

                         
           THE FATHER (voice over)
           Oh, Zachary ! Too many doughnuts.

                         
          Father and son laugh. Edward starts walking again.

                         
          Long shot on the large terrace in front of the building. Edward is
          crossing it toward the entrance. He slows down to give a last look
          the the father and his son.

          Medium full shot on the long conference table. Edward is standing
          behind his chair at the end of the table, in front of the bay
          window. All the other ones are already seated. On Edward's right
          hand side, James Morse and then David Morse. On Edward's left hand
          side, Philip. The other seats are occupied by the various male
          assistants.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Mr. Morse, you said this morning you wished to speak to Mr.
           Lewis. Mr. Lewis is now listening.

                         
          Edward is pacing up and down in front of the bay window.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           I've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer...
           on one condition. I'm not so concerned about me, but the
           people who are working for me.

                         

                          PHILIP
           It's not a problem. They'll be taken care of. Well, then,
           gentlemen. If we could address ourselves to the contracts
           in front of you. If you look at...

                         
          Edward hardly listens to what Philip says. He seems worried. He
          raises a hand.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Excuse me, Phil.

                         
          Philip looks up at him.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Gentlemen, I'd like to speak to Mr. Morse alone. Thank you.

                         
          Philip seems surprised by what Edward just said. A bit
          reluctantly, he says :

                         

                          PHILIP
           All right, gentlemen, you heard the man. Please wait
           outside.
          All the assistants stand up to leave the room.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You too, Phil.

                         
          Philip, still seated, looks up at Edward. He looks very surprised
          and chuckles nervously.

                         

                          PHILIP
           What do you mean ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I mean I would like to speak to Mr. Morse alone.

                         
          Philip stands up and points toward David Morse.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Why does he get to stay ?

                         
          James Morse makes a discreet sign to his grand-son to enjoin him
          to leave the room.

                         
          Edward and Philip are standing, facing each other.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Please, please.

                         
          Reluctantly, Philip starts moving away.

                         

                          PHILIP
           I'll be right outside.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Good.

                         
          Philip leaves the room, followed by David.

          manipulates the control of the vertical Venetian blinds, to dim
          the daylight in the room.

           Is that better ?

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           It's all right.

                          EDWARD
           Would you like a cup of coffee ?

                          JAMES MORSE
           Black.

                         
          Edward takes the coffee pot to pour the coffee. He sighs loudly.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mr. Morse, my interests in your company have changed.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           What is it you're after now, Mr. Lewis ?

                         
          Edward brings the cup on the table in front of James.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, I no longer wish to buy your company and take it
           apart. But I don't want anyone else to, either. And it is
           still extremely vulnerable. So I find myself... in
           unfamiliar territory. I want to help you.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           Why ?

          standing on either side of it. But they can't hear what is said
          inside the room. Philip gives a quick look at David and walks away
          toward the center of the hall.

          Full shot of the room. Edward is now seated in his chair facing
          James.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mr. Morse, I think we can do something very special with
           your company.

                          JAMES MORSE
           What about our Navy contracts ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Ah, they weren't dead. Just delayed. I... bluffed a little
           bit.

                         
          Medium shot of James, who chuckles.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           You're very good at it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you very much. It's my job.

                         
          He bends down and chuckles. Then he stands up from his chair.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I think we can leave the details up to the others.

                         
          More slowly than Edward, James stands up.

                          JAMES MORSE
           I find this hard to say without sounding condescending,
           but... I'm proud of you.

                         
          He puts his hand on Edward's shoulder. Edward seems moved by this
          gesture.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you. I think we can let in the other suits now.

                          EDWARD
           Let's continue the meeting.

                         
          He goes back into the meeting room, followed by Philip, David and
          all the assistants.

                         
          Through the open door, we see James Morse, standing at the back of
          the room, near Edward's chair. He motions to the men to sit down.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           Come in, gentlemen. Sit down.

           Edward, please, what was this all about ? Hmm ?

                         
          Edward slaps him on the arm.

                         

                          EDWARD
           It's all yours, Phil. Finish it up.

           PHILIP (voice over, heard through the door)
           Hold it. Hold it. These aren't signed ! These aren't
           signed ! Could someone please tell me what the fuck is
           going on here ?

           You know, I think I'm gonna go for a walk. Just stay here
           for a while. I'll be back.

                         

                          DARRYL

           Well, well. Hello again. I'm looking for Edward.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Edward's not here. I thought he was with you.

                         

                          PHILIP
           No. Uh, Edward is definitely not with me.

                         
          He walks in without waiting for Vivian to invite him in.

                         
          He chuckles. Vivian closes the front door.

                         

                          PHILIP
           No, if Edward were with me...

                         
          He puts his briefcase down on the floor and walks into the room.

                         

                          PHILIP
           When. Actually, when... Edward was with me, he didn't blow
           off billion dollar deals !

                         
          He walks to the bar and helps himself for a drink.

                         

                          PHILIP
           I think that, uh, Edward's with you. That's what I think.
           Mind if I have a drink ?

                         
          He pours whisky in a glass without waiting for Vivian's answer.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No.

                         
          He holds the glass toward her.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No, thank you.

                         
          She walks away from him.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Well, I'll just wait.

                         
          She sits down on the sofa, crosses her legs on the couch and
          starts writing in a notebook. Behind him, Philip sits down on a
          stool near the bar.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home.

                         
          Medium shot on Philip at the bar. He stands up and slowly walks
          toward her. The camera follows him.

                         

                          PHILIP
           You know...

                          (HE CHUCKLES)
           ...this is not home. This is, uh, a hotel room. And, uh,
           you are not... the little woman.

                         
          He sits down on the sofa, next to Vivian. She uncrosses her legs
          and lets them down on the floor. He puts his glass on the low
          table, crosses his fingers and snickers.

                         

                          PHILIP
           You're a hooker. Maybe you're a very good hooker, you
           know ?
          She puts her notebook on the low table.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing
           millions of dollars. Because I have to be very honest with
           you right now, Vivian.

                         
          He moves slightly closer to her. She seems very tense by the
          situation.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Right now I really do care. I really do. And right now I am
           really pissed, you know ?

                         
          He moves his hand toward her bare leg. She glares at him.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Right now I am just freaking out. So maybe if I screw you,
           huh...

                         
          He puts his hand between her legs. She moves it away.

                         

                          PHILIP
           ...and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy,
           just like Edward.

                         
          He keeps on trying to fondle her, and Vivian keeps on trying to
          get rid of him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hey, get off me !

                         
          They start fighting. He stands up.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Hey, hey ! Goddamn it !

                         
          She bites his hand.

                          PHILIP
           Ow !

                         
          He slaps her face very hard. She falls down on the floor.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Ow !

                         
          He kneels down beside her and grabs her.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Come on ! Come on ! I'll pay for it.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SCREAMING)
           Get off me ! Ow ! Get off me !

                         

                          PHILIP
           How much is it ? Twenty bucks, thirty bucks ?

                         

                          VIVIAN (SCREAMING)
           Get off me ! Get off me !

                          PHILIP
           Fifty ? You a fifty dollars whore, Vivian ?

                         
          Edward, who has come silently into the room, grabs him from
          behind, and forces him to stand up.

                         

                          PHILIP
           What are you doing ? Get off !

                         
          Quick shot on Vivian slowly getting up from the floor.

                         
          Back on Philip and Edward fighting.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Stop. I don't want to hurt you ! Stop it !

                         

                          PHILIP
           I don't know how to tell you this. You already did,
           Edward !

                         
          Edward pushes him toward the front door, which is still open.

                         

                          PHILIP
           All right, all right.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Out. Out of here.

                         
          Philip falls down on the floor. He slowly stands back up

                         

                          PHILIP
           Look, she's a whore, man. She's a goddamn... Aah !

                         
          Edward very violently punches him in the face. Philip falls down
          on the floor.

                         
          Quick shot on Vivian, seated on the sofa. She starts when she sees
          Edward punching Philip.

                         
          Philip slowly stands up, his hand on his face. Edward looks at his
          hand, who seems to hurt him after the violent punch he gave to
          Philip.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Aah ! Damn. Shit. Goddamn !

                         
          He picks up Philip's briefcase and throws it through the open
          door. It falls on the floor of the hallway.

                         

                          PHILIP
           I think you broke my nose.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Get out of here.

                         

                          PHILIP (SCREAMING)
           What is wrong with you ? Come on, Edward ! I gave you ten
           years ! I devoted my whole life to you !

                          EDWARD
           That's bullshit. This is such bullshit ! It's the kill you
           love, not me ! I made you a very rich man doing exactly
           what you loved. Now get out of here !

                          (YELLING)
           Get out !

                         
          Philip, subdued, walks slowly out.

                         
          Quick shot on Vivian, still seated on the sofa, and still very
          moved by what just happened.

                         
          Back to Edward, slamming the door behind Philip. He looks very
          upset.

                         
          Later.

                         
          Close up on a box full of ice cubes. One of Edward's hands is
          taking the cubes out of the box. The other hand, the one which hit
          Philip, is wrapped in a white napkin. He puts the cubes in another
          white napkin and wraps the napkin around the cubes.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           Why do guys always know how to hit a woman right across the
           cheek ?

                         
          Close up on Vivian's face. She is touching her red cheek.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Wham ! And it feels like your eye is gonna explode. What do
           they do ? Do they pull you aside in high school and show
           you how to do this ?

                         
          We see Edward's hand holding the napkin with the ice inside. He
          puts it on Vivian's cheek.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Is that... Ow !
          Even the light touch of the napkin seems to hurt her.

                         
          The camera moves slowly away, widening the shot, and showing
          Edward in shirtsleeves bending over Vivian, without her jacket,
          and lying on the sofa.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Not all guys hit.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I heard about what you did with Morse.

                         

                          EDWARD
           That was a business decision.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           It was good.

                         

                          EDWARD
           It felt good.

                          VIVIAN
           I think this is okay.

                         
          She moves his hand away, and slowly sits up in the sofa.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I gotta get going.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes, I noticed you're packed. Why are you leaving now ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Edward, there'll always be some guy, even some friend of
           yours, thinking he can treat me like Stuckey, thinking that
           it's allowed. What are you gonna do ? You gonna beat up
           everybody ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           That's not why you're leaving.

                         
          She stands up from the sofa.

                         
          Full shot on the sofa, with Vivian standing up and Edward still
          seated.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Look, you made me a really nice offer. And a few months
           ago, no problem. But now everything is different, and
           you've changed that. And you can't change back. I want
           more.

                         
          Edward stands up from the sofa.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I know about wanting more. I invented the concept. The
           question is how much more.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I want the fairy tale.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Impossible relationships.

                         
          Vivian has put her jacket back on and she is putting her shoes on,
          seated on the step that goes across the room.

                         

                          EDWARD
           My special gift is impossible relationships.

                         
          Full shot on the room. Edward has taken his wallet, and he is
          taking money out of it. He throws the wallet on a table and sits
          down on the steps next to Vivian.

                         
          Medium shot on the steps. Edward gives the money to Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You're welcome.
          She puts the money in the pocket of her jacket. He is holding a
          business card in his hand.

                         
           If you ever need anything... dental floss, whatever... you
           give me a call.

                         
          They both chuckle.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I had a good time.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Me too.

                         
          She stands up from the steps, and starts collecting her luggage.
          Edward, who had remained seated on the steps, stands up.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Do you want me to get you a bellboy ?

                         
          She is putting the garment bags on her arm.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No, I got it.

                         
          He bends down to pick up a bag.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'll carry this.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Thanks.

                         
          She starts moving toward the front door. He walks ahead of her and
          starts opening the door, then closes it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Stay. Stay the night with me. And not because I'm paying
           you, but because you want to.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I can't.

                         
          She seems very sad. She opens the door. He holds it for her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Good-bye.

                         
          She starts moving out, then stops and smiles to him

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I think you have a lot of special gifts.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mmm.

                         
          Edward closes the door without looking at her.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY
          Close shot on the marbled floor. There is a black spot on it.
          Barney and an uniformed attendant are kneeling on either side of
          the black spot.

                         

                          THE ATTENDANT
           I didn't do it, sir.

                         

                          BARNEY
           No, no. Now, I didn't say that. I want you to call
           maintenance and have them deal with this. You must delegate
           authority.

                         
          Vivian's legs walk in and stop between the two men.

                         

                          THE ATTENDANT
           Yes, sir.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hi, Barney.

                         
          The camera tilts up and we see the faces of all of those three
          people. The two men stand up

                         

                          BARNEY
           Miss Vivian.

                         
          The attendant doesn't move away and looks at Vivian with a light
          smile. Barney looks at him.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Thank you.

                         
          The attendant walks away.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I wanted to say good-bye.

                          BARNEY
           Well, then, I gather you're not accompanying Mr. Lewis to
           New York.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Come on, Barney. You and me live in the real world... most
           of the time.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Have you arranged for transportation ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm gonna call a cab.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Allow me.

                         
          He points to Darryl, whom we don't see, and calls him.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Darryl.
           DARRYL (voice over)
           Yes, sir.

                         
          Darryl walks near Vivian.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Please take Miss Vivian anywhere she wishes to go.

                         

                          DARRYL
           Yes, sir.

                         
          Darry walks away. Vivian holds her hand out to Barney. Barney
          bends down and lightly kisses the extended hand. Then he shakes
          it.

                         

                          BARNEY
           It's been a pleasure knowing you. Come and visit us again
           sometime.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Stay cool.

                         
          She slaps him on the arm and walks away. Barney turns around and
          looks at her walking away.

          Vivian turns around to have a last look at the hotel.

          Vivian turns back and look absently in front of her, with the same
          pensive, slightly sad, look on her face.

                         

                          LYRICS

           I close my eyes And dream away.

                         
          The scene dissolves into :

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR EVENING

                         
          Medium shot taken from outside the terrace, of Edward standing
          near the balustrade. His vest is open and he has taken his tie
          off. He tries to look over the balustrade, but can't.

                         

                          LYRICS
           It must have been love, But it's over now. It must have
           been good...

                         
          He walks away from the balustrade, and back into the penthouse.

                         

                          LYRICS
           ...But I lost it somehow. It must have been love, But it's
           over now.

                         
          The camera lets Edward go inside the penthouse and pans to the
          right along the wall and the foliage decorating the terrace.

                         
          The picture dissolves into the foliage on the other side of the
          French window and :

                         

          PENTHOUSE - TERRACE - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          Next day.

                         

                          LYRICS
           From the moment we touched, Till the time had run out.

                         
          The camera pans to the left from the foliage to a medium shot on
          the window.

                         
          Edward comes out on the terrace. He is fully dressed in an elegant
          grey suit. The camera follows Edward. We hear some thunder
          rumbling in the distance. Edward moves to the balustrade. He is
          holding a jewel case in his hand. It is the one with Vivian's
          necklace inside.
          A bell boy is coming out on the terrace. He has some luggage in
          his hands.

                         

                          BELL BOY
           Is that everything, sir ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yes. Yes, that's everything.

                         

                          BELL BOY
           I'll meet you downstairs, sir.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you.

                         
          The bell boy walks away from the terrace, carrying luggage.

                         
          More thunder and end of the music.

                         

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
          Close shot on kit, seen through the window. It's raining. She is
          holding a picture of her and Vivian. She chuckles.

                         

                          KIT
           We look so dopey.

                         
          Medium shot inside the room. Kit is seated near the window,
          holding a Teddy Bear on her laps. She stands up.

                         

                          KIT
           San Francisco's not that great, you know.

                         
          She walks toward Vivian, who is wearing slacks, a white T-shirt
          and a dark jacket. Her hair is tied into a bun.

                         

                          KIT
           It's bad climate. It's foggy. It's unpredictable.

                         
          The camera moves back into a full shot of the room.

                         
          Vivian is putting things away in a bag.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'll wear a sweater.

                         

                          KIT
           What are you gonna do there ?

                         
          She sits down.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Get a job. Finish high school. I got things I can do. I
           used to make pretty good grades in high school.

                         

                          KIT
           Yeah, I could see that about you. I could see that.

                         
          She turns around to face Kit.

                          VIVIAN
           Sure you won't come with me ?

                         
          Kit looks around her.

                         

                          KIT
           And leave all this ? Not in a million.

                         
          She laughs.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Come here.

                         
          Kit stands up, puts the Teddy Bear down, and walks toward her.
          Vivian takes some money out of her pocket. She puts the money in
          the breast pocket of Kit's denim jacket.

                         

                          KIT
           Whoa. Whoa. What is this ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           It's part of the Edward Lewis scholarship fund. We think
           you got a lot of potential, Kit De Luca.

                         

                          KIT
           You do ? You think I got potential ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh, yeah. Don't let anybody tell you different, okay ?

                         

                          KIT
           Okay.

                         
          Vivian is crying.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Take care of you.

                         
          She puts a cap on Kit's head.

                         

                          KIT
           No, I can't, I can't. It's your favorite.

                         
          She takes it off and gives it back to Vivian. She walks away.

                         

                          KIT
           What time's your bus ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           An hour.

                         

                          KIT
           Yeah, well, I gotta split, 'cause good-byes make me crazy.
           So, take care of you.

                         
          She hugs Vivian.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Whoa.
          Vivian slaps Kit's back, and then kisses her on the head.

          Medium shot from behind the front desk. Barney is behind the
          counter, working on some paperwork. Miss Wilson is standing
          besides him, with her large glasses back on her nose. Edward walks
          to the desk. Barney smiles to him.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Mr. Lewis.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You don't have any messages for me, do you ?

                         

                          BARNEY
           No, I'm afraid not, sir.

                         
          Edward starts signing some documents on the counter.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'll need a car to the airport also.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Of course. Darryl will take you wherever you need to go.

                         
          Darryl walks to the desk.

           Yes, sir.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Thank you, Darryl.

                         
          Darryl walks away. Edward pushes the signed documents across the
          counter to Barney.

                         

                          EDWARD
           One last thing.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Yes.

                         
          Edward gives the jewel box to Barney.

                         

                          EDWARD
           If you could possibly return this to Fred's for me, please.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Yes, of course. May I, sir ?

                         
          Edward chuckles.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Of course, please.
          Barney opens the jewel box.

           It must be difficult to let go of something so beautiful.

                          BARNEY
           You know, Darryl also drove Miss Vivian home yesterday.

                         
          Edward doesn't answer, but his face indicates he has taken the
          information in.
          Back to Barney.

                         

                          BARNEY
           I'll take care of it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you, Mr. Thompson.

                         
          Edward walks away, followed by the bell boy carrying his luggage.
          Barney looks at him with a puzzled eye.

                         

          LIMOUSINE - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium shot of Edward seated in the back of the limousine. He has
          an absent look on his face. It is raining outside.

                         
           DARRYL (voice over, from the driver's seat)
           Your plane is leaving as scheduled, sir, and you should be
           back in New York on time.

                         
          Edward gives Darryl a quick look, then look absently through the
          window. He must think about something that makes him smile a
          little.

                         

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Vivian is also looking absently through the window of her hotel
          room.

                         

          HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium shot on a fast food stand on the street. Kit is standing in
          front of the stand, talking to Angel, another prostitute whom we
          have already briefly seen early in the film in the Blue Banana
          Club. She is drinking Coca-Cola from a paper tumbler.

                         

                          KIT
           I'm gonna have to charge you a little more rent than
           Vivian... because I've got this beauty course I'm looking
           into. I'm not gonna be there that much, you know ?

                         
          Full shot showing the whole sidewalk with the food stand in the
          middle. On the right of the food stand, a very small temporary
          flower stand in front of a closed shop. While Kit keeps on talking
          to her prospective roommate, Edward walks behind them.

                         

                          KIT
           'Cause you can't... You just can't turn tricks forever. You
           gotta have a goal. Do you have a goal ?

                         
          Closer shot on the flower stand and the florist, a middle-aged
          woman. Edward has just reached the stand.

                         
           ANGEL (voice over)
           Well, I always wanted to be in the Ice Capades.

                         
          Edward is looking at the flowers.

                         

                          THE FLORIST
           Help you, love ?
          Edward points to a bunch of flowers. The florist gives it to him.

                         

                          EDWARD
           There you go. Thank you very much.

                         
          He gives her money, takes the flowers and puts his wallet back
          into his jacket inside pocket. He walks away.

                         
          Back to Kit and Angel at the food stand.

                         

                          KIT
           So, you got a lot of stuff you gotta move in ?

                         

                          ANGEL
           No, Carlos burned most of my stuff when I said I was moving
           out.

                         

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Medium full shot. Vivian is putting her handbag on her shoulder,
          getting ready to move out of the room. She has already reached the
          front door, when she hears a car honking repeatedly. She stops and
          slowly turns around.

                         
          We hear music from La Traviata, a soprano solo.

                         
          Vivian drops the bag and walks toward the window. The music gets
          louder and Vivian has a broad smile. She walks to the window.

                         

          SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          High angle shot of the street, as seen from Vivian's hotel window.
          The limousine is slowly driving toward the hotel. The roof of the
          limousine is open, and the upper half of Edward's body is showing
          through the open roof. He has the flowers in one hand and a black
          umbrella in the other hand. The car is honking and moves closer to
          the curb.
          The car stops in front of the hotel. Edward raises one arm, the
          one with the umbrella.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Vivian !

                         
          Close shot on the window. Vivian is laughing, but also ready to
          cry.

                         
          High angle view of the roof of the car. Edward is waving both his
          umbrella and his flowers. Darryl is coming out of the driver's
          door.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Vivian !

                         
          Back to Vivian, waving to him.

                         

          VIVIAN AND KIT'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY

                         
          Vivian leaves the window.
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Princess Vivian ! Come down !

                         
          Vivian walks to another window, the one leading to the emergency
          exit.

                         

          SIDE STREET IN HOLLYWOOD - EXTERIOR DAY

                         
          High angle shot of the limousine. Edward comes out of the car
          through the roof and jumps on the sidewalk. Darryl, standing near
          the car, watches the scene and smiles.

                         
          Medium close shot on the balcony of the emergency exit. Vivian has
          come out of the room, and is smiling and looking down at Edward.

                         
          Medium close shot of Edward, standing on the sidewalk and looking
          up at Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Had to be the top floor, right ?

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over, from the top of the building)
           It's the best.

                         
          High angle shot of the emergency exit, seen from Vivian's balcony.
          We see Edward through the metal steps leading to Vivian's level.

                         

                          EDWARD
           All right. I'm coming up.

                         
          Back on the sidewalk level of the emergency exit. Edward grabs the
          emergency ladder with the hook of his umbrella, and brings it
          down.

                         
          Back on Vivian's balcony. She unties her hair, an lets it wave
          down.
          Medium shot on the emergency exit. Edward is slowly climbing the
          steps, with the flowers between his teeth.

                         
          Back to Vivian, looking down and smiling broadly.

                         
          Back to Edward on a landing of the emergency exit. He crawls on
          it, with his back pressed against the wall.

                         
          Close shot on Edward's face, with the flowers between his teeth.
          He stops moving and looks down.

                         
          High angle shot on the limousine, and Darryl, smiling
          encouragingly to Edward.

                         
          Back to Edward's close shot. He resumes his crawling walk with his
          back pressed against the wall.

                         
          Larger shot on the emergency exit landing. Edward reaches the
          ladder leading to Vivian's landing, whose shadow we see moving
          above Edward.

                         
          Low angle shot on Vivian's balcony. She walks on it to meet
          Edward.

                         
          High angle shot, seen from Vivian's eyes, and showing Edward
          walking up the last steps, holding the bannister very firmly.

                         
          Low angle shot on Vivian, standing on the top of the steps,
          laughing and looking down at Edward.

                         
          Back to Edward, who lets go of the bannister, and opens his arms
          to Vivian.

                         
          Close shot on Vivian walking down the steps. She reaches Edward,
          who climbs another step to be at her level. Their faces are now
          close to one another.

                         

                          EDWARD
           So what happened after he climbed up the tower and rescued
           her ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           She rescues him right back.

                         
          Slowly, their mouth meet, and they kiss passionately.

                         
          Full shot of Vivian's hotel and the emergency exit. On the steps
          between the top landing and the one below, we see Edward and
          Vivian kissing passionately.

                         
          End of La Traviata music.

                         
          We hear the voice of the Afro-American man we saw at the beginning
          of the film, crossing Hollywood Boulevard.

                         
           THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)
           Welcome to Hollywood. What's your dream ?

                         
          The camera moves away from the hotel and we see the Afro-American
          man coming down the street

                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN
           Everybody comes here. This is Hollywood, the land of
           dreams.

                         
          He crosses the street.

                         

                          THE AFRO-AMERICAN
           Some dreams come true, some don't. But keep on dreaming.

                         
          The picture moves away to the right of the screen, to be replaced
          by a full black screen.

                         
           THE AFRO-AMERICAN (voice over)
           This is Hollywood. Always time to dream, so keep on
           dreaming.

                         
          The credits start rolling up while we hear the song «Pretty
          Woman», performed by Roy Orbison.

                         

                          LYRICS
           Pretty woman, Walking down the street. Pretty woman, The
           kind I like to meet. Pretty woman, I don't believe you.
           You're not the truth. No one could look as good as you.
           Mercy. Pretty woman won't you pardon me. Pretty woman I
           couldn't help but see, Pretty woman, That you look lovely
           as can be. Are you lonely just like me. Oh, pretty woman.

                         
          End of music.

                         
          A short silence, and then we hear the song «No Explanation»,
          performed by Peter Cetera.

                         

                          LYRICS
           You really took me by surprise. You're someone I've needed
           for a lifetime. Your heart was cleverly disguised, And it
           didn't look that way in my mind. Tell me how could it be. I
           was the last to know. Darling, I couldn't read what was in
           your mind, To turn around and love me, With no Explanation.
           I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would
           take it With sweet consideration. And after all that we've
           been through, I can't believe it's true Until I hear you
           say. Ooh ! I know now, now, now. Ah ! No explanation. I
           gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would
           take it.

                         
          The music slowly fades out

                         
          End of credits.

          1 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - DAY. I

          A vast mansion is coming to life. Maids pull dustsheets
          off furniture; servants open shutters. Sunshine spills
          into the great rooms of Netherfield. outside, a glimpse
          of rolling parkland.

          "It is a truth universally
          acknowledged...

          Its a whirlwind of activity. Servants bustle around,
          sweeping and polishing, readying the house for its new
          occupants. The shutters of a room are opened onto the
          imposing gardens. A coach pulls up and, through the
          window, we see a young man get out.

          "that a single man in possession of a
          good fortune, must be in want of a wife"

          A white sheet is pulled from a spinet and obscures our

          2 EXT. LONGBOURN HOUSE - DAY. 2

          Elizabeth Bennet, 20, good humoured, attractive, clearly
          nobody's fool, walks through a field of tall meadow
          grass. She is reading a novel entitled 'First
          Impressions'. She approaches Longbourn, a fairly run down
          17th Century house with a small moat around it. Elizabeth
          jumps up onto a wall and crosses the moat by walking a
          wooden plank duck board, a reckless trick learnt in early
          childhood. She walks passed the back of the house where,
          through an open window to the library, we see her mother
          and father, Mr and Mrs Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that
          Netherfield Park is let at last?
          We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear
          her parents' conversation.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          Do you not want to know who has taken it?

                         MR BENNET
          As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have
          any choice in the matter...

          3 INT. LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.

          As Elizabeth walks through the hallway, we hear the sound
          of piano scales plodding through the afternoon. She walks
          down the entrance hall past the room where Mary, 18, the
          bluestocking of the family, is practising, and finds
          Kitty, 16, the second youngest, and Lydia, 15, the
          precocious baby of the family, are listening at the door
          to the library.

                         LYDIA

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          Have you heard? A Mr Bingley, a young man
          from the North of England, has come down
          on Monday in a chaise and four.

                         KITTY
          With five thousand a year!
          Jane, (the eldest, most beautiful and most charmingly
          naive of the girls), joins them at the door.

                         JANE
          Goodness!

                         LYDIA
          - and he's single to be sure!

          INT. LIBRARY - LONGBOURN - CONTINUOUS.

          Mr Bennet is trying to ignore Mrs Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          What a fine thing for our girls!

                         MR BENNET
          Bow can it affect them?

                         MRS BENNET
          My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so
          tiresome! You know that he must marry one
          of them.

                         MR BENNET
          Oh, so that is his design in settling
          here?
          Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of
          the library into the corridor where the girls are
          gathered, Mrs Bennet following.

          4 INT. CORRIDOR - LONGBOURN - THE SAME.

          Mr Bennet walks through the girls to the drawing room
          pursued by Mrs Bennet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         MRS BENNET
          - So you must go and visit him at once.

          5 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 5

          Mr Bennet walks to the bookshelf to replace the book he
          is carrying. Mary is there practising the piano. The
          girls come in to listen.

                         LYDIA
          Oh, yes, Papa.

                         KITTY
          Please, Papa!

                         MR BENNET
          There is no need, for I already have.
          The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare.

                         MRS BENNET
          You have?

                         JANE
          when?

                         MRS BENNET
          â¢ How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have
          no compassion for my poor nerves?

                         MR BENNET
          You mistake me, my dear. I have a high
          respect for them; they are my constant
          companions these twenty years.

                         MRS BENNET
          Is he amiable?

                         KITTY
          Is he handsome?

                         LYDIA
          He's sure to be handsome.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (IRONICALLY)
          With five thousand a year, it would not
          matter if he had a big pink face.

                         MR BENNET
          I will give my hearty consent to his
          marrying whichever of the girls he
          chooses.

                         LYDIA
          So will he come to the ball tomorrow?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         MR BENNET
          I believe so.
          Lydia and Kitty shriek with excitement.

                         KITTY

                         (TO JANE)
          I have to have your spotted muslin,
          please!

                         LYDIA
          I need it!

                         KITTY
          - if you do, I'll lend you my green
          slippers.
          Mr Bennet winks at Elizabeth and turns to Mary, a
          serious, somewhat pedantic young woman.

                         MR BENNET
          And what do you say, Mary? Are you not
          excited by the prospect of a ball?

                         MARY
          Society has claims on us all, Papa. As
          long as I have my mornings to myself, I
          consider an interval of recreation and
          â¢ amusement as quite desirable.
          Elizabeth laughs.

          6 INT. ASSEMBLY ROOMS -- MERYTON VILLAGE - NIGHT.

          The local subscription dance is in full swing. It's a
          rough-and-ready, though enthusiastic affair...yeoman
          farmers, small-time squires with their ruddy-cheeked
          daughters.
          Lydia and Kitty, with their mother, are fussing over
          their clothes - straightening their dresses, tidying
          their hair and so on.

                         LYDIA
          (fussing over her dress)
          I literally can't breathe its so tight.

                         KITTY
          My toes hurt.
          Elizabeth and Jane are a little apart from their family.
          Jane looks breathtaking.

          5.

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ Well, if every man in this room does not
          end the evening completely in love with
          you then I am no judge of beauty.

                         JANE
          Or men.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh, they are far too easy to judge.

                         JANE
          They are not all bad.

                         ELIZABETH
          Humourless poppycocks, in my limited
          experience.

                         JANE
          One of these days, Lizzie, someone will
          catch your eye and then you'll have to
          watch your tongue.

                         ELIZABETH
          And eat my hat.
          She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters
           the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but
          â¢ prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get
          the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of
          every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most
          company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam
          Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which
          could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the
          highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches
          Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised
          shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.

                         JANE
          Luckily, you are not wearing a hat.
          A hush falls as the local people turn to stare. The
          newcomers - creatures from another world - make quite a
          stir.

                         CUT TO:
          Caroline Bingley, standing next to Darcy, gazes at the
          somewhat provincial gathering with distaste.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
          are we not, Mr Darcy?
          He does indeed look superior to the assembled company. On
          the dance floor a young couple, staring at the newcomers,
          trip over each other, stumble and burst out laughing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          Mr Bingley spots Jane Bennet. For a moment he forgets
          himself and openly looks at her.

                         MR BINGLEY
          I find it very charming.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY

                         (TO DARCY)
          My brother is so easily pleased, is he
          not?
          Darcy does not answer.

                         CUT TO:
          Elizabeth has found her great friend Charlotte Lucas - an
          intelligent, sensible woman in her late twenties. They
          spy through the crowd.

                         ELIZABETH
          So which of the painted peacocks is our
          Mr Bingley?

                         CHARLOTTE
          He is on the right, and on the left is
          his sister.

                         ELIZABETH
          And the person with the disagreeable
          expression?

                         CHARLOTTE
          That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Poor soul.

                         CHARLOTTE
          On the contrary, he has ten thousand a
          year and owns half of Derbyshire.

                         CUT TO:
          Sir William Lucas, 53 a hale but unsophisticated member
          of the self-made gentry, takes it upon himself to
          introduce Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy to his daughter
          Charlotte and the Bennet family.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          (to Mr Bingley)
          My eldest daughter you know, Mrs
          Bennet ...miss Jane Bennet, Elizabeth and
          Miss Mary Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          It is a pleasure. I have two others but

                         40
          they are already dancing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Delighted to make your acquaintance.

                         Â¢

                         SIR WILLIAM
          And may I introduce Mr Darcy.

                         (SIGNIFICANT LOOK)
          -- of Pemberley, in Derbyshire!
          A stiff bow from Darcy, Elizabeth smiles, Darcy does not.

                         CUT TO:
          Moments later. Elizabeth is standing in a small group
          with Jane, Bingley, Miss Bingley and Darcy. Bingley can't
          keep his eyes off Jane, but is frightfully at a loss in
          disguising his instant ardour.

                         ELIZABETH
          How do you like it here in Hertfordshire,
          Mr Bingley?

                         MR BINGLEY
          (smiling at Jane shyly)
          Very much.

                         ELIZABETH
          The library at Netherfield, I've heard,
          is one of the finest in the country.

                         Â¢

                         MR BINGLEY
          Yes, it fills me with guilt.
          He looks at Jane a little blush starts around his collar.

                         BINGLEY
          Not a good reader, you see. I like being
          out of doors. I mean, I can read, of

                         COURSE -
          His sister steps in. as the blush threatens to engulf his
          ears.

                         MISS BINGLEY

                         (TO DARCY)
          Your library at Pemberly, Mr Darcy, is
          astonishingly good.

                         DARCY
          Thank you. It is the work of many
          generations.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          And then you have added so much to it
          yourself.

                         JANE
          I wish I read more, but there always
          seems so many other things to do.

                         BINGLEY
          That's exactly what I meant.
          He beams at Jane.

                         CUT TO:
          Mr and Mrs Bennet stand a little apart from Elizabeth and
          the other young people. Lydia and Kitty bound up to them
          in a state of high excitement.

                         LYDIA
          Mama! The regiment is arriving next week!

                         KITTY
          And will be here for the whole winter!
          Mrs Forster told us!

                         LYDIA
          They're going to be stationed in the
          village!

                         CUT TO:
          Mr Bingley'turns to Jane.

                         MR BINGLEY
          May I have the honour?
          They leave, to dance.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you dance Mr Darcy?

                         DARCY
          Not if I can help it.
          Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as
          they over hear the following...

                         CUT TO:

                         LYDIA
          officers! Lots of officers!

                         KITTY
          How will we meet them?

                         LYDIA
          It's easy. You just walk up and down in
          front of them and drop something.
          Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         LYDIA
          â¢ They pick it up. You say 'oh thank you
          sir' and blush prettily and then you're
          introduced!

                         MR BENNET
          I have long suspected that we have two of
          the silliest girls in the county.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I
          liked a red coat myself, and if a smart
          young colonel with six thousand a year
          should want one of my girls I shall not
          say nay to him.
          Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie
          moves away.

                         CUT TO:
          The dance floor. Mr Bingley is dancing with Jane. His
          ears blushing with thrilled embarrassment. Mrs Bennet,
          with a group of other mothers, watches the young couple
          with rather too obvious satisfaction.

                         MRS BENNET
          7 That dress becomes her, does it not. 7
          â¢ Though of course my Jane needs little
          help from couturiers.
          Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at
          Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and
          demure, he clearly smitten -

                         CUT TO:
          Darcy is joined by Bingley exhilarated by the dance.

                         BINGLEY
          Come Darcy, I must have you dance. I hate
          to see you standing by yourself in this
          stupid manner.

                         MR DARCY
          (shakes his head)
          You know how I detest it.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Upon my word, I've never seen so many
          pretty girls in my life.

                         DARCY
          You are dancing with the only handsome
          girl in the room.

                         Â¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         BINGLEY
          Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I
          ever beheld, but her sister Elizabeth is
          very agreeable.
          They have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have
          not seen Elizabeth and charlotte who are standing close
          behind them. Elizabeth smirks as she overhears their
          conversation.

                         DARCY
          Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not
          handsome enough to tempt me.
          Elizabeth's smile drops.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          You had better return to your partner and
          enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting
          your time with me.
          Bingley goes off.

                         CUT TO:
          Elizabeth and Charlotte, who have overheard Darcy and
          Bingley's exchange.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Ignore him, Lizzie, he is such a
          disagreeable man it would be a misfortune
          to be liked by him.

                         ELIZABETH
          Don't worry. I would not dance with him
          for half of Derbyshire.

                         CUT TO:
          Later. Bingley politely dancing with Charlotte. As he
          does so, he catches sight of Jane dancing with somebody
          else. A look of pure longing, but he cannot dance every
          dance with her. Lizzie too is dancing and clocks this.
          Lydia and Kitty are exuberantly dancing too, laughing and
          chatting. Darcy stands watching, a look of infinitely
          superior boredom on his fine features.

                         CUT TO:
          Bingley is standing with Jane, Elizabeth, Mrs Bennet and
          Darcy.

                         BINGLEY

                         (TO LIZZIE)
          Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing
          young woman.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ Yes! I adore her.

                         MRS BENNET
          It is a pity she is not more handsome.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mama!

                         MRS BENNET
          But Lizzie will never admit she is plain.

                         (TO BINGLEY)
          Of course it's my Jane who's considered
          the beauty of the county.

                         JANE
          Oh, Mama, please!

                         MRS BENNET
          When she was only fifteen there was a
          gentleman so much in love with her that I
          was sure he would make her an offer.
          However, he did write her some very
          pretty verses.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (IMPATIENTLY)
          And so ended their affection. I wonder
          â¢ who first discovered the power of poetry
          in driving away love?

                         DARCY
          I thought that poetry was the food of
          love.

                         ELIZABETH
          Of a fine, stout love it may. Everything
          nourishes what is strong already. But if
          it is only a thin, slight sort of
          inclination, I'm convinced that one good
          sonnet will starve it away entirely.
          Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of
          interest.

                         DARCY
          So what do you recommend, to encourage
          affection?

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh dancing, of course. Even if ones
          partner is barely tolerable.
          She gives him a dazzling smile. Darcy looks startled. He
          has no idea she heard him. He blushes.

          Elizabeth is dancing happily in a round, Jane and Bingley
          â¢ are also in the same dance. At the edge of the dance
          floor Darcy is watching.

          7 INT. BEDROOM -- LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 7

          Elizabeth and Jane are both tucked up in the same bed,
          but are too excited to sleep.

                         JANE
          Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought
          to be. Sensible, good humoured -

                         ELIZABETH
          (completing the list)
          Handsome, conveniently rich -

                         JANE
          You know perfectly well I do not believe
          marriage should be driven by thoughts of
          money.

                         ELIZABETH
          I agree entirely, only the deepest love
          will persuade me into matrimony, which is
          why I will end up an old maid.

                         JANE
          Do you really believe he liked me,
          Lizzie?

                         ELIZABETH
          Jane, he danced with you most of the
          night.

                         JANE
          I was flattered, I must admit. I did not
          expect such a compliment.

                         ELIZABETH
          That is one great difference between us.
          Compliments always take you by surprise.
          Well, Mr Bingley is certainly very
          amiable, and I give you leave to like
          him. You've liked many a stupider person.

                         JANE
          Lizzie!

                         ELIZABETH
          You're a great deal too apt to like
          people in general, you know. All the
          world is good and agreeable in your eyes.

                         Â¢ JANE
          Not his friend. I still cannot believe
          what he said about you.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive
          his vanity had he not wounded mine. But
          no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak
          again.
          She blows out the candle.

          8 INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 8

          Mrs Bennet presides over breakfast with an endless
          description of the ball. Mary is doing some needle work,
          whilst Lydia, Kitty and Jane blearily eat.

                         MRS BENNET
          And then he danced the third with Miss
          Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is
          not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss
          King of little standing. And the fifth
          again with Jane.

                         MR BENNET
          â¢ If he'd had any compassion for me he
          would have sprained his ankle in the
          first dance.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the
          girls looked forward to a grand
          inheritance.
          Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this
          speech many times before.

                         MR BENNET

                         (NOT LISTENING)
          Kitty, be so kind as to pass the butter.

                         MRS BENNET
          As you well know, Mr Bennet, when you
          die, which may in fact be very soon, our
          girls will be left without a roof over
          their head nor a penny to their name.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the
          morning.
          Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's
          â¢ babbling.

          â¢ A letter addressed to Miss Bennet, Ma'arn.
          From Netherfield Hall.

                         MRS BENNET
          Praise the Lord! We are saved.
          Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          Make haste, Jane, make haste. 0 happy
          day!

                         JANE
          It is from Miss Bingley.
          Mrs Bennet is stopped in her tracks.

                         JANE (CONT'D)
          She has invited me to dine with her.

                         (PAUSE)
          Her brother will be dining out.

                         MRS BENNET
          This is most unfortunate.

                         LYDIA
          I didn't think he was so good looking
          anyway.

                         JANE
          Can I take the carriage?

                         MRS BENNET
          Certainly not my dear, you will go to
          Netherfield on horse back.

                         JANE
          Horseback?!
          Mrs Bennet leaves with a secret smile on her lips.

          hand, to check.

          (smiles, satisfied)

          Excellent. Now she will have to stay the
          night. Exactly as I predicted.

                         MR BENNET
          Good grief, woman. Your skills in the art
          of match-making are without question.

                         ELIZABETH
          Though I don't think, mama, you can
          reasonably take credit for making it
          rain. Let's hope she hasn't caught her
          death before she gets there.

          Well, my dear, if your daughter does die
          it will be a comfort to know it was all
          in pursuit of Mr Bingley.

          girls took the carriage to town.

          Walk! You will not be fit to be seen by
          the time you get there.

                         MR BENNET
          Why the devil not. We could have them all
          laid up at Netherfield Hall.

          Elizabeth strides across vast muddy fields, slipping as

          In the large grand dining room Caroline Bingley and Darcy
          are eating breakfast.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          Its very formal, in fact frigid, compared to the
          volatile Bennet household. Darcy is reading the
          â¢ newspaper; Caroline Bingley is reading a letter.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          (puts down the letter)
          Apparently, Lady Bathurst is redecorating
          her ballroom in the French style. A
          little unpatriotic, don't you think?
          Mr Darcy is about to answer when the door opens. A
          footman appears, his face rigid with disapproval.

                         FOOTMAN
          Miss Elizabeth Bennet.
          Lizzie comes in, her face flushed, her skirt covered in
          mud. She looks ravishing. Darcy stares at her, then
          quickly rises to his feet. Caroline Bingley, astonished,
          looks her up and down.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Good Lord, Miss Bennet. Have you walked
          here?

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm so sorry. How is my sister?

                         DARCY

                         (MORE KINDLY)
          She's upstairs.

                         (TO FOOTMAN)
          Show Miss Bennet the way, Alfred.
          Lizzie leaves. A beat.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Goodness, did you see her petticoat? Six
          inches deep in mud!
          No response.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          And her hair, so blowsy and untidy!

                         DARCY
          I think her concern for her sister does
          her credit.
          A little pause, Caroline recovers.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Oh yes, its shocking to have a bad cold.
          I dislike excessively being ill myself.

          Elizabeth is taken upstairs. Bingley, looking tense,
          waits outside her sister's room. His face lights up when
          he sees her.

                         BINGLEY
          Miss Elizabeth! Oh I'm so glad to see you
          A doctor comes out of Jane's room.

          ELIZABETH AND BINGLEY

                         (TOGETHER)
          How is she?

                         DOCTOR
          A violent cold, but we shall get the
          better of it.

          Elizabeth goes into the bedroom where Jane lies in bed,
          feverish and ill.

                         ELIZABETH
          Jane!
          Jane's face lights up. Elizabeth kisses her.

                         JANE
          Lizzie! Oh, your face is so cold. They're
          being so kind to me, I feel such a
          terrible imposition.

                         ELIZABETH
          Don't worry. I don't know who is more
          pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr
          Bingley.
          Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Thank you for tending to my sister so
          diligently, it seems she is in better
          comfort here than she would be at home.

                         BINGLEY
          It is a pleasure, I mean not to see her
          so sick, of course, that's terrible. I
          will have a room made up for you. You

          21 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD -- DAY. 21

          Darcy is quietly reading as Bingley paces about
          anxiously. Caroline berates him from the sofa.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Stay!? She is a perfectly sweet girl but
          save being an excellent walker, there is
          very little to recommend her.

                         BINGLEY
          I thought she showed remarkable spirit
          coming all this way.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          The eldest Miss Bennet, as you know, I
          hold in excessive regard and I wish her
          well settled. Though I do fear with her
          families low connections there is little
          chance of it. Their uncle is in trade,
          you know, in Cheapside.

                         BINGLEY
          If they had uncles enough to fill all
          Cheapside it would not make them one jot
          less agreeable.

          22 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN - DAY. 22

          Mr Bennet is overseeing the gardener who is pruning the
          hedge. Mrs Bennet bustles up. She looks very pleased with
          herself.

                         MRS BENNET
          Well, my dear, its all going according
          to plan. He's half in love with her
          already!

                         MR BENNET
          (a touch disingenuously)
          Who, my sweetest?

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Bingley! And he doesn't mind that she
          hasn't a penny, for he has enough for the
          two of them.
          Suddenly a distant trumpet sounds, dogs bark. The militia
          are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed
          up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face
          lights up.

          â¢ MRS BENNET
          Wait for me!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          And she's gone. Mr Bennet gazes at their departing
          â¢ figures.

          23 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 23

          Mrs Bennet and her two daughters rush down the street
          into the village. Dogs bark, children run alongside as a
          regiment of soldiers march through the street. Geese
          scatter; shopkeepers stand in their doorways. The two
          Bennet girls simper at the handsome young soldiers. Mrs
          Bennet, flushed and excited, runs panting behind them.
          Lydia deliberately drops her hankerchief. One of the
          soldiers stands on it. She is appalled.

          24 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD - EVENING. 24

          Elizabeth is reading a book. Darcy is writing a letter.
          Bingley is sat nervously. Caroline, obviously bored,
          wanders the room looking for distraction. She looks over
          Darcy's shoulder.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          You write uncommonly fast, Mr Darcy.

                         MR DARCY
          (without looking up)
          â¢ You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.
          Caroline Bingley lingers, annoyingly.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          How many letters you must have occasion
          to write, Mr Darcy. Letters of business
          too. How odious I should think them!

                         DARCY
          It is fortunate, then, that they fall to
          my lot instead of yours.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Please tell your sister that I long to
          see her.

                         DARCY
          I have already told her once, by your
          desire.
          Lizzie looks across from her book.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          I do dote on her, I was quite in raptures
          at her beautiful little design for a
          table.

                         DARCY

                         Â¢
          Perhaps you will give me leave to defer
          your raptures till I write again. At
          present I have not enough room to do them
          justice.
          Mr Bingley now pacing anxiously around the room.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Its amazing, how young ladies have the
          patience to be so accomplished.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          What do you mean, Charles?

                         MR BINGLEY
          They all paint tables, and embroider
          cushions and play the piano. I never
          heard of a young lady, but people say she
          is accomplished.

                         DARCY
          The word is indeed applied too liberally.
          I cannot boast of knowing more than half
          a dozen women, in all my acquaintance,
          that are truely accomplished.

          â¢ CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Nor I, to be sure!

                         ELIZABETH
          Goodness! You must comprehend a great
          deal in the idea.

                         DARCY
          I do.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Absolutely. She must have a thorough
          knowledge of music, singing, drawing,
          dancing and the modern languages, to
          deserve the word. And something in her
          air and manner of walking.

                         DARCY
          And of course she must improve her mind
          by extensive reading.
          Elizabeth closes her book.

                         ELIZABETH
          i am no longer surprised at your knowing
          only six accomplished women. I rather
          wonder now at your knowing any.

                         Â¢

                         DARCY
          Are you so severe on your own sex?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ I never saw such a woman. She would
          certainly be a fearsome thing to behold.
          Pause. Darcy goes back to his letter. Caroline Bingley
          picks up a book. Pauses. Puts it down. she walks over to

                         LIZZIE_

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Miss Bennet, let us take a turn about the
          room.
          Lizzie, surprised, gets up. Caroline Bingley links her
          arm and they start walking up and down.

          CAROLINE BINGLEY (CONT'D)
          It's refreshing, is it not, after sitting
          so long in one attitude?

                         ELIZABETH
          And it's a small kind of accomplishment,
          I suppose.
          Darcy meets Lizzie's eye, briefly. He goes back to his
          letter-writing. More walking up and down. Caroline
          Bingley turns to Darcy.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Mr Darcy, will you join us?

                         DARCY
          (shakes his head)
          You can only have two motives, Miss
          Bingley, and I would interfere with
          either.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          (to Lizzie, archly)
          What can he mean?

                         ELIZABETH
          Our surest way of disappointing him will
          be to ask nothing about it.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY

                         (TO DARCY)
          Please tell us!

                         DARCY
          Either you are in each other's confidence
          and have secret affairs to discuss, or
          you are conscious that your figures
          appear to the greatest advantage by
          walking. If the first, I should get in
          your way. If the second, I can admire you
          â¢ much better from here.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

          â¢ CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Oh, shocking! How shall we punish him for
          such a speech?

                         ELIZABETH
          We could always tease him.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Oh no, Mr Darcy is not to be laughed at!

                         ELIZABETH
          Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would
          you consider that a fault?

                         DARCY
          That I couldn't say.

                         ELIZABETH
          For we're trying to find a fault in you.

                         DARCY
          Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive
          the follies and vices of others, or their
          offences against myself. My good opinion,
          once lost, is lost forever.

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ Oh dear, I cannot tease you about that.
          What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY

                         (SMALL SMILE)
          A family trait I think.
          Elizabeth smiles, sweetly. Miss Bingley glances at Darcy.

          Darcy gallops through the countryside.

          27 EXT. STABLE YARD - NETHERFIELD - DAY. 27

          Darcy, exhausted, rides into the stable yard. In the
          corner is a trough and pump. He strides up to the pump,
          puts his head under it and douses himself with cold
          water.

          From a window Elizabeth looks out at Darcy.
          Darcy looks up and for a second catches Elizabeth looking
          down at him. She turns from the window. Jane is waking
          up.

                         ELIZABETH
          Jane, do you think you might feel well
          enough to leave today?

          29 INT. DRAWING ROOM - NETHERFIELD - DAY. 29

          The doors open. The Butler as before:

                         BUTLER
          A Mrs Bennet, a Miss Bennet, a Miss
          Bennet and a Miss Bennet, sir.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Are we to receive every Bennet in the
          country?
          Mrs Bennet, Lydia, Mary and Kitty are introduced to
          Caroline, Bingley and Darcy. Elizabeth holds her breath
          as her mother launches into untold gaucheries.

                         MRS BENNET
          What an excellent room you have sir. Such
          expensive furnishings. I hope you intend
          to stay here, Mr Bingley.

                         BINGLEY
          Absolutely I find the country very
          diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?

                         DARCY
          I find it perfectly adequate even if
          society is a little less varied than in
          town.

                         MRS BENNET
          But I assure you there is quite as much
          going on in the country as there is in
          the town.

                         ELIZABETH
          Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely
          meant there were not such a variety of
          people to be met in the country as there
          are in town, which you must acknowledge
          to be true.

          â¢ MRS BENNET
          Nonsense, we dine with four and twenty
          families. Sir William Lucas for instance
          is a very agreeable man. So very genteel
          and easy.
          Elizabeth cringes.

                         LYDIA
          Mr Bingley, is it true that you have
          promised to hold a ball here at
          Netherfield?

                         BINGLEY
          Well...

                         LYDIA
          It would be an excellent way to meet new
          friends. You could invite the militia.

                         KITTY
          Oh do hold a ball.

                         ELIZABETH
          (trying to stop Bingley being

                         BAMBOOZLED)
          Kitty...

                         BINGLEY
          When your sister has recovered you shall
          name the day.

                         MARY
          I think a Ball is a perfectly irrational
          way to gain new acquaintance. It would be
          better if conversation instead of dancing
          were the order of the day.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Indeed much more rational but rather less
          like a ball.

                         ELIZABETH
          Thank you, Mary.

                         BINGLEY
          (to Mrs Bennet)
          Please let me show you to Jane, you will
          find her quite recovered.

          The Bennet's carriage awaits. The Bingley's are gathered
          to see the Bennet's off. Jane is radiant - in the peak of
          health.

                         JANE
          (to the Bingley's)
          Really, I don't know how to thank you.
          Bingley beams bashfully. He can't take his eyes off her.

                         BINGLEY
          Really, you're welcome anytime you feel
          the least bit poorly.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (TO CAROLINE)
          Thank you for such stimulating company.
          It has been most instructive.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Not at all. The pleasure is all mine.
          Elizabeth looks at Darcy, who does not say anything. She
          gets in the carriage.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy.

                         DARCY
          Miss Bennet.
          They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the
          Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley
          waves enthusiastically to Jane.

                         BINGLEY
          Goodbye. Goodbye.

          31 INT. CARRIAGE - LEAVING NETHERFIELD - THE SAME. 31

          The family are all squeezed in rather too tightly.

                         MRS BENNET
          What a high and mighty man that Mr Darcy
          is, quite eaten up with pride.

          32 EXT. MERYTON - DAY. 3

          The Bennet's carriage is stopped in its tracks by the
          Militia who are marching en masse through town.

          â¢ 33 INT. CARRIAGE - MERYTON - DAY. 33

          Lydia cannot believe her eyes as row after row of
          soldiers pass by the carriage with not a few of the men
          looking in at the Bennet girls with some interest.

                         LYDIA
          I can't believe it, there must be a
          thousand of them.
          Leading the one troupe of Militia is Wickham a very
          handsome blonde officer, Lydia spots him and swoons.

                         ELIZABETH
          (to the coachman)
          Please, drive on.

          34 INT. LONGBOURN - HERTFORDSHIRE - DAY. 34

          As the Bennet girls come into the house, Lydia eulogizing
          the Militia, they meet Mr Bennet.

                         MR BENNET
          I hope, my dear, that you have ordered a
          good dinner today, because I have reason
          to expect an addition to our family

                         Â¢
          party.
          Mr Bennet holds up the letter.

          35 INT. CARRIAGE - COMING THROUGH MERYTON - DAY. 35

          Collins, late twenties, an overweening sychophant,
          nervous and unctuous in equal measure. He sits in his
          black garb, hunched uncomfortably as he comes through
          town.

          COLLINS (V.O.)
          "Dear sir, the disagreement subsisting
          between yourself and my late father over
          the entail to me of the Longbourn estate,
          has long been a subject of much torment
          which I have frequently wished to heal.
          Having received ordination this Easter
          and being so fortunately distinguished by
          the patronage of the Right Honorable Lady
          Catherine de Bourgh..."
          Collins' voice fades out as his carriage wipes through
          frame revealing Elizabeth and Charlotte on their way to
          the butchers.

                         LIZZIE
          â¢ His name is Mr Collins. He's the dreaded
          cousin.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Who's to inherit?

                         LIZZIE
          Indeed. Everything, apparently. He may
          leave us our stays, but even my piano
          stool belongs to Mr Collins.

                         CHARLOTTE
          When?

                         LIZZIE
          He can turn us out of the house as soon
          as he pleases.

                         CHARLOTTE
          But why?

                         LIZZIE
          Because the estate is entailed to him and
          not to us poor females.
          A cart passes, crammed with sheep going to slaughter.

          36 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN -- DAY. 36

          Mr Collins is ushered in by the manservant, Perkins. He
          looks around his future home with interest.
          Mr and Mrs Bennet greet him.

                         MR COLLINS

                         (DEEP BOW )
          Mr Collins, at your service.

                         (LOOKS AROUND)
          What a charming house! So convenient for
          the local village.
          (looks at the furniture)
          And some very fine pieces, if I'm not
          mistaken.
          A beat. This is hardly tactful.

                         MRS BENNET

                         (COLDLY)
          They are.
          Jane, Lizzie and Mary enter.

                         MR COLLINS
          Ah, these are your daughters, are they
          not?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         MR BENNET
          We have some more somewhere.

                         MR COLLINS
          I must congratulate you. I have heard
          much of their beauty, but in this
          instance fame has fallen short of the
          truth.
          A very low bow. The girls are somewhat taken aback.

          37 INT. DINING ROOM -- NETHERFIELD - EVENING. 37

          The Bennets and Collins are seated formally for supper.
          Mr Collins is served some food.

                         COLLINS
          What a superbly featured room and what
          excellent boiled potatoes. It is many
          years since I had such an exemplary
          vegetable. To which of my fair cousins
          should I compliment the excellence of the
          cooking?

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Collins, we are perfectly able to keep
          a cook.

                         Â¢

                         COLLINS
          Excellent. I am very pleased the estate
          affords such a living. I am honoured to
          have, as my patroness, Lady Catherine de
          Bourg, you have heard of her, I presume?
          Mrs Bennet shakes her head.

                         MR COLLINS
          My small rectory abuts her estate,
          Rosings Park, and she often condescends
          to drive by my humble abode in her little
          phaeton and ponies.
          A pause. Lizzie catches her father's eye.

                         MRS BENNET
          Does she have any family?

                         MR COLLINS
          One daughter, the heiress of Rosings and
          very extensive property. I have often
          observed to Lady Catherine, that her
          daughter seemed born to be a duchess for
          she has all the superior graces of
          â¢ elevated rank.

                         (LITTLE COUGH)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.
          MR COLLINS (cont'd)
          .These are the kind of little delicate
          compliments that are always acceptable to
          1ï¿½1 ladies, and which I conceive myself
          particularly bound to pay.

                         MR BENNET

                         (GRAVELY)
          How happy for you, Mr Collins, to possess
          the talent for flattering with delicacy.
          Mr Collins nods with satisfaction.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do these pleasing attentions proceed from
          the impulse of the moment or are they the
          result of previous study?
          Jane kicks Elizabeth under the table. Elizabeth tries not
          to laugh at Mr Collins' answer.

                         MR COLLINS
          They arise chiefly from what is passing
          at the time, and though I sometimes amuse
          myself with arranging such little elegant
          compliments, I always wish to give them
          as unstudied an air as possible.

                         ELIZABETH
          Believe me, no one would suspect your
          manners to be practised.
          The girls look at one another.

                         COLLINS
          After dinner I thought I might read to
          you all an hour or two. I have with me
          Fordyce's sermons which speak eloquently
          on this point.

                         (TO JANE)
          Do you know Fordyce's sermons Miss
          Bennet?

          38 INT. CORRIDOR -- LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 38

          Later; we can see the girls and Mr Bennet gathered by the
          fire through the doorway. Mr Collins leaves the room and
          takes Mrs Bennet aside to a very discrete conference, out
          of hearing of anyone else.

                         COLLINS
          Mrs Bennet. You do know I have been
          bestowed by the good grace of Lady
          Catherine de Bough a parsonage of no mean
          size.

          â¢ MRS BENNET
          I have become aware of the fact.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         COLLINS
          â¢ Well, it.is my avowed hope that soon I
          may find a mistress for it, and I have to
          inform you that the eldest Miss Bennet
          has captured my special attention.
          Collins looks lasciviously into the room.

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Collins, unfortunately it is incumbent
          on me to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet
          is - very soon to be engaged.

                         COLLINS
          Engaged!

                         MRS BENNET
          But Miss Elizabeth next to her in both
          age and beauty would make anyone an
          excellent partner. Do not you agree, Mr
          Collins?
          Mr Collins looks through the doorway at Elizabeth

                         COLLINS
          Indeed. Indeed. A very agreeable
          alternative.

                         Â¢

          39 EXT. BACK MEADOW - LONGBOURN - DAY. 39

          Elizabeth and Jane are walking towards the house when,
          across the moat, they see Mr Collins come out of the
          house and advance towards them.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh no!
          Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the
          garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them.

                         ELIZABETH
          Quick! This way!
          She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat,
          through the house and out the front.
          Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house.
          The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around,
          puzzled.

          40 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 40

          â¢ Elizabeth and Jane arrive in the village. Jane, forever
          the dutiful daughter, looks uneasy- Elizabeth is flushed
          and reckless. She looks behind them-

                         ELIZABETH

                         (LAUGHS)

                         Â¢
          We've lost him.
          They slow down to a walk. And then stop. outside the
          milliner's shop the incorrigible Lydia and Kitty are
          chatting to Wickham, the dashing young officer we spotted
          earlier. He is utterly gorgeous - slim, handsome, tousled
          hair. The perfect romantic hero.

                         ELIZABETH
          Kitty? Lydia!
          She and Jane join them.

                         LYDIA
          We just happened to be looking for some
          ribbon, didn't we, Kitty?

                         (KITTY NODS)
          And we met Mr Wickham.

                         KITTY
          He picked up Lydia's gloves!

                         LYDIA
          He's a lieutenant!
          Wickham bows.

                         WICKHAM
          I'm enchanted. Shall we all look at some
          ribbons together?

                         LYDIA
          Oh yes!

          41 INT. MILLINER'S SHOP - DAY. 41

          They come into the shop. The others go towards the
          counter. Wickham hangs back, and smiles a complicit,
          witty smile at Elizabeth. She colours.

                         WICKHAM
          Though I must warn you, I have very poor
          taste.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SMILES)
          Only a man truly confident of himself
          would admit that.

                         WICKHAM
          No, it's true. My rooms in town,
          decorated, I thought, in the height of
          â¢ fashion, have reduced grown men to tears
          of mirth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         ELIZABETH'

                         Â¢ (LAUGHS)
          Then why don't you change them?

                         MR WICKHAM
          And deny people such pleasure?

                         ELIZABETH
          So you don't mind being laughed at?

                         MR WICKHAM
          Not particularly.

                         ELIZABETH
          It is a somewhat sterile quality, is it
          not, to be aware of ones importance in
          the world.

                         WICKHAM
          Especially if, like me, one has none.
          Elizabeth looks at him with interest. A beat. The moment
          is broken by Lydia coming up.

                         LYDIA
          Lizzie, please lend me some money!

                         ELIZABETH

                         Â¢
          You already owe me a considerable sum,
          Liddy.

                         MR WICKHAM
          Allow me to oblige.

                         ELIZABETH
          No! Please - Mr Wickham! -
          Wickham gives Elizabeth a smile and moves away to the
          counter.

          42 EXT. MILLINER'S SHOP - DAY. 42

          The girls emerge from the shop with Wickham.

                         ELIZABETH
          You're too generous.

                         WICKHAM
          I know. Fivepence halfpenny!

                         ELIZABETH
          It all adds up.

                         Â¢ LYDIA
          I'll pay him back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         WICKHAM
          Oh yes. I'll make sure of that.

                         Â¢
          They laugh. Elizabeth is really rather taken with him.
          They walk down the street.

                         ELIZABETH
          Will you be stationed here all winter, Mr
          Wickham?

                         WICKHAM
          That depends on what the French have in
          mind. Of course I look forward to
          action...
          (smiles at her)
          But on the other hand

                         JANE
          Lizzie - look!
          They stop. Jane's face lights up.

                         JANE
          Mr Bingley !
          It is indeed Bingley, riding towards them. He is
          accompanied by Darcy.
          â¢ Bingley jumps off his horse and hurries over to Jane. His
          open, friendly face is filled with delight.

                         BINGLEY
          I was on my way to your house.

                         LYDIA -
          Please Mr Bingley, when are you going to
          give a ball?

                         JANE
          Lydia!

                         BINGLEY
          I was just waiting until your sister was
          quite well.-

                         LYDIA
          She is!
          Elizabeth pays no attention to the following
          conversation, instead she is looking at Darcy who, in
          turn, is staring at Wickham. They both obviously
          recognize each other and look very uncomfortable.

                         KITTY
          - when, then?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         MR BINGLEY

                         Â¢
          As soon as they have made the white soup.

                         LYDIA
          Be sure to invite Mr Wickham.
          Darcy turns and rides off without a word.

                         JANE
          Lydia, you can't just say that -

                         MR BINGLEY
          Will you excuse me ladies? Mr Wickham.
          Enjoy the day.
          Elizabeth looks at Wickham, puzzled.

          43 INT. DRAWING ROOM - THE LUCAS' HOUSE - DAY. 43

          A small cards party is underway. Three tables have been
          set up. Elizabeth, Wickham, Jane, Lydia, Kitty, Charlotte
          and Sir William and Lady Lucas are present. A small
          number of officers and other ladies are also present. We
          move around the tables. Kitty is sat with Sir William and
          Charlotte and Mary. Jane sits at a table with Mr Collins
          and Lady Lucas. Lizzie sits with Lydia and two other
          officers. Lydia flirts outrageously.

                         Â¢

          LYDIA.
          We have asked mama if we might have new
          dresses for the Netherfield ball.

                         KITTY
          Yes, white, they must be white.

                         LYDIA
          White is the only colour to be worn this
          season.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          So I believe.
          Mr Collins is at a table with Lady Lucas, he glances over
          at Elizabeth, as he talks.

                         COLLINS
          - of course, when you understand that
          Lady Catherine de Bourgh is its
          proprietor you will realise what an
          immense compliment that is. Lady
          Catherine spent eight hundred pounds on a
          chimney-piece alone.
          â¢ Wickham who has been talking to some of the other
          officers comes and sits beside Elizabeth, passing by Mr
          collins on the way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         WICKHAM
          (aside to Elizabeth)
          Your cousin is blessed with an uncommon
          capacity for charm.
          Elizabeth laughs and plays a hand.

                         LYDIA
          Will you be attending the Netherfield
          ball, Mr Wickham?

                         WICKHAM
          I hope to.

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          How long has Mr Darcy been a guest a
          Netherfield?
          Elizabeth pounces on this reference to Mr Darcy and takes
          her chance.

                         ELIZABETH
          About a month. Are you acquainted with,
          Mr Darcy?

                         WICKHAM
          Indeed, my fate has been very intimate
          with that gentleman. I have been
          connected with his family since infancy.
          Elizabeth is genuinely surprised, there is a pause while
          she is forced to play her hand.

                         WICKHAM (CONT'D)
          You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet,
          especially given the cold manner of our
          intimacy this afternoon. Are you well
          acquainted with that gentleman?

                         ELIZABETH
          As much as I could ever wish to be. I
          have spent four days in the same house as
          him, and I think him very disagreeable.

                         WICKHAM
          I cannot pretend to be sorry.
          Elizabeth blushes.

                         WICKHAM
          But really I speak out of turn.
          Collins voice breaks the moment.

                         COLLINS
          Miss Elizabeth, I was just saying to Sir
          William what appalling weather we've been
          having.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          Elizabeth cannot believe her misfortune in Mr Collins,
          â¢ but she smiles politely.

                         ELIZABETH
          I think I shall take a little air.
          She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony.
          As she passes the other tables we follow and witness
          snippets of their conversations.

                         CHARLOTTE

                         (TO MARY)
          It seems Mr Wickham has met with
          universal approval. Though Lizzie looks
          singularly pleased with him.

                         MARY
          At the moment she has more suitors than
          sense.
          Charlotte looks over at Mr Collins. Elizabeth passes Sir
          William's side of the table.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          Now any one for a round of bridge?
          Elizabeth?

                         ELIZABETH

                         Â¢
          Really I need to take some air.
          Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          Mr Collins?

                         COLLINS
          Oh, I am not so familiar with the game,
          Sir William.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          Absolute nonsense. I insist that you join
          us.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Please, Mr Collins, I'd be happy if you'd

                         PARTNER ME_
          Collins resigns himself to his fate. Elizabeth smiles and
          slips out into the night air.

          44 EXT. BALCONY - THE LUCASES HOUSE - MERYTON - NIGHT. 44

          Elizabeth breathes in the cold night air. She senses
          someone join her. She looks round to see Wickham has
          followed her as she had hoped.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ I hope your plans in favor of Meryton
          will not be affected by your difficult
          relations with the gentleman we were just
          speaking of.

                         WICKHAM
          Oh no - it is not for me to be driven
          away. If he wishes to avoid seeing me, he
          must go not I.
          Pause.

                         ELIZABETH
          I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the
          manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?

                         WICKHAM
          Do you really want to hear?
          Lizzie nods.

                         WICKHAM
          He ruined me.
          She stares at him.

                         ELIZABETH
          How so?

                         WICKHAM
          My father managed his estate. We grew up
          together, Darcy and I. His father treated
          me like a second son. Oh he was the
          kindest of men and bequeathed me the best
          living in his gift, for I had my heart
          set on joining the church. But when he
          died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave
          the living to another man.

                         LIZZIE
          Why did he do that?

                         WICKHAM
          Out of jealousy, for his father loved me
          more than he loved him.

                         LIZZIE
          How cruel! Are you sure?

                         WICKHAM

                         (NODS)
          And out of pride, for he considered me
          too lowly to be worth his consideration.

                         Â¢
          Pause. Lizzie gazes at him with horror and sympathy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

          â¢ 45 INT. BEDROOMS - LONGBOURNE - THE SAME. 45

          We pan through the bedrooms as the Bennet girls prepare
          for the Netherfield ball. Kitty is helping Lydia into her
          dress, they are both wearing white.

                         LYDIA
          Aggghh!

                         KITTY
          Breathe in!
          We move to the quieter preparations of Jane and
          Elizabeth. This conversation has been going on for some
          time.

                         JANE

                         (HORRIFIED)
          - I still think there must have been a
          misunderstanding.

                         LIZZIE

                         (EXASPERATED LAUGH)
          Oh Jane, do you never think ill of
          anybody?

                         JANE
          0 How could Mr Darcy do such a thing? I
          will discover the truth from Mr Bingley
          at the ball this evening.

                         ELIZABETH
          If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict
          it himself. But until he does, I hope
          never to encounter him.

                         JANE
          Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.

                         ELIZABETH
          On the contrary, he is twice the man
          Darcy is.

                         JANE
          And lets hope for you a rather more
          willing dancer.
          Jane leaves Elizabeth, at the mirror, taking very
          particular care of her makeup. she smil6s to herself.

          46 INT. NETHERFIELD - HERTFORDSHIRE - NIGHT. 46

          â¢ The great doors of Netherfield open to reveal the ball in
          full swing. Compared to the somewhat clod-hopping
          Assembly, its a dazzling affair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.
          There are hundreds of guests. All the women, roughly two
          hundred, are dressed in white. The men are either in red
          â¢ officer uniform or dressed in black and white. There are
          a number of rooms each occupied by a different activity,
          cards, buffet, women's closet. The final and grandest
          room is the ball room, a swirl of elegant dance.
          The Bennet's enter the first reception room, the girls,
          including Mrs Bennet, are all dressed in white. Mr
          Collins is slightly detained as people pass. Mr Bingley
          bounds up to Jane.

                         BINGLEY
          You're here! I'm so pleased.

                         JANE
          And so am I.

                         BINGLEY
          How are you, Miss Elizabeth?
          Elizabeth is not paying attention, instead she is
          searching over Mr Bingleys' shoulder for a sight of
          Wickham.

                         BINGLEY
          Are you, looking for someone?

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor
          of the ball.

                         JANE
          It is lovely, Mr Bingley.
          Bingley and Jane move off leaving Elizabeth with Mrs
          Bennet and others. While Mrs Bennet talks we focus on
          Elizabeth searching the sea of red coats.

                         MRS BENNET
          (refering to Jane and

                         BINGLEY)
          I dare say I have never met a more
          pleasant gentleman in all my years. Look
          how he dotes on her! Still Jane has
          always done what is best for her family.
          Elizabeth takes this opportunity to slip away into the
          next room. Elizabeth looks around but cannot see Mr
          Wickham. Suddenly she thinks she sees him, so starts to
           a r, move over. The man turns round, it is not Wickham but
           someone else.
           Elizabeth walks nonchanantly into the next room, again
           looking for Mr Wickham. She cranes around trying to see
          â¢ him then she is suddenly surprised by Charlotte Lucas.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         ELIZABETH

                         Â¢
          Have you seen Mr Wickham.
          She shakes her head.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Perhaps he is in the ballroom.
          They both walk into the ball room. We pull back to reveal
          a sea of dancers. Wickham is nowhere to be seen. Jane
          appears and catches Elizabeths arm.

                         JANE
          He's not here. Apparently otherwise
          detained.
          The disappointment is palpable on Elizabeth's face.

                         ELIZABETH
          Detained?
          Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at
          Elizabeth.

                         COLLINS
          There you are.

                         Â¢ ELIZABETH
          Mr Collins. What a pleasant surprise.

                         MR COLLINS
          Perhaps you will do me the honour, Miss
          Elizabeth?

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr
          Collins.

                         MR COLLINS
          I do not consider it incompatible with
          the office of a clergyman to indulge in
          such an innocent diversion.
          Elizabeth tries to smile, politely.

           MR COLLINS (CONT'D)
           In fact several people, her ladyship
           included, have complimented me on my
           lightness of foot.
           Elizabeth's face is a matey rictus.

                          CUT TO:
          â¢ They dance, the style of which is not unlike English
          Country dancing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         COLLINS
          â¢ To be sure, dancing is of little
          consequence to me, but it does afford the
          opportunity to lavish'ones partner with
          delicate attentions which is my primary
          object of the evening.
          Elizabeth turns as part of the dance and for a moment she
          dances beside Jane.

                         JANE
          Apparently Your Mr Wickham has been
          called on some business to town, though
          my informer told me he would have been
          less inclined to be engaged had it not
          been for the presence at Netherfield of a
          certain gentleman.
          Jane indicates towards where Darcy stands watching them.

                         ELIZABETH
          That gentleman barely warrants the name.
          The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins.

          COLLINS (CONT`D)
          It is my intention, if I may be so bold
          to remain close to you throughout the
          evening.

                         CUT TO:
          Couples are preparing for the next dance. Elizabeth and
          Charlotte are standing to one side when Mr Darcy
          approaches.

                         DARCY
          May I have the next dance, Miss
          Elizabeth.
          Elizabeth is stunned.

                         ELIZABETH
          You may.
          Darcy walks away.

                         ELIZABETH
          What was I thinking? Have I no presence

          I dare say you will find him very
          agreeable, Lizzie.

                         Â¢ ELIZABETH
          Heaven forbid! That would be the greatest
          misfortune of all - to find a man
          agreeable whom one is determined to hate!

                         CUT TO:
          Elizabeth dances face to face with Darcy. Neither can
          speak. They dance for a moment in silence.

                         ELIZABETH
          I do love a Sarabande.

                         DARCY
          Indeed. Most invigorating.
          They continue, for a moment, in silence.

                         ELIZABETH
          It is your turn to say something, Mr
          Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you
          ought to remark on the size of the room
          or the number of couples.

                         DARCY
          I am perfectly happy to oblige, please
          advise me of what you would like most to
          â¢ hear.

                         ELIZABETH
          That reply will do for the present.
          Perhaps by and bye I may observe that
          private balls are much pleasanter than
          public ones. But for now we may be
          silent.

                         DARCY
          Do you talk as a rule while dancing?

                         ELIZABETH
          We are each of an unsocial, taciturn
          disposition, unwilling to speak, unless
          we expect to say something that will -
          amaze the whole room, and be handed down
          to posterity with all the eclat of a
          proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid
          embarrassment might be advantageous.

                         DARCY
          I see no striking resemblance of your own
          character in this, how near it is to mine
          I cannot say. (beat) Tell me do you and
          your sisters very often walk to Meryton?

                         Â¢
          They are suddenly parted by the choreography of the
          dance.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          We stay with Elizabeth who is whisked round the floor by
          an elderly man who smiles at her toothlessly, Elizabeth
          â¢ looks back at Darcy who is dancing with Lydia. He stare
          at Elizabeth as he dances. Elizabeth smiles at her
          current partner in embarrassment.

                         ELIZABETH
          Very mild weather we've been having.

                         DANCING PARTNER
          (deaf as a post)
          Sorry.
          The dance spins again and she is back with Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a
          great opportunity to meet new people. In
          fact when you met us we had just had the
          pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.

                         DARCY
          I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed
          with such happy manners as may ensure his
          making friends - whether he is capable of
          retaining them is less certain.

                         ELIZABETH
          He has been so unlucky as to lose your
          friendship. I remember hearing you once
          say that your resentment once created was
          unappeasable. You are very cautious, I
          suppose, as to its being created?

                         DARCY
          I am. May I ask to what these questions
          tend.

                         ELIZABETH
          To make out your character, Mr Darcy.

                         DARCY
          And what have you discovered?

                         ELIZABETH
          very little.
          The dancefinishes.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I hear such different accounts of you as
          puzzle me exceedingly.

                         DARCY
          I hope to afford you more clarity in the
          â¢ future.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          â¢ They bow to each other and Elizabeth moves quickly away
          from Darcy.

                         CUT TO:
          Elizabeth is at the buffet watching Kitty quaff a huge
          glass of wine and having the glass immediately refilled.
          She is joined by Caroline Bingley who also looks at Kitty
          disapprovingly.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Miss Elizabeth. Let me recommend you as a
          friend not to give too much confidence to
          all of the assertions your friend Mr
          Wickham might make. He is indeed a
          charming man, but one should never forget
          from where he is descended.

                         ELIZABETH
          His lack of trustworthiness and descent
          appear by your account to be the same
          thing,

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          Please excuse my interterence, it was
          kindly meant.
          â¢ A breathless Mr Collins appears.

                         COLLINS
          Is that Mr Darcy, of Pemberley in
          Derbyshire?

                         ELIZABETH
          I believe so.

                         COLLINS
          But I must make myself known to him
          immediately!

                         ELIZABETH
          But sir -

                         COLLINS
          He is the nephew of my esteemed
          patroness, Lady Catherine.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SURPRISED)
          He is?
          Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards
          Darcy.

                         Â¢ ELIZABETH
          Please, Mr Collins! He'll consider it an

                         IMPERTINENCE --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          Elizabeth watches from a distance, with acute
          embarrassment, as Collins interrupts Darcy. Darcy does
          not notice him so Collins raises his voice.

                         COLLINS (CONT'D)
          Mr Darcy!
          The room around him stops. Darcy is surprised and turns
          round. In dumbshow we see Darcy is horrified by Collins'
          obsequiousness, during the conversation Collins points
          Elizabeth out to Darcy.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          What interesting relatives you have, Miss
          Bennet.
          Elizabeth walks away into another room.

                         CUT TO:
          The other room, where Mary is singing badly at the piano.
          Elizabeth is horrified. She turns to leave only to see Mr
          Bennet looking on. He winces as Mary misses a high note.
          Mary finishes the song with an off key flourish. Polite
          applause. Mary smiles and prepares for another song.

                         ELIZABETH
          Aren't you going to do something?

                         Â¢
          Mr Bennet walks over to the piano.

                         MR BENNET
          Mary dear, you've delighted us long
          enough.

                         MARY
          But they asked for another song.
          Mr Bennet shuts the lid.

                         MR BENNET
          Let the other young ladies have a turn.

                         CUT TO:
          Later. Charlotte and Lizzie are sat together.

                         ELIZABETH
          Perhaps my family have made a competition
          to see who can expose themselves to the
          most ridicule.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Well, at least Bingley has not noticed.

                         Â¢
          They look over and see Jane and Bingley dancing. Bingley
          clearly besotted by Jane.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ Yes. I think he likes her very much.

                         CHARLOTTE
          But does she like him? There are few of
          us who are secure enough to be really in
          love without proper encouragement.
          Bingley likes her enormously but might
          not do more if she does not help him on.

                         ELIZABETH
          She is just shy and modest. If he does
          not perceive her regard he is a fool.

                         CHARLOTTE
          We are all fools in love. He does not
          know her character as we do. She should
          move fast. Snap him up. There is plenty
          of time for us to get to know them after
          we're married -
          Elizabeth looks over the dancefloor to see Lydia dancing
          with a soldier. she's a little drunk, and very
          flirtatious. He says something; she shrieks with
          laughter.

          47 MONTAGE OF THE BALL 47
          Elizabeth sits at the side of the dance-floor. She looks
          at Mrs Bennet dancing in outrageous fashion. Cut to
          later: Lydia is getting more and more leery with a group
          of soldiers, Elizabeth walks away in embarrasment only to
          see Mr Collins smiling at her from across the room. Cut
          to: Elizabeth dancing joylessly with the excruciating Mr
          Collins, as she turns in the dance she sees Darcy look on
          with obvious disdain. Cut to: much later, the band are
          exhausted, guests are leaving. The staff are asleep on
          their feet. Elizabeth almost alone watching her parents
          dancing almost the only people left on the dance floor,
          Kitty is asleep over Elizabeth's lap. This is a never-
          ending nightmare.

          48 INT. ENTRANCE HALL-- NETHERFIELD - THE WEE HOURS 48

          Day light creeps through the curtains. Mrs Bennet is
          sprawled on a sofa. Lydia completely drunk. Kitty asleep.
          Jane sitting demurely. Collins looking longingly at
          Elizabeth. Mrs Bennet is holding court, whilst the
          footmen behind are literally ready to drop. Bingley is
          standing, the perfect host, but obviously willing the
          â¢ Bennets to leave.

                         MRS BENNET
          I have never had such a good time in my
          life. Mr Bingley you must have such a
          ball once a month at least.
          Caroline who is standing with her brother, yawns
          ostentatiously.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mother. I really think it is time to go.

                         MRS BENNET
          Don't be impertinent. our hosts are
          perfectly happy with our company, are you
          not, Mr Bingley? I hope I can entice you
          to Longbourn to sample our hospitality.
          We would make sure you had 3 or 4 courses
          at least.
          She holds out her glass for a top up and carries on.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          So tell me Mr Bingley. Whom did you like
          least of all your guests this evening?

                         ELIZABETH
          Really. This is enough.
          Darcy looking down at Elizabeth from a staircase. He
          turns and walks away.

          49 INT. CARRIAGE - HERTFORDSHIRE - MORNING. 49

          The Bennet's are squeezed into their carriage. It is
          light outside. Only Mrs Bennet is awake but the lack of
          an audience does not stop her from talking.

                         MRS BENNET
          Allowing for new carriages, dresses
          etcetera, etcetera. We will be having a
          wedding here at Netherfield in less than

          Mrs Bennet I was hoping, if it would
          not trouble you, that I might solicit a
          private audience with Miss Elizabeth in
          the course of the morning.
          Elizabeth is open mouthed.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh! Yes. Certainly - Lizzy would be very
          happy indeed. Please -- go ahead. No time
          like the present. Everyone. Out. Mr
          Collins would like a private audience
          with your sister.
          Everyone looks in amazement.

                         ELIZABETH
          Wait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have
          nothing to say to me.that anybody need
          not hear.

          No. Nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you-will
          stay where you are. Everyone else, to the
          drawing room. Mr Bennet.

          Mrs Bennet makes sure everyone leaves, winks at Mr
          Collins then shuts the door before Elizabeth has time to
          do anything. Elizabeth looks at Mr Collins who looks at
          her in earnest. There is a horrible pause of intense
          embarrassment.

                         MR COLLINS
          Dear Miss Elizabeth, you can hardly doubt
          the purpose of my discourse. My
          attentions have been too marked to be
          mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the
          house I singled you out as the companion
          of my future life.
          Elizabeth stares at him, astonished.

                         MR COLLINS
          But before I am run away with my feelings
          perhaps I may state my reasons for
          marrying. Firstly, that it is the duty of
          a clergyman to set the example of
          matrimony in his parish.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          S0.
          MR COLLINS (cont'd)
          Secondly, that I am convinced it will add
          greatly to my happiness, and, thirdly,
          â¢ that it is at the urging of my esteemed
          patroness Lady Catherine that I select a
          wife.
          We here a kick and Kitty screach from behind the door.

          MRS BENNET (V.0.)
          sshhh.

                         MR COLLINS
          My object in coming to Longbourn was to
          choose such a one from amongst Mr
          Bennet's daughters, for as you know I am
          next in the entail of the estate and such
          an alliance will surely make amends for
          this.
          (drops to his knee)
          And now nothing remains for me but to
          assure you in the most animated language
          of the violence of my affections.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Collins -

                         MR COLLINS
          And that no reproach on the subject of
          fortune will cross my lips once we are
          â¢ married.

                         ELIZABETH
          You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I
          have made no answer.

                         MR COLLINS

                         (UNPERTURBED)
          I must add, that Lady Catherine will
          thoroughly approve, when I speak to her
          of your modesty, economy and other
          amiable qualities.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but
          regret I must decline it.

                         MR COLLINS
          (momentarily taken aback, but

                         RECOVERING)
          I know ladies have their pretty little
          ways, and don't seek to seem too eager -

                         ELIZABETH
          (in some desperation)
          Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You
          could not make me happy and I'm convinced
          I'm the last woman in the world who could
          make you happy.

          â¢ MR COLLINS

                         (PAUSE)
          I 'flatter myself, cousin, that your
          refusal is merely a natural delicacy.
          Besides, you should take into account
          that despite your manifold attractions it
          is by no means certain that another offer
          of marriage may ever be made to you -

                         ELIZABETH
          (rising, deeply affronted)
          Mr Collins -

                         MR COLLINS
          So I must conclude that you simply seek
          to increase my love by suspense,
          according to the usual practice of
          elegant females.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sir! I am not the sort of female to
          torment a respectable man. Please
          understand me - I cannot accept you!
          Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house.
          Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the
          tail of Elizabeth.

                         COLLINS
          Thank you, but... Head strong?

                         MRS BENNET
          - we shall have this little hiccup dealt
          with immediately, Mr Collins.
          Mrs Bennet goes chases after Elizabeth. Mr Collins
          watches through a window as Elizabeth is chased by her
          mother.

          Mrs Bennet marches into the library. Mr Bennet looks up
          in shock.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh Mr Bennet. We are all in a uproar. You
          must come and make Lizzy marry Mr
          Collins, for she vows she will not have
          him.

          Mr Collins, Mr Collins has proposed to
          Lizzie. But Lizzy declares she will not
          have him, and now the danger is Mr
          Collins may not have Lizzy.

                         MR BENNET
          And what am I to do?
          Mrs Bennet drags Mr Bennet to his feet.

                         MRS BENNET
          Speak to Lizzy.
          They march to find Elizabeth.

          Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet confront Elizabeth, who has been
          waiting in the hallway. Perhaps the other girls form an
          audience from the stairs, Mr Collins looks on sheepishly
          from the breakfast room.

                         MRS BENNET
          Tell her that you insist upon them
          marrying.

                         (TO LIZZIE)
          So, your mother insists on you marrying
          Mr Collins.-

                         MRS BENNET
          Yes, or I shall never see her again?

                         MR BENNET
          Well, Lizzie. From this day on you must
          be a stranger to one of your parents -

                         MRS BENNET

                         (TO LIZZIE)
          - who will maintain you when your father
          is dead?

                         MR BENNET
          Your mother will never see you again if
          you do not marry Mr Collins, and I will
          never see you again if you do.

                         ELIZABETH
          Thank you, papa.
          Elizabeth turns around and walks into the drawing room.

          53 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME 53

          Elizabeth enters the drawing room. In the drawing room,
          Mary is trying to read, through the family din. Jane sits
          very still. Her face is white. There's a letter in her
          hand. Mrs Bennet charges in, Lydia and Kitty in tow, and
          speaks to anyone who will listen.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh, ungrateful child! I shall never speak
          to her again! Not that I have much
          pleasure in talking to anybody. People
          who suffer as I do from nervous
          complaints can have no inclination for
          talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer...
          She jabbers on but her voice fades. We're with Jane, re-
          reading the letter.

                         ELIZABETH
          What's wrong, Jane?
          Close on Jane's pale face. She's staring at the letter.

          Elizabeth and Jane in bed.

                         ELIZABETH
          I don't understand. What would take him
          from Netherfield? Why would he not know
          when he was to return?

                         JANE
          â¢ I have no reserves from you.
          Jane passes Elizabeth the letter.

                         ELIZABETH
          "Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister
          and we are scarcely less eager to meet
          her again. I really do not think Georgina
          Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance
          and accomplishments, so much so I must
          hope to hereafter call her my sister. It
          is my duty to indulge you in no hope in
          this respect for your own self."

                         JANE
          Is that not clear enough?

                         ELIZABETH
          Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in
          love with you and is gone with him to
          persuade him otherwise.

                         JANE
          But I know her to be incapable of
          wilfully deceiving anyone.

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ He loves you, Jane. Do not give up. Go to
          our aunt and uncle's in London.

          57 EXT. LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 57

          Jane is in a carriage. Mrs Bennet kisses her goodbye
          through the window as all the Bennets look on.

                         MRS BENNET
          Give my love to my sister. And try not to
          be so much of a burden, dear.
          Jane's carriage moves away and the family wave. Mr Bennet
          talks to Elizabeth.

                         MR BENNET
          Poor Jane. However, a girl likes to be
          crossed in love now and then. It gives
          her something to think of, and a sort of
          distinction among her companions.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (DRYLY)
          I'm sure that will cheer her up,Papa.

                         MR BENNET
          It's your turn now, Lizzie. Since you've
          turned down Mr Collins you're free to go
          off and be jilted yourself. What about Mr
          Wickham? He is a pleasant fellow and
          would do the job credibly.

                         ELIZABETH
          Thank you, but a less agreeable man would
          satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's
          good fortune.

                         MR KENNET
          Still, it's a comfort to know that
          whatever might befall you, you have an
          affectionate mother who will be sure to
          make the most of it.
          A small smile from Elizabeth.

          58 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY 58

          Elizabeth is making the bed and tidying Jane's
          belongings. There is a knock at the door and Charlotte
          enters.

                         CHARLOTTE
          My dear Elizabeth, I've come here to tell
          you the news.

                         (DEFIANTLY)
          Mr Collins and I are engaged to be
          married.
          A stunned pause.

                         ELIZABETH
          Engaged?

                         CHARLOTTE

                         (TIMIDLY)
          You don't mind, do you?

                         ELIZABETH
          No, no...
          (tries to recover)
          Of course not.

                         CHARLOTTE
          He asked for my hand this morning .and
          I accepted him.
          Elizabeth looks quite faint. Charlotte sits on the bed.
          Elizabeth, after a pause, sits down beside her.

                         CHARLOTTE
          I can see you're surprised - coming so
          soon after his wishing to marry you...

                         ELIZABETH

                         (WEAKLY)
          No...

                         CHARLOTTE
          I'm not a romantic, you know. I ask only
          a comfortable home, and considering Mr
          Collin's character, and situation in
          life, I am convinced that my chance of
          happiness with him is as fair as most
          people can hope for.

                         ELIZABETH
          And that's all you expect?

                         CHARLOTTE
          For women in our situation, what choice
          is there?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (PASSIONATELY)
          Don't speak like that, Charlotte!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         CHARLOTTE
          â¢ - to become an old maid, at best
          tolerated, at worst a burden, dependent
          on the kindness of others? Or to seek the
          protection of marriage.

                         ELIZABETH
          And we only have two choices?

                         CHARLOTTE
          Yes.
          An appalled silence. Elizabeth gazes at her closest
          friend. Charlotte has recovered herself. she now looks
          cool and composed - unnervingly so.

                         ELIZABETH
          You can still change your mind,
          Charlotte.

                         CHARLOTTE
          (shakes her head)

          The militia are leaving Meryton. Hundreds of soldiers and
          officers in the red coats marching out of the village to
          the sound of pipes and drums. The villagers are out to
          bid them farewell. Lydia and Kitty run through the crowds
          very distraught. They find Elizabeth coming in the other
          direction.

                         LYDIA
          It's too dreadful! They're leaving for
          Brighton.

                         ELIZABETH
          All of them?

                         KITTY
          They got the call this morning.

                         LYDIA
          Not a word of warning!
          Lydia wails. Elizabeth searches the red coats for
          Wickham. She spots him, he glances across at her, she
          gives a pathetic wave and he's gone. Lydia and Kitty
          chase the last of the officers, leaving Elizabeth alone.
          She walks into the post office.

          Bad news, Miss?

          It could not be worse. I have been
          invited to possibly the very last place
          on earth I would like to go.

                         MR COLLINS
          Welcome to our humble abode...

          63 EXT. HUNSFORD PARSONAGE- DAY. 63

          There is a coop containing hens of various
          descriptions ...a.pig-stye...a vegetable patch...a rose
          bower. Charlotte and Mr Collins are showing Elizabeth
          round the place.

                         MR COLLINS

                         (POINTING)
          And from here we have a good view of
          Rosings Park, where we are honoured to
          dine at least twice a week. Her
          ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered
          for us. I should say, one of her
          ladyship's carriages, for she has
          several.

                         CHARLOTTE
          My dear, I think our guest is tired after
          her journey. Come on, Lizzie, let's get
          some tea.

                         T

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         MR COLLINS
          â¢ My wife encourages me to spend as much
          time in the garden as possible, for the
          sake of my health.
          A beat. Lizzie glances at Charlotte, who remains
          impassive.

                         MR COLLINS
          I plan many improvements, of course.
          (points to house)
          I intend. to throw out a bow there, and
          plant a lime walk.
          (sharp look at Lizzie)
          Oh yes, I flatter myself that any young
          lady would be happy to be the mistress of
          such a house.
          A tiny nod from Elizabeth. She understands perfectly.

          64 INT. CHARLOTTE'S PARLOUR - HUNSFORD - DAY. 64

          Lizzie and Charlotte are at last alone. They sit down,
          with a certain relief, in a charming little parlour that
          faces the front of the house. Charlotte pours out tea.

                         CHARLOTTE
          â¢ We shall not be disturbed here, for this
          parlour is for my own particular use.

                         (A BEAT)
          Oh Lizzie, it's such a pleasure, to run
          my own home!
          A flash of understanding between them.

          MR COLLINS (OOV)
          Charlotte! Come here!
          Charlotte jumps up and rushes to the window.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (ALARMED)
          What's happened?

          MR COLLINS (OOV)
          Charlotte!

                         ELIZABETH

                         (JUMPS UP)
          Has the pig escaped?
          Lizzie joins her at the window. outside in the lane, Mr
          Collins stands, bowing, at a carriage.

                         Â¢

                         CHARLOTTE
          Its all right. Its just Lady Catherine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          They both burst out laughing. Just for a moment, the
          â¢ atmosphere is eased.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
          Tell me, how are things concerning Mr
          Wickham?
          Elizabeth's face changes.

                         ELIZABETH
          I have not heard from Mr Wickham since
          the regiment left for Brighton, but I am
          informed by Lydia who keeps a breast of
          all matters military that he does very
          well.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Oh Lizzie.
           we hear Mr Collins rushing back into the house, and
           running up the stairs.

           COLLINS (O.S.)
           Great news! Great news!
           He comes into the room, breathlessly excited.

                          COLLINS (CONT'D)
          â¢ We have an invitation to visit Rosings
          this evening from Lady Catherine de
          Bourgh.
          Elizabeth is not overcome with enthusiasm.

                         COLLINS (CONT'D)
          Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear
          cousin, about your apparel. Just put on
          that which is best among your clothes and
          Lady Catherine will not think the worse
          of you.

          65 EXT. GROUNDS OF ROSINGS - EVENING. 65

          Elizabeth, Charlotte and Mr Collins walk hurriedly across
          the lawns towards the great house. Beyond the toparied
          hedges the grey building looms ominously above them. It
          is grand without being elegant.

                         COLLINS
          One of the most extraordinary sights in
          all Europe, is it not. The glazing alone
          cost upwards of twenty thousand pounds.

                         0

          66 INT. STAIRWAY -- ROSINGS - THE SAME. 66

          Mr Collins, Charlotte and Elizabeth are led up a vast
          stairway which is painted with visions of hell. Elizabeth
          stops in front of a painting of a devil. She stares at
          it, It seem to speak, but she realizes the voice is
          Collins chiding her.

                         COLLINS
          (as the devil)
          This way!

          67 TNT. SALON - ROSINGS - DUSK. 67
          The salon at Rosings is spectacularly grand; hideously
          so. Heavy furniture, rows of servants. The three guests
          are shown in by the footman. Again Mr Collins scrapes
          the floor with his bow.

                         MR COLLINS
          Your Ladyship.
          (to the daughter)
          Miss de Bourg.
          Lady Catherine is a haughty, bossy woman. Pretty
          â¢ unspeakable, really. Her daughter is a sickly, irritable-
          looking creature.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          So you are Elizabeth Bennet.

                         ELIZABETH
          I am, your ladyship.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          (looking her up and down)
          Hmm.
          (indicates her daughter)
          This is my daughter.

                         CHARLOTTE

                         (EAGERLY)
          It's very kind of you to ask us to dine,
          Lady Catherine.
          Lady Catherine ignores her.

                         MR COLLINS
          (whispers to Lizzie)
          The chimneypiece alone cost Â£400.
          But Lizzie doesn't hear. Darcy walks into the room.
          Lizzie freezes. When he sees Lizzie he, too, falters, and
          recovers himself. Another man (Fitzwilliam) is with him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ Mr Darcy! What are you doing here?

                          MR COLLINS
           Mr Darcy!
          (another deep bow)
          I had no idea we would have the honour...
          A stiff bow from Darcy, who looks at Mr Collins as if
          he's something brought in by the dog. He turns to Lizzie,
          trying to collect himself.

                         DARCY

                         (BOWS)
          Miss Bennet...I'm staying here.

                         LADY CATHERINE

                         (SURPRISED)
          You know my nephew?

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting
          him in Hertfordshire.
          Darcy's friend Fitzwilliam, a much more easy-going chap,
          introduces himself.

                         FITZWILLIAM
          â¢ Colonel Fitzwilliam. How do you do?
          He bows. Lizzie returns his smile gratefully. They move
          towards the dining room. Mr Collins leans towards
          Lizzie.

                         MR COLLINS

                         (WHISPERING)
          You know Mr Darcy is as good as engaged
          to Miss de Bourg?

                         ELIZABETH
          Really? Miss Bingley will be disappointed
          to hear that.
          (looks at the girl, and
          whispers to charlotte)
          What a sickly, cross little thing! Oh
          yes, they should suit each other very
          well.
          Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more
          intimidated by Rosings than Elizabeth is, and indeed has
          more at stake.
           68 INT. DINING ROOM - ROSINGS - NIGHT. f
          9 The dining room is laid for a very grand dinner -- footmen
          waiting, thousands of candles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.
          Lady Catherine seats herself at the head of the table.
          The guests wait for their orders.

                         Â¢

                         LADY CATHERINE
          You sit there and you sit there. Mr
          Collins! You can't sit next to your wife!
          After some awkward shuffling around they all sit down.
          Lizzie, much to her discomfort, finds herself sitting
          next to Darcy. There is a pause.

                         MR DARCY
          I trust your family is in good health,
          Miss Bennet?

                         ELIZABETH
          They are, thank you.

                         (PAUSE)
          My eldest sister is currently in London,
          perhaps you happened to see her there?

                         MR DARCY

                         (AWKWARD PAUSE)
          I haven't been fortunate enough, no.
          Lizzie looks at him. He colours slightly. Lady Catherine
          addresses Lizzie in a loud voice, from the head of the
          table.

                         Â¢

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Do you play the pianoforte, Miss Bennet?

                         ELIZABETH
          A little, ma'am, and very poorly.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Oh. Do you draw?

                         ELIZABETH
          No, not at all.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Your sisters, do they draw?

                         ELIZABETH
          Not one.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          That is very strange. But I suppose you
          had no opportunity. Your mother should
          have taken you to town every spring for
          the benefit of the masters.

                         ELIZABETH
          My mother would have no objection but my
          father hates London.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          â¢ Has your governess left you?

                         ELIZABETH
          We never had a governess.
          Mr Collins squirms in embarrassment. Darcy watches
          Elizabeth, keenly.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          No governess? Five daughters brought up
          at home without a governess, I never
          heard such a thing! Your mother must have
          been quite a slave to your education.

                         ELIZABETH
          (can't help smiling at this)
          Not at all, Lady Catherine.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Mmmm. Are any of your younger sisters
          out?

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, ma'am. All.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          All! What, five out at once? Very odd!
          â¢ And you only the second - the younger
          ones out before the elders are married!
          Your youngest sisters must be very young.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I
          think it would be very hard on younger
          sisters, not to have their share of
          amusement because the elder is still
          unmarried. And to be kept back on such a
          motive! It would hardly encourage
          sisterly affection.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Upon my word, you give your opinion very
          decidedly for so young a person. Pray,
          what is your age?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SMILES)
          With three younger sisters grown up, your
          Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to

                         P C
          it.
          Lady Catherine looks astonished. Mr Collins shifts in
          his seat. Mr Darcy glances sharply - in fact, admiringly
          - at Lizzie. She's enjoying herself.

          69 INT. DRAWING ROOM - ROSINGS -- NIGHT. 69

          Dinner is over and they are drinking coffee. Darcy moves
          towards Elizabeth but Lady Catherine interrupts, by
          shouting from her seat.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Come, Miss Bennet, and play for us!

                         ELIZABETH
          No, I beg you -

                         LADY CATHERINE
          For music is my delight. In fact there
          are few people in England who have more
          true enjoyment of music than myself, or
          better natural taste. If I had ever
          learnt, I should have been a great
          proficient.

                         (INDICATES DAUGHTER)
          So would Anne, if her health would have
          allowed her.

                         ELIZABETH
          Please, I told you I play poorly -

          â¢ MR COLLINS

                         (HISSES)
          Come come, Elizabeth, her ladyship
          demands it!
          Lizzie reluctantly sits down at the piano and starts to
          play. Lady Catherine takes no notice and talks loudly
          over the music.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          How does Georgina get along, Darcy?

                         DARCY
          She plays very well.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          I hope she practises. No excellence can
          be acquired without constant practice. I
          have told Mrs Collins this.
          (turns to Charlotte)
          Though you have no instrument of your own
          you are very welcome to come to Rosings
          and play on the piano in the
          housekeeper's room.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Thank you, your ladyship.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          â¢ You would be in nobody's way", you know,
          in that part of the house.
          Darcy flinches at her bad manners. He moves away to the
          piano where Lizzie is playing - not that terribly well,
          it must be said. A moment passes.

                         ELIZABETH
          You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by
          coming in all your state to hear me, but
          I won't be alarmed even though your
          sister does play so well.

                         DARCY
          I am well enough acquainted with you,
          Miss Bennet, to know I cannot alarm you
          even should I wish it.
          A beat. They eye each other warily. Colonel Fitzwilliam
          joins them.

                         FITZWILLIAM

                         (INDICATING DARCY)
          What was my friend like, in
          Hertfordshire?

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ You really care to know?
          The colonel nods.

                         ELIZABETH
          Prepare yourself for something very
          dreadful.

                         (STOPS PLAYING)
          The first time I saw him, at the
          Assembly, he danced with nobody at all -
          even though gentlemen were scarce and
          there was more than one young lady who
          was sitting down without a partner.

                         DARCY

                         (COLOURING )
          I knew nobody beyond my own party.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SMILES SWEETLY)
          True, and nobody can be introduced in a
          ballroom.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Fitzwilliam! Come here and talk to us!
          0 Fitzwilliam moves away. Darcy and Elizabeth are alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         DARCY
          I do not have the talent of conversing
          easily with people I have never met
          before.

                         ELIZABETH
          Maybe you should take your aunt's advice
          and practice.
          Ouch! Darcy flinches. Lizzie turns away from him and
          carries on playing. Darcy gazes at the curve of her neck.
          She plays a false note, stumbles, and grimly carries on.

          70 INT. DRAWING ROOM - HUNSFORD - DAY. 70

          Elizabeth is writing a letter in the drawing room. She
          starts "Dear Jane..:" The doorbell rings in the
          background, she thinks nothing of it and continues. The
          maid opens the door to the drawing room and Mr Darcy
          enters.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (ASTONISHED)
          Mr Darcy!
          An awkward pause.

                         ELIZABETH
          Please, do be seated.

                         (PAUSE)
          I'm afraid Mr and Mrs Collins are gone on
          business to the village.
          A pause. What on earth does Mr Darcy want? He paces up
          and down.

                         DARCY
          This is a charming house. I believe my
          aunt did a great deal to it when Mr
          Collins first arrived.

                         ELIZABETH
          I believe so -- and she could not have
          bestowed her kindness on a more grateful

                         SUBJECT-
          Another pause.

                         DARCY
          Mr Collins seems very fortunate in his
          choice of wife.

                         Â¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         ELIZABETH
          He is indeed lucky to have found one of
          the few sensible women who would have
          accepted him.
          Darcy sits down.

                         ELIZABETH
          Shall I call for some tea?

                         DARCY
          No. Thankyou.
          The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up.

                         DARCY
          Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a
          pleasure.
          He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused
          and intrigued.

                         CUT TO:
          Charlotte, in the hallway, taking off her bonnet. Darcy
          hurries past her, with a swift bow, and leaves abruptly.
          Charlotte gazes after him in surprise.
          â¢ Charlotte heads to the drawing room where she finds
          Elizabeth sitting, bemused.

                         CHARLOTTE
          What on earth have you done to poor Mr
          Darcy?

          ELIZABETH.
          I have no idea.
          73 She truly doesn't. Charlotte gives Elizabeth a look 73

          71 EXT. HUNSFORD CHURCH - DAY. 71

          Sunday service is over and worshippers are leaving the "
          church. Mr Collins, in his vestments, obeises himself to
          Lady Catherine, who is sweeping out with her miserable-
          looking daughter and downtrodden governess. Elizabeth
          joins Colonel Fitzwilliam. They walk down the path
          together.

                         ELIZABETH
          How long do you plan to stay in Kent,
          Colonel?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          As long as Darcy chooses. I am at his
          disposal.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         ELIZABETH
          I do imagine your cousin brought you down
          with him chiefly to have someone to order
          around. I wonder he does not marry and
          secure a lasting convenience of that
          kind.

                         FITZWILLIAM
          She would be a lucky woman.

                         ELIZABETH
          Really?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          Darcy is a most loyal companion. From
          what I heard, on our journey here, he
          recently came to the rescue of one of his
          friends just in time.
          Darcy, waylaid by various people, comes out of the
          church. His eyes search for Elizabeth. He sees her with
          Fitzwilliam and hesitates. Too late! Mr Collins steps up
          to him and engages him in conversation. Elizabeth stops,
          at the churchyard gate.

                         ELIZABETH
          What happened?

                         Â¢

                         FITZWILLIAM
          He saved the man from an imprudent
          marriage.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (FALTERING SLIGHTLY)
          Who was the man?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          His closest friend. Mr Bingley.
          A silence.

                         ELIZABETH
          Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for
          this interference?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          There were apparently strong objections
          to the lady.

                         ELIZABETH
          What kind of objections? Her lack of
          fortune?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          I think it was her family that was
          considered unsuitable.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         ELIZABETH
          So he separated them?

                         FITZWILLIAM
          I believe so. I know nothing else.
          Elizabeth grows pale. She turns to look at Darcy who is
          joined by his aunt.

                         ELIZABETH
          I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well
          in finding partners suitable to their
          very high standards. Good morning, Col.
          Fitzwilliam.
          76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76
          parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a
          distance.

          72 EXT. ROSINGS PARK - DAY. 72

          Lizzie walks across the park - anywhere, she hardly
          cares. She is in a turmoil of misery and fury. How could
          Darcy do such a terrible thing! It starts to rain.

                         CUT TO:
          â¢ A Grecian summer house by the lake. The rain is now
          bucketing down. Lizzie hurries into the summer house and
          sits down, heavily, on a bench.
          Her poor sister; Lizzie gazes in despair at the rain-
          lashed landscape.
          A man approaches, across the park. He draws nearer.
          It's Darcy. Elizabeth stiffens. He's hurrying towards
          her. Sodden, breathless, he comes into the. summer house.
          He is in a state of agitation - far too agitated to
          notice her upset face.

                         DARCY
          Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but
          I can bear it no longer ... . The past
          months have been a torment...
          He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in
          astonishment. He struggles on.

                         DARCY
          I came to Rosings with the single object
          of seeing you...I had to see you...

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ Me?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         DARCY
          â¢ I've fought against my better judgement,
          my family's expectation...

                         (PAUSE)
          The inferiority of your birth.. .my rank
          and circumstance...

                         (STUMBLINGLY)
          all those things.. .but I'm willing to put
          them aside... and ask you to end my
          agony...

                         ELIZABETH
          I don't understand...

                         DARCY

                         (WITH PASSION)
          I love you. Most ardently.
          Elizabeth stares at him.

                         DARCY
          Please do me the honour of accepting my
          hand.
          A silence. Elizabeth struggles with the most painful
          confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (VOICE SHAKING)
          Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have
          been through, and I am very sorry to have
          caused you pain. Believe me, it was
          unconsciously done.
          A silence. Gathering her shawl, she gets to her feet.

                         DARCY

                         (STARES)
          Is this your reply?

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, sir.

                         DARCY
          Are you laughing at me?

                         ELIZABETH
          No?

                         DARCY
          Are you rejecting me?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (PAUSE)
          I'm sure that the feelings which, as
          you've told me, have hindered your
          regard, will help you in overcoming it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.
          A terrible silence, as this sinks in. Neither of them can
          â¢ move. At last, Darcy speaks. He is very pale.

                         DARCY
          Might I ask why, with so little endeavour
          at civility, I am thus repulsed?

                         ELIZABETH
          (trembling with emotion)
          I might as well enquire why, with so.
          evident a design of insulting me, you
          chose to tell me that you liked me
          against your better judgement. If I was
          uncivil, that was some excuse -

                         DARCY
          Believe me, I didn't mean -

                         ELIZABETH
          But I have other reasons, you know I
          have!

                         DARCY
          What reasons?

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you think that anything might tempt me
          to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps
          for ever, the happiness of a most beloved
          sister?
          Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the
          face.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you
          separated a young couple who loved each
          other, exposing your friend to the
          censure of the world for caprice, and my
          sister to its derision for disappointed
          hopes, and involving them both in misery
          of the acutest kind?

                         DARCY
          I do not deny it.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (BLURTS OUT)
          How could you do it?

                         DARCY
          Because I believed your sister
          indifferent to him.

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ Indifferent?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         DARCY
          â¢ I watched them most carefully, and
          realized his attachment was much deeper
          than hers.

                         ELIZABETH
          That's because she's shy!

                         DARCY
          Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded
          that she didn't feel strongly for him.

                         ELIZABETH
          Because you suggested it!

                         DARCY
          I did it for his own good.

                         ELIZABETH
          My sister hardly shows her true feelings
          to me!
          (pause, takes a breath)
          I suppose you suspect that his fortune
          had some bearing on the matter?

                         DARCY

                         (SHARPLY)
          No! I wouldn't do your sister the

                         Â¢
          dishonour. Though it was suggested -

                         (STOPS)

                         ELIZABETH
          What was?

                         DARCY
          It was made perfectly clear that-an
          advantageous marriage...

                         (STOPS)

                         ELIZABETH
          Did my sister give that impression?

                         DARCY -
          No!
          An awkward pause.

                         DARCY
          There was, however, I have to admit...
          the matter of your family -

                         ELIZABETH
          Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't
          vex himself about that!

                         Â¢

                         DARCY
          No, it was more than that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         ELIZABETH
          How, sir?

                         DARCY
          (pause, very uncomfortable)
          It pains me to say this, but it was the
          lack of propriety shown by your mother,
          your three younger sisters - even, on
          occasion, your father. Forgive me.
          Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down.

                         DARCY
          You and your sister -- I must exclude from
          this...
          Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth
          glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery.

                         ELIZABETH
          And what about Mr Wickham?

                         DARCY
          Mr Wickham?

                         ELIZABETH
          What excuse can you give for your
          behavior to him?

                         Â¢

                         DARCY
          You take an eager interest in that
          gentleman's concerns!

                         ELIZABETH
          He told me of his misfortunes.

                         DARCY
          Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very
          great indeed!

                         ELIZABETH
          You have ruined his chances, and yet
          treat him with sarcasm?

                         DARCY
          So this is your opinion of me! Thank you
          for explaining so fully. Perhaps these
          offences might have been overlooked, if
          your pride had not been hurt -

                         ELIZABETH
          My pride?

                         DARCY
          - by my honesty in admitting scruples
          about our relationship.

                          DARCY (CONT'D)
           Could you expect me to rejoice in the
           inferiority of your circumstances?

                         Â¢

                         ELIZABETH
          And those are the words of a gentleman?
          From the first moment I met you, your
          arrogance and conceit, your selfish
          distain of the feelings of others, made
          me realize that you were the last man in
          the world I could ever be prevailed upon
          to marry.
          Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence.

                         DARCY
          Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much
          of your time.
          He leaves, abruptly.
          Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What
          has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears.

          73 INT. HUNSFORD - DAY. 73

          Elizabeth comes in soaked to the skin. Charlotte runs to
          her.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Elizabeth!

                         ELIZABETH
          I was caught somewhat off-guard.

          74 INT. BEDROOM - HUNSFORD - THE SAME. 74

          Charlotte attends to Elizabeth.who has changed and is
          drying her hair, a shawl around her shoulders.

                         CHARLOTTE
          Shall I call the doctor?

                         ELIZABETH
          No! Charlotte, I shall be quite all
          right. Please, give Lady de Bourgh my
          apologies. You must not keep her waiting.
          Mr Collins clatters up the stairs.

                         COLLINS
          (popping his head around the

                         DOOR)
          Come on. We shall be late!

                         Â¢

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Charlotte leaves, reluctantly, and goes downstairs.

                         CUT TO
          Later; The sound of the front door closing. Elizabeth
          sits down, heavily, on the bed. She walks downstairs and
          enters the drawing room.

          75 INT. DRAWING ROOM - HUNSFORD - DAY. 75

          Elizabeth is in the drawing room, she looks at a book on
          the table. It is Fordyce's Sermons. She puts it down and
          walks to the mirror and stares at herself. After a moment
          suddenly Darcy's face appears. She freezes. They stare at
          each other without speaking. Finally...

                         DARCY
          I came to leave you this.
          He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth
          does not turn but watches him through the mirror.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          I'm not going to renew the sentiments
          which were so disgusting to you, but to
          address the two offenses you have laid
          against me. I had not long been in
          Hertfordshire before I saw that Bingley

                         Â¢
          preferred your eldest sister. I observed
          my friend's behaviour attentively and I
          could perceive that his partiality for
          Miss Bennet was beyond what I have ever
          witnessed in him.
          Elizabeth cannot bring herself to look at Darcy. She
          stares at her own reflection as he speaks.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          Yet when I observed your sister .1
          detected no symptom of peculiar regard,
          and witnessed only the families coarse
          appetite for having their daughters
          married favorably. And so in London,
          perhaps erroneously, I persuaded him of
          the unfitness of the match citing your
          sisters coolness towards him.
          We zoom in on Elizabeth's reflection.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          It was unknowingly done and though the
          motives which governed me may to you
          appear naturally insufficient, they were
          done to protect a friend. As to the other
          â¢ more serious matter..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.
          As Elizabeth turns she realises Darcy has gone. Darcy's
          voice carries.

          DARCY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          "My father provided for Mr Wickham a
          valuable living.
          Elizabeth tears open the envelope, her hands shaking, and
          reads the letter, as Darcy's voice carries on.

          DARCY (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          "But upon his death, however, Mr Wickham
          told me that he had no intention of
          taking orders and would I recompense him
          to the tune of Â£3000 so he could go to
          town and study the law.
          We circle Elizabeth as she reads.

          DARCY (CONT'D) (V.0.)

                         (CONT'D)
          This I did, though by now I had some
          doubts about his character. These were
          confirmed by reports that he had sunk
          into a life of idleness, gambling and
          dissipation. The money was soon used up,
          whereupon he wrote demanding more money
          which I refused, whereupon he severed all

                         Â¢ ACQUAINTANCE"
          Holding the letter she looks out of the window to see
          Darcy riding away.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          "But last summer he was unwillingly
          obtruded on my notice when he connived a
          relationship with my sister whom he
          persuaded to be in love with him and made
          her consent to an elopement. She was but
          fifteen.

          76 EXT. HUNSFORD - DAY. 76

          Darcy rides off.

          DARCY (V.0.)
          Mr Wickham's prime objective was her
          inheritance of thirty thousand pounds but
          hope of revenging me was a strong
          inducement. I was lucky enough to
          persuade my sister of her folly. I hope
          this goes someway to mitigating my
          behaviour in your eyes. If you doubt my
          word please have it confirmed by my

                         Â¢

          Lizzy: Are you alright?

                         ELIZABETH
          I do not know. I hardly know myself.
          Elizabeth looks at Charlotte utterly shaken.

          Elizabeth riding in a carriage through Cheapside, reading
          the letter.

          DARCY (V.0.)
          P.S. As we shall never meet again, I wish
          you all happiness in the future.
          Elizabeth looks out at the high warehouse building and
          the bustle of trade. There is no horizon.
          is 79 INT. GARDINERS HOUSE - CHEAPSIDE - DAY. 7
          Mrs Gardiner, the girls' kindly aunt, is taking
          Elizabeth's coat from her.

                         MRS GARDINER
          How fortunate, you are here just in time
          to catch everybody coming through from
          Longbourn.

                         ELIZABETH
          How is Jane?
          Mrs Gardiner smiles sadly.

                         MRS GARDINER
          She is outside.
          Through a window Elizabeth sees Jane sitting quietly
          alone at her needle work.

                         CUT TO:

          80 EXT. SMALL BACK GARDEN OF THE GARDINERS' HOUSE - E


          CHEAPSIDE - THE SAME.
          Elizabeth and Jane sit together in the small walled
          garden.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.
          Jane is all smiles, but behind her eyes is a sadness
          unseen before. Elizabeth is desperate to unburden herself
          â¢ but feels unable.

                         JANE
          I am quite over him, Lizzie. If he passed
          in the street I would hardly notice.
          London is so diverting...

                         ELIZABETH
          oh Jane...

                         JANE
          Its true! What with the theatre and...
          But tell me, what news from Kent?

                         ELIZABETH
          Nothing. Everything as you might imagine.
          Elizabeth tries to smile. There is a crash as all the
          Bennet's arrive at the house. Kitty rushes into the
          garden crying her eyes out, she is followed by Lydia and
          Mrs Bennet.

                         KITTY
          Lizzie, tell mama, tell her!

                         LYDIA

                         (WAILS)
          Why didn't she ask me as well?

                         ELIZABETH
          Kitty, what's happened?

                         LYDIA
          - because she likes me better.

                         KITTY
          I've just as much right as Lydia -

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh, if I could but go to Brighton -

                         KITTY
          - and more so, because I'm two years
          older!
          Elizabeth looks to Jane.

                         JANE
          Lydia has been invited to Brighton with
          the Foresters.

          I shall dine with the officers every
          night!
          An anguished wail from Kitty.

                         MRS BENNET
          I'm sure I cried for two days when
          Colonel Millar's regiment went away.
          thought I should have broke my heart.

                         LIZZIE
          Mother! Are you all mad?
          She glares at them, deeply upset -- by them, by
          everything.

          81 INT. THE GARDINERS' HOUSE - DAY. 81

          Elizabeth has found a quiet corner with her father.

                         ELIZABETH
          Please Papa, don't let her go!

                         MR BENNET
          Lydia will never be easy till she has
          exposed herself in some public place or
          other, and we can never expect her to do
          it with so little inconvenience as under
          the present circumstances.

                         ELIZABETH
          (with great emotion)
          If you, dear father, will not take the
          trouble to check her, she will be fixed
          forever as the silliest and most
          determined flirt who ever made her family
          ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she
          always does.

                         MR KENNET
          We shall have no peace until she goes.

                         ELIZABETH
          (really angry now)
          Peace! Is that all you care about?

                         MR BENNET
          Colonel Forster is a sensible man and
          will keep her out of any real mischief,
          and she is far too poor to be an object
          of prey to anyone.

                         ELIZABETH
          Father, its dangerous! -

                         MR BENNET
          I'm sure the officers will find women
          better worth their while. Let us hope, in
          fact, that her stay in Brighton will
          teach her her own insignificance. At any
          rate she can hardly grow any worse,
          without authorizing us to lock her up for
          the rest of her life.
          Elizabeth gazes at her father - will nothing touch him?
          He gave up on his daughter long ago. For this, just now,
          she hates him.

                         ELIZABETH
          No wonder our family is treated with
          contempt.
          She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks
          puzzled at her outburst.

          82 INT. DRAWING ROOM - CHEAPSIDE - THE SAME. 82

          Mr Bennet follows Elizabeth in.

                         MR BENNET
          Well, at least the house will be quieter.

                         ELIZABETH
          I don't wish to be stuck with such a
          foolish family any longer, with your
          constant talk of men and marriages.
          Surely there is more to life.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Lizzie dear, you would be very welcome to
          accompany us?

                         MR GARDINER
          Oh yes. We plan to journey through the
          Peak District. You'd be most welcome.

                         MARY
          Oh, the glories of nature! What are men,
          compared to rocks and mountains?

                         ELIZABETH
          Believe me, men are either eaten up with
          arrogance or stupidity. And if they're
          amiable they're so easily led that they
          have no minds of their own whatsoever.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Take care, my love, that savours strongly
          of bitterness.

          No, they bring nothing but heartache.

          83 INT. BEDROOM - CHEAPSIDE - NIGHT. 83

          As usual Elizabeth and Jane share a bed. They lie next to
          each other in the darkness

                         ELIZABETH
          I saw Mr Darcy when I was in Rosings.

                         JANE
          Why did you not tell me. Did he mention
          Mr Bingley.
          Pause.

                         ELIZABETH
          No. He did not.
          Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her
          sister.

          84 EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DAY. 84

          A ravishing landscape of savage and romantic beauty -
          scudding clouds, mountains, wild rocky outcrops.
          Elizabeth is walking freely, the wind in her hair. As she
          nears the peak of a promontory, Mr and Mrs Gardiner are
          below making their way towards her. They smile at her.
          She strides off determined to reach the very top. When
          she gets there she stands with her arms outstretched, her
          head back laughing into the wind. The view is
          magnificent. She breathes deeply.

          85 EXT. LAMBTON - DUSK. 85

          An establishing shot of Lambton, a charming market town.
          Through the window of an inn we see Elizabeth and Mr and
          Mrs Gardiner at a table.

                         O
          In the inn, the Gardiner's and Elizabeth are eating
          supper. An air of high spirits. At the next table,
          another amiable tourist couple are also tucking into
          their food.

          One of the best houses in the country.

          Aren't you acquainted with the owner, Mr

          Well, we shall go there tomorrow, Lizzie.

                         ELIZABETH
          I would rather stay here.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Stay here?

                         (VERY UNCOMFORTABLE)
          I must own that I'm tired of great
          houses. All those carpets and curtains.

                         MRS GARDINER
          But you liked Chatsworth.

                         ELIZABETH
          If it is anything like Mr Darcy, I am
          sure I will not be able to bear it.

          Come, come, Lizzie.

          Let us not make a fuss. If the girl does
          not want to go there is little point in
          persuading her.

          87 INT. BEDROOM -- INN - NIGHT. 87

          Elizabeth is preparing for bed. The chambermaid fills her
          washbowl and starts to leave.

          I hear that Pemberley is not far from
          here.

          Yes, madam.

                         ELIZABETH
          You see something of the owner, do you,
          in town?

                         MAID
          Not for some months, madam, for he's
          still in London, I believe.

          I'm so glad you changed your mind.
          Elizabeth is alert, her eyes bright with curiosity. The
          parkland is wild and rocky. Deer graze; rooks wheel in
          the sky. A sense of freedom and liberation. As the
          carriage drives over the top of a hill, close on
          Elizabeth's face. She gasps. The Gardiners gasp.
          A huge, wide shot of Pemberley House. It's vast,
          breathtakingly beautiful, set in great boulder-strewn

          the sunlight.

          Elizabeth walks through the magnificent grounds.

          as big as all Cheapside.
          Elizabeth is lost in admiration.

          Elizabeth and the Gardiners are being taken on the tour
          by the housekeeper, Mrs Reynolds, who witters on in the
          background with descriptions of each room. Elizabeth is
          apart and we witness the exquisite house from her point
          of view. A book lies open, on a reading desk, Elizabeth
          turns it over to read the title.

                         MRS GARDINER

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          Keep up.
          They walk through room after amazing room: a breath-
          taking library, an unbelievable staircase.

          91 INT. PICTURE GALLERY - PEMBERLY -- DAY. 91

          The huge picture gallery. Elizabeth is apart from the
          rest looking at the pictures she stops by a painting of
          Darcy. She looks at it thoughtfully but is interrupted by
          Mrs Reynolds and the Gardiners who are following her.

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          This is my master - Mr Darcy.

                         MRS GARDINER
          A handsome face. Lizzie, is it a true
          likeness of him?

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          Does this young lady know Mr Darcy?

                         ELIZABETH
          Only a little.

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          And do you not think him a handsome man,
          Miss?

                         ELISABETH

                         (THOUGHTFULLY)
          Yes, yes I suppose he is.
          Mrs Reynolds moves the Gardiners on to another painting,
          but Elizabeth stays, staring at Darcy's image.

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          And this is his sister, Miss Georgians.
          She plays and sings all day long.
          We realize that in the distance we have heard music.
          Elizabeth is still gazing at the portrait of Darcy, then
          suddenly snaps out of her reverie, as she processes Mrs

                         REYNOLDS SPEECH:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         ELIZABETH
          â¢ They are at home?!

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          Miss Darcy is always down for the summer.
          Mr Darcy is due here tomorrow.

                         MR GARDINER
          Is your master much at Pemberley?

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          Not as much as I would wish, sir, or he --
          for he dearly loves it here.
          Relaxed again Elizabeth wanders off as the Gardiners talk
          to Mrs Reynolds.

                         MRS GARDINER
          If he should marry, you might see more of
          him.

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          Yes madam, but I do not know when that
          will be. I do not know a lady who is good
          enough for him.

                         MRS GARDINER
          What do you mean?

                         Â¢

                         MRS REYNOLDS
          I've known Mr Darcy since he was a boy.
          He was always a kind and generous person
          even then. Not everyone can see it,
          because he does not make a meal of it
          like a lot of young men nowadays. But he
          is the most sweet-tempered and kind-
          hearted man I have ever known.

                         CUT TO:
          As the Gardiners look at more paintings, Elizabeth drifts
          out through the open doors and onto a terrace. In the
          bright sunlight the view of the gardens and valley beyond
          is exquisite. Outside the music we heard before is
          louder.

          92 EXT. TERRACE - PEMBERLY - THE SAME. 92

          Elizabeth wanders aimlessly across the terrace, being
          unconsciously drawn by the music. Suddenly Elizabeth
          recognizes the tune (perhaps it is one she has played
          earlier - but this time it is played exquisitely). She
          follows the music round a corner, intrigued as she gets
          â¢ closer and closer to its source. She finally realizes she
          is outside the room where the music is being played.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          She steals herself a moment, but her curiosity gets the
          better of her and she discretely peeps in.

                         Â¢
          Through the window she sees Georgina Darcy, a beautiful
          fifteen year old playing the piano with great passion and
          fluency. She is moved by the music and listens. After
          sometime, then someone steps into her view but is mostly
          hidden by shadows in the room. He is directly behind
          Georgina and gently puts his hands over her eyes.
          Georgina stops playing and laughs uproariougly. She
          stands and kisses the figure, the sunlight hits his face.
          It is Darcy.
          Georgina and Darcy kiss. Elizabeth is stunned to see him
          there. Darcy glances up and sees Elizabeth watching him.
          For a moment they both stare at each other frozen with
          surprise. Georgina starts in fright at the figure,
          Elizabeth turns and runs. Darcy comes out after her.

                         DARCY
          Miss Bennet!
          Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches
          up with her. They both blush, deeply.

                         ELIZABETH
          I thought you were in London.

                         DARCY

                         (STUPIDLY)
          No... I'm not.

                         ELIZABETH
          No.
          Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once.

                         DARCY ELIZABETH
          I came here a day early - We wouldn't have come -

                         DARCY ELIZABETH
          -- some business with my I'm so terribly sorry -

                         STEWARD -
          They stop. He gazes at her with great emotion.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and
          aunt.

                         DARCY
          (trying to recover)
          And are you having a pleasant trip?

                         ELIZABETH
          Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock.

                         DARCY
          â¢ Tomorrow?

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Are you staying at Larnbton?

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes. At the Rose and Crown.
          Another pause. She extends her hand.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the
          house was open for visitors. I had no
          idea...
          She shakes his hand and starts to walk away.

                         DARCY
          May I see you to the village?

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh no! I'm very fond of walking.

                         DARCY
          Yes.

                         ELIZABETH
          Goodbye, Mr Darcy.

                         Â¢
          She hurries away. He gazes after her.

                         CUT TO:
          A wood. Now she is out of sight Lizzie collapses on a
          log. She is utterly undone. Around her, the birds sing.

          93 INT. INN -- NIGHT. 93

          It's that night. Lizzie comes downstairs, for supper. And
          stops. Through a gap in the door to the restaurant she
          sees Mr Darcy talking to her aunt and uncle.

                         DARCY
          - I shall send my carriage at noon
          After a moment Darcy leaves and Elizabeth approaches the
          table.

                         0 MRS GARDINER
          Lizzie, I've just met Mr Darcy! Why
          didn't you tell us you had seen him? He's
          asked us to dine with him tomorrow - He
          was very civil, was he not?

                         Â¢

                         MR GARDINER
          Very civil.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         MRS GARDINER
          â¢ Not at all like you painted him.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (STARES)
          To dine with him?

                         MRS GARDINER
          - there is something pleasing about his
          mouth, when he speaks.

                         MR GARDINER
          You don't mind delaying our journey for
          another day?
          Elizabeth shakes her head, dumbly.

                         MRS GARDINER
          He particularly wishes you to meet his
          sister.

                         ELIZABETH
          His sister?

          94 INT. LIBRARY AND DRAWING ROOM -- PEMBERLEY - DAY. 94

          A footman escorts Elizabeth and the Gardiner's through
          the stupendous library. From the drawing room, the sound
          of a piano playing.. It's the same music Elizabeth played
          at Rosings, but this time played very beautifully.
          Elizabeth is filled with trepidation; we can almost feel
          her heart racing.
          The footman opens the double doors to reveal the
          magnificent drawing room. Darcy is there. So is the
          dreaded Miss Bingley. Seeing her, Elizabeth's polite
          smile falters. Darcy's sister Georgiana plays the piano.
          She jumps up and hurries over.

                         DARCY
          My sister, Miss Darcy...
          They smile and bob. Georgiana is a friendly, sweet girl.

                         GEORGIANA
          Miss Elizabeth, my brother has told me so
          much about you. I feel as if we are
          friends already.

                         ELIZABETH
          What a beautiful instrument.

                         GEORGIANA
          My brother gave it to me.
          (smiles at him)
          He shouldn't have.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         DARCY
          â¢ Yes I should.

                         GEORGIANA
          Oh very well then.

                         DARCY
          She's easily persuaded, is she not?
          They gaze at each other with affection. Miss Bingley
          approaches.

                         MISS BINGLEY

                         (SMALL SMILE)
          What a surprise, Miss Bennet, to see you
          in Derbyshire.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SMALL NOD)
          Your brother is well, I trust?

                         MISS BINGLEY
          Very well. He hopes to come here soon.
          (significant glance at

                         GEORGIANA)
          Pemberley has a special attraction for
          him.

                         Â¢ ELIZABETH

                         (SWEETLY)
          Yes, the library is particularly
          splendid, is it not?
          A small silence. Darcy, uneasy at their conversation,
          approaches.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          And how is your family, Miss Bennet?
          Someone told me the militia are removed
          from Meryton.

                         (SIGNIFICANT SMILE)
          They must be a great loss for some of you
          Darcy comes to the rescue.

                         DARCY
          Your uncle is fond of fishing, I hear.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yes, very.

                         DARCY
          (drawing her away)
          Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this
          afternoon?

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          For the lake here is very well stocked
          and its occupants left in peace for far
          â¢ too long.
          Elizabeth smiles, surprised and delighted. And grateful
          to be rescued. What does Mr Darcy mean by this?
          She moves away, to speak to her uncle. Miss Bingley moves
          closer to Darcy.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          In six months I have never seen anyone so
          altered. How brown and coarse she has
          become!

                         DARCY
          I perceive no alteration' except she is
          rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous
          consequence of travelling in the summer.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          I remember, when we first knew her in
          Hertfordshire, you said "she a beauty? I
          would have as soon called her mother a
          wit!"

                         DARCY
          You must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even
          had I thought it, I would have couched it

                         Â¢
          with a little more finesse.
          Elizabeth looks across at Darcy - they smile at each
          other.

          95 EXT. DERBYSHIRE - DUSK 95

          Darcy is driving Elizabeth and the Gardiner's back to
          Lampton. The rugged landscape looks even more beautiful
          and dramatic in the dusk light. Elizabeth sits up with
          Darcy who holds the reins, while Mr and Mrs Gardiner sit
          comfortably in the carriage. Mr Gardiner smiles broadly
          at two large fish that lie beside him.

                         ELIZABETH
          It is so beautiful up here. I will be
          sorry to leave.
          Darcy smiles at her.

                         ELIZABETH
          You have been a most gracious host. I'm
          sure my aunt and uncle will talk of
          nothing else for days.

                         Â¢ DARCY
          I have recently thought a great deal
          about how I appear and act to others.

          She smiles softly at Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          It does you credit, sir.

          96 INT. INN -- LAMBTON - NIGHT. 96

          The party arrive back at the inn.

                         MR GARDINER
          (quietly to Elizabeth)
          What a capital fellow.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Thank you so much Mr Darcy.
          Darcy is about to take his leave when a servant brings
          Elizabeth a letter.

                         SERVANT

                         (TO LIZZIE)
          For you, madam.

                         ELIZABETH

          â¢ she rips open the letter.

          97 INT. PARLOUR - INN - LAMBTON - THE SAME. 97

          Elizabeth is crying with the open letter in her hand.
          Darcy and Mr and Mrs Gardiner stand dumb, not quite
          knowing what to do. Elizabeth tries to speak but bursts
          into tears again. She cries for a long time.

                         DARCY
          Miss Elizabeth.
          She cries on.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          Miss Elizabeth.
          She eventually gathers herself.

                         ELIZABETH
          It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has
          run away - with Mr Wickham. They are gone
          together from Brighton to Lord knows
          where. She has no money, no connections,
          I fear she is lost forever.

                         DARCY
          â¢ (quietly to Elizabeth)
          This is my fault - if only I had exposed
          Wickham when I should.

                         ELIZABETH
          No, this is my fault. I might have
          prevented all of it by merely being open
          with my sisters rather than too proud
          with my knowledge.
          Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed.

                         MRS GARDINER
          Has anything been done to recover her?

                         ELIZABETH
          Father has gone to London. But I know
          very well that nothing can be done. We
          have not the smallest hope.

                         DARCY
          Would to heaven that anything could be
          said or done on my part that could offer
          consolation to such distress.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sir, it think it is too late.

                         Â¢

                         MR GARDINER
          I am afraid we must go at once - I will
          join Mr Bennet and find Lydia before she
          ruins the family forever.

                         DARCY
          I am so very sorry. This is grave indeed.
          I will leave you. Goodbye.
          Darcy pauses at the door, looks back at Elizabeth and
          then is gone.

          Elizabeth, Jane, Mary and Kitty are gathered around Mrs
          Bennet who has taken to her bed.

                         MRS BENNET
          Why did the Foresters let her out of
          their sight? I always said they were
          unfit to have charge of her.

          You are all ruined. Who will take you now
          with a fallen sister? Poor Mr Bennet will
          now have to fight the perfidious Wickham
          and then be killed...

                         ELIZABETH
          He hasn't found him yet, Mama.

                         MRS BENNET

          over me...

          Were looking directly down onto a London street. Mr
          Bennet stands still against the passing pedestrian
          traffic. He tries to address a passer by.

          Excuse me.
          They ignore him. He tries again

          Excuse me, I'm looking for...
          Mr Bennet takes out a piece of paper.

          101 INT. MESS HALL - BARRACKS - NIGHT. 101

          Mr Bennet walks timidly into the mess hall. It is smoky,
          drunken, noisy, boisterous and extremely threatening. Mr
          Bennet stops at the threshold, gulps, then the whole room
          turns round to look at him and a sudden silence descends.
          Mr Bennet is terrified.

                         MR BENNET
           I am...(his voice breaks up - he clears
           his throat) I am looking for a Mr
          â¢ Wickham.

          MRS BENNET (OFF)
          We are ruined. Ruined.

                         ELIZABETH
          How long is this going to go on for?

                         JANE
          Don't be too harsh. This is hard for all
          of us.
          They walk downstairs.

          No Lizzie. Let me once in my life feel

          We're looking through a window to the stairwell of a
          seedy looking boarding house. An anonymas pair of mens
          boots appear climbing up the stairs. We move across the
          exterior wall of the building to find an open window
          through which Lydia and Wickham can be seen.
          Lydia and Wickham sit, snuggled close beside the fire in
          their room in a humble lodging house. They're eating a
          meal with relish. Giggling, Lydia feeds him a mouthful.
          A knock at the door. They freeze, like naughty children.

          Jane grabs it from Mary.

                         JANE

          As it is addressed to me...
          He tears it open and begins to read, squinting because he
          has forgotten his glasses.

          They will be, if father will settle a
          hundred pounds a year on her. That is
          Wickham's condition.

          A hundred pounds!

                         ELIZABETH

          The letter is passed around the other girls.

                         MR BENNET
          Of course I will agree. But how much your
          uncle has laid on this wretched man
          already is anybody's guess.

          Do you think it a large sum?

                         MR BENNET
          Wickham's a fool if he takes her for less
          than ten thousand pounds. I should be
          sorry to think so ill of him in the very -
          beginning of our relationship.

                         JANE
          Ten thousand! Heaven forbid!

          â¢ 107 INT. MR & MRS BENNET'S BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. It
          Close on Mrs Bennet's face as she springs out of bed.
          Pure triumphant joy.

                         MRS BENNET
          Lydia married! And at sixteen too! Ring
          the bell, Kitty! I must put on my things
          and tell Lady Lucas! Oh to see her face!
          And tell the servants they will have a
          bowl of punch!
          The other Bennet's are assembled.

                         ELIZABETH
          We should thank our uncle, Mama.

                         MRS BENNET
          And so he should help! He's much richer
          than us, and he hasn't got any children.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (ANGRILY)
          How can you talk like that?
          Her mother gets to her feet.

                         Â¢

                         MRS BENNET
          A daughter, married!

                         ELIZABETH
          Is that all you think about?

                         MRS BENNET
          "Mrs Wickham" - how well it sounds

                         ELIZABETH

                         (IN DESPERATION)
          You don't know what he's like

                         MRS BENNET
          Now where will they live? Purvis Lodge
          might do. Ashworth is vacant of course,
          but it's too far off, I couldn't bear to
          have her ten miles from me -

                         MR BENNET
          Before you take any of these houses, Mrs
          Bennet, let us be clear. Into one house
          she will never be welcome.
          Mrs Bennet stares at him.

                         9

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

          â¢ 108 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN - DAY. 108

          Lydia's triumphant face. The cat that's got the cream.
          She comes into the house with Wickham. Her mother kisses
          her, effusively. Mr Bennet coldly bows.

                         LYDIA
          - and then we passed Sarah Sims in her
          carriage so I took off my glove and let
          my hand just rest on the window frame, so
          she might see the ring, and then 1 bowed
          and smiled like anything!
          Kitty shrieks with envy. Lizzie moves away; she cannot
          bear it. Wickham catches her eye, but she ignores him.

          109 INT. DINING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 109

          They are taking their seats for dinner. Lydia moves to
          the head of the table.

                         LYDIA
          Jane, I take your place now, and you must
          go lower, for I am the married woman.
          She sits down and giggles at her sisters. The maid brings
          â¢ in the food. Lydia holds up her hand, to display her ring
          to the maid.

                         LYDIA
          You must all go to Brighton, for that is
          the place to get husbands! I hope you
          have half my good luck.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (FURIOUS)
          Lydia!

                         CUT TO:
          Wickham looking uncomfortable. He's talking to the stony-
          faced Mr Bennet.

                         WICKHAM
          I've been enlisted in a regiment in the
          north of England, sir.
          l f G MR BENNET

                         (NODS COLDLY)
          I'm glad to hear of it.

                         WICKHAM
          Near Newcastle. We shall travel there
          next week.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         KITTY
          â¢ Can I come and stay with you?

                         MR BENNET
          That is out. of the question.

                         CUT TO:
          Lydia, rattling on to Lizzie.

                         LYDIA
          Well, Monday morning came and I was in
          such a fuss -

                         ELIZABETH
          I don't want to hear -

                         LYDIA
          - there was my aunt, preaching and
          talking away just as if she was reading a
          sermon, she was horrid unpleasant -

                         ELIZABETH
          Can't you understand why?

                         LYDIA
          - but I didn't hear a word because I was
          thinking of my dear Wickham. I longed to
          â¢ know whether he would be married in his
          blue coat...

                         CUT TO:
          Mary turning to Wickham.

                         MARY
          The north of England, I believe, boasts
          some spectacular scenery...

                         CUT TO:
          Lydia burbling on, to a stony-faced Lizzie.

                         LYDIA
          - and then my uncle was called away from
          the church on business and I thought -
          who is to be our best man if he doesn't
          come back? Lucky he did come back or I
          would have had to ask Mr Darcy -

                         ELIZABETH

                         (STARES)
          Mr Darcy?

                         LYDIA
          (claps her hand to her mouth)
          I forgot! I shouldn't have said a word!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         Â¢ ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy was at your wedding?

                         LYDIA

                         (WHISPERS)
          He was the one that discovered us! He
          knew where to find Wickham, you see.

                         (HISSES)
          But don't tell anyone! He told me not to
          tell!
          Lizzie stares at her. Darcy at her wedding? Lydia turns
          away, to talk to the others.

          110 EXT. GARDEN - LONGBOURN - DAY. 110

          Lydia, croquet mallet in hand, drags her new husband
          across the lawn. Kitty follows.

                         LYDIA
          Come on, Wickham! You've got to play.

                         KITTY
          Yes, come on!
          Wickham looks slightly abashed - a trapped man. What has
          he let himself in for?
          Lizzie comes into the garden, looking for her younger
          sister. Wickham detaches himself and comes over to her. A
          rueful smile.

                         WICKHAM
          I hope we can be even better friends, now
          we're brother and sister.
          An attempt at a twinkling smile, but Elizabeth is now
          immune to his charm. She nods, briefly.

                         WICKHAM
          I hear you visited Pemberley. My dear old
          home.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (NODS)
          I met Mr Darcy's sister.

                         WICKHAM

                         (A BEAT)
          Did you like her?

                         ELIZABETH
          Very much.
          (looks at him)
          We found a great deal to talk about.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          A beat. Wickham looks deeply uneasy. He bows and leaves.
          Lizzie watches him pick up a mallet and take his turn.
          She can't bear it; she hurries up to Lydia and draws her
          aside.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (LOW VOICE)
          Why was Mr Darcy there?

                         LYDIA
          I'm not supposed to tell.
          Lizzie abandons her pride. She takes Lydia's hand.

                         ELIZABETH
          Please, Lydia!

                         LYDIA
          Because he paid for it.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (STARES)
          For what?

                         LYDIA

                         (CARELESSLY)
          The wedding, Wickham's commission.
          Everything.

                         Â¢

                         ELIZABETH
          Everything?

                         KITTY

                         (CALLS)
          Lydia! It's your turn!
          Lydia moves to go.

                         LYDIA
          People kept saying Wickham owed them
          money, it was so tedious. So Darcy
          settled his debts but I don't really like
          him, do you?
          Lizzie pulls her back.

                         ELIZABETH
          But why did he do it?

                         LYDIA

                         (SHRUGS)
          I don't know, do I? Anyway you're not to
          tell because it's supposed to be our
          uncle who paid, and he wouldn't have
          â¢ minded paying, either, because I'm his
          favorite.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          â¢ She leaves. Giggles and shrieks from the croquet lawn.
          Elizabeth looks blank with shock.

          111 EXT. BINGLEY'S HOUSE - MAYFAIR -- DAY. 111

          Close on Darcy's grimly determined face. Drawing back, we
          see that he is walking down a street in Mayfair. He
          arrives at a house, pauses, and rings the bell. The door
          is opened.

                         BUTLER
          Mr Darcy.

                         DARCY
          I have some business with Mr Bingley.
          Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes
          slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor
          window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and
          bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley
          looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We
          witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has
          wronged Jane Bennet.

          112 EXT. LONGBOURN - DAY. 112


                         IS
          Lydia and Wickham are leaving. Mr Bennet stands at a
          distance. Mrs Bennet sobs as Lydia climbs onto the
          carriage.

                         MRS BENNET
          Write to me often, my dear'.
          Wickham takes his leave of Elizabeth.

                         WICKHAM
          Please relay my affections to the Darcy's
          on your next acquaintance. I am sure he
          will be pleased to hear things have
          worked out so well.
          He joins Lydia.

                         LYDIA
          (through the window)
          Married women never have much time for
          writing. My sisters may write to me!
          They'll have nothing else to do.
          The Mrs Bennet and the girls watch as the carriage drives
          away.

                         MRS BENNET

                         Â¢
          Oh there is nothing so bad as parting
          with ones children! One seems so forlorn
          without them.

                         ELIZABETH
          That is the consequence of marrying a
          daughter. It must make you better
          satisfied that your other four are
          single.

          113 EXT. MERYTON VILLAGE - DAY. 113

          Elizabeth and Jane are out shopping with their mother and
          sisters. Their housekeeper, Mrs Hill, comes out of the
          butchers shop.

                         MRS HILL
          Did you hear the news, madam? Mr Bingley
          is returning to Netherfield.
          A stunned silence. Lizzie glances at Jane. She blushes.

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Bingley?
          Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop.

                         MRS HILL
          Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch Of pork,
          for she expects him tomorrow.

                         MRS BENNET
          Tomorrow?

                         (RECOVERING)
          Not that I care about it. Mr Bingley is
          nothing to us and I'm sure I never want
          to see him again.

                         (MOVES AWAY)
          No, we shall not mention a word about it.
          (comes back to Mrs Hill)
          Is it quite certain he is coming?

                         MRS HILL
          Yes, madam. I believe he is alone; his
          sister remains in town.

                         MRS BENNET
          Huh! Come along, girls.
          Their mother goes into the draper's shop. Jane pauses at
          the threshold.

                         Â¢
          It's all right, Lizzie. I'm just glad
          that he comes alone, because then we
          shall see less of him.

                         (BLUSHING)
          Not that I'm afraid of myself, but I
          dread other people's remarks.
          A brave smile. Lizzie, of course, is not convinced in the
          slightest. They go into the shop.

          114 EXT. LONGBOURN -- DAY. 114

          Mr Bingley rides towards Longbourn, a look of slight
          trepidation in his eyes. Darcy now comes into view riding
          along side him. They cross the moat bridge.

          115 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- DAY. 115

          Mary is practising her scales. Jane and Elizabeth are
          sitting at their work, with their mother. Kitty rushes
          in.

                         KITTY
          He is here! He is here, he's at the door!

                         Â¢

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh my goodness! Everybody act naturally.
          Jane completely freezes. Everybody else goes into a
          fluster.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          Whatever you do, do not appear
          overbearing.
          Kitty looks out through a window.

                         KITTY
          Look. There's someone with him. Mr whats
          his name. The pompous one from before.
          Elizabeth looks through the window at Darcy, her heart
          leaps to her mouth.

                         MRS BENNET
          Mr Darcy indeed! The very insolence of
          0 0 it. What does he think of coming here?
          Elizabeth returns to her seat and sits down, heavily. Mrs
          Bennet hurries over to Jane and pinches her cheeks.

                         Â¢ JANE
          Mama!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         MRS BENNET
          â¢ (to Mary - who is still

                         PLAYING)
          Stop that and sit down! Find yourself
          some work! Oh Lord.
          They sit there, frozen, pretending to sew. The drawing
          room door opens and Mrs Hill shows in the two men. They
          bow. Bingley smiles warmly at Jane, who blushes.
          Elizabeth glances at Darcy. His face is strained. Mrs
          Bennet is all smiles for Bingley. She ignores Darcy.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          How very glad we are to see you, Mr
          Bingley! There are a great many changes
          since you went away. Miss Lucas is
          married and settled. And one of my own
          daughters too, you will have seen it in
          the papers though it was not put in as it
          ought to have been. Very short, nothing
          about her family.

                         BINGLEY

                         (SMILES)
          I did hear of it, and offer my
          congratulations.

                         MRS BENNET
          - but it's very hard to have my Lydia
          taken away from me. Mr Wickham has been
          transferred to Newcastle, where ever that
          is. Thank heaven he has some friends.
          Mrs Bennet shoots a frosty glance at Mr Darcy. This is
          more than Elizabeth can bare.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you hope to stay long in the country,
          Mr Bingley?

                         BINGLEY
          Just a few weeks. For the shooting.

                         MRS BENNET
          When you have killed all your own birds,
          Mr Bingley, I beg you will come here and
          shoot as many as you please.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Thank you -

                         MRS BENNET
          - Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to
          oblige you, and will save all the best of
          â¢ the covies for you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107,

                         MR BINGLEY

                         Â¢
          Excellent.

                         ELIZABETH
          Are you well, Mr Darcy?

                         DARCY
          Quite well, thank you.

                         ELIZABETH
          Well, I hope the weather stays fine, for
          your sport.

                         DARCY
          I return to town tomorrow.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (A PAUSE)
          So soon?

                         MRS BENNET
          My Jane looks well, does she not?
          Mr-Bingley stands up abruptly.

                         BINGLEY
          She does indeed. Well, I must be going, I
          suppose. Darcy -
          Darcy cannot quite believe it. He gives Bingley a harsh
          stare, Bingley has not completed his task.

          BINGLEY (CONT`D)
          It was very pleasant to see you all
          again. Elizabeth, Miss Jane..
          Bingley can almost not bear to look Jane in the eye as he
          acknowledges them all very briefly and bolts for the
          door. Mrs Bennet fusses around him.

                         MRS BENNET
          You must come again. For when you were in
          town last winter you promised to take a
          family dinner with us. I have not forgot
          you see. At least three courses.
          Bingley and Darcy take their leave, leaving the Bennets
          sitting in silence all looking at once another. Kitty is
          fit to burst out laughing, Elizabeth and Jane horrified
          by the awkward visit.

          116 EXT. THE LANE - NEAR LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 116

          â¢ Bingley is pacing backwards and forwards in despair
          muttering to himself. Darcy looks at him in extreme
          frustration.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         BINGLEY
          Oh damn, damn, buggery, damn.

                         DARCY
          What were you thinking of?
          It's as if Bingley has not heard. He keeps pacing up and
          down.

                         BINGLEY
          Damn and blast, oh buggery, damn.

          117 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DAY. 117

          The girls are now spread around the room. Jane in.
          despair.

                         JANE
          Well, I'm glad that's over. We can now
          meet as indifferent acquaintances.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (LAUGHING)
          Oh yes? Jane, take care.

                         JANE
          You cannot think me so weak as to be in

                         Â¢
          danger now.

                         ELIZABETH
          I think you are in great danger of making
          him as much in love with you as ever.

                         JANE
          I'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr
          Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (BLURTS OUT)
          Oh Jane, I have acted so stupidly. Had I
          been in love, I could not have been more
          blind!

                         JANE

                         (STARES)
          What do you mean?
          The door bell rings.

                         KITTY
          (at the window)
          It is him. He's back. He's come again.
          â¢ A stunned reaction.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.
          Everyone has regained their decorous positions. They hear

                         Â¢
          Bingley's voice at the door and he comes in very
          awkwardly. He smiles. His face is crimson with
          embarrassment.

                         BINGLEY
          I, erm, I know this is all very
          embarrassing, but I would like to request
          the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane -
          They all look at him.

                         BINGLEY (CONT'D)
          - alone.

                         MRS BENNET
          Girls. Everybody to the kitchen.
          Immediately. Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so
          good to see you again so soon.
          She ushers everyone out, not before squeezing Jane's
          hand. Now Jane and Bingley are alone, facing each other
          with extreme embarrassment.

                         BINGLEY
          Miss Bennet, you have been the victim of
          a huge misunderstanding. Suffice to say,
          I have been an unmitigated and
          comprehensive ass. And therefore, I would
          like to ask you -

                         CUT TO:

          118 INT. HALLWAY - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 118

          Mrs Bennet, Kitty, Mary and Mr Bennet are all jostling
          for a position at the door in order to overhear events
          inside.

                         MARY
          Ssssshhh!
          Elizabeth is apart from her family. She cannot bear to be
          there. She walks down the corridor and out of the house
          into the garden. Through a window she sees Bingley on one
          knee, her eyes fill with tears as she walks away from the
          house.

          - CUT TO:

          119 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 119

          â¢ Bingley looks at Jane, desperately worried. A pause.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         JANE
          â¢ Yes. A hundred times - yes.
          Mrs Bennet and the girls throw open the double doors to
          the drawing room and come crashing in. Bingley and Jane
          beam at them.

                         MRS BENNET
          Thank the Lord for that. I thought it
          would never happen.

          120 EXT. GARDEN -- LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 120

          Elizabeth is sat under a tree crying.

          121 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - OVER LOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 121

          Darcy looks down at Longbourn.

          122 INT. BEDROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 122

          Mr Bennet and Mrs Bennet are in bed.

                         MR BENNET
          I am sure they will do well together,

                         Â¢
          their tempers are much alike. They will
          be cheated assiduously by their servants,
          and be so generous with the rest, they
          will always exceed their income.

                         MRS BENNET
          Exceed their income? He has five thousand
          a year! I knew she could not be so
          beautiful for nothing.
          The camera moves through to another bedroom - where Mary
          is reading a book out loud to Kitty - then to yet another

                         ROOM:

          123 INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT. 123

          Jane and Elizabeth lie in bed.

                         JANE
          He has made me so happy. You know, he. was
          totally ignorant of my being in town last
          spring!

                         ELIZABETH
          How did he account for it?

                         Â¢

                         JANE
          He thought me indifferent!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ELIZABETH
          Unfathomable.

                         JANE
          No doubt poisoned by his pernicious
          sister.

                         ELIZABETH
          Bravo! That is the most unforgiving
          speech you've ever made.

                         JANE
          Oh Lizzie, if I could but see you so
          happy. If there were such another man for
          you!
          There is a noise outside.

                         ELIZABETH
          Perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may
          meet with another Mr Collins in time.
          What is that?
          More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud
          banging on the door downstairs. The girls look at each
          other.

          124 INT. DOWNSTAIRS -- LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 12.4-

          Mr Bennet, Mrs Bennet and the girls lit by only candles
          have gathered. The door bangs again.

                         MARY
          Maybe he's changed his mind.
          Timidly, Mr Bennet opens the door revealing a wide-eyed
          Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Everyone gasps.

                         ELIZABETH
          Lady Catherine!
          Lady Catherine does not acknowledge her, but comes in
          uninvited, inspecting the assembled company of aghast
          Bennets.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          (to Mrs Bennet)
          And these are your daughters, I suppose.

                         MRS BENNET
          All but one, the youngest has been lately
          married your ladyship. And my eldest was
          only proposed to yesterday afternoon.

                         Â¢

                         LADY CATHERINE
          You have a very small garden, madam.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         MRS BENNET
          â¢ I am sure it is nothing compared to
          Rosings, but it is larger than Sir
          William Lucas's, I can assure you.

                         MR BENNET

                         (TENTATIVELY)
          Could I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps?

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Absolutely not! I must speak to Miss
          Elizabeth alone, as a matter of complete
          urgency.
          The Bennets all look at each other", bewildered by this
          strange turn of events.

          125 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - NIGHT. 125

          Elizabeth leads the way into the drawing room - lights an
          oil lamp. Lady Catherine walks in. The door closes behind
          them.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to
          understand why I am`here.
          â¢ Lit only by the oil lamp Lady Catherine resembles a
          flickering ghoul.

                         ELIZABETH
          Indeed you are mistaken. I can not
          account for this honour at all.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Miss Bennet, I warn you, I am not to be
          trifled with. A report of a most alarming
          nature has reached me that you intend to
          be united with my nephew, Mr Darcy.
          Elizabeth stares at her, amazed.

          LADY CATHERINE (CONT'D)
          I know this to be a scandalous falsehood,
          though not wishing to injure him by
          supposing it possible, I instantly set
          off to make my sentiments known.

                         ELIZABETH
          If you believed it impossible, I wonder
          you took the trouble of coming so far.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          To hear it contradicted, Miss Bennet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (COOLLY)
          Your coming here will be rather a
          confirmation, surely, if indeed such a
          report exists.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          If? Do you then pretend to be ignorant of
          it? Has it not been industriously
          circulated by yourself?

                         ELIZABETH
          I have never heard of it.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          And can you declare there is no
          foundation for it?

                         ELIZABETH
          I do not pretend to possess equal
          frankness with your ladyship. You may ask
          the questions, which I may not choose to
          answer.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          This is not to be borne. Has my nephew
          made you an offer of marriage?

                         IS

                         ELIZABETH
          Your Ladyship declared it to be
          impossible.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Let me be understood. Mr Darcy is engaged
          to my daughter. Now what have you to say?

                         ELIZABETH
          Only this - if that is the case you can
          have no reason to suppose he will make an
          offer to me.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          Oh obstinate girl! This union has been
          planned since their infancy. Do you think
          it can be prevented by a young woman of
          inferior birth, of no importance in the
          world and wholly unallied to his family?
          Whose own sister's elopement resulted in
          the scandalously patched-up marriage,
          only achieved at the expense of your
          uncle? Heaven and earth, are the shades
          of Pemberly to be thus polluted? Now tell
          me once and for all, are you engaged to
          him?

                         Â¢

                         ELIZABETH
          I am not.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          And will you promise never to enter into
          such an engagement?

                         ELIZABETH
          I will not. And I certainly never shall.
          Allow me to say, the arguments which you
          have supported this extraordinary
          application have been as frivolous as the
          application was ill-judged. You have,
          insulted me in every possible method and
          can now have nothing further to say. I
          must ask you to leave immediately. Good
          night.
          Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family
          outside.

                         LADY CATHERINE
          I have never been thus treated in my
          entire life.
          Lady Catherine storms past the family and out into the
          night. Elizabeth is standing shaking with the excitement
          of having stood so firmly up for herself.

                         MR BENNET
          Lizzie, what on earth is going on?

                         Â¢

                         ELIZABETH
          Just a small misunderstanding.
          She walks past them to bed.

                         MRS BENNET
          Lizzie!

                         ELIZABETH
          For once in your life. Just leave me
          alone.
          Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction.

          Jane is fast asleep. Elizabeth unable to sleep. She
          quietly climbs out of bed and creeps out of the room.

          127 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN -- THE SAME. 127

          Elizabeth sits alone downstairs, thinking. Outside we see
          dawn is breaking.

          Elizabeth creeps out into the garden and wanders around
          through the early morning mist, as the sun starts to
          rise.

          129 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE OVERLOOKING LONGBOURN - THE SAME. 129

          Elizabeth walks out into the open countryside. The mists
          are starting to evaporate. From out of the mist in the
          distance a figure emerges. Her heart misses a beat. She
          is alone, vulnerable. Then she sees it is Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy!

                         DARCY
          What are you doing out here so early?

                         ELIZABETH
          I could not sleep.

                         DARCY
          Me neither. I have been up.most of the
          night.

                         Â¢
          Elizabeth hardly knows how to react at this unexpected
          meeting. Rather politely she thanks Mr Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your
          unexampled generosity to both my sisters.
          I know what kindnesses you have done for
          poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the
          happy resolution for Jane also.

                         DARCY
          I am alarmed that you know of what I have
          been so in earnest to keep silent. But
          you must know that your happiness was one
          of my prime inducements.
          Elizabeth looks at Darcy.

          DARCY (CONT`D)
          I know you are too generous to trifle
          with me. I believe you spoke with my Aunt
          last night, and it has taught me to hope
          as I had scarcely allowed myself before.
          If your feelings are still what they were
          last April, tell me so at once. My
          affections and wishes are unchanged, but

                         Â¢
          one word from you will silence me
          forever.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          If, however, your feelings have
          changed...
          Elizabeth gazes at him.

                         DARCY (CONT'D)
          I would have to tell you, you have
          bewitched me body and soul and I love and
          love and love you. And never wish to be
          parted from you from this day on.
          Elizabeth looks at him. She does not say a word. Darcy is
          staring at her for a reply. A tear rolls down Elizabeth's
          cheek.

                         ELIZABETH
          I am very happy to inform you that not
          only have my sentiments changed there are
          no other words which could give me
          greater pleasure.
          Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very,
          very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her
          eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the
          kiss becomes passionate.

          130 INT. DRAWING ROOM - LONGBOURN - DUSK. 130

          The place is in an uproar. Bingley, Jane, Mary, Kitty, Mr
          and Mrs Bennet are all gathered, fretting terribly about
          Elizabeth's whereabouts. Through a window we see
          Elizabeth lead Darcy along the duck board plank across
          the moat. Elizabeth enters the house, everybody starts.

                         MRS BENNET
          Lizzie, where have you been. We thought
          something had happened to you.
          Darcy follows Elizabeth in.

          MRS BENNET (CONT'D)
          Mr Darcy! What on earth are you doing
          here?
          Elizabeth takes Mr Darcy's hand.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mr Darcy has come to speak with Papa.
          Everyone is stunned.

          Elizabeth paces outside the door of the library, waiting.
          After a while Darcy emerges, he gives Elizabeth the
          briefest of smiles and leaves the door open. Elizabeth
          walks in. Her father is in a state of shock.

                         MR BENNET
          Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I
          thought you hated the man.

                         ELIZABETH
          No, Papa.

                         MR BENNET
          He is rich, to be sure, and you will have
          more fine carriages than Jane. But will
          that make you happy?

          belief in my indifference?

                         MR BENNET
          None at all. We all know him to be a
          proud, unpleasant sort of fellow, but
          this would be nothing if you really liked
          him.

                         ELIZABETH
          (tears in her eyes)
          I do like him!

                         (WITH PASSION)
          I love him! He's not proud. It's I who's
          been prejudiced, who didn't realize ...
          You don't know him, Papa...if I told you
          what he's really like. What he's done.

          and Darcy. We meet all our characters. Lydia and Wickham
          are missing. Let everyone have an end.
          Darcy and Elizabeth kiss, then Darcy pulls Elizabeth off
          into the shadows. We see them disappear into the park.
          Coming close, we see them in the moonlight. It's Darcy
          and Elizabeth. Deer turn to gaze at them. The music fades
          as they walk further from the house, up the hill, past
          the outcrops of rocks. An owl hoots. Darcy turns to
          Elizabeth and smiles.

          He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the
          rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by
          side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.

          Now be sincere, did you admire me for my
          impertinenc?

          You may as well call it impertinence,
          though make a virtue of it by all means.
          My good qualities are under your
          protection, and you are to exaggerate -
          them as much as possible. And, in return,
          it belongs to me to find occasions for
          teasing and quarrelling with you as often
          as maybe... and I shall begin directly...

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

             Guess what.

tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

                         GRANDFATHER
             I brought you a special present.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

             A book?

             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

             Her favorite pastimes were riding

             him that.

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while
in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at
her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't
as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm boy. Polish my horse's
             saddle. I want to see my face
             shining in it by morning.

                         WESTLEY
                  (quietly, watching her)
             As you wish.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her
as she walks away.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             "As you wish" was all he ever
             said to her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm Boy. Fill these with water --
                  (a beat)
             --please.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he
manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             That day, she was amazed to
             discover that when he was saying,
             "As you wish," what he meant was,
             "I love you."

BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

                  (off-screen)
             And even more amazing was the day
             she realized she truly loved him
             back.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (pointing to a pitcher
                  that she could reach herself)
             Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to
each other gazing into each other's eyes.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

Now he turns, moves outside.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red

                  (reading again)
             Westley had no money for marriage.
             So he packed his few belongings
             and left the farm to seek his
             fortune across the sea.

                  (off-screen reading)
             It was a very emotional time for

                         BUTTERCUP
             I fear I'll never see you again.

                         WESTLEY
             Of course you will.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But what if something happens to
             you?

                         WESTLEY
             Hear this now: I will come for you.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how can you be sure?

                         WESTLEY
             This is true love. You think this
             happens every day?

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly
around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup
watches him go.

                  (off-screen reading)
             Westley didn't reach his
             destination. His ship was attacked
             by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who
             never left captives alive. When
             Buttercup got the news that
             Westley was murdered --

The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople,

             Five years later, the main square

THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if

A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

                         VOICE
             A word, my lady?

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are
not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as
a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a
giant. His name is FEZZIK.

                         VIZZINI
             We are but poor, lost circus
             performers. Is there a village
             nearby?

                         BUTTERCUP
             There is nothing nearby; not for

             Then there will be no one to hear
             you scream-

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,
touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
As she starts to fall --

A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision.

                         INIGO
             What is that you're ripping?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10.


                         VIZZINI
                  (not stopping or turning)
             It's fabric from the uniform of
             an Army officer of Guilder.

                         FEZZIK
             Who's Guilder?

                         VIZZINI
                  (pointing straight out)
             The country across the sea. The
             sworn enemy of Florin.
                  (slaps the horse's rump)
             Go!

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Once the horse reaches the
             castle, the fabric will make the
             Prince suspect the Guilderians
             have abducted his love. When he
             finds her body dead on the
             Guilder frontier, his suspicions
             will be totally confirmed.

                         FEZZIK
             You never said anything about
             killing anyone.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             I've hired you to help me start a
             war. That's a prestigious line of
             work with a long and glorious
             tradition.

                         FEZZIK
             I just don't think it's right,
             killing an innocent girl.

                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on Fezzik)
             Am I going mad or did the word
             "think" escape your lips? You
             were not hired for your brains,
             you hippopotamic land mass.

                         INIGO
             I agree with Fezzik.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11.


CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.

                         VIZZINI
                  (We only thought he
                  was in a fury --now
                  he's really getting mad)
             Oh. The sot has spoken. What
             happens to her is not truly your
             concern -- I will kill her --
                  (louder)
             And remember this -- never forget
             this --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows
on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             -- when I found you, you were so
             slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
             brandy --
                  (now to Fezzik, who
                  retreats as much as he
                  can while Vizzini advances)
             -- and you -- friendless,
             brainless, helpless, hopeless --
             Do you want me to send you back
             to where you were, unemployed in
             Greenland?

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very
distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts
off.

                         INIGO
                  (softly)
             That Vizzini, he can fuss.
                  (a slight emphasis on
                  the last word)


                         FEZZIK
                  (looking at Inigo)
             ... fuss ... fuss ...
                  (Suddenly, he's got it
                  again, emphasis on the
                  last word.)
             I think he likes to scream at us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12.


                         INIGO
             Probably he means no harm.

                         FEZZIK
             He's really very short on charm.

                         INIGO
                  (proudly)
             Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

                         FEZZIK
             Yes, some of the time.
                  (he starts to smile)


                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on them)
             Enough of that.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?

                         FEZZIK
             If there are, we'll all be dead.

                         VIZZINI
             No more rhymes now, I mean it.

                         FEZZIK
             Anybody want a peanut?

As Vizzini screams we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the
princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?
Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.

Inigo nods, glances back.

                         VIZZINI
             Why are you doing that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.


                         INIGO
             Making sure nobody's following us.

                         VIZZINI
             That would be inconceivable.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Despite what you think, you will
             be caught. And when you are, the
             Prince will see you all hanged.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

                         VIZZINI
             Of all the necks on this boat,
             Highness, the one you should be
             worrying about is your own.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

                         VIZZINI
             Stop doing that. We can all
             relax, it's almost over-

                         INIGO
             You're sure nobody's following us?

                         VIZZINI
             As I told you, it would be
             absolutely, totally, and in all
             other ways, inconceivable. No one
             in Guilder knows what we've done.
             And no one in Florin could have
             gotten here so fast. Out of
             curiosity, why do you ask?

                         INIGO
             No reason. It's only, I just
             happened to look behind us, and
             something is there.

                         VIZZINI
             What?

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the
wind whistles. And the waves pound.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14.


And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately
to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.
Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.
Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good
distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the
gap.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI

staring at the other boat.

                         VIZZINI
                  (explaining with as
                  much logic as he can muster)
             Probably some local fisherman out
             for a pleasure cruise at night
             through eel-infested waters.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

and Vizzini screaming.

                         VIZZINI
             Go in, get after her!

                         INIGO
             I don't swim.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to the unasked question)
             I only dog paddle.

                         VIZZINI
             Veer left. Left. Left!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new
is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness? Those are the Shrieking
             Eels -- if you doubt me, just
             wait. They always grow louder
             when they're about to feed on
             human flesh.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
Buttercup stays silent.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             If you swim back now, I promise,
             no harm will come to you. I doubt
             you will get such an offer from
             the Eels.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is
louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,
something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.


-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,
it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made
such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp
down --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
             at this time.

And the second we hear him:

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
             explaining to you because you
             looked nervous.

                         THE KID
             Well, I wasn't nervous.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

                         THE KID
             Well, maybe I was a little bit
             concerned. But that's not the
             same thing.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Because I can stop now if you want.

                         THE KID
             No. You could read a little bit
             more ... if you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.


He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the
book.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (reading)
             "Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness?"

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

We're back in the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Those are the Shrieking Eels.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             We're past that, Grandpa.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             You read it already.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm
             sorry. Beg your pardon.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

treading water.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             All right, all right, let's see.
             Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
             was coming after her. She was
             frightened. The Eel started to
             charge her. And then -

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,
Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to
clamp down as we

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           18.


A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily
lifting Buttercup.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

                         VIZZINI
             Put her down. Just put her down.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pointing behind them.

                         INIGO
             I think he's getting closer.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

                         VIZZINI
             He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
                  (to Buttercup)
             I suppose you think you're brave,
             don't you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (staring deep at him)
             Only compared to some.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black
sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be
flying.

                         INIGO
             Look! He's right on top of us. I
             wonder if he is using the same
             wind we are using.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's too late --
                  (pointing ahead of them)
             -- see?
                  (big)
             The Cliffs of Insanity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.


And once he's said the name--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was
too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

being pursued.

                         VIZZINI
             Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
             that other thing. Move it!
                  (staring back now)
             We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
             strong enough to go up our way --
             he'll have to sail around for
             hours 'til he finds a harbor.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,
economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a
jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope
a freeing swing and

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS

The rope goes all the way to the top.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself
gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20.


And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along
with him as he goes.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity,
watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is
the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and
it's a gasper.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's
already over a third of the way done.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's
impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he
didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over
hand like lightning.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         INIGO
                  (looking down)
             He's climbing the rope. And he's
             gaining on us.

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!

He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21.


THE MAN IN BLACK

roaring up the rope, and

                                            CUT TO:

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         VIZZINI
                  (shrieking)
             Faster!

                         FEZZIK
             I thought I was going faster.

                         VIZZINI
             You were supposed to be this
             colossus. You were this great,
             legendary thing. And yet he gains.

                         FEZZIK
             Well, I'm carrying three people.
             And he's got only himself.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cutting through)
             -- I do not accept excuses.
                  (shaking his head)
             I'm just going to have to find
             myself a new giant, that's all.

                         FEZZIK
                  (hurt)
             Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.

And his arms begin moving much more slowly.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded
up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22.


THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now.

                         VIZZINI
             Did I make it clear that your job
             is at stake?

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT!

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting
for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some
stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and
his pace is as dazzling as before, and

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

cutting through the last of the rope and

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the
Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to Inigo -- impressed)
             He has very good arms.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to
the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

stunned, turning to the others, looking down.

                         VIZZINI
             He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!

                         INIGO
                  (whirling on Vizzini)
             You keep using that word -- I do
             not think it means what you think
             it means.
                  (looks down again)
             My God! He's climbing.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards,
sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

                                            CUT TO:

The group at the top, staring down.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's obviously
             seen us with the Princess, and
             must therefore die.
                  (to Fezzik)
             You, carry her.
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll head straight for the
             Guilder frontier. Catch up when
             he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
             not, the sword.

Inigo nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24.


                         INIGO
             I want to duel him left-handed.

                         VIZZINI
             You know what a hurry we're in.

                         INIGO
             Well, it's the only way I can be
             satisfied. If I use my right --
             tch -- over too quickly.

                         VIZZINI
                  (turns abruptly,
                  starts off-screen)
             Oh, have it your way.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

still creeping his way upward.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

who goes to Inigo.

                         FEZZIK
             You be careful.
                  (gravely)
             -- people in masks cannot be
             trusted.

                         VIZZINI
                  (calling out)
             I'm waiting!

FEZZIK nods, hurries after Vizzini.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the
Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands
loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is
a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for
waiting around.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           25.


THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than
when last we saw him. Inigo is watching.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to
talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but
neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our
two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what
it is.

                         INIGO
                  (hollering down)
             Hello there.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

                         INIGO
             Slow going?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look, I don't mean to be rude,
             but this is not as easy as it
             looks. So I'd appreciate it if
             you wouldn't distract me.

                         INIGO
             Sorry.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again.

                         INIGO
             I do not suppose you could speed
             things up?

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (with some beat)
             If you're in such a hurry, you
             could lower a rope, or a tree
             branch, or find something useful
             to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.


                         INIGO
             I could do that. In fact, I've
             got some rope up here. But I do
             not think that you will accept my
             help, since I am only waiting
             around to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That does put a damper on our
             relationship.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

                         INIGO
             But I promise I will not kill you
             until you reach the top.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That's very comforting. But I'm
             afraid you'll just have to wait.

                         INIGO
             I hate waiting. I could give you
             my word as a Spaniard.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No good. I've known too many
             Spaniards.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his
strength.

                         INIGO
             You don't know any way you'll
             trust me?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Nothing comes to mind.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before.

                         INIGO
             I swear on the soul of my father,
             Domingo Montoya, you will reach
             the top alive.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK.

There is a pause. Then, quietly:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Throw me the rope.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of
the cliff.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and
hurls it over --

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks,
grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then
looks up at Inigo and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily,
and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to
Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (pulling his sword)
             Thank you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28.


                         INIGO
             We'll wait until you're ready.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

                         INIGO
             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have six fingers on your right
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

                         INIGO
             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fondling it-impressed)
             I have never seen its equal.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

                         INIGO
             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           29.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             the six-fingered man did leave me
             alive with the six-fingered
             sword, but he gave me these.

He touches his scars.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             How old were you?

                         INIGO
             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You've done nothing but study
             swordplay?

                         INIGO
             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the
             bills. There's not a lot of money
             in revenge.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (handing back the
                  great sword, starting
                  to rise)
             Well, I certainly hope you find
             him, someday.

                         INIGO
             You are ready, then?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Whether I am or not, you've been
             more than fair.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.


                         INIGO
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (walking away a few
                  paces, unsheathing his sword)
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to die.

                         INIGO
             Begin!

And on that word --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO MEN

finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes
so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In
Black retreating up a rocky incline.

                         INIGO
                  (thrilled)
             You're using Bonetti's defense
             against me, ah?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I thought it fitting, considering
             the rocky terrain --

                         INIGO
             Naturally, you must expect me to
             attack with Capo Ferro.

And he shifts his style now.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (coping as best he can)
             -- naturally --
                  (suddenly shifting again)
             --but I find Thibault cancels out
             Capo Ferro, don't you?

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

                         INIGO
             Unless the enemy has studied his
             Agrippa-

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the
perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and
lands facing his opponent.

                         INIGO
             -- which I have.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,
never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the
battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the
other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that
this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more
that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're
in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"
battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,
the action begins going even faster than before as we

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for
long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,
keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.


                         INIGO
                  (happy as a clam)
             You are wonderful!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you -- I've worked hard to
             become so.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being
forced toward it.

                         INIGO
             I admit it -- you are better than
             I am.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Then why are you smiling?

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

                         INIGO
             Because I know something you
             don't know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that?

                         INIGO
             I am not left-handed.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately, the tide of battle turns.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now
faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he
increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33.


A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a
frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every
thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.
Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're amazing!

                         INIGO
             I ought to be after twenty years.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,
pinned there under the six fingered sword.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (hollering it out)
             There's something I ought to tell
             you.

                         INIGO
             Tell me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am not left-handed either.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully
joined.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And
before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and
scrambles to his sword and we

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.


He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring in awe.

                         INIGO
             Who are you?!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No one of consequence.

                         INIGO
             I must know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Get used to disappointment.

                         INIGO
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,
darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even
than before, and again he slashes but --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,
and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's
feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35.


THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

catching it again. And something terrible is written behind
his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,
tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't
enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling
everything and

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a
moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his
eyes.

                         INIGO
             Kill me quickly.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I would as soon destroy a stained
             glass window as an artist like
             yourself. However, since I can't
             have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo
pitches forward unconscious.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Please understand, I hold you in
             the highest respect.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: VIZZINI

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.


PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying
the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
morning.

                         VIZZINI
             Give her to me.
                  (grabs Buttercup
                  starts off)
             Catch up with us quickly.

                         FEZZIK
                  (starting to panic)
             What do I do?

                         VIZZINI
             Finish him, finish him. Your way.

                         FEZZIK
             Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
             Vizzini.
                  (little pause)
             Which way is my way?

                                            CUT TO:

A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large
boulder nearby.

                         VIZZINI
             Pick up one of those rocks, get
             behind the boulder, and in a few
             minutes, the Man in Black will
             come running around the bend. The
             minute his head is in view, hit
             it with the rock!

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

                         FEZZIK
                  (little frown; softly)
             My way's not very sportsmanlike.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.


THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.
He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly.

                         FEZZIK
             I did that on purpose. I don't
             have to miss.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I believe you -- So what happens
             now?

                         FEZZIK
             We face each other as God intended.
             Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
             weapons, skill against skill alone.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You mean, you'll put down your
             rock and I'll put down my sword,
             and we'll try to kill each other
             like civilized people?

                         FEZZIK
                  (gently)
             I could kill you now.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,
takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Frankly, I think the odds are
             slightly in your favor at hand
             fighting.

                         FEZZIK
             It's not my fault being the
             biggest and the strongest. I
             don't even exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.


He flips the rock away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN

The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But
it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so
much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look are you just fiddling around
             with me or what?

                         FEZZIK
             I just want you to feel you're
             doing well. I hate for people to
             die embarrassed.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,
spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

                         FEZZIK
             You're quick.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And a good thing too.

                         FEZZIK
                  (getting set for
                  another onslaught)
             Why do you wear a mask? Were you
             burned by acid, or something like
             that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Oh no. It's just that they're
             terribly comfortable. I think
             everyone will be wearing them in
             the future.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he
moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves
right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back
and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's
throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one
behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

                         FEZZIK
                  (standing, talking as
                  he does so)
             I just figured out why you give
             me so much trouble.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his arms never leave
                  Fezzik's throat)
             Why is that, do you think?

                         FEZZIK
                  (his voice just
                  beginning to get a
                  little strained)
             Well, I haven't fought just one
             person for so long. I've been
             specializing in groups. Battling
             gangs for local charities, that
             kind of thing.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.


ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH

Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,
but he doesn't, he holds on.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Why should that make such a
             difference?

                         FEZZIK
             Well ...
                  (And now his voice is
                  definitely growing weaker)
             ... you see, you use different
             moves when you're fighting half a
             dozen people than when you only
             have to be worried about one.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

and there isn't much breath coming.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,
but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there
for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In
Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But
there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's
heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I don't envy you the headache you
             will have when you awake. But, in
             the meantime, rest well ... and
             dream of large women.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed
WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and
maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,
maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             There was a mighty duel -- it
             ranged all over. They were both
             masters.

                         RUGEN
             Who won? How did it end?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (looking down in the
                  position where Inigo
                  fell unconscious)
             The loser ran off alone.
                  (points in the
                  direction Vizzini and
                  FEZZIK took)
             The winner followed those
             footprints toward Guilder!

                         RUGEN
             Shall we track them both?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             The loser is nothing. -- Only the
             Princess matters --
                  (to the armed warriors)
             -- clearly this was all planned
             by warriors of Guilder. We must
             be ready for whatever lies ahead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.


                         RUGEN
             Could this be a trap?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (vaulting onto his horse)
             I always think everything could
             be a trap -- Which is why I'm
             still alive.

And he gallops off --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

cresting the peak of the mountain.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's
throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and
between them, a small leather wine container. And some
cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely
spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,
slows. The two men study each other. Then --

                         VIZZINI
             So, it is down to you. And it is
             down to me.

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

                         VIZZINI
             If you wish her dead, by all
             means keep moving forward.

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's
unprotected throat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Let me explain-

                         VIZZINI
             -- there's nothing to explain.
             You're trying to kidnap what I've
             rightfully stolen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Perhaps an arrangement can be
             reached.

                         VIZZINI
             There will be no arrangement --
                  (deliberate)
             -- and you're killing her!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP'S THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against
the pain.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stopping fast.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             But if there can be no
             arrangement, then we are at an
             impasse.

                         VIZZINI
             I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
             with you physically. And you're
             no match for my brains.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're that smart?

                         VIZZINI
             Let me put it this way: have you
             ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
             Socrates?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Yes.

                         VIZZINI
             Morons.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Really? In that case, I challenge
             you to a battle of wits.

                         VIZZINI
             For the Princess?

The Man In Black nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.


                         VIZZINI
             To the death?

Another nod.

                         VIZZINI
             I accept.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Good. Then pour the wine.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing
it to Vizzini.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Inhale this, but do not touch.

                         VIZZINI
                  (doing it)
             I smell nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (taking the packet back)
             What you do not smell is called
             iocane powder. It is odorless,
             tasteless, dissolves instantly in
             liquid, and is among the more
             deadlier poisons known to man.

                         VIZZINI
             Hmm.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,
turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces
Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other
in front of himself.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             All right: where is the poison?
             The battle of wits has begun. It
             ends when you decide and we both
             drink, and find out who is right
             and who is dead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.


                         VIZZINI
             But it's so simple. All I have to
             do is divine from what I know of
             you. Are you the sort of man who
             would put the poison into his own
             goblet, or his enemy's?

He studies the Man In Black now.

                         VIZZINI
             Now, a clever man would put the
             poison into his own goblet,
             because he would know that only a
             great fool would reach for what
             he was given. I'm not a great
             fool, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of you. But you
             must have known I was not a great
             fool; you would have counted on
             it, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (And now there's a
                  trace of nervousness beginning)
             You've made your decision then7

                         VIZZINI
             Not remotely. Because iocane
             comes from Australia, as everyone
             knows. And Australia is entirely
             peopled with criminals. And
             criminals are used to having
             people not trust them, as you are
             not trusted by me. So I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Truly, you have a dizzying
             intellect.

                         VIZZINI
             Wait till I get going! Where was I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Australia.

                         VIZZINI
             Yes -- Australia, and you must
             have suspected I would have known
             the powder's origin, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.


                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (very nervous)
             You're just stalling now.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cackling)
             You'd like to think that, wouldn't
             you?
                  (stares at the Man in Black)
             You've beaten my giant, which
             means you're exceptionally strong.
             So, you could have put the poison
             in your own goblet, trusting on
             your strength to save you. So I
             can clearly not choose the wine
             in front of you. But, you've also
             bested my Spaniard which means
             you must have studied. And in
             studying, you must have learned
             that man is mortal so you would
             have put the poison as far from
             yourself as possible, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man
In Black's has been fast disappearing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're trying to trick me into
             giving away something -- it won't
             work --

                         VIZZINI
                  (triumphant)
             It has worked -- you've given
             everything away -- I know where
             the poison is.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fool's courage)
             Then make your choice.

                         VIZZINI
             I will. And I choose --

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In
Black.

                         VIZZINI
             -- what in the world can that be?

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47.


THE MAN IN BLACK

turning around, looking.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What? Where? I don't see anything.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his
head turned.

                         VIZZINI
             Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
             saw something. No matter.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to
laugh.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What's so funny?

                         VIZZINI
             I'll tell you in a minute. First,
             let's drink -- me from my glass,
             and you from yours.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini
hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows
his wine.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You guessed wrong.

                         VIZZINI
                  (roaring with laughter)
             You only think I guessed wrong --
                  (louder now)
             -- that's what's so funny! I
             switched glasses when your back
             was turned. You fool.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

There's nothing he can say. He just sits there.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           48.


VIZZINI

watching him.

                         VIZZINI
             You fell victim to one of the
             classic blunders. The most famous
             is "Never get involved in a land
             war in Asia." But only slightly
             less well known is this: "Never
             go in against a Sicilian when
             death is on the line."

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings
off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Who are you?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am no one to be trifled with,
             that is all you ever need know.

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled
terrain.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (a final glance back
                  toward Vizzini)
             To think -- all that time it was
             your cup that was poisoned.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             They were both poisoned. I spent
             the last few years building up an
             immunity to iocane powder.

And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him.

                                            CUT TO:

A MOUNTAIN PATH

It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK
TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of
misplaced sand. The others wait behind him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Someone has beaten a giant!
                  (roaring)
             There will be great suffering in
             Guilder if she dies.

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off.

                                            CUT TO:

A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging
Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her
along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go
of her.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his voice harsh now,
                  carrying the promise
                  of violence)
             Catch your breath.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If you'll release me ... whatever
             you ask for ransom ... you'll get
             it, I promise you...

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that worth, the
             promise of a woman? You're very
             funny, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I was giving you a chance. No
             matter where you take me ...
             there's no greater hunter than
             Prince Humperdinck. He could
             track a falcon on a cloudy day.
             He can find you

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You think your dearest love will
             save you?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.


                         BUTTERCUP
             I never said he was my dearest
             love. And yes, he will save me.
             That I know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You admit to me you do not love
             your fiance?

                         BUTTERCUP
             He knows I do not love him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             "Are not capable of love" is what
             you mean.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I have loved more deeply than a
             killer like yourself could ever
             dream.

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches,
but does not retreat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That was a warning, Highness. The
             next time, my hand flies on its
             own. For where I come from, there
             are penalties when a woman lies.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI'S BODY

The picnic is spread as before.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body
as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
                  (gestures to the trail ahead)
             And there are the Princess's
             footprints. She is alive ... or
             was, an hour ago. If she is
             otherwise when I find her, I
             shall be very put out.

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           51.


BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In
Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine
floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Rest, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (stares at him)
             I know who you are -- your
             cruelty reveals everything.

The Man In Black says nothing.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You're the Dread Pirate Roberts;
             admit it.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (bowing)
             With pride. What can I do for you?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die slowly cut into a
             thousand pieces.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Hardly complimentary, Your
             Highness. Why loose your venom on
             me?

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You killed my love.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             It's possible; I kill a lot of
             people. Who was this love of
             yours? Another Prince, like this
             one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52.


                         BUTTERCUP
             No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and
             perfect, with eyes like the sea
             after a storm.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be
tears.

                         BUTTERCUP
             On the high seas, your ship
             attacked, and the Dread Pirate
             Roberts never takes prisoners.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (explaining as a
                  teacher might)
             I can't afford to make exceptions.
             Once word leaks out that a pirate
             has gone soft, people begin to
             disobey you, and then it's
             nothing but work, work, work, all
             the time.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mock my pain!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Life is pain, Highness. Anyone
             who says differently is selling
             something. I remember this farm
             boy of yours, I think. This would
             be, what, five years ago?

Buttercup nods.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Does it bother you to hear?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Nothing you can say will upset me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             He died well, that should please
             you. No bribe attempts or
             blubbering. He simply said,
             "Please. Please, I need to live."
             It was the "please" that caught
             my memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.


                         MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
             I asked him what was so important
             for him. "True love," he replied.
             And then he spoke of a girl of
             surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
             I can only assume he meant you.
             You should bless me for destroying
             him before he found out what you
             really are.

                         BUTTERCUP
             And what am I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
             Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
             tell me truly. When you found out
             he was gone, did you get engaged
             to your prince that same hour, or
             did you wait a whole week out of
             respect for the dead?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mocked me once, never do it
             again -- I died that day!

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly,

                                            CUT TO:

HIS P.O.V.:

The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up
into the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high,
she pushes him with all the strength she has.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die too, for all I care!!

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins
to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           54.


Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far
below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

                         MAN IN BLACK
             ... as ... you ... wish...

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
             done?

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,
she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is
falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DUST CLOUD

rising.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot
where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.
The Prince shakes his head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Disappeared. He must have seen us
             closing in, which might account
             for his panicking in error.
             Unless I'm wrong, and I am never
             wrong, they are headed dead into
             the fire swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           55.


THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of
course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After
a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

                         WESTLEY
             Can you move at all?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (weakly stretching out
                  an arm toward him)
             Move? You're alive. If you want,
             I can fly.

                         WESTLEY
             I told you, "I would always come
             for you." Why didn't you wait for
             me?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well ... you were dead.

                         WESTLEY
             Death cannot stop true love. All
             it can do is delay it for a while.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I will never doubt again.

                         WESTLEY
             There will never be a need.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and
loving and gentle and --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             Oh no. No, please.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

                         GRANDFATHER
             What is it? What's the matter?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.


                         THE KID
             They're kissing again, do we have
             to hear the kissing part?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Someday, you may not mind so much.

                         THE KID
             Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
             sounded good.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.
                  (he picks up the book again)
             So now, where were we here? Yeah,
             yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley
             and Buttercup raced along the
             ravine floor.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND HIS MEN

perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and
Buttercup.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

                         WESTLEY
             Ha. Your pig fiance is too late.
             A few more steps and we'll be
             safe in the Fire Swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like
nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never survive.

                         WESTLEY
             Nonsense -- you're only saying
             that because no one ever has.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.


As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,
defeated.

                                            CUT TO:

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,
sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great
trees block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but
he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

                         WESTLEY
             It's not that bad. I'm not saying
             I'd like to build a summer home
             here, but the trees are actually
             quite lovely.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight
popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the
lower half of her is and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming
hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This
isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

                         WESTLEY
             Well now, that was an adventure.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

                         WESTLEY
             Singed a bit, were you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (She wasn't and she
                  shakes her head "no")
             You?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.


He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her
feet --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SWAMP FLOOR

-- and as there's another popping sound,

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, one thing I will say. The
             Fire Swamp certainly does keep
             you on your toes.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently
leads her forward as we-

THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle.

                         WESTLEY
                  (happily)
             This will all soon be but a happy
             memory because Roberts' ship
             "Revenge" is anchored at the far
             end. And I, as you know, am
             Roberts.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how is that possible, since
             he's been marauding twenty years
             and you only left me five years
             ago?

                         WESTLEY
             I myself am often surprised at
             life's little quirks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.


There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves
her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking
without missing a beat.

                         WESTLEY
             You see, what I told you before
             about saying "please" was true.
             It intrigued Roberts, as did my
             descriptions of your beauty.

                                            CUT TO:

SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his
sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as
they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

                         WESTLEY
             Finally, Roberts decided something.
             He said, "All right, Westley,
             I've never had a valet. You can
             try it for tonight. I'll most
             likely kill you in the morning."
             Three years he said that. "Good
             night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
             well. I'll most likely kill you
             in the morning." It was a fine
             time for me. I was learning to
             fence, to fight, anything anyone
             would teach me. And Roberts and I
             eventually became friends. And
             then it happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What? -- go on --

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
             he wanted to retire. So he took
             me to his cabin and told me his
             secret. "I am not the Dread
             Pirate Roberts," he said. "My
             name is Ryan. I inherited this
             ship from the previous Dread
             Pirate Roberts, just as you will
             inherit it from me. The man I
             inherited it from was not the
             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             His name was Cummerbund. The real
             Roberts has been retired fifteen
             years and living like a king in
             Patagonia." Then he explained the
             name was the important thing for
             inspiring the necessary fear. You
             see, no one would surrender to
             the Dread Pirate Westley.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

                         WESTLEY
             So we sailed ashore, took on an
             entirely new crew and he stayed
             aboard for awhile as first mate,
             all the time calling me Roberts.
             Once the crew believed, he left
             the ship and I have been Roberts
             ever since. Except, now that
             we're together, I shall retire
             and hand the name over to someone
             else. Is everything clear to you?

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is
gone as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still
connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,
and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,
but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning
sand, lovely and lethal.

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is
suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into
view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs
around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.


THE LIGHTNING SAND

as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes
out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,
her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but
you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

high above them; it watches --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning
sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.
Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never succeed -- we may as
             well die here.

                         WESTLEY
             No. No. We have already succeeded.

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The
have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62.


                         WESTLEY
             I mean, what are the three
             terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
             the flame spurts. No problem.
             There's a popping sound preceding
             each, we can avoid that. Two, the
             Lightning Sand. But you were
             clever enough to discover what
             that looks like, so in the future
             we can avoid that too.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

                         WESTLEY
             Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
             think they exist...

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from
offscreen.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend
it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He
howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the
R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just
when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly
rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,
changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley!

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing
only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small
branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the
thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.


WESTLEY

jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,
sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He
tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound --

                                            CUT TO:

A FLAME SPURT

shooting skyward and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts
into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is
trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,
exhausted. The danger has passed.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

relieved.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP

Beyond, a beach.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (almost in disbelief)
             We did it.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, was that so terrible?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.


And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED:

Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS,
armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup
and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to
leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.
Westley looks worse.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Surrender!

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others.

                         WESTLEY
             You mean you wish to surrender to
             me? Very well, I accept.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I give you full marks for
             bravery --don't make yourself a
             fool.

                         WESTLEY
             Ah, but how will you capture us?
             We know the secrets of the Fire
             Swamp. We can live there quite
             happily for some time. So,
             whenever you feel like dying,
             feel free to visit.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I tell you once again -- surrender!

                         WESTLEY
             It will not happen!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other; then something else catches
her eye and we --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65.


AN ARMED WARRIOR

in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking the other way --

                                            CUT TO:

ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (roaring)
             For the last time -- SURRENDER!

                         WESTLEY
                  (roaring right back, bigger)
             DEATH FIRST!!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

frantically staring around, and now

                                            CUT TO:

A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a
tree blocking any escape Westley might try.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Will you promise not to hurt him?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

whirling to face her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

whirling to face her.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           66.


                         WESTLEY
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

talking to them both.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If we surrender, and I return
             with you, will you promise not to
             hurt this man?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             May I live a thousand years and
             never hunt again.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (looks at Westley)
             He is a sailor on the pirate ship
             "Revenge." Promise to return him
             to his ship.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

staring deep into each other's eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whispering)
             Once we're out of sight, take him
             back to Florin and throw him in
             the Pit of Despair.

                         RUGEN
                  (almost a smile)
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
             I thought you were dead once, and
             it almost destroyed me. I could
             not bear it if you died again,
             not when I could save you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67.


Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off
her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring
Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it
in his hand.

                         RUGEN
             Come, sir. We must get you to
             your ship.

                         WESTLEY
             We are men of action. Lies do not
             become us.

                         RUGEN
             Well spoken, sir --

Westley is looking at him.

                         RUGEN
             -- what is it?

                         WESTLEY
             You have six fingers on your
             right hand -- someone was looking
             for you --

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black.

FADE IN ON:

THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering
torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the
cage, chained and helpless.

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of
food and medication. He puts it down.

                         WESTLEY
             Where am I?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68.


                         ALBINO
                  (he only whispers)
             The Pit of Despair.

He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces.

                  (garbled)
             Don't even think --
                  (A hack, sputter,
                  cough - now his voice
                  seems normal again)
             -- don't even think about trying
             to escape. The chains are far too
             thick. And don't dream of being
             rescued either. The only way in
             is secret. And only the Prince,
             the Count, and I know how to get
             in and out.

                         WESTLEY
             Then I'm here till I die?

                         ALBINO
                  (working away)
             Till they kill you. Yeah.

                         WESTLEY
             Then why bother curing me?

                         ALBINO
             The Prince and the Count always
             insist on everyone being healthy
             before they're broken.

                         WESTLEY
             So it's to be torture.

The albino nods.

                         WESTLEY
             I can cope with torture.

The albino shakes his head.

                         WESTLEY
             You don't believe me?

                         ALBINO
             You survived the Fire Swamp. You
             must be very brave...
                  (little pause)
             ... but nobody withstands The
             Machine.

He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad.

BUTTERCUP

and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a
corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an
intersecting corridor:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her.

             She's been like that ever since
             the Fire Swamp.
                  (looks at Rugen)
             It's my father's failing health
             that's upsetting her.

                  (unbelieving)
             Of course.

             The King died that very night,
             and before the following dawn,
             Buttercup and Humperdinck were
             married.

And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how
many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen
and the Queen stand high on the balcony.

             again. This time as their Queen.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were...

                  (off-screen)
             -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

And the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence.

THE KID'S ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly
stronger than when we first saw him.

                         THE KID
             You read that wrong. She doesn't
             marry Humperdinck, she marries
             Westley. I'm just sure of it.
             After all that Westley did for
             her, if she does not marry him,
             it wouldn't be fair.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Well, who says life is fair?
             Where is that written? Life isn't
             always fair.

                         THE KID
             I'm telling you you're messing up
             the story, now get it right!

                         GRANDFATHER
             Do you want me to go on with this?

                         THE KID
             Yes.

                         GRANDFATHER
             All right, then. No more
             interruptions.
                  (starts to read again)
             ... at noon, she met her subjects

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were
             "love her as I loved her, and
             there will be joy." I present to
             you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.

And on his words--

THE CROWD

and it's gigantic.

THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent
KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.

THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT
WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every
step of the way.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why do you do this?

                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Because you had love in your
             hands, and you gave it up.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (distraught)
             But they would have killed
             Westley if I hadn't done it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72.


                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Your true love lives and you
             marry another --
                  (to the crowd)
             -- True love saved her in the
             Fire Swamp, and she treated it
             like garbage. And that's what she
             is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow
             down to her if you want. Bow to
             her. Bow to the Queen of Slime,
             the Queen of Filth, the Queen of
             Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish!
             Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!

She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.

CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at
Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's
throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was
when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and
suddenly,

she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.

             It was ten days till the wedding.
             The King still lived, but
             Buttercup's nightmares were
             growing steadily worse.

                         BUTTERCUP
             It comes to this: I love Westley.
             I always have. I know now I
             always will. If you tell me I
             must marry you in ten days,
             please believe I will be dead by
             morning.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I could never cause you grief;
             consider our wedding off.
                  (to Rugen)
             You returned this Westley to his
             ship?

                         RUGEN
             Yes.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Then we will simply alert him.
                  (to Buttercup now)
             Beloved, are you certain he still
             wants you? After all, it was you
             who did the leaving in the Fire
             Swamp. Not to mention that
             pirates are not known to be men
             of their words.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will always come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I suggest a deal. You write four
             copies of a letter. I'll send my
             four fastest ships. One in each
             direction. The Dread Pirate
             Roberts is always close to Florin
             this time of year. We'll run up
             the white flag and deliver your
             message. If Westley wants you,
             bless you both. If not ... please
             consider me as an alternative to
             suicide. Are we agreed?

And she nods --

A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are
extraordinarily heavily knotted.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.

                         RUGEN
             Your Princess is really a winning
             creature. A trifle simple,
             perhaps, but her appeal is
             undeniable.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Oh, I know. The people are quite
             taken with her. It's odd, but
             when I hired Vizzini to have her
             murdered on our engagement day, I
             thought that was clever. But it's
             going to be so much more moving
             when I strangle her on our
             wedding night. Once Guilder is
             blamed, the nation will be truly
             outraged. They'll demand we go to
             war.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

                         RUGEN
             Now, where is that secret knot?
             It's impossible to find.

                  the tree he hits it,
                  and it opens, revealing
                  a staircase leading underground.)
             Are you coming down into the Pit?
             Westley's got his strength back.
             I am starting him on The Machine
             tonight.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Tyrone, you know how much I love
             watching you work. But, I've got
             my country's five hundredth
             anniversary to plan, my wedding
             to arrange, My wife to murder,
             and Guilder to frame for it. I'm
             swamped.

             Get some rest -- if you haven't
             got your health, you haven't got
             anything.

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides
back perfectly into place.

AN ENORMOUS THING

We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow
it is unsettling.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing --
Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there.

                         RUGEN
             Beautiful, isn't it?

The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley.

                         RUGEN
             It took me half a lifetime to
             invent it. I'm sure you've
             discovered my deep and abiding
             interest in pain. At present I'm
             writing the definitive work on
             the subject. So I want you to be
             totally honest with me on how The
             Machine makes you feel.

with numbers ranging from a low of "1" to a high of "50."
Rugen goes to it.

             This being our first try, I'll
             use the lowest setting.

And he turns the dial to "1".

WESTLEY

He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his
heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of
himself

the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the

chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it
almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes

we finally

pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides.
Rugen opens the book to a blank page.

             As you know, the concept of the
             suction pump is centuries old.
             Well, really, that's all this is.
             Except that instead of sucking
             water, I'm sucking life. I've
             just sucked one year of your life
             away. I might one day go as high
             as five, but I really don't know
             what that would do to you. So,
             let's just start with what we
             have. What did this do to you?
             Tell me. And remember, this is
             for posterity, so be honest --
             how do you feel?

in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries.

Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.

             Sire.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             As Chief Enforcer of all Florin,
             I trust you with this secret:
             killers from Guilder are
             infiltrating the Thieves' Forest
             and plan to murder my bride on
             our wedding night.

                         YELLIN
             My spy network has heard no such
             news.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Any word from Westley?

THE PRINCE AND YELLIN

turning to her in the doorway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Too soon, my angel. Patience.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He will come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Of course.

As she glides out--

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She will not be murdered. On the
             day of the wedding, I want the
             Thieves' Forest emptied and every
             inhabitant arrested.

                         YELLIN
             Many of the thieves will resist.
             My regular enforcers will be
             inadequate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Form a Brute Squad then. I want
             the Thieves' Forest emptied
             before I wed.

                         YELLIN
             It won't be easy, Sire.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (alone, exhausted)
             Try ruling the world sometime.

THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The day of the wedding arrived.
             The Brute Squad had their hands
             full carrying out Humperdinck's
             orders.

                         YELLIN
                  (to an unpleasantlooking
                  assistant)
             Is everybody out?

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
             us some trouble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79.


                         YELLIN
             Well, you give him some trouble.
             Move!

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of
brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He
looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry.

                         INIGO
             I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
             You told me to go back to the
             beginning. So I have. This is
             where I am, and this is where
             I'll stay. I will not be moved.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Ho there.

                         INIGO
             I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
             there."

He waves his sword dangerously.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             But the Prince gave orders --

                         INIGO
             -- So did Vizzini -- when a job
             went wrong, you went back to the
             beginning. And this is where we
             got the job. So it's the
             beginning, and I'm staying till
             Vizzini comes.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
                  (gesturing off-screen)
             You! Brute! Come here.

                         INIGO
             -- I -- am -- waiting -- for --
             Vizzini --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           80.


                         VOICE
                  (off-screen)
             You surely are a meanie.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it
to his own smaller hand.

                         FEZZIK
             Hello.

                         INIGO
             It's you.

                         FEZZIK
             True!

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's
brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

                         FEZZIK
             You don't look so good.
                  (after Inigo blasts
                  air in protest)
             You don't smell so good either.

                         INIGO
             Perhaps not. I feel fine.

                         FEZZIK
             Yeah?

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and
as he does,

                                            CUT TO:

AN EMPTY ALEHOUSE IN THE THIEVES' QUARTER

Inigo sits slumped in a chair, while FEZZIK spoons him some
stew.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
             And as FEZZIK nursed his
             inebriated friend back to health,
             he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
             and the existence of Count Rugen,
             the sixfingered man. Considering
             Inigo's lifelong search, he
             handled the news surprisingly well.

And he faints again into his stew.

                                            CUT TO:

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly
of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head
into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,
pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a
short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then
back in the hot --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Fezzik took great care in reviving
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
                  (up and going)
             That's enough. That's enough!
             Where is this Rugen so I may kill
             him?

                         FEZZIK
             He's with the Prince in the
             Castle. But the castle gate is
             guarded by thirty men.

                         INIGO
             How many could you handle?

                         FEZZIK
             I don't think more than ten.

                         INIGO
                  (doing the math on his fingers)
             That leaves twenty for me. At my
             best, I could never defeat that
             many.
                  (he sinks sadly down)
             I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
             gift for strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.


                         FEZZIK
             But Vizzini's dead.

                                            CUT TO:

Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo.

                         INIGO
             No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
             Man in Black --

                         FEZZIK
             -- what? --

                         INIGO
             -- look, he bested you with
             strength, your greatness. He
             bested me with steel. He must
             have outthought Vizzini, and a
             man who can do that can plan my
             castle's onslaught any day. Let's
             go --

                         FEZZIK
             -- where?

                         INIGO
             To find the Man in Black,
             obviously.

                         FEZZIK
             But you don't know where he is.

                         INIGO
                  (he is possessed by
                  demons now)
             Don't bother me with trifles;
             after twenty years, at last, my
             father's soul will be at peace.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK'S CHAMBERS

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (sharpening his dagger)
             Rise and report.

                         YELLIN
             The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
             Thirty men guard the castle gate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Double it. My Princess must be
             safe.

                         YELLIN
             The gate has but one key, and I
             carry that.

He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck.
Just at that moment, Buttercup enters.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we
             marry. Tomorrow morning, your men
             will escort us to Florin Channel
             where every ship in my armada
             waits to accompany us on our
             honeymoon.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but your four fastest,
             you mean.

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but the four you sent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally,
             not those four.

                         YELLIN
                  (bows, exits)

                         BUTTERCUP
             You never sent the ships. Don't
             bother lying. It doesn't matter.
             Westley will come for me anyway.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (sharply)
             You're a silly girl.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Yes, I am a silly girl, for not
             having seen sooner that you were
             nothing but a coward with a heart

             Westley and I are joined by the
             bonds of love. And you cannot
             track that. Not with a thousand
             bloodhounds. And you cannot break
             it. Not with a thousand swords.
             And when I say you are a coward,
             that is only because you are the
             slimiest weakling ever to crawl
             the earth.

but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his
book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the
steps, raging.

                  (at Westley)
             You truly love each other, and so
             you might have been truly happy.
             Not one couple in a century has
             that chance, no matter what the
             storybooks say. And so I think no
             man in a century will suffer as
             greatly as you will.

And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace,
which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through.

                         INIGO
                  (instantly)


FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of
ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen
slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.

                         FEZZIK
             The Man in Black?

                         INIGO
             His true love is marrying another
             tonight, so who else has cause
             for Ultimate Suffering?
                  (trying to push through)
             Excuse me --

It's too crowded.

                         INIGO
             -- pardon me, it's important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87.


                         INIGO
             -- Fezzik, please --

                         FEZZIK
                  (gigantic and roaring)
             Everybody ... MOVE!!

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND.

                         INIGO
             Thank you.

                                            CUT TO:

A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes
at his chest.

                         INIGO
             Where is the Man in Black?

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

                         INIGO
             You get there from this grove, yes?

Silence.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, jog his memory.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops
without a sound.

                         FEZZIK
                  (upset)
             I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
             to jog him so hard. Inigo?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes
closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his
voice low and strange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.


                         INIGO
             Father, I have failed you for
             twenty years. Now our misery can
             end. Somewhere ... somewhere
             close by is a man who can help us.
             I cannot find him alone. I need
             you. I need you to guide my sword.
             Please.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

                         INIGO
             Guide my sword.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword
held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SECRET KNOT

that reveals the staircase.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the
Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a
knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides
away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other, then start down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a
heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89.


                         FEZZIK
             He's dead.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
                  (barely able to speak)
             It just is not fair.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet
seen him.

                         THE KID
             -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean,
             "He's dead?" I mean he didn't
             mean dead.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

                         THE KID
             Westley's only faking, right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             You want me to read this or not?

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID: CLOSE UP

                         THE KID
             Who gets Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
             I don't understand.

                         THE KID
             Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At
             the end, somebody's got to do it.
             Is it Inigo? Who?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.


                         THE KID
             You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
             What did you read me this thing
             for?

And he desperately fights for control.

                         GRANDFATHER
             You know, you've been very sick
             and you're taking this story very
             seriously. I think we better stop
             now.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

                         THE KID
                  (shaking his head)
             No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
                  (gestures toward the chair)
             -- sit down. All right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.
                  (sitting and opening
                  the book again)
             All right, now, let's see. Where
             were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
             Despair.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, IN DESPAIR

We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a
moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
             Well, we Montoyas have never
             taken defeat easily. Come along,
             Fezzik. Bring the body.

                         FEZZIK
             The body?

                         INIGO
                  (not stopping)
             Have you any money?

                         FEZZIK
             I have a little.

                         INIGO
             I just hope it's enough to buy a
             miracle, that's all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.


As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

                                            CUT TO:

A HOVEL - DUSK

Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From
inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel
Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

                         LITTLE OLD GUY
                  (off-screen)
             Go away!

Inigo pounds again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening a small
                  window in the door)
             What? What?

                         INIGO
             Are you the Miracle Max who
             worked for the King all those
             years?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             The King's stinking son fired me.
             And thank you so much for bringing
             up such a painful subject. While
             you're at it, why don't you give
             me a nice paper cut and pour
             lemon juice on it? We're closed!

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening the window)
             Beat it or I'll call the Brute
             Squad.

                         FEZZIK
             I'm on the Brute Squad.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (looking at the Giant)
             You are the Brute Squad.

                         INIGO
             We need a miracle. It's very
             important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.


                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look, I'm retired. And besides,
             why would you want someone the
             King's stinking son fired? I
             might kill whoever you wanted me
             to miracle.

                         INIGO
             He's already dead.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (for the first time, interested)
             He is, eh? I'll take a look.
             Bring him in.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting
to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench
by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop
limp.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             I've seen worse.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

                         INIGO
             Sir. Sir.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Hah?

                         INIGO
             We're really in a terrible rush.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (He takes nothing from nobody)
             Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a
             miracle man, you get rotten
             miracles. You got money?

                         INIGO
             Sixty-five.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sheesh! I never worked for so
             little, except once, and that was
             a very noble cause.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.


                         INIGO
             This is noble, sir.
                  (pointing to Westley, remorseful)
             His wife is crippled. His children
             are on the brink of starvation.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Are you a rotten liar.

                         INIGO
             I need him to help avenge my
             father, murdered these twenty
             years.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Your first story was better.
                  (looking around)
             Where's that bellows?
                  (spots it)
             He probably owes you money, huh?
             Well, I'll ask him.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

                         INIGO
                  (stupefied)
             He's dead. He can't talk.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look who knows so much. Well, it
             just so happens that your friend
             here is only mostly dead. There's
             a big difference between mostly
             dead and all dead. Please open
             his mouth.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and
starts to pump.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Now, mostly dead is slightly
             alive. Now, all dead...well, with
             all dead, there's usually only
             one thing that you can do.

                         INIGO
             What's that?

He stops pumping.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Go through his clothes and look
             for loose change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94.


He starts pumping again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Westley)
             Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
             so important? What you got here
             that's worth living for?

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

                         WESTLEY
             ... tr ... oooo .... luv...

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

                         INIGO
             True love. You heard him. You
             could not ask for a more noble
             cause than that.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sonny, true love is the greatest
             thing in the world. Except for a
             nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
             tomato sandwich, where the mutton
             is nice and lean and the tomato
             is ripe. They're so perky, I love
             that. But that's not what he said.
             He distinctly said "to blave."
             And, as we all know, "to blave"
             means "to bluff." So you're
             probably playing cards, and he
             cheated

                         A WOMAN'S VOICE
             -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR --

VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and
toward

                         MIRACLE MAX
             -- get back, witch --

                         VALERIE
             I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.
             But after what you just said, I'm
             not even sure I want to be that
             anymore.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             You never had it so good.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.


                         VALERIE
             "True love." He said, "true
             love," Max. My God --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (retreating)
             Don't say another word, Valerie.

                         VALERIE
                  (turning to Inigo and Fezzik)
             He's afraid. Ever since Prince
             Humperdinck fired him, his
             confidence is shattered.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Why'd you say that name -- you
             promised me that you would never
             say that name --

                         VALERIE
                  (pursuing him now)
             What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
             Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (holding his hands
                  over his ears)
             I'm not listening.

                         VALERIE
             A life expiring and you don't
             have the decency to say why you
             won't help --

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Nobody's hearing nothing!

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck!
             Humperdinck!

                         INIGO
             -- But this is Buttercup's true
             love -- If you heal him, he will
             stop Humperdinck's wedding.

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Valerie)
             Shut up --
                  (now to Inigo)
             Wait. Wait. I make him better,
             Humperdinck suffers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96.


                         INIGO
             Humiliations galore!

                         MIRACLE MAX
             That is a noble cause. Give me
             the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

                                            CUT TO:

THIS LUMP

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking
utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more
dubiously.

                         INIGO
                  (a little appalled)
             That's a miracle pill?

Max nods.

                         VALERIE
                  (finishing)
             The chocolate coating makes it go
             down easier. But you have to wait
             fifteen minutes for full potency.
             And you shouldn't go swimming
             after, for at least, what?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             An hour.

                         VALERIE
             Yeah, an hour.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             A good hour. Yeah.

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff
as a board now.

                         INIGO
                  (heading out the door,
                  Fezzik close behind)
             Thank you for everything.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Okay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.


                         VALERIE
                  (waving after them)
             Bye-bye, boys.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Have fun storming the castle.

                         VALERIE
                  (to Max)
             Think it'll work?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             It would take a miracle. Bye!

                         VALERIE
             Bye.

And as they wave, trying to look happy we --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down
to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,
he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,
trying to prop Westley against the wall.

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo -- there's more than
             thirty --

                         INIGO
                  (absolutely unfazed)
             What's the difference?
                  (indicating the half-
                  dead Westley)
             We've got him. Help me here.
             We'll have to force feed him.

                         FEZZIK
             Has it been fifteen minutes?

                         INIGO
             We can't wait -- the wedding's in
             half an hour and we must strike
             in the hustle and the bustle
             beforehand.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98.


                         INIGO
             Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.

                         FEZZIK
                  (following orders)
             How long do we have to wait
             before we know if the miracle
             works?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.

                         INIGO
             Your guess is as good as mine --

                         WESTLEY
                  (frantic)
             I'll beat you both apart. I'll
             take you both together.

                         FEZZIK
             Guess not very long.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

                         WESTLEY
             Why won't my arms move?

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

                         FEZZIK
             You've been mostly dead all day.

                         INIGO
             We had Miracle Max make a pill to
             bring you back.

                         WESTLEY
             Who are you? -- Are we enemies?
             Why am I on this wall? -- Where's
             Buttercup? --

                         INIGO
             Let me explain --
                  (pauses very briefly)
             -- No, there is too much. Let me
             sum up.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
             in a little less than half an
             hour, so all we have to do is get
             in, break up the wedding, steal
             the Princess, make our escape
             after I kill Count Rugen.

                         WESTLEY
             That doesn't leave much time for
             dilly dallying.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

                         FEZZIK
             You've just wiggled your finger.
             That's wonderful.

                         WESTLEY
             I've always been a quick healer.
                  (to Inigo)
             What are our liabilities?

                         INIGO
             There is but one working castle
             gate.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself.

                         INIGO
             And it is guarded by sixty men.

                         WESTLEY
             And our assets?

                         INIGO
             Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
             my steel.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

absolutely stunned.

                         WESTLEY
             That's it? Impossible. If I had a
             month to plan, maybe I could come
             up with something. But this...

He shakes his head from side to side.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100.


INIGO AND FEZZIK

                         FEZZIK
                  (trying to be cheery)
             You just shook your head -- that
             doesn't make you happy?

                         WESTLEY
             My brains, his steel, and your
             strength against sixty men, and
             you think a little head jiggle is
             supposed to make me happy? I
             mean, if we only had a
             wheelbarrow, that would be
             something.

                         INIGO
             Where did we put that wheelbarrow
             the Albino had?

                         FEZZIK
             Over the Albino, I think.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, why didn't you list that
             among our assets in the first
             place? What I wouldn't give for a
             holocaust cloak.

                         INIGO
             There we cannot help you.

                         FEZZIK
                  (pulling one out)
             Will this do?

                         INIGO
                  (to Fezzik-- surprised)
             Where did you get that?

                         FEZZIK
             At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice,
             he said I could keep it.

                         WESTLEY
             All right, all right. Come on,
             help me up.

Inigo and Fezzik do.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101.


                         INIGO
             Why? You can't even lift one.

                         WESTLEY
             True, but that's hardly common
             knowledge, is it?
                  (And his bead tilts
                  limply back. Fezzik
                  sets it up right for him)
             Thank you. Now, there may be
             problems once we're inside.

                         INIGO
             I'll say -- how do I find the
             Count? -- Once I do, how do I
             find you again? -- Once I find
             you again, how do we escape? --

                         FEZZIK
                  (sharply)
             Don't pester him, he's had a hard
             day.

                         INIGO
                  (nods)
             Right, right, sorry.

                                            CUT TO:

A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these
words come to us on the wind --

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
             What?

                         FEZZIK
             I hope we win...

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her
beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          102.


                         HUMPERDINCK
             You don't seem excited, my little
             muffin.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Should I be?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Brides often are, I'm told.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (gently, confidently)
             I do not marry tonight.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and she couldn't seem more serene.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will save me.

                                            CUT TO:

HER WESTLEY

looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE

-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake
hands.

Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back
and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his
arm over and onto his friend's.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing
CLERGYMAN imaginable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          103.


Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind
them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the
back is Count Rugen.

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
                  (clears his throat,
                  begins to speak)
             Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings
             us togewer today...

He has an impediment that would stop a clock.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement,
             that dweam wiffim a dweam...

And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a
commotion. And then--

                         YELLIN
                  (off-screen)
             Stand your ground, men. Stand
             your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the
commotion, frightened, pointing.

                         YELLIN
             Stand your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THEIR P.O.V.:

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating
toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak,
and with a voice that would crumble walls.

                         FEZZIK
                  (deep and booming)
             I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS.
             THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          104.


FEZZIK

and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the
wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by
pushing it and supporting Westley.

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

                         FEZZIK
             MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE,
             BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting
orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY

Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Light him.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES

as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.

                         FEZZIK
                  (roaring)
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO
             SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST
             NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105.


                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow
             you fowever..

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to
Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel
with the Four Guards as we

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

                         FEZZIK
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
             FOR YOUR SOULS!

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
panic --

                         YELLIN
             Stay where you are. I said stay
             where you are!

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE CHAPEL

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... so tweasuwe your vruv..

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Skip to the end.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Have you the wing?

As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud
outside.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Here comes my Westley now.

                                            CUT TO:

Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak.

                         WESTLEY
             FEZZIK, the portcullis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106.


And FEZZIK rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is
indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
Yellin just watches in fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL

as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Your Westley is dead.

Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I killed him myself.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (never more serene)
             Then why is there fear behind
             your eyes?

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And she's right. It's there.

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK
close in.

                         WESTLEY
             Give us the gate key.

                         YELLIN
                  (every ounce of
                  honesty he's got)
             I have no gate key.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, tear his arms off.

FEZZIK

steps toward him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107.


                         YELLIN
             Oh, you mean this gate key.

And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP

AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Man and wife -- say man and wife...

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Man and wife.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whirling to the King
                  and Queen)
             Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
             Suite -- I'll be there shortly.

And as he dashes off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

standing there. Dazed.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He didn't come.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS

racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex
intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous,
as we

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK

moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who
is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog
leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108.


COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start.

                         RUGEN
             Kill the dark one and the giant,
             but leave the third for
             questioning.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe
they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor. There is a pause. Then --

                         INIGO
                  (to Rugen, evenly and soft)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he
does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,
running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He
tries again. No kind of chance.

                         INIGO
                  (calling out)
             Fezzik, I need you --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls
back --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.


                         FEZZIK
                  (indicating Westley)
             I can't leave him alone.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door.

                         INIGO
             He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
             Please. FEZZIK!

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK AND WESTLEY

                         FEZZIK
                  (to Westley)
             I'll be right back.

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came
from --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for
him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands
the door crumbles

                         INIGO
             Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

                         KING
                  (can hardly be understood)
             Strange wedding.

                         QUEEN
             Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
             along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110.


Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

                         KING
             What was that for?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Because you've always been so
             kind to me. And I won't be seeing
             you again since I'm killing
             myself once we reach the Honeymoon
             Suite.

                         KING
                  (smiling away --his
                  hearing isn't what it
                  once was)
             Won't that be nice?
                  (calling out to the Queen)
             She kissed me...

And on those words --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he
glances back --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

behind him, coming like a streak and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE INTERSECTION

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at
all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of
the missing Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his
pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111.


INIGO

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

throwing the dagger --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it
sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming
from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

                         INIGO
             ... Sorry, Father ... I tried ...
             I tried...

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face,
and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

                         RUGEN
             You must be that little Spanish
             brat I taught a lesson to all
             those years ago. It's simply
             incredible. Have you been chasing
             me your whole life only to fail
             now? I think that's the worst
             thing I ever heard. How marvelous.

Inigo sinks.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled
box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.


                         WESTLEY
             There's a shortage of perfect
             breasts in this world. It would
             be a pity to damage yours.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice
sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
Westley is helpless.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, darling.
                  (more kisses)
             Westley, why won't you hold me?

                         WESTLEY
                  (gently)
             Gently.

                         BUTTERCUP
             At a time like this that's all
             you can think to say? "Gently?"

                         WESTLEY
                  (not so gently)
             Gently!!

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised.

                         RUGEN
             Good heavens. Are you still
             trying to win?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his
stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving
in to kill Inigo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.


                         RUGEN
             You've got an overdeveloped sense
             of vengeance. It's going to get
             you into trouble some day.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left
shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much
worse.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

stepping back, going for the heart again.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a
roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make
some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as
this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,
Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count
is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall.

                         INIGO
                  (all but audible)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father; prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114.


COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he
forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the
Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father, prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none
of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
forward.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder still)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                         RUGEN
             Stop saying that!

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home
where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his
blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo
was wounded.

                         INIGO
                  (all he's got)
             HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA.
             YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
             DIE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115.


                         RUGEN
             No --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

                         RUGEN
             -- yes --

                         INIGO
             -- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

                         RUGEN
             -- all that I have and more
             please --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me everything I ask
             for --

                         RUGEN
             -- anything you want --

                         INIGO
                  (roaring)
             I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON-
             OFA-BITCH!

And on that --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes
one final time and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead
center and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116.


INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen
like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

                                            CUT TO:

RUGEN

lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from
the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide, full of fear.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never
seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling, then --

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is
still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, will you ever
             forgive me?

                         WESTLEY
             What hideous sin have you
             committed lately?

                         BUTTERCUP
             I got married. I didn't want to.
             It all happened so fast.

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What?

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.


                         BUTTERCUP
             But it did. I was there. This old
             man said, "Man and wife."

                         WESTLEY
             Did you say, "I do"?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well, no, we sort of skipped that
             part.

                         WESTLEY
             Then you're not married -- if you
             didn't say it, you didn't do it
                  (a pause)
             -- wouldn't you agree, Your
             Highness?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             A technicality that will shortly
             be remedied. But first things
             first. To the death.

                         WESTLEY
             No.
                  (a little pause)
             To the pain.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (about to charge,
                  stops short)
             I don't think I'm quite familiar
             with that phrase.

                         WESTLEY
             I'll explain. And I'll use small
             words so that you'll be sure to
             understand, you wart-hog-faced
             buffoon.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             That may be the first time in my
             life a man has dared insult me.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118.


WESTLEY

lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.

                         WESTLEY
             It won't be the last. To the pain
             means the first thing you lose
             will be your feet, below the
             ankles, then your hands at the
             wrists, next your nose.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

gripping his sword, watching.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             -- and then my tongue, I suppose.
             I killed you too quickly the last
             time, a mistake I don't mean to
             duplicate tonight.

                         WESTLEY
             I wasn't finished -- the next
             thing you lose will be your left
             eye, followed by your right --

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (takes step forward)
             -- and then my ears, I understand.
             Let's get on with it

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE

                         WESTLEY
             Wrong! Your ears you keep, and
             I'll tell you why --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the
wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.

                         WESTLEY
             -- so that every shriek of every
             child at seeing your hideousness
             will be yours to cherish -- every
             babe that weeps at your approach,
             every woman who cries out, "Dear
             God, what is that thing?" will
             echo in your perfect ears.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             That is what "to the pain" means.
             It means I leave you in anguish,
             wallowing in freakish misery
             forever.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I think you're bluffing --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying there, staring at him.

                         WESTLEY
             It's possible, pig -- I might be
             bluffing -- it's conceivable, you
             miserable vomitous mass, that I'm
             only lying here because I lack
             the strength to stand -- then
             again, perhaps I have the strength
             after all.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his
feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

staring, eyes wide.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.

                         WESTLEY
                  (slow and determined)
             DROP-YOUR-SWORD.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind
his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.

                         WESTLEY
                  (to Humperdinck)
             Have a seat.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.

                         WESTLEY
             Tie him up. Make it as tight as
             you like.

And as she sets to work --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

entering, looking around.

                         INIGO
             Where's Fezzik?

                         WESTLEY
             I thought he was with you.

                         INIGO
             No.

                         WESTLEY
             In that case --

his balance betrays him.

                         INIGO
                  (to Buttercup)
             Help him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why does Westley need helping?

                         INIGO
             Because he has no strength --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121.


HUMPERDINCK

and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I knew it! I knew you were
             bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.

                         INIGO
                  (staring at the Prince)
             Shall I dispatch him for you?

                         WESTLEY
                  (considers this, then)
             Thank you, but no -- whatever
             happens to us, I want him to live
             a long life alone with his
             cowardice.

                         FEZZIK
                  (off-screen)
             Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on
the balcony.

                         FEZZIK
             Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
             the Prince's stables, and there
             they were, four white horses. And
             I thought, there are four of us,
             if we ever find the lad -- hello,
             lad -- so I took them with me, in
             case we ever bumped into each
             other.
                  (considers things a moment)
             I guess we just did.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

looking down at FEZZIK.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, you did something right.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          122.


                         FEZZIK
             Don't worry -- I won't let it go
             to my head.

And as he holds out his great arms--

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of
course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

                         INIGO
             You know, it's very strange -- I
             have been in the revenge business
             so long, now that it's over, I
             don't know what to do with the
             rest of my life.

                         WESTLEY
                  (as Inigo gets him
                  ready for his jump)
             Have you ever considered piracy?
             You'd make a wonderful Dread
             Pirate Roberts.

Now from that --

                                            CUT TO:

THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS

triumphantly racing through the night --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

and at last their trials are done. They stop.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             They rode to freedom. And as dawn
             arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
             they were safe. A wave of love
             swept over them. And as they
             reached for each other...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          123.


As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading.

                         THE KID
             What? What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             No, it's kissing again. You don't
             want to hear it.

                         THE KID
             I don't mind so much.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Since the invention of the kiss,
             there have been five kisses that
             were rated the most passionate,
             the most pure. This one left them
             all behind. The end.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Now I think you ought to go to
             sleep.

                         THE KID
             Okay.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (standing, readying to leave)
             Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
             long.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.


                         THE KID
             Grandpa?

The Old Man stops, turns.

                         THE KID
             Maybe you could come over and
             read it again to me tomorrow.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (a beat)
             As you wish...

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the
door, tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT.

THE END.

FADE IN ON:

A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN

The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard.

                                            CUT TO:

THIS KID

lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's
seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand,
presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's
hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down.

His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech.
We're in the present day and this is a middle class house,
somewhere in the suburbs.

                                            CUT TO:

The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his
pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's
worried, it doesn't show. During this

                         MOTHER
             You feeling any better?

                         THE KID
             A little bit.

                         MOTHER
             Guess what.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         MOTHER
             Your grandfather's here.

                         THE KID
                  (not overjoyed)
             Mom, can't you tell him that I'm
             sick?

                         MOTHER
             You are sick, that's why he's here.

                         THE KID
             He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.

                         MOTHER
             Maybe he won't.

The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we

THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of
rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package
tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid,
pinches his cheek.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Hey! How's the sickie? Heh?

The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother
ignores it, beats a retreat.

                         MOTHER
             I think I'll leave you two pals.

And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then...

                         GRANDFATHER
             I brought you a special present.

                         THE KID
             What is it?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Open it up.

The Kid does. He does his best to smile.

                         THE KID
             A book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             That's right. When I was your
             age, television was called books.
             And this is a special book. It
             was the book my father used to
             read to me when I was sick, and I
             used to read it to your father.
             And today, I'm gonna read it to
             you.

                         THE KID
             Has it got any sports in it?

             Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting.
             Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters.

                  (manages a shrug)
             It doesn't sound too bad. I'll
             try and stay awake.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Well, thank you very much.
             It's very nice of you. Your vote
             of confidence is overwhelming.
             All right.

             The Princess Bride, by S.
             Morgenstern. Chapter One.
             Buttercup was raised on a small
             farm in the country of Florin.

                  (off-screen)
             Her favorite pastimes were riding
             her horse and tormenting the farm
             boy that worked there. His name
             was Westley, but she never called
             him that.
                  (to the kid)
             Isn't that a wonderful beginning?

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen doing his best)
             Yeah. It's really good.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Nothing gave Buttercup as much
             pleasure as ordering Westley
             around.

BUTTERCUPS FARM - DAY

BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while
in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at
her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about
clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't
as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the
most beautiful woman in the world.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm boy. Polish my horse's
             saddle. I want to see my face
             shining in it by morning.

                         WESTLEY
                  (quietly, watching her)
             As you wish.

Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup.
And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her
as she walks away.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             "As you wish" was all he ever
             said to her.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large
buckets near him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Farm Boy. Fill these with water --
                  (a beat)
             --please.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns -- he
manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             That day, she was amazed to
             discover that when he was saying,
             "As you wish," what he meant was,
             "I love you."

BUTTERCUP IN THE KITCHEN - DUSK

Westley enters with an armload of firewood.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And even more amazing was the day
             she realized she truly loved him
             back.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (pointing to a pitcher
                  that she could reach herself)
             Farm Boy, fetch me that pitcher.

He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to
each other gazing into each other's eyes.

                         WESTLEY
             As you wish.

Now he turns, moves outside.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red
glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)

THE KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             What is this? Are you trying to
             trick me? -- Where's the sports? --
             Is this a kissing book?

                         GRANDFATHER
             -- wait, just wait --

                         THE KID
             -- well, when does it get good?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Keep your shirt on. Let me read.
                  (reading again)
             Westley had no money for marriage.
             So he packed his few belongings
             and left the farm to seek his
             fortune across the sea.

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             It was a very emotional time for
             Buttercup --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen groaning)
             I don't be-leeve this.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I fear I'll never see you again.

                         WESTLEY
             Of course you will.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But what if something happens to
             you?

                         WESTLEY
             Hear this now: I will come for you.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how can you be sure?

                         WESTLEY
             This is true love. You think this
             happens every day?

He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly
around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup
watches him go.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen reading)
             Westley didn't reach his
             destination. His ship was attacked
             by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who
             never left captives alive. When
             Buttercup got the news that
             Westley was murdered --

                  (off-screen, perking
                  up a little)

             She went into her room and shut
             the door. And for days, she
             neither slept nor ate.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (no emotion at all in
                  her voice)
             I will never love again.

HOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad.

FLORIN CASTLE - DAY

The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople,
livestock, and a bustling marketplace.

                  (off-screen reading)
             Five years later, the main square
             of Florin City was filled as
             never before to hear the
             announcement of the great Prince
             Humperdinck's bride-to be.

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing,
standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three
others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the
aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the
Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN.

             My people ... a month from now,
             our country will have its 500th
             anniversary. On that sundown, I

A giant staircase leading to the CROWD and as a FIGURE just
begins to become visible,

THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if
there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd,
collectively, holds its breath.

THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no
instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees. Great
waves of people kneeling and --

BUTTERCUP, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her

moment.

                  (off-screen)
             Buttercup's emptiness consumed
             her. Although the law of the land
             gave Humperdinck the right to
             choose his bride, she did not
             love him.

             Despite Humperdinck's reassurance

             the only joy she found was in her

A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN

Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in.

                         VOICE
             A word, my lady?

THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them
can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are
not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a
tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his
name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as
a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a
giant. His name is FEZZIK.

                         VIZZINI
             We are but poor, lost circus

             There is nothing nearby; not for
             miles.

                         VIZZINI
             Then there will be no one to hear
             you scream-

He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over,
touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a
scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast.
As she starts to fall --

                                            CUT TO:

A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL

A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long.
Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready.

                                            CUT TO:

The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board.

Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket
and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There
is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill
and precision.

                         INIGO
             What is that you're ripping?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           10.


                         VIZZINI
                  (not stopping or turning)
             It's fabric from the uniform of
             an Army officer of Guilder.

                         FEZZIK
             Who's Guilder?

                         VIZZINI
                  (pointing straight out)
             The country across the sea. The
             sworn enemy of Florin.
                  (slaps the horse's rump)
             Go!

The horse takes off. They start for the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Once the horse reaches the
             castle, the fabric will make the
             Prince suspect the Guilderians
             have abducted his love. When he
             finds her body dead on the
             Guilder frontier, his suspicions
             will be totally confirmed.

                         FEZZIK
             You never said anything about
             killing anyone.

Vizzini hops onto the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             I've hired you to help me start a
             war. That's a prestigious line of
             work with a long and glorious
             tradition.

                         FEZZIK
             I just don't think it's right,
             killing an innocent girl.

                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on Fezzik)
             Am I going mad or did the word
             "think" escape your lips? You
             were not hired for your brains,
             you hippopotamic land mass.

                         INIGO
             I agree with Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           11.


CLOSE UP: Vizzini, in a fury.

                         VIZZINI
                  (We only thought he
                  was in a fury --now
                  he's really getting mad)
             Oh. The sot has spoken. What
             happens to her is not truly your
             concern -- I will kill her --
                  (louder)
             And remember this -- never forget
             this --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK, as Vizzini advances on them. Nothing shows
on Inigo's face, but FEZZIK is panicked by Vizzini.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             -- when I found you, you were so
             slobbering drunk you couldn't buy
             brandy --
                  (now to Fezzik, who
                  retreats as much as he
                  can while Vizzini advances)
             -- and you -- friendless,
             brainless, helpless, hopeless --
             Do you want me to send you back
             to where you were, unemployed in
             Greenland?

Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them.

During this, Inigo has gone close to FEZZIK, who is very
distressed at the insults he's just received. As Inigo casts
off.

                         INIGO
                  (softly)
             That Vizzini, he can fuss.
                  (a slight emphasis on
                  the last word)


                         FEZZIK
                  (looking at Inigo)
             ... fuss ... fuss ...
                  (Suddenly, he's got it
                  again, emphasis on the
                  last word.)
             I think he likes to scream at us.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           12.


                         INIGO
             Probably he means no harm.

                         FEZZIK
             He's really very short on charm.

                         INIGO
                  (proudly)
             Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.

                         FEZZIK
             Yes, some of the time.
                  (he starts to smile)


                         VIZZINI
                  (whirling on them)
             Enough of that.

As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?

                         FEZZIK
             If there are, we'll all be dead.

                         VIZZINI
             No more rhymes now, I mean it.

                         FEZZIK
             Anybody want a peanut?

As Vizzini screams we:

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE SAILBOAT RACING ACROSS THE DARK WATERS

Inigo is at the helm, FEZZIK stands near the body of the
princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly -- or do they?
Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are
only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds.

                         VIZZINI
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll reach the Cliffs by dawn.

Inigo nods, glances back.

                         VIZZINI
             Why are you doing that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           13.


                         INIGO
             Making sure nobody's following us.

                         VIZZINI
             That would be inconceivable.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Despite what you think, you will
             be caught. And when you are, the
             Prince will see you all hanged.

Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess.

                         VIZZINI
             Of all the necks on this boat,
             Highness, the one you should be
             worrying about is your own.

Inigo keeps staring behind them.

                         VIZZINI
             Stop doing that. We can all
             relax, it's almost over-

                         INIGO
             You're sure nobody's following us?

                         VIZZINI
             As I told you, it would be
             absolutely, totally, and in all
             other ways, inconceivable. No one
             in Guilder knows what we've done.
             And no one in Florin could have
             gotten here so fast. Out of
             curiosity, why do you ask?

                         INIGO
             No reason. It's only, I just
             happened to look behind us, and
             something is there.

                         VIZZINI
             What?

And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do --

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the
wind whistles. And the waves pound.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           14.


And suddenly it's all gone ominous.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately
to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM

And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous.
Only now it's eerie too.

Then --

The moon slips through and --

Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat.
Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good
distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the
gap.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI

staring at the other boat.

                         VIZZINI
                  (explaining with as
                  much logic as he can muster)
             Probably some local fisherman out
             for a pleasure cruise at night
             through eel-infested waters.

And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

and Vizzini screaming.

                         VIZZINI
             Go in, get after her!

                         INIGO
             I don't swim.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to the unasked question)
             I only dog paddle.

                         VIZZINI
             Veer left. Left. Left!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent
breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new
is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound.
Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness? Those are the Shrieking
             Eels -- if you doubt me, just
             wait. They always grow louder
             when they're about to feed on
             human flesh.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The
shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying.
Buttercup stays silent.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

                         VIZZINI
             If you swim back now, I promise,
             no harm will come to you. I doubt
             you will get such an offer from
             the Eels.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is
louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now,
something dark and gigantic slithers past.

She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she
makes no reply --

-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           16.


-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling,
starting to close --

-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of
any kind --

-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer --

-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do,
it's over, all over --

-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made
such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp
down --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             She doesn't get eaten by the Eels
             at this time.

And the second we hear him:

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's
gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands.

                         THE KID
             What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             The Eel doesn't get her. I'm
             explaining to you because you
             looked nervous.

                         THE KID
             Well, I wasn't nervous.

His Grandfather says nothing, just waits.

                         THE KID
             Well, maybe I was a little bit
             concerned. But that's not the
             same thing.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Because I can stop now if you want.

                         THE KID
             No. You could read a little bit
             more ... if you want.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.


He grips the sheets again, as the Grandfather picks up the
book.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (reading)
             "Do you know what that sound is,
             Highness?"

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

We're back in the boat.

                         VIZZINI
             Those are the Shrieking Eels.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             We're past that, Grandpa.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SICK KID'S ROOM

                         THE KID
             You read it already.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. Oh my goodness, I did. I'm
             sorry. Beg your pardon.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

treading water.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             All right, all right, let's see.
             Uh, she was in the water, the Eel
             was coming after her. She was
             frightened. The Eel started to
             charge her. And then -

And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her,
Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to
clamp down as we

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           18.


A GIANT ARM

pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily
lifting Buttercup.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The boat and FEZZIK, Buttercup being deposited on the deck.

                         VIZZINI
             Put her down. Just put her down.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pointing behind them.

                         INIGO
             I think he's getting closer.

Vizzini, tying Buttercup's hands.

                         VIZZINI
             He's no concern of ours. Sail on!
                  (to Buttercup)
             I suppose you think you're brave,
             don't you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (staring deep at him)
             Only compared to some.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

The boat at dawn, being followed closely by the black
sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being
sailed by a MAN IN BLACK, and his boat almost seems to be
flying.

                         INIGO
             Look! He's right on top of us. I
             wonder if he is using the same
             wind we are using.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's too late --
                  (pointing ahead of them)
             -- see?
                  (big)
             The Cliffs of Insanity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.


And once he's said the name--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS OF INSANITY - DAWN

They rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO SAILBOATS

in a wild race for the Cliffs and the Man In Black is
closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was
too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great
precision straight at the Cliffs

                                            CUT TO:

THE BOAT

being pursued.

                         VIZZINI
             Hurry up. Move the thing! Um ...
             that other thing. Move it!
                  (staring back now)
             We're safe -- only FEZZIK is
             strong enough to go up our way --
             he'll have to sail around for
             hours 'til he finds a harbor.

There is much activity going on, all of it swift, expert,
economical. FEZZIK reaches up along the Cliff face, grabs a
jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick
rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope
a freeing swing and

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFFS

The rope goes all the way to the top.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts
Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself
gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like
papooses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           20.


And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along
with him as he goes.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity,
watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments
of dawn.

                                            CUT TO:

THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN

FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is
the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and
it's a gasper.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with
fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS

FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's
already over a third of the way done.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's
impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he
didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over
hand like lightning.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         INIGO
                  (looking down)
             He's climbing the rope. And he's
             gaining on us.

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!

He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           21.


THE MAN IN BLACK

roaring up the rope, and

                                            CUT TO:

LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS

-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS

                         VIZZINI
                  (shrieking)
             Faster!

                         FEZZIK
             I thought I was going faster.

                         VIZZINI
             You were supposed to be this
             colossus. You were this great,
             legendary thing. And yet he gains.

                         FEZZIK
             Well, I'm carrying three people.
             And he's got only himself.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cutting through)
             -- I do not accept excuses.
                  (shaking his head)
             I'm just going to have to find
             myself a new giant, that's all.

                         FEZZIK
                  (hurt)
             Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.

And his arms begin moving much more slowly.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded
up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           22.


THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS

Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now.

                         VIZZINI
             Did I make it clear that your job
             is at stake?

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

less than a hundred feet behind them. And gaining.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CLIFF TOP AS FEZZIK MAKES IT!

Vizzini leaps off and takes out a knife, begins to cut the
rope which is tied around a great rock while Inigo helps the
Princess to her feet and FEZZIK just stands around, waiting
for someone to tell him to do something. Nearby are some
stone ruins. Once they might have been a fort, now the kind
of resemble Stonehenge.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

feet from the top now, maybe less -- maybe only 50 -- and
his pace is as dazzling as before, and

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

cutting through the last of the rope and

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

slithering across the ground and out of sight toward the
Channel, like some great serpent at last going home.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

standing with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           23.


                         FEZZIK
                  (to Inigo -- impressed)
             He has very good arms.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

hanging suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to
the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

stunned, turning to the others, looking down.

                         VIZZINI
             He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!

                         INIGO
                  (whirling on Vizzini)
             You keep using that word -- I do
             not think it means what you think
             it means.
                  (looks down again)
             My God! He's climbing.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

and so he is. Very slowly, he is picking his way upwards,
sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch.

                                            CUT TO:

The group at the top, staring down.

                         VIZZINI
             Whoever he is, he's obviously
             seen us with the Princess, and
             must therefore die.
                  (to Fezzik)
             You, carry her.
                  (to Inigo)
             We'll head straight for the
             Guilder frontier. Catch up when
             he's dead. If he falls, fine. If
             not, the sword.

Inigo nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           24.


                         INIGO
             I want to duel him left-handed.

                         VIZZINI
             You know what a hurry we're in.

                         INIGO
             Well, it's the only way I can be
             satisfied. If I use my right --
             tch -- over too quickly.

                         VIZZINI
                  (turns abruptly,
                  starts off-screen)
             Oh, have it your way.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

still creeping his way upward.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

who goes to Inigo.

                         FEZZIK
             You be careful.
                  (gravely)
             -- people in masks cannot be
             trusted.

                         VIZZINI
                  (calling out)
             I'm waiting!

FEZZIK nods, hurries after Vizzini.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the
Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands
loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is
a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for
waiting around.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           25.


THE MAN IN BLACK

climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than
when last we saw him. Inigo is watching.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to
talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but
neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our
two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what
it is.

                         INIGO
                  (hollering down)
             Hello there.

The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts.

                         INIGO
             Slow going?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look, I don't mean to be rude,
             but this is not as easy as it
             looks. So I'd appreciate it if
             you wouldn't distract me.

                         INIGO
             Sorry.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you.

Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few
perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the
edge again.

                         INIGO
             I do not suppose you could speed
             things up?

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (with some beat)
             If you're in such a hurry, you
             could lower a rope, or a tree
             branch, or find something useful
             to do.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.


                         INIGO
             I could do that. In fact, I've
             got some rope up here. But I do
             not think that you will accept my
             help, since I am only waiting
             around to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That does put a damper on our
             relationship.

He finds another bold a few inches higher.

                         INIGO
             But I promise I will not kill you
             until you reach the top.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That's very comforting. But I'm
             afraid you'll just have to wait.

                         INIGO
             I hate waiting. I could give you
             my word as a Spaniard.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No good. I've known too many
             Spaniards.

And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his
strength.

                         INIGO
             You don't know any way you'll
             trust me?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Nothing comes to mind.

And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo.
He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice
takes on a tone we have not heard before.

                         INIGO
             I swear on the soul of my father,
             Domingo Montoya, you will reach
             the top alive.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK.

There is a pause. Then, quietly:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           27.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Throw me the rope.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of
the cliff.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and
hurls it over --

                                            CUT TO:

THE ROPE

It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks,
grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then
looks up at Inigo and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

rising through the early morning light, slowly, steadily,
and as the cliff top at last comes within reach --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

watching as the Man In Black crawls to safety, then looks to
Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (pulling his sword)
             Thank you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           28.


                         INIGO
             We'll wait until you're ready.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Again. Thank you.

The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held
the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see
several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears
gloves. Inigo stares at them.

                         INIGO
             I do not mean to pry, but you
             don't by any chance happen to
             have six fingers on your right
             hand?

He glances up -- the question clearly baffles him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Do you always begin conversations
             this way?

                         INIGO
             My father was slaughtered by a
             sixfingered man. He was a great
             swordmaker, my father. And when
             the six-fingered man appeared and
             requested a special sword, my
             father took the job. He slaved a
             year before he was done.

He hands his sword to the Man In Black.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fondling it-impressed)
             I have never seen its equal.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP - INIGO

Even now, this still brings pain.

                         INIGO
             The six-fingered man returned and
             demanded it, but at one-tenth his
             promised price. My father refused.
             Without a word, the six-fingered
             man slashed him through the heart.
             I loved my father, so, naturally,
             challenged his murderer to a duel
             ... I failed ...

                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             the six-fingered man did leave me
             alive with the six-fingered
             sword, but he gave me these.

He touches his scars.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

looking up at Inigo.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             How old were you?

                         INIGO
             I was eleven years old. When I
             was strong enough, I dedicated my
             life to the study of fencing. So
             the next time we meet, I will not
             fail. I will go up to the
             sixfingered man and say, "Hello,
             my name is Inigo Montoya. You
             killed my father. Prepare to die."

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You've done nothing but study
             swordplay?

                         INIGO
             More pursuit than study lately.
             You see, I cannot find him. It's
             been twenty years now. I am
             starting to lose confidence. I
             just work for Vizzini to pay the
             bills. There's not a lot of money
             in revenge.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (handing back the
                  great sword, starting
                  to rise)
             Well, I certainly hope you find
             him, someday.

                         INIGO
             You are ready, then?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Whether I am or not, you've been
             more than fair.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.


                         INIGO
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to kill you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (walking away a few
                  paces, unsheathing his sword)
             You seem a decent fellow. I hate
             to die.

                         INIGO
             Begin!

And on that word --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest
sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later
on), and right from the beginning it looks different.

Because they aren't close to each other -- none of the
swordscrossing "en garde" garbage.

No, what we have here is two men, two athletes, and they
look to be too faraway to damage each other, but each time
one makes even the tiniest feint, the other counters, and
there is silence, and as they start to circle --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

feinting here, feinting there and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO MEN

finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest.

Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes
so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In
Black retreating up a rocky incline.

                         INIGO
                  (thrilled)
             You're using Bonetti's defense
             against me, ah?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           31.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I thought it fitting, considering
             the rocky terrain --

                         INIGO
             Naturally, you must expect me to
             attack with Capo Ferro.

And he shifts his style now.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (coping as best he can)
             -- naturally --
                  (suddenly shifting again)
             --but I find Thibault cancels out
             Capo Ferro, don't you?

The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated
castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand.

Inigo stares down at him.

                         INIGO
             Unless the enemy has studied his
             Agrippa-

And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the
perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and
lands facing his opponent.

                         INIGO
             -- which I have.

The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain,
never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the
battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the
other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that
this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more
that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're
in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate"
battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly,
the action begins going even faster than before as we

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the
deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and
ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for
long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage,
keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           32.


                         INIGO
                  (happy as a clam)
             You are wonderful!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Thank you -- I've worked hard to
             become so.

The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being
forced toward it.

                         INIGO
             I admit it -- you are better than
             I am.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Then why are you smiling?

Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles.

                         INIGO
             Because I know something you
             don't know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that?

                         INIGO
             I am not left-handed.

And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and
immediately, the tide of battle turns.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff
edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now
faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he
increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           33.


A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and
the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he
can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a
frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every
thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails.
Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves
but they are nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're amazing!

                         INIGO
             I ought to be after twenty years.

And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar,
pinned there under the six fingered sword.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (hollering it out)
             There's something I ought to tell
             you.

                         INIGO
             Tell me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am not left-handed either.

And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully
joined.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps.
He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the
same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And
before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked
clear out of his hand.

Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar
suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and
scrambles to his sword and we

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the
landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black
copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           34.


He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus
performer and dismounts with a backflip.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring in awe.

                         INIGO
             Who are you?!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             No one of consequence.

                         INIGO
             I must know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Get used to disappointment.

                         INIGO
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

moving like lightning, and he thrusts forward, slashes,
darts back, all in almost a single movement and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

Dodging, blocking, and again he thrusts forward, faster even
than before, and again he slashes but --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And there is never a move anyone makes he doesn't remember,
and this time he blocks the slash, slashes out himself with
the sixfingered sword.

On it goes, back and forth across the rocky terrain, Inigo's
feet moving with the grace and speed of a great
improvisational dancer.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           35.


THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

as it is knocked free, arching up into the air, and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

catching it again. And something terrible is written behind
his eyes: he has given his all, done everything man can do,
tried every style, made every maneuver, but it wasn't
enough, and on his face for all to see is the realization
that he, Inigo Montoya of Spain, is going to lose.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

moving in for the end now, blocking everything, muzzling
everything and

                                            CUT TO:

THE SIX-FINGERED SWORD

sent flying from Inigo's grip. He stands helpless only a
moment. Then be drops to his knees, bows his head, shuts his
eyes.

                         INIGO
             Kill me quickly.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I would as soon destroy a stained
             glass window as an artist like
             yourself. However, since I can't
             have you following me either --

And he dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo
pitches forward unconscious.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Please understand, I hold you in
             the highest respect.

He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: VIZZINI

                         VIZZINI
             Inconceivable!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           36.


PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far
below the Man In Black can be seen running. FEZZIK, carrying
the Princess, stands alongside. It's a little later in the
morning.

                         VIZZINI
             Give her to me.
                  (grabs Buttercup
                  starts off)
             Catch up with us quickly.

                         FEZZIK
                  (starting to panic)
             What do I do?

                         VIZZINI
             Finish him, finish him. Your way.

                         FEZZIK
             Oh, good, my way. Thank you,
             Vizzini.
                  (little pause)
             Which way is my way?

                                            CUT TO:

A COUPLE OF ROCKS

Nothing gigantic. Vizzini points to them. There is a large
boulder nearby.

                         VIZZINI
             Pick up one of those rocks, get
             behind the boulder, and in a few
             minutes, the Man in Black will
             come running around the bend. The
             minute his head is in view, hit
             it with the rock!

As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away.

                         FEZZIK
                  (little frown; softly)
             My way's not very sportsmanlike.

He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and
we --

                                            DISSOLVE TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           37.


THE MAN IN BLACK

racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail.
He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening.

Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he
rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a
boulder inches in front of him.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another
rock and holds it lightly.

                         FEZZIK
             I did that on purpose. I don't
             have to miss.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I believe you -- So what happens
             now?

                         FEZZIK
             We face each other as God intended.
             Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no
             weapons, skill against skill alone.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You mean, you'll put down your
             rock and I'll put down my sword,
             and we'll try to kill each other
             like civilized people?

                         FEZZIK
                  (gently)
             I could kill you now.

He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head,
takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Frankly, I think the odds are
             slightly in your favor at hand
             fighting.

                         FEZZIK
             It's not my fault being the
             biggest and the strongest. I
             don't even exercise.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.


He flips the rock away.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN

The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But
it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so
much.

There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives
at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the
stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a
beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any
number of terrific wrestling moves.

FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery.
Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at
the Giant.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Look are you just fiddling around
             with me or what?

                         FEZZIK
             I just want you to feel you're
             doing well. I hate for people to
             die embarrassed.

They get set to begin again. Then suddenly --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size
and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees,
spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs.

                         FEZZIK
             You're quick.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And a good thing too.

                         FEZZIK
                  (getting set for
                  another onslaught)
             Why do you wear a mask? Were you
             burned by acid, or something like
             that?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Oh no. It's just that they're
             terribly comfortable. I think
             everyone will be wearing them in
             the future.

FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he
moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the
Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves
right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to
his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back
and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's
throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one
behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter.

                         FEZZIK
                  (standing, talking as
                  he does so)
             I just figured out why you give
             me so much trouble.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and
just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the
entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous,
but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his arms never leave
                  Fezzik's throat)
             Why is that, do you think?

                         FEZZIK
                  (his voice just
                  beginning to get a
                  little strained)
             Well, I haven't fought just one
             person for so long. I've been
             specializing in groups. Battling
             gangs for local charities, that
             kind of thing.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           40.


ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH

Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge,
and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the
rough boulder.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as
if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble,
but he doesn't, he holds on.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Why should that make such a
             difference?

                         FEZZIK
             Well ...
                  (And now his voice is
                  definitely growing weaker)
             ... you see, you use different
             moves when you're fighting half a
             dozen people than when you only
             have to be worried about one.

Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only
this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to
slowly collapse.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

and there isn't much breath coming.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

holding his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it,
but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there
for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In
Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But
there is just no air. No air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies
still.

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's
heart. It beats. The Man In Black stands.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           41.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             I don't envy you the headache you
             will have when you awake. But, in
             the meantime, rest well ... and
             dream of large women.

And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it
and as he dashes off up along the mountain path --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

as he slips his boot into a foot print in the sand.

Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed
WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless
in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and
maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again,
maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into
strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is
miming the fencers.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             There was a mighty duel -- it
             ranged all over. They were both
             masters.

                         RUGEN
             Who won? How did it end?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (looking down in the
                  position where Inigo
                  fell unconscious)
             The loser ran off alone.
                  (points in the
                  direction Vizzini and
                  FEZZIK took)
             The winner followed those
             footprints toward Guilder!

                         RUGEN
             Shall we track them both?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             The loser is nothing. -- Only the
             Princess matters --
                  (to the armed warriors)
             -- clearly this was all planned
             by warriors of Guilder. We must
             be ready for whatever lies ahead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.


                         RUGEN
             Could this be a trap?

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (vaulting onto his horse)
             I always think everything could
             be a trap -- Which is why I'm
             still alive.

And he gallops off --

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

cresting the peak of the mountain.

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP ON

a knife pointed at a throat -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini
munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's
throat. She is blindfolded.

A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and
between them, a small leather wine container. And some
cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely
spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all
the way back to the sea.

The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini,
slows. The two men study each other. Then --

                         VIZZINI
             So, it is down to you. And it is
             down to me.

The Man In Black nods and comes nearer --

                         VIZZINI
             If you wish her dead, by all
             means keep moving forward.

And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's
unprotected throat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Let me explain-

                         VIZZINI
             -- there's nothing to explain.
             You're trying to kidnap what I've
             rightfully stolen.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.


                         MAN IN BLACK
             Perhaps an arrangement can be
             reached.

                         VIZZINI
             There will be no arrangement --
                  (deliberate)
             -- and you're killing her!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP'S THROAT

as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against
the pain.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stopping fast.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             But if there can be no
             arrangement, then we are at an
             impasse.

                         VIZZINI
             I'm afraid so -- I can't compete
             with you physically. And you're
             no match for my brains.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're that smart?

                         VIZZINI
             Let me put it this way: have you
             ever heard of Plato, Aristotle,
             Socrates?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Yes.

                         VIZZINI
             Morons.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Really? In that case, I challenge
             you to a battle of wits.

                         VIZZINI
             For the Princess?

The Man In Black nods.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           44.


                         VIZZINI
             To the death?

Another nod.

                         VIZZINI
             I accept.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Good. Then pour the wine.

As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the
Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing
it to Vizzini.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Inhale this, but do not touch.

                         VIZZINI
                  (doing it)
             I smell nothing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (taking the packet back)
             What you do not smell is called
             iocane powder. It is odorless,
             tasteless, dissolves instantly in
             liquid, and is among the more
             deadlier poisons known to man.

                         VIZZINI
             Hmm.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

watching excitedly as the Man In Black takes the goblets,
turns his back. A moment later, he turns again, faces
Vizzini, drops the iocane packet. It is now empty.

The Man In Black rotates the goblets in a little shell game
maneuver then puts one glass in front of Vizzini, the other
in front of himself.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             All right: where is the poison?
             The battle of wits has begun. It
             ends when you decide and we both
             drink, and find out who is right
             and who is dead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           45.


                         VIZZINI
             But it's so simple. All I have to
             do is divine from what I know of
             you. Are you the sort of man who
             would put the poison into his own
             goblet, or his enemy's?

He studies the Man In Black now.

                         VIZZINI
             Now, a clever man would put the
             poison into his own goblet,
             because he would know that only a
             great fool would reach for what
             he was given. I'm not a great
             fool, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of you. But you
             must have known I was not a great
             fool; you would have counted on
             it, so I can clearly not choose
             the wine in front of me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (And now there's a
                  trace of nervousness beginning)
             You've made your decision then7

                         VIZZINI
             Not remotely. Because iocane
             comes from Australia, as everyone
             knows. And Australia is entirely
             peopled with criminals. And
             criminals are used to having
             people not trust them, as you are
             not trusted by me. So I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of you.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Truly, you have a dizzying
             intellect.

                         VIZZINI
             Wait till I get going! Where was I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Australia.

                         VIZZINI
             Yes -- Australia, and you must
             have suspected I would have known
             the powder's origin, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.


                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (very nervous)
             You're just stalling now.

                         VIZZINI
                  (cackling)
             You'd like to think that, wouldn't
             you?
                  (stares at the Man in Black)
             You've beaten my giant, which
             means you're exceptionally strong.
             So, you could have put the poison
             in your own goblet, trusting on
             your strength to save you. So I
             can clearly not choose the wine
             in front of you. But, you've also
             bested my Spaniard which means
             you must have studied. And in
             studying, you must have learned
             that man is mortal so you would
             have put the poison as far from
             yourself as possible, so I can
             clearly not choose the wine in
             front of me.

As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man
In Black's has been fast disappearing.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You're trying to trick me into
             giving away something -- it won't
             work --

                         VIZZINI
                  (triumphant)
             It has worked -- you've given
             everything away -- I know where
             the poison is.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (fool's courage)
             Then make your choice.

                         VIZZINI
             I will. And I choose --

And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In
Black.

                         VIZZINI
             -- what in the world can that be?

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           47.


THE MAN IN BLACK

turning around, looking.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What? Where? I don't see anything.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI

busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his
head turned.

                         VIZZINI
             Oh, well, I-I could have sworn I
             saw something. No matter.

The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to
laugh.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             What's so funny?

                         VIZZINI
             I'll tell you in a minute. First,
             let's drink -- me from my glass,
             and you from yours.

And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the
one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini
hesitates a moment.

Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows
his wine.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You guessed wrong.

                         VIZZINI
                  (roaring with laughter)
             You only think I guessed wrong --
                  (louder now)
             -- that's what's so funny! I
             switched glasses when your back
             was turned. You fool.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

There's nothing he can say. He just sits there.

VIZZINI

watching him.

                         VIZZINI
             You fell victim to one of the
             classic blunders. The most famous
             is "Never get involved in a land
             war in Asia." But only slightly
             less well known is this: "Never
             go in against a Sicilian when
             death is on the line."

He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all
ways quite cheery until he falls over dead.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings
off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead.

The Man In Black pulls her to her feet.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Who are you?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             I am no one to be trifled with,
             that is all you ever need know.

He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled
terrain.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (a final glance back
                  toward Vizzini)
             To think -- all that time it was
             your cup that was poisoned.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             They were both poisoned. I spent
             the last few years building up an
             immunity to iocane powder.

And with that, he takes off, dragging her behind him.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           49.


A MOUNTAIN PATH

It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK
TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of
misplaced sand. The others wait behind him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Someone has beaten a giant!
                  (roaring)
             There will be great suffering in
             Guilder if she dies.

He leaps onto his horse and they charge off.

                                            CUT TO:

A WILD STRETCH OF TERRAIN

The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging
Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her
along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go
of her.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (his voice harsh now,
                  carrying the promise
                  of violence)
             Catch your breath.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If you'll release me ... whatever
             you ask for ransom ... you'll get
             it, I promise you...

                         MAN IN BLACK
             And what is that worth, the
             promise of a woman? You're very
             funny, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I was giving you a chance. No
             matter where you take me ...
             there's no greater hunter than
             Prince Humperdinck. He could
             track a falcon on a cloudy day.
             He can find you

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You think your dearest love will
             save you?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.


                         BUTTERCUP
             I never said he was my dearest
             love. And yes, he will save me.
             That I know.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             You admit to me you do not love
             your fiance?

                         BUTTERCUP
             He knows I do not love him.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             "Are not capable of love" is what
             you mean.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I have loved more deeply than a
             killer like yourself could ever
             dream.

And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches,
but does not retreat.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             That was a warning, Highness. The
             next time, my hand flies on its
             own. For where I come from, there
             are penalties when a woman lies.

                                            CUT TO:

VIZZINI'S BODY

The picnic is spread as before.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body
as the others ride up. The Prince grabs the empty poison
packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Iocane. I'd bet my life on it.
                  (gestures to the trail ahead)
             And there are the Princess's
             footprints. She is alive ... or
             was, an hour ago. If she is
             otherwise when I find her, I
             shall be very put out.

And as he vaults onto his horse and the all charge off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In
Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer
ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine
floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Rest, Highness.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (stares at him)
             I know who you are -- your
             cruelty reveals everything.

The Man In Black says nothing.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You're the Dread Pirate Roberts;
             admit it.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (bowing)
             With pride. What can I do for you?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die slowly cut into a
             thousand pieces.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Hardly complimentary, Your
             Highness. Why loose your venom on
             me?

CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You killed my love.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

watching her closely.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             It's possible; I kill a lot of
             people. Who was this love of
             yours? Another Prince, like this
             one, ugly, rich, and scabby?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           52.


                         BUTTERCUP
             No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and
             perfect, with eyes like the sea
             after a storm.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be
tears.

                         BUTTERCUP
             On the high seas, your ship
             attacked, and the Dread Pirate
             Roberts never takes prisoners.

                         MAN IN BLACK
                  (explaining as a
                  teacher might)
             I can't afford to make exceptions.
             Once word leaks out that a pirate
             has gone soft, people begin to
             disobey you, and then it's
             nothing but work, work, work, all
             the time.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mock my pain!

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Life is pain, Highness. Anyone
             who says differently is selling
             something. I remember this farm
             boy of yours, I think. This would
             be, what, five years ago?

Buttercup nods.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Does it bother you to hear?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Nothing you can say will upset me.

                         MAN IN BLACK
             He died well, that should please
             you. No bribe attempts or
             blubbering. He simply said,
             "Please. Please, I need to live."
             It was the "please" that caught
             my memory.

                         MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
             I asked him what was so important
             for him. "True love," he replied.
             And then he spoke of a girl of
             surpassing beauty and faithfulness.
             I can only assume he meant you.
             You should bless me for destroying
             him before he found out what you
             really are.

                         BUTTERCUP
             And what am I?

                         MAN IN BLACK
             Faithfulness he talked of, madam.
             Your enduring faithfulness. Now,
             tell me truly. When you found out
             he was gone, did you get engaged
             to your prince that same hour, or
             did you wait a whole week out of
             respect for the dead?

                         BUTTERCUP
             You mocked me once, never do it
             again -- I died that day!

The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on
the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his
attention and as he stares at it briefly,

                                            CUT TO:

HIS P.O.V.:

The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up
into the sky.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high,
she pushes him with all the strength she has.

                         BUTTERCUP
             You can die too, for all I care!!

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAN IN BLACK

teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins
to fall. Down goes the Man In Black.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           54.


Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward
the flat rock floor of the ravine.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

staring transfixed at what she has wrought.

There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far
below the words come to her, drifting on the wind --

                         MAN IN BLACK
             ... as ... you ... wish...

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I
             done?

And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers,
she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is
falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn,
cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved.

                                            CUT TO:

THE DUST CLOUD

rising.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot
where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom.
The Prince shakes his head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Disappeared. He must have seen us
             closing in, which might account
             for his panicking in error.
             Unless I'm wrong, and I am never
             wrong, they are headed dead into
             the fire swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale.

THE RAVINE FLOOR

TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. It is, of
course, Buttercup and Westley. They might be corpses. After
a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he
does,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her.

                         WESTLEY
             Can you move at all?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (weakly stretching out
                  an arm toward him)
             Move? You're alive. If you want,
             I can fly.

                         WESTLEY
             I told you, "I would always come
             for you." Why didn't you wait for
             me?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well ... you were dead.

                         WESTLEY
             Death cannot stop true love. All
             it can do is delay it for a while.

                         BUTTERCUP
             I will never doubt again.

                         WESTLEY
             There will never be a need.

And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and
loving and gentle and --

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             Oh no. No, please.

                                            CUT TO:

                         THE KID
             They're kissing again, do we have
             to hear the kissing part?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Someday, you may not mind so much.

                         THE KID
             Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that
             sounded good.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you.
                  (he picks up the book again)
             So now, where were we here? Yeah,
             yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley
             and Buttercup raced along the
             ravine floor.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up.

Buttercup.

             Ha. Your pig fiance is too late.
             A few more steps and we'll be
             safe in the Fire Swamp.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and Westley has tried to say it with Chevalier-like
nonchalance, but she ain't buying.

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never survive.

                         WESTLEY
             Nonsense -- you're only saying
             that because no one ever has.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.


As they race off, leaving Humperdinck and his men stranded,
defeated.

                                            CUT TO:

THE FIRE SWAMP

And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist,
sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great
trees block the sun.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but
he moves jauntily along, sword in hand.

                         WESTLEY
             It's not that bad. I'm not saying
             I'd like to build a summer home
             here, but the trees are actually
             quite lovely.

THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell
and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun.

A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight
popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses
Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the
lower half of her is and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming
hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This
isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he
does his best to sound as jaunty as before.

                         WESTLEY
             Well now, that was an adventure.

He examines where the flames burst over her.

                         WESTLEY
             Singed a bit, were you?

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (She wasn't and she
                  shakes her head "no")
             You?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.


He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her
feet --

                                            CUT TO:

THE SWAMP FLOOR

-- and as there's another popping sound,

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP

pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame
suddenly shoots up.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, one thing I will say. The
             Fire Swamp certainly does keep
             you on your toes.

Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently
leads her forward as we-

                                            CUT TO:

THE TWO OF THEM

moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of
the Fire Swamp.

It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different
angle.

                         WESTLEY
                  (happily)
             This will all soon be but a happy
             memory because Roberts' ship
             "Revenge" is anchored at the far
             end. And I, as you know, am
             Roberts.

                         BUTTERCUP
             But how is that possible, since
             he's been marauding twenty years
             and you only left me five years
             ago?

                         WESTLEY
             I myself am often surprised at
             life's little quirks.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.


There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame.
Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves
her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking
without missing a beat.

                         WESTLEY
             You see, what I told you before
             about saying "please" was true.
             It intrigued Roberts, as did my
             descriptions of your beauty.

                                            CUT TO:

SOME HIDEOUS VINES --

they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his
sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as
they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time.

                         WESTLEY
             Finally, Roberts decided something.
             He said, "All right, Westley,
             I've never had a valet. You can
             try it for tonight. I'll most
             likely kill you in the morning."
             Three years he said that. "Good
             night, Westley. Good work. Sleep
             well. I'll most likely kill you
             in the morning." It was a fine
             time for me. I was learning to
             fence, to fight, anything anyone
             would teach me. And Roberts and I
             eventually became friends. And
             then it happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What? -- go on --

Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water
that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, Roberts had grown so rich,
             he wanted to retire. So he took
             me to his cabin and told me his
             secret. "I am not the Dread
             Pirate Roberts," he said. "My
             name is Ryan. I inherited this
             ship from the previous Dread
             Pirate Roberts, just as you will
             inherit it from me. The man I
             inherited it from was not the
             real Dread Pirate Roberts, either.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           60.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             His name was Cummerbund. The real
             Roberts has been retired fifteen
             years and living like a king in
             Patagonia." Then he explained the
             name was the important thing for
             inspiring the necessary fear. You
             see, no one would surrender to
             the Dread Pirate Westley.

The two of them have by now crossed the pond.

                         WESTLEY
             So we sailed ashore, took on an
             entirely new crew and he stayed
             aboard for awhile as first mate,
             all the time calling me Roberts.
             Once the crew believed, he left
             the ship and I have been Roberts
             ever since. Except, now that
             we're together, I shall retire
             and hand the name over to someone
             else. Is everything clear to you?

Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she
steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch
of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she
sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is
gone as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY WHIRLING

slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still
connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword,
and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the
lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder,
but it settles quickly.

Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning
sand, lovely and lethal.

HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN --

An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is
suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into
view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably
no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs
around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           61.


THE LIGHTNING SAND

as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes
out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls
to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine --

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE-UP - BUTTERCUP

Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes,
her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but
you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues
to pull them to safety --

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

high above them; it watches --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning
sand from her face. He hesitates, glances around and

                                            CUT TO:

THE R.0.U.S.

on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley.

Westley stares back up at the beast. Buttercup is oblivious.
Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as --

                         BUTTERCUP
             We'll never succeed -- we may as
             well die here.

                         WESTLEY
             No. No. We have already succeeded.

He glances back again. Now THERE ARE TWO R.0.U.S.'s. The
have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, picking her up.

He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he
encouragingly goes on talking.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           62.


                         WESTLEY
             I mean, what are the three
             terrors of the Fire Swamp? One,
             the flame spurts. No problem.
             There's a popping sound preceding
             each, we can avoid that. Two, the
             Lightning Sand. But you were
             clever enough to discover what
             that looks like, so in the future
             we can avoid that too.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?

                         WESTLEY
             Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't
             think they exist...

And as he says that, a R.0.U.S. comes flying at him from
offscreen.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

screaming and --

Westley, pinned under the attacking R.0.U.S., trying to fend
it off. Can't. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. He
howls.

Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off.
He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the
R.0.U.S. is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just
when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly
rodent clear.

Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.0.U.S. stampedes on,
changing its target, heading right for --

Buttercup, and she's scared to death and --

                         BUTTERCUP
             Westley!

Westley abandons his sword, reaching for the rodent, grabbing
only a tail, wrestling with it. Buttercup grabs a small
branch, and using it as a club, beats the skull of the
thing, doing pretty well, but the beast manages to snag her
hem with its razor teeth, and she's pulled to the ground, and

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           63.


WESTLEY

jumping onto its back, and the R.0.U.S. is all over him now,
sinking needle teeth into Westley's shoulder.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with death close at hand, as a popping sound starts. He
tries one desperate move, rolls into the sound --

                                            CUT TO:

A FLAME SPURT

shooting skyward and --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

with the R.0.U.S. pinned under him, and as the beast bursts
into flame, it lets go and Westley rolls safely free, grabs
his sword and exhaustedly stabs the R.0.U.S., which is
trying to put itself out.

The R.0.U.S. collapses dead. Westley stands motionless,
exhausted. The danger has passed.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

relieved.

                                            DISSOLVE TO:

THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP

Beyond, a beach.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (almost in disbelief)
             We did it.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, was that so terrible?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.


And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace,
and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp --

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED:

Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS,
armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup
and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to
leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion.
Westley looks worse.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Surrender!

It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

staring out at the others.

                         WESTLEY
             You mean you wish to surrender to
             me? Very well, I accept.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I give you full marks for
             bravery --don't make yourself a
             fool.

                         WESTLEY
             Ah, but how will you capture us?
             We know the secrets of the Fire
             Swamp. We can live there quite
             happily for some time. So,
             whenever you feel like dying,
             feel free to visit.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I tell you once again -- surrender!

                         WESTLEY
             It will not happen!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking from one to the other; then something else catches
her eye and we --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           65.


AN ARMED WARRIOR

in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

looking the other way --

                                            CUT TO:

ANOTHER WARRIOR

crossbow aimed at Westley.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (roaring)
             For the last time -- SURRENDER!

                         WESTLEY
                  (roaring right back, bigger)
             DEATH FIRST!!

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

frantically staring around, and now

                                            CUT TO:

A THIRD WARRIOR

crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a
tree blocking any escape Westley might try.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Will you promise not to hurt him?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

whirling to face her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

whirling to face her.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           66.


                         WESTLEY
             What was that?

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

talking to them both.

                         BUTTERCUP
             If we surrender, and I return
             with you, will you promise not to
             hurt this man?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             May I live a thousand years and
             never hunt again.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (looks at Westley)
             He is a sailor on the pirate ship
             "Revenge." Promise to return him
             to his ship.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

staring deep into each other's eyes.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND RUGEN

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whispering)
             Once we're out of sight, take him
             back to Florin and throw him in
             the Pit of Despair.

                         RUGEN
                  (almost a smile)
             I swear it will be done.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

                         BUTTERCUP
             I thought you were dead once, and
             it almost destroyed me. I could
             not bear it if you died again,
             not when I could save you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           67.


Westley is dazed. Silent.

Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off
her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring
Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it
in his hand.

                         RUGEN
             Come, sir. We must get you to
             your ship.

                         WESTLEY
             We are men of action. Lies do not
             become us.

                         RUGEN
             Well spoken, sir --

Westley is looking at him.

                         RUGEN
             -- what is it?

                         WESTLEY
             You have six fingers on your
             right hand -- someone was looking
             for you --

Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley
starts to fall --the screen goes black.

FADE IN ON:

THE PIT OF DESPAIR

Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering
torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the
cage, chained and helpless.

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING REALLY FRIGHTENING: A BLOODLESS-LOOKING ALBINO

Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of
food and medication. He puts it down.

                         WESTLEY
             Where am I?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           68.


                         ALBINO
                  (he only whispers)
             The Pit of Despair.

He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces.

                         ALBINO
                  (garbled)
             Don't even think --
                  (A hack, sputter,
                  cough - now his voice
                  seems normal again)
             -- don't even think about trying
             to escape. The chains are far too
             thick. And don't dream of being
             rescued either. The only way in
             is secret. And only the Prince,
             the Count, and I know how to get
             in and out.

                         WESTLEY
             Then I'm here till I die?

                         ALBINO
                  (working away)
             Till they kill you. Yeah.

                         WESTLEY
             Then why bother curing me?

                         ALBINO
             The Prince and the Count always
             insist on everyone being healthy
             before they're broken.

                         WESTLEY
             So it's to be torture.

The albino nods.

                         WESTLEY
             I can cope with torture.

The albino shakes his head.

                         WESTLEY
             You don't believe me?

                         ALBINO
             You survived the Fire Swamp. You
             must be very brave...
                  (little pause)
             ... but nobody withstands The
             Machine.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.


He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a
corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an
intersecting corridor:

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN

watching her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She's been like that ever since
             the Fire Swamp.
                  (looks at Rugen)
             It's my father's failing health
             that's upsetting her.

                         RUGEN
                  (unbelieving)
             Of course.

As they move on--

                                            CUT TO:

FLORIN CASTLE - NIGHT

CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice
reading.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             The King died that very night,
             and before the following dawn,
             Buttercup and Humperdinck were
             married.

                                            CUT TO:

MAIN SQUARE OF FLORIN CASTLE

And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how
many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen
and the Queen stand high on the balcony.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           70.


                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             And at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were...

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- hold it. Hold it, Grandpa.

And the scene FREEZES, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly
stronger than when we first saw him.

                         THE KID
             You read that wrong. She doesn't
             marry Humperdinck, she marries
             Westley. I'm just sure of it.
             After all that Westley did for
             her, if she does not marry him,
             it wouldn't be fair.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Well, who says life is fair?
             Where is that written? Life isn't
             always fair.

                         THE KID
             I'm telling you you're messing up
             the story, now get it right!

                         GRANDFATHER
             Do you want me to go on with this?

                         THE KID
             Yes.

                         GRANDFATHER
             All right, then. No more
             interruptions.
                  (starts to read again)
             ... at noon, she met her subjects
             again. This time as their Queen.

And on these words--

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           71.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

                         HUMPERDINCK
             My father's final words were
             "love her as I loved her, and
             there will be joy." I present to
             you your Queen. Queen Buttercup.

And on his words--

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

and it's gigantic.

                                            CUT TO:

THE ARCHWAY

we saw before, as Buttercup emerges.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent
KNEELING PEOPLE. All of them down.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we

                                            CUT TO:

THE CROWD

SOMEONE IS BOOING! The BOOING gets louder as an ANCIENT
WOMAN approaches Buttercup through the crowd, BOOING every
step of the way.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why do you do this?

                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Because you had love in your
             hands, and you gave it up.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (distraught)
             But they would have killed
             Westley if I hadn't done it.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           72.


                         ANCIENT BOOER
             Your true love lives and you
             marry another --
                  (to the crowd)
             -- True love saved her in the
             Fire Swamp, and she treated it
             like garbage. And that's what she
             is, the Queen of Refuse! So, bow
             down to her if you want. Bow to
             her. Bow to the Queen of Slime,
             the Queen of Filth, the Queen of
             Putrescence. Boo! Boo! Rubbish!
             Filth! Slime! Muck! Boo! Boo!

She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked.

CLOSE-UP - THE ANCIENT BOOER

Louder and louder and LOUDER she shrieks vituperation at
Buttercup, reaching out her old hands toward Buttercup's
throat, and Buttercup is as frightened now as Dorothy was
when the Witch went after her in "The Wizard of Oz", and
suddenly,

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As
she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen, still reading)
             It was ten days till the wedding.
             The King still lived, but
             Buttercup's nightmares were
             growing steadily worse.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             See? Didn't I tell you she'd
             never marry that rotten
             Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             -- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands
nearby.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           73.


                         BUTTERCUP
             It comes to this: I love Westley.
             I always have. I know now I
             always will. If you tell me I
             must marry you in ten days,
             please believe I will be dead by
             morning.

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I could never cause you grief;
             consider our wedding off.
                  (to Rugen)
             You returned this Westley to his
             ship?

                         RUGEN
             Yes.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Then we will simply alert him.
                  (to Buttercup now)
             Beloved, are you certain he still
             wants you? After all, it was you
             who did the leaving in the Fire
             Swamp. Not to mention that
             pirates are not known to be men
             of their words.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will always come for me.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I suggest a deal. You write four
             copies of a letter. I'll send my
             four fastest ships. One in each
             direction. The Dread Pirate
             Roberts is always close to Florin
             this time of year. We'll run up
             the white flag and deliver your
             message. If Westley wants you,
             bless you both. If not ... please
             consider me as an alternative to
             suicide. Are we agreed?

And she nods --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           74.


A VERY THICK GROVE OF TREES

The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are
extraordinarily heavily knotted.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees.

                         RUGEN
             Your Princess is really a winning
             creature. A trifle simple,
             perhaps, but her appeal is
             undeniable.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Oh, I know. The people are quite
             taken with her. It's odd, but
             when I hired Vizzini to have her
             murdered on our engagement day, I
             thought that was clever. But it's
             going to be so much more moving
             when I strangle her on our
             wedding night. Once Guilder is
             blamed, the nation will be truly
             outraged. They'll demand we go to
             war.

They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around.

                         RUGEN
             Now, where is that secret knot?
             It's impossible to find.
                  (Finding the knot on
                  the tree he hits it,
                  and it opens, revealing
                  a staircase leading underground.)
             Are you coming down into the Pit?
             Westley's got his strength back.
             I am starting him on The Machine
             tonight.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Tyrone, you know how much I love
             watching you work. But, I've got
             my country's five hundredth
             anniversary to plan, my wedding
             to arrange, My wife to murder,
             and Guilder to frame for it. I'm
             swamped.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.


                         RUGEN
             Get some rest -- if you haven't
             got your health, you haven't got
             anything.

Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides
back perfectly into place.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ENORMOUS THING

We can't tell quite what it is or what it does, but somehow
it is unsettling.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing --
Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there.

                         RUGEN
             Beautiful, isn't it?

The Albino starts attaching suction cups to Westley.

                         RUGEN
             It took me half a lifetime to
             invent it. I'm sure you've
             discovered my deep and abiding
             interest in pain. At present I'm
             writing the definitive work on

             totally honest with me on how The
             Machine makes you feel.

He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his
heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of
himself

the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the
wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going.

pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides.
Rugen opens the book to a blank page.

             As you know, the concept of the
             suction pump is centuries old.
             Well, really, that's all this is.
             Except that instead of sucking
             water, I'm sucking life. I've
             just sucked one year of your life
             away. I might one day go as high
             as five, but I really don't know
             what that would do to you. So,
             let's just start with what we
             have. What did this do to you?

Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write.

             killers from Guilder are
             infiltrating the Thieves' Forest
             and plan to murder my bride on
             our wedding night.

                         YELLIN
             My spy network has heard no such

             Of course.

As she glides out--

                         HUMPERDINCK
             She will not be murdered. On the
             day of the wedding, I want the
             Thieves' Forest emptied and every
             inhabitant arrested.

                         YELLIN
             Many of the thieves will resist.
             My regular enforcers will be
             inadequate.

             Form a Brute Squad then. I want
             the Thieves' Forest emptied
             before I wed.

                         YELLIN
             It won't be easy, Sire.

THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY

A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being
rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men.
Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling.

                  (off-screen)
             The day of the wedding arrived.
             The Brute Squad had their hands
             full carrying out Humperdinck's
             orders.

                         YELLIN
                  (to an unpleasantlooking
                  assistant)
             Is everybody out?

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Almost. There's a Spaniard giving
             us some trouble.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           79.


                         YELLIN
             Well, you give him some trouble.
             Move!

And his wagon starts, and as it does,

INIGO

drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of
brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He
looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. But the way he
brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone
cause for worry.

                         INIGO
             I am waiting for you, Vizzini.
             You told me to go back to the
             beginning. So I have. This is
             where I am, and this is where
             I'll stay. I will not be moved.

He takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. He stops as the
Assistant Brute comes into view.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             Ho there.

                         INIGO
             I do not budge. Keep your "Ho
             there."

He waves his sword dangerously.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
             But the Prince gave orders --

                         INIGO
             -- So did Vizzini -- when a job
             went wrong, you went back to the
             beginning. And this is where we
             got the job. So it's the
             beginning, and I'm staying till
             Vizzini comes.

                         ASSISTANT BRUTE
                  (gesturing off-screen)
             You! Brute! Come here.

             Vizzini --

                         VOICE
                  (off-screen)
             You surely are a meanie.

INIGO feels a hand on his back. A huge hand. He compares it
to his own smaller hand.

                         FEZZIK
             Hello.

                         INIGO
             It's you.

                         FEZZIK
             True!

And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's
brains out, FEZZIK lets fly with a stupendous punch.

The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right
in the chops. It's like he was shot from a cannon as he
careens backwards out of sight across the street.

There is a pause. Then a crunching sound, as he clearly has
come in contact with something hard and immobile.

FEZZIK puts Inigo down.

                         FEZZIK
             You don't look so good.
                  (after Inigo blasts
                  air in protest)
             You don't smell so good either.

                         INIGO
             Perhaps not. I feel fine.

                         FEZZIK
             Yeah?

And so FEZZIK puts Inigo down. That's when Inigo faints, and
as he does,

stew.

                  (off-screen)
             FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited.
             And as FEZZIK nursed his
             inebriated friend back to health,
             he told Inigo of Vizzini's death
             and the existence of Count Rugen,
             the sixfingered man. Considering
             Inigo's lifelong search, he
             handled the news surprisingly well.

And he faints again into his stew.

TWO LARGE TUBS

one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly
of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head
into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time,
pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a
short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then
back in the hot --

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Fezzik took great care in reviving
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
                  (up and going)
             That's enough. That's enough!
             Where is this Rugen so I may kill
             him?

                         FEZZIK
             He's with the Prince in the
             Castle. But the castle gate is
             guarded by thirty men.

                         INIGO
             How many could you handle?

                         FEZZIK
             I don't think more than ten.

                         INIGO
                  (doing the math on his fingers)
             That leaves twenty for me. At my
             best, I could never defeat that
             many.
                  (he sinks sadly down)
             I need Vizzini to plan. I have no
             gift for strategy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.


                         FEZZIK
             But Vizzini's dead.

Silent and bereft. Then a wild look hits Inigo.

                         INIGO
             No -- not Vizzini -- I need the
             Man in Black --

             -- what? --

             -- look, he bested you with
             strength, your greatness. He
             bested me with steel. He must
             have outthought Vizzini, and a
             man who can do that can plan my
             castle's onslaught any day. Let's
             go --

                         FEZZIK
             -- where?

                         INIGO
             To find the Man in Black,
             obviously.

                         FEZZIK
             But you don't know where he is.

             Don't bother me with trifles;

             The Thieves' Forest is emptied.
             Thirty men guard the castle gate.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Double it. My Princess must be
             safe.

                         YELLIN
             The gate has but one key, and I
             carry that.

He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck.
Just at that moment, Buttercup enters.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we
             marry. Tomorrow morning, your men
             will escort us to Florin Channel
             where every ship in my armada
             waits to accompany us on our

             Every ship but your four fastest,
             you mean.

The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Every ship but the four you sent.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally,
             not those four.

             You never sent the ships. Don't
             bother lying. It doesn't matter.
             Westley will come for me anyway.

             You're a silly girl.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Yes, I am a silly girl, for not

HUMPERDINCK

her along, out of control, his words indistinct.

                                            CUT TO:

A CORRIDOR OF THE CASTLE

as the Prince throws open the door to Buttercup's room,
slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           85.


WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE

but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his
book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the
steps, raging.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (at Westley)
             You truly love each other, and so
             you might have been truly happy.
             Not one couple in a century has
             that chance, no matter what the
             storybooks say. And so I think no
             man in a century will suffer as
             greatly as you will.

And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the
lever and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

calling out --

                         RUGEN
             Not to fifty!!!

But it's too late as we --

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

shoving the lever all the way up and

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY'S FACE

And there has never been such pain. The pain grows and grows
and with it now, something else has started

THE DEATH SCREAM. As The Death Scream starts to rise --

                                            CUT TO:

OUTSIDE THE PIT OF DESPAIR

as the SOUND moves along, LOUDER AND LOUDER, and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           86.


YELLIN AND HIS SIXTY BRUTES

and they bear it, and a few of the Brutes turn to each other
in fear, and as the scream builds --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP IN HER ROOM

and she hears the SOUND, doesn't know what it is, but her
arms involuntarily go around her body to try to control the
trembling, and the scream, still builds and --

                                            CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING SHOT ACROSS THE RIVER

There are many PEOPLE --it is the day of the country's 500th
Anniversary -- but all the People stop as the sound hits
them. A few CHILDREN pale, bolt toward their PARENTS and --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

trying to make their way through the jammed marketplace,
which suddenly quiets as the fading sound comes through.

                         INIGO
                  (instantly)


FEZZIK, FEZZIK, listen, do you hear? -- That is the sound of
ultimate suffering. My heart made that sound when Rugen
slaughtered my father. The Man in Black makes it now.

                         FEZZIK
             The Man in Black?

                         INIGO
             His true love is marrying another
             tonight, so who else has cause
             for Ultimate Suffering?
                  (trying to push through)
             Excuse me --

It's too crowded.

                         INIGO
             -- pardon me, it's important --

No one budges and the sound is fading faster.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           87.


                         INIGO
             -- Fezzik, please --

                         FEZZIK
                  (gigantic and roaring)
             Everybody ... MOVE!!

And the Crowd begins to fall away, and he and Inigo start to
track the FADING SOUND.

                         INIGO
             Thank you.

                                            CUT TO:

A GROVE OF TREES NEAR THE PIT OF DESPAIR

The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. Inigo's sword pushes
at his chest.

                         INIGO
             Where is the Man in Black?

The Albino shakes his head, says nothing.

                         INIGO
             You get there from this grove, yes?

Silence.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, jog his memory.

And Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if
he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops
without a sound.

                         FEZZIK
                  (upset)
             I'm sorry, Inigo. I didn't mean
             to jog him so hard. Inigo?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes
closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his
voice low and strange.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           88.


                         INIGO
             Father, I have failed you for
             twenty years. Now our misery can
             end. Somewhere ... somewhere
             close by is a man who can help us.
             I cannot find him alone. I need
             you. I need you to guide my sword.
             Please.

And now he rises, eyes still closed.

                         INIGO
             Guide my sword.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GROVE OF TREES

as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword
held in his hands.

Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind.

                                            CUT TO:

THE SECRET KNOT

that reveals the staircase.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the
Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it.

Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen.
Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes
home dead center into a knot and --

Nothing. He has failed.

In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a
knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides
away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each
other, then start down.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a
heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           89.


                         FEZZIK
             He's dead.

Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
                  (barely able to speak)
             It just is not fair.

                         THE KID
                  (off-screen)
             -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet
seen him.

                         THE KID
             -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean,
             "He's dead?" I mean he didn't
             mean dead.

The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there.

                         THE KID
             Westley's only faking, right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             You want me to read this or not?

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID: CLOSE UP

                         THE KID
             Who gets Humperdinck?

                         GRANDFATHER
             I don't understand.

                         THE KID
             Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At
             the end, somebody's got to do it.
             Is it Inigo? Who?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.


                         THE KID
             You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa!
             What did you read me this thing
             for?

And he desperately fights for control.

                         GRANDFATHER
             You know, you've been very sick
             and you're taking this story very
             seriously. I think we better stop
             now.

He closes the book and starts to get up.

                         THE KID
                  (shaking his head)
             No! I'm okay. I'm okay.
                  (gestures toward the chair)
             -- sit down. All right?

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.
                  (sitting and opening
                  the book again)
             All right, now, let's see. Where
             were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of
             Despair.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO, IN DESPAIR

We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a
moment, he just sags.

                         INIGO
             Well, we Montoyas have never
             taken defeat easily. Come along,
             Fezzik. Bring the body.

                         FEZZIK
             The body?

                         INIGO
                  (not stopping)
             Have you any money?

                         FEZZIK
             I have a little.

                         INIGO
             I just hope it's enough to buy a
             miracle, that's all.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.


As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs --

                                            CUT TO:

A HOVEL - DUSK

Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From
inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel
Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy.

                         LITTLE OLD GUY
                  (off-screen)
             Go away!

Inigo pounds again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening a small
                  window in the door)
             What? What?

                         INIGO
             Are you the Miracle Max who
             worked for the King all those
             years?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             The King's stinking son fired me.
             And thank you so much for bringing
             up such a painful subject. While
             you're at it, why don't you give
             me a nice paper cut and pour
             lemon juice on it? We're closed!

He shuts the window. They rap on the door.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (opening the window)
             Beat it or I'll call the Brute
             Squad.

                         FEZZIK
             I'm on the Brute Squad.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (looking at the Giant)
             You are the Brute Squad.

                         INIGO
             We need a miracle. It's very
             important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           92.


                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look, I'm retired. And besides,
             why would you want someone the
             King's stinking son fired? I
             might kill whoever you wanted me
             to miracle.

                         INIGO
             He's already dead.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (for the first time, interested)
             He is, eh? I'll take a look.
             Bring him in.

He unlocks the door and lets them in.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND FEZZIK

hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting
to stiffen up a little. He lays Westley down across a bench
by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop
limp.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             I've seen worse.

He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there.

                         INIGO
             Sir. Sir.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Hah?

                         INIGO
             We're really in a terrible rush.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (He takes nothing from nobody)
             Don't rush me, sonny. You rush a
             miracle man, you get rotten
             miracles. You got money?

                         INIGO
             Sixty-five.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sheesh! I never worked for so
             little, except once, and that was
             a very noble cause.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.


                         INIGO
             This is noble, sir.
                  (pointing to Westley, remorseful)
             His wife is crippled. His children
             are on the brink of starvation.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Are you a rotten liar.

                         INIGO
             I need him to help avenge my
             father, murdered these twenty
             years.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Your first story was better.
                  (looking around)
             Where's that bellows?
                  (spots it)
             He probably owes you money, huh?
             Well, I'll ask him.

He goes to get a huge bellows.

                         INIGO
                  (stupefied)
             He's dead. He can't talk.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Look who knows so much. Well, it
             just so happens that your friend
             here is only mostly dead. There's
             a big difference between mostly
             dead and all dead. Please open
             his mouth.

Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and
starts to pump.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Now, mostly dead is slightly
             alive. Now, all dead...well, with
             all dead, there's usually only
             one thing that you can do.

                         INIGO
             What's that?

He stops pumping.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Go through his clothes and look
             for loose change.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           94.


He starts pumping again.

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Westley)
             Hey! Hello in there. Hey! What's
             so important? What you got here
             that's worth living for?

And he presses lightly on Westley's chest.

                         WESTLEY
             ... tr ... oooo .... luv...

Everybody stares at Westley lying there on the bench.

                         INIGO
             True love. You heard him. You
             could not ask for a more noble
             cause than that.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Sonny, true love is the greatest
             thing in the world. Except for a
             nice MLT, a mutton, lettuce and
             tomato sandwich, where the mutton
             is nice and lean and the tomato
             is ripe. They're so perky, I love
             that. But that's not what he said.
             He distinctly said "to blave."
             And, as we all know, "to blave"
             means "to bluff." So you're
             probably playing cards, and he
             cheated

                         A WOMAN'S VOICE
             -- Liar -- LIAR-LI-A-A-AR --

VALERIE, an ancient fury, storms out of a back room and
toward

                         MIRACLE MAX
             -- get back, witch --

                         VALERIE
             I'm not a witch, I'm your wife.
             But after what you just said, I'm
             not even sure I want to be that
             anymore.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             You never had it so good.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.


                         VALERIE
             "True love." He said, "true
             love," Max. My God --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (retreating)
             Don't say another word, Valerie.

                         VALERIE
                  (turning to Inigo and Fezzik)
             He's afraid. Ever since Prince
             Humperdinck fired him, his
             confidence is shattered.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Why'd you say that name -- you
             promised me that you would never
             say that name --

                         VALERIE
                  (pursuing him now)
             What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck.
             Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (holding his hands
                  over his ears)
             I'm not listening.

                         VALERIE
             A life expiring and you don't
             have the decency to say why you
             won't help --

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Nobody's hearing nothing!

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck!
             Humperdinck!

                         INIGO
             -- But this is Buttercup's true
             love -- If you heal him, he will
             stop Humperdinck's wedding.

                         VALERIE
             Humperdinck. Humperdinck --

                         MIRACLE MAX
                  (to Valerie)
             Shut up --
                  (now to Inigo)
             Wait. Wait. I make him better,
             Humperdinck suffers?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           96.


                         INIGO
             Humiliations galore!

                         MIRACLE MAX
             That is a noble cause. Give me
             the sixty-five, I'm on the job.

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we

                                            CUT TO:

THIS LUMP

It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at
the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking
utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like
chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more
dubiously.

                         INIGO
                  (a little appalled)
             That's a miracle pill?

Max nods.

                         VALERIE
                  (finishing)
             The chocolate coating makes it go
             down easier. But you have to wait
             fifteen minutes for full potency.
             And you shouldn't go swimming
             after, for at least, what?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             An hour.

                         VALERIE
             Yeah, an hour.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             A good hour. Yeah.

Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff
as a board now.

                         INIGO
                  (heading out the door,
                  Fezzik close behind)
             Thank you for everything.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Okay.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.


                         VALERIE
                  (waving after them)
             Bye-bye, boys.

                         MIRACLE MAX
             Have fun storming the castle.

                         VALERIE
                  (to Max)
             Think it'll work?

                         MIRACLE MAX
             It would take a miracle. Bye!

                         VALERIE
             Bye.

And as they wave, trying to look happy we --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, INIGO, AND WESTLEY

on the top of the outer wall of the castle. They look down
to the front gate of the castle. The sixty Brutes are visible.

FEZZIK is thunderstruck by how many Brutes there are. Upset,
he turns to Inigo, who is concentrating unsuccessfully,
trying to prop Westley against the wall.

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo -- there's more than
             thirty --

                         INIGO
                  (absolutely unfazed)
             What's the difference?
                  (indicating the half-
                  dead Westley)
             We've got him. Help me here.
             We'll have to force feed him.

                         FEZZIK
             Has it been fifteen minutes?

                         INIGO
             We can't wait -- the wedding's in
             half an hour and we must strike
             in the hustle and the bustle
             beforehand.

During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to
get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while
Inigo brings out the miracle pill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           98.


                         INIGO
             Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.

                         FEZZIK
                  (following orders)
             How long do we have to wait
             before we know if the miracle
             works?

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth.

                         INIGO
             Your guess is as good as mine --

                         WESTLEY
                  (frantic)
             I'll beat you both apart. I'll
             take you both together.

                         FEZZIK
             Guess not very long.

Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed.

                         WESTLEY
             Why won't my arms move?

He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy.

                         FEZZIK
             You've been mostly dead all day.

                         INIGO
             We had Miracle Max make a pill to
             bring you back.

                         WESTLEY
             Who are you? -- Are we enemies?
             Why am I on this wall? -- Where's
             Buttercup? --

                         INIGO
             Let me explain --
                  (pauses very briefly)
             -- No, there is too much. Let me
             sum up.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.


                         INIGO (CONT'D)
             Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck
             in a little less than half an
             hour, so all we have to do is get
             in, break up the wedding, steal
             the Princess, make our escape
             after I kill Count Rugen.

                         WESTLEY
             That doesn't leave much time for
             dilly dallying.

He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now.

                         FEZZIK
             You've just wiggled your finger.
             That's wonderful.

                         WESTLEY
             I've always been a quick healer.
                  (to Inigo)
             What are our liabilities?

                         INIGO
             There is but one working castle
             gate.

Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can
see for himself.

                         INIGO
             And it is guarded by sixty men.

                         WESTLEY
             And our assets?

                         INIGO
             Your brains, Fezzik's strength,
             my steel.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

absolutely stunned.

                         WESTLEY
             That's it? Impossible. If I had a
             month to plan, maybe I could come
             up with something. But this...

He shakes his head from side to side.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          100.


INIGO AND FEZZIK

                         FEZZIK
                  (trying to be cheery)
             You just shook your head -- that
             doesn't make you happy?

                         WESTLEY
             My brains, his steel, and your
             strength against sixty men, and
             you think a little head jiggle is
             supposed to make me happy? I
             mean, if we only had a
             wheelbarrow, that would be
             something.

                         INIGO
             Where did we put that wheelbarrow
             the Albino had?

                         FEZZIK
             Over the Albino, I think.

                         WESTLEY
             Well, why didn't you list that
             among our assets in the first
             place? What I wouldn't give for a
             holocaust cloak.

                         INIGO
             There we cannot help you.

                         FEZZIK
                  (pulling one out)
             Will this do?

                         INIGO
                  (to Fezzik-- surprised)
             Where did you get that?

                         FEZZIK
             At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice,
             he said I could keep it.

                         WESTLEY
             All right, all right. Come on,
             help me up.

Inigo and Fezzik do.

                         WESTLEY
             Now, I'll need a sword eventually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          101.


                         INIGO
             Why? You can't even lift one.

                         WESTLEY
             True, but that's hardly common
             knowledge, is it?
                  (And his bead tilts
                  limply back. Fezzik
                  sets it up right for him)
             Thank you. Now, there may be
             problems once we're inside.

                         INIGO
             I'll say -- how do I find the
             Count? -- Once I do, how do I
             find you again? -- Once I find
             you again, how do we escape? --

                         FEZZIK
                  (sharply)
             Don't pester him, he's had a hard
             day.

                         INIGO
                  (nods)
             Right, right, sorry.

                                            CUT TO:

A SHOT OF THE THREE OF THEM IN PROFILE

They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these
words come to us on the wind --

                         FEZZIK
             Inigo.

                         INIGO
             What?

                         FEZZIK
             I hope we win...

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her
beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             You don't seem excited, my little
             muffin.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Should I be?

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Brides often are, I'm told.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (gently, confidently)
             I do not marry tonight.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

and she couldn't seem more serene.

                         BUTTERCUP
             My Westley will save me.

                                            CUT TO:

HER WESTLEY

looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE

-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK

looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake
hands.

Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back
and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his
arm over and onto his friend's.

                                            CUT TO:

AN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing
CLERGYMAN imaginable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          103.


Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind
them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the
back is Count Rugen.

FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
                  (clears his throat,
                  begins to speak)
             Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings
             us togewer today...

He has an impediment that would stop a clock.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement,
             that dweam wiffim a dweam...

And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a
commotion. And then--

                         YELLIN
                  (off-screen)
             Stand your ground, men. Stand
             your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES AND YELLIN

by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the
commotion, frightened, pointing.

                         YELLIN
             Stand your ground.

                                            CUT TO:

THEIR P.O.V.:

And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating
toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak,
and with a voice that would crumble walls.

                         FEZZIK
                  (deep and booming)
             I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS.
             THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          104.


FEZZIK

and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the
wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by
pushing it and supporting Westley.

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Not yet.

                                            CUT TO:

THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

                         FEZZIK
             MY MEN ARE HERE, AND I AM HERE,
             BUT SOON YOU WILL NOT BE HERE

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting
orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold. Now --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY

Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight --

                         INIGO
             Now?

                         WESTLEY
             Light him.

                                            CUT TO:

THE BRUTES

as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames.

                         FEZZIK
                  (roaring)
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS TAKES NO
             SURVIVORS. ALL YOUR WORST
             NIGHTMARES ARE ABOUT TO COME TRUE.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          105.


                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... Ven wuv, twoo wuv, wiw fowwow
             you fowever..

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, turning quickly, giving a sharp nod to
Count Rugen, who immediately takes off out of the chapel
with the Four Guards as we

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK, flaming and scary as hell.

                         FEZZIK
             THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS IS HERE
             FOR YOUR SOULS!

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

as suddenly the Brutes just scream and take off in wild
panic --

                         YELLIN
             Stay where you are. I said stay
             where you are!

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE CHAPEL

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             ... so tweasuwe your vruv..

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Skip to the end.

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Have you the wing?

As Humperdinck whips out the ring, the screams are very loud
outside.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Here comes my Westley now.

                                            CUT TO:

Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak.

                         WESTLEY
             FEZZIK, the portcullis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          106.


And FEZZIK rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is
indeed closing quickly.

FEZZIK grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward.
Yellin just watches in fear.

                                            CUT TO:

THE CHAPEL

as Humperdinck shoves the ring on Buttercup's finger

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Your Westley is dead.

Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I killed him myself.

                         BUTTERCUP
                  (never more serene)
             Then why is there fear behind
             your eyes?

                                            CUT TO:

PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

And she's right. It's there.

                                            CUT TO:

YELLIN

pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK
close in.

                         WESTLEY
             Give us the gate key.

                         YELLIN
                  (every ounce of
                  honesty he's got)
             I have no gate key.

                         INIGO
             Fezzik, tear his arms off.

FEZZIK

steps toward him.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          107.


                         YELLIN
             Oh, you mean this gate key.

And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP

AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup...

                         HUMPERDINCK
             Man and wife -- say man and wife...

                         IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN
             Man and wife.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (whirling to the King
                  and Queen)
             Escort the bride to the Honeymoon
             Suite -- I'll be there shortly.

And as he dashes off --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

standing there. Dazed.

                         BUTTERCUP
             He didn't come.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS

racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex
intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous,
as we

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK

moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who
is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog
leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          108.


COUNT RUGEN

as the confrontation is about to start.

                         RUGEN
             Kill the dark one and the giant,
             but leave the third for
             questioning.

And as his Warriors attack --

Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe
they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance
to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone
mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and
the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit
the floor. There is a pause. Then --

                         INIGO
                  (to Rugen, evenly and soft)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he
does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving
Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen,
running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it
and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He
tries again. No kind of chance.

                         INIGO
                  (calling out)
             Fezzik, I need you --

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY

who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls
back --
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          109.


                         FEZZIK
                  (indicating Westley)
             I can't leave him alone.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

desperately pounding at the heavy door.

                         INIGO
             He's getting away from me, Fezzik.
             Please. FEZZIK!

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK AND WESTLEY

                         FEZZIK
                  (to Westley)
             I'll be right back.

And he props Westley up against a large suit of armor and
takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came
from --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for
him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands
the door crumbles

                         INIGO
             Thank you --

And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP WALKING WITH THE KING AND QUEEN

The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead.

                         KING
                  (can hardly be understood)
             Strange wedding.

                         QUEEN
             Yes. A very strange wedding. Come
             along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          110.


Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his
forehead. He's very surprised and pleased.

                         KING
             What was that for?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Because you've always been so
             kind to me. And I won't be seeing
             you again since I'm killing
             myself once we reach the Honeymoon
             Suite.

                         KING
                  (smiling away --his
                  hearing isn't what it
                  once was)
             Won't that be nice?
                  (calling out to the Queen)
             She kissed me...

And on those words --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he
glances back --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

behind him, coming like a streak and --

                                            CUT TO:

THE INTERSECTION

with the large suit of armor, and Fezzik gaping, staring at
all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of
the missing Westley.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his
pace. He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp
point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          111.


INIGO

closing the gap, closer, closer and he's down the stairs and
heading into a dining hall and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

throwing the dagger --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

trying like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it
sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly
against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming
from his wound.

The room is going white on him.

                         INIGO
             ... Sorry, Father ... I tried ...
             I tried...

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking across the room at Inigo. He stares at Inigo's face,
and then touches his own cheeks, as memory comes.

                         RUGEN
             You must be that little Spanish
             brat I taught a lesson to all
             those years ago. It's simply
             incredible. Have you been chasing
             me your whole life only to fail
             now? I think that's the worst
             thing I ever heard. How marvelous.

Inigo sinks.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP

shutting the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crossing quietly
to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled
box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems
very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          112.


                         WESTLEY
             There's a shortage of perfect
             breasts in this world. It would
             be a pity to damage yours.

And Buttercup whirls as we --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice
sounds just fine, but he does not move.

Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses.
Westley is helpless.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, darling.
                  (more kisses)
             Westley, why won't you hold me?

                         WESTLEY
                  (gently)
             Gently.

                         BUTTERCUP
             At a time like this that's all
             you can think to say? "Gently?"

                         WESTLEY
                  (not so gently)
             Gently!!

And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

looking very much surprised.

                         RUGEN
             Good heavens. Are you still
             trying to win?

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his
stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand.

Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving
in to kill Inigo.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          113.


                         RUGEN
             You've got an overdeveloped sense
             of vengeance. It's going to get
             you into trouble some day.

Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his
sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do,
just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered
sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left
shoulder.

Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much
worse.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

stepping back, going for the heart again.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for
support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a
roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make
some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as
this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again,
Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it.

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues
to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count
is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of
his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back,
makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

slowly pushing away from the wall.

                         INIGO
                  (all but audible)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father; prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          114.


COUNT RUGEN

suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great
power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he
forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall.
But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the
Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

pushing slowly off from the wall again.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya,
             you killed my father, prepare to
             die.

                                            CUT TO:

THE COUNT

And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none
of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves
forward.

                         INIGO
                  (a little louder still)
             Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.
             You killed my father. Prepare to
             die.

                         RUGEN
             Stop saying that!

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

retreating more quickly around the table.

Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home
where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his
blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo
was wounded.

                         INIGO
                  (all he's got)
             HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA.
             YOU KILLED MY FATHER. PREPARE TO
             DIE.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          115.


                         RUGEN
             No --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me money --

And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash
bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks.

                         RUGEN
             -- yes --

                         INIGO
             -- power too -- promise me that --

The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel
slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek.

                         RUGEN
             -- all that I have and more
             please --

                         INIGO
             -- offer me everything I ask
             for --

                         RUGEN
             -- anything you want --

                         INIGO
                  (roaring)
             I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON-
             OFA-BITCH!

And on that --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes
one final time and --

                                            CUT TO:

COUNT RUGEN

crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead
center and --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          116.


INIGO AND RUGEN

the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen
like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and
as the Count pitches down --

                                            CUT TO:

RUGEN

lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from
the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging
wide, full of fear.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

staring at Rugen. And now Inigo does something we have never
seen him do before: he smiles. HOLD FOR JUST A MOMENT on
Inigo smiling, then --

                                            CUT TO:

INSIDE THE HONEYMOON SUITE

WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is
still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side.

Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Oh, Westley, will you ever
             forgive me?

                         WESTLEY
             What hideous sin have you
             committed lately?

                         BUTTERCUP
             I got married. I didn't want to.
             It all happened so fast.

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.

                         BUTTERCUP
             What?

                         WESTLEY
             It never happened.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.


                         BUTTERCUP
             But it did. I was there. This old
             man said, "Man and wife."

                         WESTLEY
             Did you say, "I do"?

                         BUTTERCUP
             Well, no, we sort of skipped that
             part.

                         WESTLEY
             Then you're not married -- if you
             didn't say it, you didn't do it
                  (a pause)
             -- wouldn't you agree, Your
             Highness?

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             A technicality that will shortly
             be remedied. But first things
             first. To the death.

                         WESTLEY
             No.
                  (a little pause)
             To the pain.

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (about to charge,
                  stops short)
             I don't think I'm quite familiar
             with that phrase.

                         WESTLEY
             I'll explain. And I'll use small
             words so that you'll be sure to
             understand, you wart-hog-faced
             buffoon.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             That may be the first time in my
             life a man has dared insult me.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          118.


WESTLEY

lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first.

                         WESTLEY
             It won't be the last. To the pain
             means the first thing you lose
             will be your feet, below the
             ankles, then your hands at the
             wrists, next your nose.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

gripping his sword, watching.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             -- and then my tongue, I suppose.
             I killed you too quickly the last
             time, a mistake I don't mean to
             duplicate tonight.

                         WESTLEY
             I wasn't finished -- the next
             thing you lose will be your left
             eye, followed by your right --

                         HUMPERDINCK
                  (takes step forward)
             -- and then my ears, I understand.
             Let's get on with it

                                            CUT TO:

CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE

                         WESTLEY
             Wrong! Your ears you keep, and
             I'll tell you why --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the
wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return.

                         WESTLEY
             -- so that every shriek of every
             child at seeing your hideousness
             will be yours to cherish -- every
             babe that weeps at your approach,
             every woman who cries out, "Dear
             God, what is that thing?" will
             echo in your perfect ears.
                         (MORE)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          119.


                         WESTLEY (CONT'D)
             That is what "to the pain" means.
             It means I leave you in anguish,
             wallowing in freakish misery
             forever.

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside
him.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I think you're bluffing --

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

lying there, staring at him.

                         WESTLEY
             It's possible, pig -- I might be
             bluffing -- it's conceivable, you
             miserable vomitous mass, that I'm
             only lying here because I lack
             the strength to stand -- then
             again, perhaps I have the strength
             after all.

And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his
feet go to the floor, he starts to stand --

                                            CUT TO:

HUMPERDINCK

staring, eyes wide.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

And now he is standing, sword in fighting position.

                         WESTLEY
                  (slow and determined)
             DROP-YOUR-SWORD.

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          120.


PRINCE HUMPERDINCK

and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind
his watch. He throws his sword to the floor.

                         WESTLEY
                  (to Humperdinck)
             Have a seat.

                                            CUT TO:

WESTLEY

speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits.

                         WESTLEY
             Tie him up. Make it as tight as
             you like.

And as she sets to work --

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO

entering, looking around.

                         INIGO
             Where's Fezzik?

                         WESTLEY
             I thought he was with you.

                         INIGO
             No.

                         WESTLEY
             In that case --

his balance betrays him.

                         INIGO
                  (to Buttercup)
             Help him.

                         BUTTERCUP
             Why does Westley need helping?

                         INIGO
             Because he has no strength --

                                            CUT TO:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          121.


HUMPERDINCK

and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds.

                         HUMPERDINCK
             I knew it! I knew you were
             bluffing! I knew he was bluffing.

                         INIGO
                  (staring at the Prince)
             Shall I dispatch him for you?

                         WESTLEY
                  (considers this, then)
             Thank you, but no -- whatever
             happens to us, I want him to live
             a long life alone with his
             cowardice.

                         FEZZIK
                  (off-screen)
             Inigo! Inigo, where are you?

They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and

                                            CUT TO:

FEZZIK

leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on
the balcony.

                         FEZZIK
             Ah, there you are. Inigo, I saw
             the Prince's stables, and there
             they were, four white horses. And
             I thought, there are four of us,
             if we ever find the lad -- hello,
             lad -- so I took them with me, in
             case we ever bumped into each
             other.
                  (considers things a moment)
             I guess we just did.

                                            CUT TO:

INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP

looking down at FEZZIK.

                         INIGO
             FEZZIK, you did something right.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          122.


                         FEZZIK
             Don't worry -- I won't let it go
             to my head.

And as he holds out his great arms--

                                            CUT TO:

SOMETHING UNEXPECTED AND VERY LOVELY:

Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of
course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can
catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think
she was flying.

Westley and Inigo, watching as FEZZIK catches Buttercup.

                         INIGO
             You know, it's very strange -- I
             have been in the revenge business
             so long, now that it's over, I
             don't know what to do with the
             rest of my life.

                         WESTLEY
                  (as Inigo gets him
                  ready for his jump)
             Have you ever considered piracy?
             You'd make a wonderful Dread
             Pirate Roberts.

Now from that --

                                            CUT TO:

THE FOUR GLORIOUS WHITE HORSES WITH THEIR FOUR RIDERS

triumphantly racing through the night --

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

and at last their trials are done. They stop.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             They rode to freedom. And as dawn
             arose, Westley and Buttercup knew
             they were safe. A wave of love
             swept over them. And as they
             reached for each other...
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          123.


As Buttercup and Westley begin their ultimate kiss --

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S BEDROOM

The Grandfather stops reading.

                         THE KID
             What? What?

                         GRANDFATHER
             No, it's kissing again. You don't
             want to hear it.

                         THE KID
             I don't mind so much.

He gestures for his Grandfather to read.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Okay.

                                            CUT TO:

BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY

locked in a deep, pure and passionate kiss.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (off-screen)
             Since the invention of the kiss,
             there have been five kisses that
             were rated the most passionate,
             the most pure. This one left them
             all behind. The end.

                                            CUT TO:

THE KID'S ROOM

The Grandfather snaps the book closed.

                         GRANDFATHER
             Now I think you ought to go to
             sleep.

                         THE KID
             Okay.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (standing, readying to leave)
             Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So
             long.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.


                         THE KID
             Grandpa?

The Old Man stops, turns.

                         THE KID
             Maybe you could come over and
             read it again to me tomorrow.

                         GRANDFATHER
                  (a beat)
             As you wish...

And his smile is enough. As The Grandfather steps out the
door, tipping his hat--

FINAL FADE OUT.

THE END.

          FADE IN:

          INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          The sun peeks over the horizon.   There's a stunning view of
          Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't
          watching.
          As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady THUMP, THUMP,
          THUMP echoes through the apartment.   Eventually, we see MARGARET
          MILLS (37) running on a treadmill, watching "The O.C." on Tivo,
          and reading a manuscript.
          She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero.   As she
          hits a button to stop the treadmill...

          INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          A hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up.   RICHARD
          PAXTON (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure
          out where he is. There are multiple framed pictures of the same
          model on the walls.
          Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is
          6:16 AM.   Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over.

          RICHARD
          Where are my clothes?
          A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers.   SIMONE is the
          model on the walls and is really, really hot.

          SIMONE
          In the kitchen.   I think.   Can I make you
          some coffee?

          RICHARD
          Sorry, I gotta go.   I'm late.
          Richard hurries to the kitchen.   Socks are on the butcher block
          next to an empty champagne bottle.   Shoes in the sink.   He finds
          his pants on the floor and puts them on.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Have you seen my belt?
          Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard.

          SIMONE
          In here.
          She unties the complicated knot.   Richard comes back half
          dressed.   He swallows a little throwup.

          RICHARD
          Baby, I just can't do this anymore.

          

          

          

          

          2.

          INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          Margaret puts on a black suit jacket.   Definitely not off the
          rack.   She makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror, and moves
          off.

          INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

          Reflected in the mirror above Simone's bed, Richard hurriedly
          gets dressed as he talks.

          RICHARD
          You're just too much for me.   And I'm just
          another guy too wrapped up in his job.

          SIMONE
          Fine.   Whatever.   Just go.
          Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone.

          RICHARD
          Let's not end it like that. It's been an
          amazing three and a half weeks.   Thank you.
          And you should know that you have the nicest
          ass I've ever been with.

          SIMONE

          (TOUCHED)
          You mean it?

          RICHARD
          I do.   It's magnificent.

          SIMONE
          I work really hard on it.

          RICHARD
          I know you do.
          Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her
          naked body.   Richard shakes his head "no" and smiles.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I really gotta go.

          INT. MARGARET'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

          CRUNCH.   Margaret eats a bowl of Kashi and soy milk while
          standing and reading a manuscript.   Her eyes remain glued to her
          reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher.
          Her apartment is very quiet.

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING

          HONK!   A cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the
          street.   His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch.

          

          

          

          

          3.

          INT. MARGARET'S LOBBY - MORNING

          DING!   The elevator opens and Margaret strides towards the exit
          and the DOORMAN (60).   Before Margaret gets to the door, her CELL
          PHONE RINGS.   She checks the caller ID and excitedly points at
          her phone as she lets it ring.

          MARGARET
          (to phone)
          I knew you would call!   Now come on, tell me
          what I want to hear.   Give it to me.

          DOORMAN
          You have to put it by your mouth so people
          can hear you.

          MARGARET
          You should get paid extra for being so darn
          funny.
          Margaret straightens her jacket, answers the phone, and walks out
          the door.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          This is Margaret.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING

          Richard bursts into the skyscraper and runs into a Starbucks.

          INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

          Two coffees lie in wait for Richard.   JILLIAN, a lovely Barista,
          smiles as he hurries to the counter.

          JILLIAN
          You're running late today.

          RICHARD
          Jillian, you are the best.

          JILLIAN
          If you think I'm good at this, you should
          use that coffee cup sometime.
          As he runs out the door, Richard glances at his cup and smiles at
          Jillian's name and phone number written in Sharpie.

          RICHARD
          See ya tomorrow.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

          The elevator doors ahead of Richard begin to close.

          RICHARD

          

          

          

          

          4.
          Mercifully, a hand reaches out and stops the doors.   Inside the
          packed elevator, Richard's CO-WORKERS look sleepy.   One
          particularly frustrated co-worker confronts Richard.

          CO-WORKER #1
          How long is she gonna make us come in by
          seven?

          RICHARD
          She doesn't exactly consult with me on these
          things.

          CO-WORKER #1
          Well this sucks ass.

          RICHARD
          Welcome to my nightmare.
          The doors close as...

          EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING

          Margaret crosses the street and talks on the phone.

          MARGARET
          You've been thinking about our talk because
          I'm right.   Everyone does publicity.   Roth,
          McCourt, Russo.   Hell, Chabon practically
          whores himself.   Know what they have in
          common?   A Pulitzer.
          (off answer)
          Yes, I know you haven't done it in twenty
          years, but that's how long it's been since
          you've written a book this good.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          Richard bursts out of the elevator and passes a clock reading
          6:56 and a sign that announces "Royce Publishing."   He hauls ass
          through a sea of cubicles.   Along the way, grumpy employees
          begrudgingly nod their good mornings.
          At his desk, he pulls a tie out of a drawer and puts it on
          without looking in the mirror.   Noticing his wrinkled suit, he
          pulls out a SPRAY BOTTLE out of the same drawer, sprays it all
          over his body, and then on his head to help mat down a tricky
          cowlick.   Satisfied, he hurries into a nearby corner office.

          INT. SKYSCRAPER LOBBY - MORNING

          Margaret walks into the lobby and continues talking.   Employees
          avoid her and pile into the elevator.

          

          

          

          

          5.

          MARGARET
          I'm not pushing so you'll sell more books,
          I'm pushing because it'll be a crime if the
          world doesn't hear that you wrote a genius
          piece of literature.   Do the publicity.
          Margaret waits for an answer and smiles when she hears "yes."
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You're making the right decision!   Great
          news.   Going into an elevator, think I'm
          going to lose you...
          Margaret hangs up.   Never give them a chance to change their
          mind.

          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Richard races to Margaret's computer and turns it on.   He picks
          up papers strewn about the room.   He goes back to the computer,
          and opens computer programs.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - RECEPTION - MORNING

          Margaret exits the elevator and receives an enthusiastic...

          RECEPTIONIST
          Good morning!
          Margaret quickly walks by and gives only the slightest nod.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          Margaret walks through the cubicles and nods hello to her staff,
          who all look busy on the phone.   When she turns the corner, they
          stop their "conversations" in mid sentence and hang up.

          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - MORNING

          Richard stares at the printer as a sheet of paper comes out.   A
          clock above the door reads 7:00 AM.   The paper clears the printer
          and Richard grabs it quickly.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          Margaret opens the door to her office, and finds Richard standing
          at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other.
          Her office looks perfect.

          RICHARD
          You've got a conference call in thirty, a
          staff meeting at nine, and your immigration
          lawyer sent some papers for you to sign.

          MARGARET
          Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight,

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          6.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (big news)
          I got Frank to do publicity.

          RICHARD
          Nice job.

          MARGARET
          When I want your praise, I'll ask for it.
          Is Bob here?

          RICHARD
          I'm sure.   You want him on the phone?

          MARGARET
          We're going to his office.   Grab your pad.
          Richard calmly backs out of the office...

          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

          ... but once he's out of Margaret's sight he runs to his computer
          and sends an instant message to the office "The Banshee is headed
          to Bob's office."

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING

          As the message pops up on computers, the quiet office jumps to
          life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes
          their imaginary conversations.

          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - MORNING

          Margaret comes out to Richard's desk.   She notices his coffee cup
          with Jillian's number on it.   She takes special notice of the
          hearts that dot the "I's" in Jillian.

          MARGARET
          That's cute.   You gonna call her today?

          RICHARD
          What?
          Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she
          nods at the cup.   He's embarrassed.

          MARGARET
          Are you bored here?   Do you need little
          distractions like that to get you through
          the day?

          RICHARD
          Uh...

          MARGARET
          You have another late night out?

          RICHARD

          

          

          

          

          7.
          Margaret starts walking.   Richard quickly catches up, worried
          because he doesn't know where she's going with this.

          MARGARET
          I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got
          hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head,
          and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday.

          RICHARD
          Oh.   Well, it won't be wrinkled for long.

          MARGARET
          You'll magically unwrinkle?

          RICHARD
          Yes.

          MARGARET
          You have magic pants?

          RICHARD
          No.   I've sprayed them with stuff that will
          take care of the wrinkles.

          MARGARET
          Does this work on more than just your pants?

          RICHARD
          Anything that's wrinkled.

          MARGARET
          Buy me some.

          RICHARD
          Will do.
          Richard makes a note.   Margaret stops to make her point.

          MARGARET
          I don't care what or who you do on your own
          time, but when you walk through that door
          you represent me, and I will not have your
          personal life affect you at work.   If you
          want me to think of promoting you to editor,
          I need you sharp, focused and professional.
          Got it?

          RICHARD
          Got it.

          MARGARET
          Great.   Now you're just a prop in here, so
          don't say a word.

          

          

          

          

          8.

          INT. BOB'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

          Margaret and Richard enter Bob's office, which is decorated with
          beautiful antiques and first edition books.   But unlike
          Margaret's office, this one isn't in the corner.
          Margaret nods at Richard to shut the door.   BOB (42) wears a prim
          bow tie, circular tortoise shell glasses, and the air of
          superiority.

          MARGARET
          Hey, Bob.

          BOB
          Ah.   Our fearless leader and her liege.
          Margaret smiles.

          MARGARET
          I'm lettin' you go, Bob.

          BOB
          Pardon?

          MARGARET
          You're fired.

          BOB
          What?   What are you talking about?

          MARGARET
          This isn't working out.

          BOB
          You can't...

          MARGARET
          I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do
          publicity.   You said it was impossible.

          BOB
          It is.   He doesn't do publicity.

          MARGARET
          I just talked to him.   He's in.

          BOB
          But...

          MARGARET
          No more buts, Bob.   I've been chief for a
          month and a half, and this is the third time
          you've dropped the ball.   You didn't even
          call to ask him.

          BOB

          

          

          

          

          9.

          MARGARET
          All you had to do to was pick up the phone.
          That's it.   Now I'll give you two months to
          find a new job, and then you can say you
          resigned.   I won't tell a soul, my lips are
          sealed.
          Margaret nods at Richard and he opens the door.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - CONTINUOUS

          Margaret and Richard walk a few steps.   Margaret looks straight
          ahead and whispers to Richard.

          MARGARET
          What's he doing?
          Richard turns around and takes a peek.   Bob gets out of his chair
          and comes to his door.

          RICHARD
          He's up and about to pop.

          MARGARET
          Oh Bob, don't do it...

          BOB

          YOU POISONOUS BITCH!   YOU CAN'T FIRE ME!
          The office stops.   This is going to be good.   Margaret turns
          around with a disappointed look on her face.   She's deadly calm.

          MARGARET
          What are you doing?   I gave you a civilized
          way out of this.

          BOB
          This is because I'm your competition.
          Because I threaten you!

          MARGARET
          Oh, Bob.   You could never threaten me.   I'm
          firing you because you're lazy, entitled and
          incompetent.   I'm firing you because you
          don't work hard.   So if you know what's good
          for you, you'll shut up, take off that
          ridiculous bow tie, find a bar and get
          drunk.   Because if you say one more word,
          Richard here is going to call security and
          have you thrown out on your ass.   Are we
          perfectly clear?
          Bob nods.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Good.   Now I've got work to do, so if you'll

          

          

          

          

          10.
          Margaret and Richard walk away and speak in hushed tones.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          We need to call his authors and explain what
          happened.   And get Frank's publicity
          schedule figured out pronto.

          RICHARD
          No problem.   I'll just cancel my trip this
          weekend.

          MARGARET
          I gave you the weekend off?

          RICHARD
          It was my Grandma's ninetieth birthday.
          But no big deal.   You were right before, I
          need to stay focused.   Professional.

          INT. RICHARD'S DESK - DAY

          Richard is on the phone with his mom explaining why he can't come
          home this weekend.   He sounds like an annoyed teenager.

          RICHARD
          Well tell gammy that I'm sorry.
          (waiting to speak)
          Mom, she's making me work this weekend.
          It's not like I volunteered.
          (waiting to speak)
          I'm sure dad is pissed.
          Margaret comes to Richard's desk.   He tries to wrap it up.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I have to go.   Yeah.   No, I'm not going to
          do that!   No.   Sorta.   Mom!   No.   Bye.
          Richard hangs up the phone.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Sorry about that.   Damage control.

          MARGARET
          She tell you to quit?

          RICHARD
          No.   No.
          (off Margaret's look)
          Um.   Yes?   But as I've explained to them,
          after three years together, you're the only
          person on the planet who can make me editor,
          so that's the way it is.
          Richard's phone rings and he picks it up.

          

          

          

          

          11.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Your 10:55 is here.   Mr. Gilbertson?

          MARGARET
          Who is this guy?

          RICHARD
          He said you knew each other.   You weren't
          sure so you told me to set a meeting.   We
          rescheduled on him four times.

          MARGARET
          Go get him.   But he's out of here in five
          minutes, we've got work to do.
          Margaret leaves and goes into her office.

          RICHARD
          (to himself)
          I'll charge up the cattle prod.

          INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAY

          Margaret reads as MR. GILBERTSON (48) sits down.   He's an intense
          man in a bad suit.   He sits in silence until Margaret looks up.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Margaret.   Good to see you.   I know how busy
          you are.   Congrats on the promotion.   Read
          about it in P-W.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   Well, those announcements are silly,
          aren't they?   Like everyone who needs to
          know doesn't know already.
          Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man,
          but now gives up.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Have to admit, I can't place where we know
          each other from.
          Gilbertson smiles.   He didn't expect her to remember.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Three years ago?   We worked together.

          MARGARET
          Don't have it...

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Remember "Dandelion's Desire?"
          Margaret gets excited.

          

          

          

          

          12.

          MARGARET
          Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me?
          That book is legend.   Without a doubt the
          worst ever written.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You think?

          MARGARET
          It was a fever dream!                                         900 offensive and
          pointless pages, with like 30 characters,
          who all had some weird disability.   The
          paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering
          scientist?   Oh!   And there was the asthmatic
          alien chapter -- written entirely in his
          alien language.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I believe there was a glossary...
          Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory.

          MARGARET
          Did you see the pass letter I wrote him?

          MR. GILBERTSON

          (QUOTING)
          "Your grammar is impeccable, but please do
          not confuse superior form with writing
          ability.   Save your skills for the office
          newsletter, you sir, are no writer."
          A beat.   Margaret says matter of fact...

          MARGARET
          You wrote the book.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I did.

          MARGARET
          You're Dante Dickens?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          One of my nom de plumes.
          Gilbertson paces.   Margaret stays seated, at a loss.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.   You
          obviously were spending a lot of time
          writing, I just thought you should channel
          all that passion into something else.
          Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket.

          

          

          

          

          13.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Ms. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and
          Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you
          to Canada.

          MARGARET
          Excuse me?   What?   This is a mistake.   I've
          lived here since 1981.   I'm applying for
          citizenship.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You need citizenship now?   After the big
          promotion?

          MARGARET
          Yes.   And all the papers are in.
          Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Well, my office is going to reject your
          paperwork on Monday, while we investigate
          whether your behavior is well disposed to
          the good order and happiness of the United
          States.   We must protect our sovereignty.

          MARGARET
          I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the
          United States?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will
          take awhile, so you'll be deported while
          your case winds through the system.
          (as if he doesn't know)
          Will it affect you at work if you aren't
          allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two
          to three years?

          MARGARET
          "Affect me at work?"   I'll lose my job!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          (mock sympathy)
          Ahhhh.   That's a shame.   Too bad we can't
          work something out.
          Margaret stops looking at her file.   It all becomes clear.

          MARGARET
          Oh, no.   No, no, no.   I won't do it.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Do what, Ms. Mills?

          MARGARET

          

          

          

          

          14.
          Gilbertson smiles.   She's quick.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I've edited it down.   It's better.

          MARGARET
          Well then, get it published at another
          house.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          They all just don't get me.

          MARGARET
          All?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Well not all.   Two hundred fifty, two
          hundred sixty-one.   Ish.

          MARGARET
          I'll be fired and laughed out of the
          industry if I publish that book.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I'm at the end of my rope, Ms. Mills.   I'm
          an author.   Not some bureaucrat who brings a
          lunchable to work everyday and lives in his
          brother's garage.   You're the last stop, and
          I'm desperate.

          MARGARET
          I will never publish your book.   Ever.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          There's no need to make this difficult.   I
          don't turn in your file until Monday...

          MARGARET
          This is blackmail.   I'll go to your boss.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I've spent two years preparing for this day.
          Don't you think I've thought of that?
          Now Margaret is pacing, while Gilbertson happily looks on.
          Suddenly, the door opens and Richard bursts in, acting like there
          is an "emergency" so Margaret can end the meeting.

          RICHARD
          Excuse me, Ms. Mills, risk management needs
          you right away.
          The sight of Richard inspires Margaret.   She turns to Gilbertson
          with a wicked grin on her face.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          MARGARET
          Know what, Dante?   I'm not going anywhere!
          We're getting married!
          Richard has no idea what Margaret is talking about.

          RICHARD
          Who's getting married?

          MARGARET
          We are!

          RICHARD
          You and him?

          MARGARET
          Stop playing around, honey.
          Margaret is all smiles.   Richard is very confused.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Mr. Gilbertson is from the INS.   I told him
          about us.   About us getting married.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You are marrying your male secretary?

          RICHARD
          Assistant.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You are marrying your male assistant?

          MARGARET
          (matter of fact)
          We're in love.   We tried to fight it.   When
          it's right, it's right.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          And this has nothing to do with my visit
          here today?

          MARGARET
          Nope.   True love.   Got it bad.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          (to Richard)
          You.   Is this true?   Are you marrying
          this... woman?
          Margaret comes over to Richard and holds his hand.

          MARGARET
          Of course we are.

          MR. GILBERTSON

          

          

          

          

          16.
          Painfully long beat where Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret
          squeezes Richard's hand hard.

          RICHARD
          Uh-huh.
          Margaret smiles and snuggles up to Richard so he can put his arm
          around her.   Richard is truly afraid.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (more of a question)
          I'm, uh, marrying my boss?
          Margaret turns and puckers her lips to let Richard know that
          she's ready for a kiss.   The two slowly begin to come together.
          Just as their dry lips are about to touch, Richard chickens out
          and kisses the hair on the top of her head.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Five years in prison and a two hundred and
          fifty thousand dollar fine.

          MARGARET
          What?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          If I prove you're lying, you go to federal
          prison for five years.
          Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          (to Richard)
          You.   Do you know what you're getting
          yourself into?   We're going to put you in a
          room and ask you every detail that a real
          couple would know about each other.   Do you
          even know her favorite color?
          Richard doesn't answer.   Margaret encourages him on with a thinly
          veiled threat.

          MARGARET
          C'mon.   Answer.   You don't have a choice.
          Richard doesn't want to do this, but relents.

          RICHARD
          Plum.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You mean purple?

          RICHARD
          No.   Plum is "smokier" than purple.

          

          

          

          

          17.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Favorite flower?

          RICHARD
          Tulips.   But only when they're in season.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Childhood pet name?

          RICHARD
          Miss Mittens.

          MARGARET
          Are we done here?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Who knows you're getting married?
          Margaret interrupts.

          MARGARET
          No one.   With us working together we decided
          it would be too much of a scandal if anyone
          knew.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Have you at least told your family?

          MARGARET

          (EXCITED)
          My parents are dead!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          How convenient.   So you're not telling
          anyone that you are getting married?

          RICHARD
          Nope.
          Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Pathetic.   Four questions and I've got
          enough to send you to prison...

          MARGARET
          We're telling his family this weekend.

          RICHARD
          We are?

          MARGARET
          Yes.   We are.   We're surprising them...
          (trying to remember)
          ...at his Grandma's 90th birthday party.

          

          

          

          

          18.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          And where's that going to be?

          MARGARET
          (no idea)
          At Richard's parent's house.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          And where's that located?

          MARGARET
          (still no idea)
          In his hometown.

          RICHARD
          Sitka.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Is that on Long Island?
          Only Richard has the answer.   Margaret tries to cover.

          MARGARET
          Why don't you tell him?

          RICHARD
          Alaska.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You're going to Alaska this weekend?

          MARGARET
          (Alaska???)
          Yes.   Of course we're going to Alaska.
          That's where Richard is from.
          Gilbertson begins to walk around.   He's getting worked up.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You think you can beat me with this B-S
          story?   Forcing your secretary...

          RICHARD
          Assistant.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...assistant to marry you and then
          conveniently telling his family for the
          first time this weekend?

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry, Dante.   Did you not prepare for
          that?
          Margaret puts her arm around Richard and waits in silence.

          

          

          

          

          19.
          Enraged, but with no recourse for now, Gilbertson checks his
          appointment book and writes down some information.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          The INS will see you both in ten days for
          your official interview.   Your stories
          better match up on every account.
          Mr. Gilbertson gets right up in Margaret's face as he gives her
          the piece of paper.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          Cross all your T's and dot your I's with
          this ruse, Ms. Mills.

          MARGARET
          There are no "T's" or "I's" in "Love" Mr.
          Gilbertson.
          Gilbertson leaves and shuts the door hard.   Margaret goes back to
          her desk like this is all in a days work.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Why are you from Alaska?   Sweet Jesus,
          that's inconvenient.   So here's what's going
          to happen.   We'll play boyfriend and
          girlfriend this weekend for your parents and
          that should be enough for this INS
          interview.
          Richard doesn't react.   Margaret doesn't notice.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          So you need to figure out the travel,
          schedule a justice of the peace for next
          week, and get my lawyer on the phone.
          Margaret takes a sip of her coffee and makes a face.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          But first, run down and get me another
          coffee from your girlfriend, this is cold.
          Margaret holds out her coffee cup.   Richard doesn't move.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Hello?   Richard?   Richard!
          Richard says his first words since Gilbertson left.

          RICHARD
          I quit.
          Richard leaves Margaret's office.   She still has her coffee cup
          outstretched in her hand.

          

          

          

          

          20.

          INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - CONTINUOUS

          Richard powers through the office.   Co-workers take notice that
          Margaret is following him.

          MARGARET
          Richard, come back here.
          Margaret tries not to make a scene.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Richard.   Richard.
          Richard pushes the elevator button in front of reception.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Come back to the office!
          Richard can't take it.   He gets up in Margaret's face.

          RICHARD
          You shut up.   You just lost your "I get to
          tell Richard what to do" privileges.

          MARGARET
          Well, we need to talk.

          RICHARD
          You want to talk with me?   Fine.   Grab your
          broom and let's go.
          Margaret is dumbstruck.   The receptionist is shocked.   The
          elevator arrives and Richard gets in.   Margaret follows. As the
          doors close, Richard shouts out to the receptionist.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Watch my phones!

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

          Richard and Margaret walk in silence through the park.   Richard
          finally speaks.

          RICHARD
          Your plan is psychotic.

          MARGARET
          Well I'd rather poke my eyes out than play
          pretend girlfriend, but this is the big
          time.   Sometimes you need to sack up.

          RICHARD
          Aren't Canadians supposed to be nice?

          MARGARET
          You wanna be an editor?   You need to make

          

          

          

          

          21.

          RICHARD
          OK.   Fine.   Then if we "make this happen"?
          You're promoting me to editor.

          MARGARET
          I'm doing what?

          RICHARD
          We go to Alaska and lie to my family?   I
          risk going to jail?   Well, you're making me
          editor for that.   I mean, did you think I'd
          do this out of the kindness of my heart?

          MARGARET
          You work for me!

          RICHARD
          You know, during my employee orientation,
          the HR rep didn't mention anything about me
          marrying you.

          MARGARET
          Look, I came to this town alone and with
          nothing.   I've worked my ass off for fifteen
          years and this guy wants to ruin me because
          he wrote the shittiest book of all time?   No
          way.

          RICHARD
          Nice story Little Orphan Annie, but that
          sounds like your problem.   Not mine.
          Margaret is stuck.   Richard really does have the upper hand.

          MARGARET
          Fine.   You take me to Alaska this weekend,
          and I'll make you editor.   Deal?
          Margaret puts out her hand to shake, Richard takes it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          And I'm not sleeping on your parent's hide-a-
          bed, we're staying in a hotel.   Do they even
          have hotels in Alaska?

          RICHARD
          No.   But they have huts.   Teepees really.
          And you have to poop in a bucket.   But
          otherwise, just like the Four Seasons.   But
          with bears.

          EXT. PLANE TO SEATTLE - DAY

          A commercial jet TAKES OFF and leaves New York City behind.

          

          

          

          

          22.

          INT. PLANE TO SEATTLE - DAY

          Richard and Margaret sit in First Class and work on their lap
          tops.   Richard looks up.

          RICHARD
          Um.   Shouldn't we talk about what we're
          going to say to my parents?
          Margaret doesn't look up, annoyed with the question.

          MARGARET
          Are you done with the press release?

          RICHARD
          Almost.

          MARGARET

          (PATRONIZING)
          Well let's finish big people business before
          mommy and daddy talk.   Okay?
          Dejected, Richard goes back to work.

          INT. SEATTLE AIRPORT - DAY

          As they change planes in Seattle, Margaret walks quickly and
          talks on the phone.   Still the assistant, Richard lags behind,
          weighed down by both their bags.
          Up ahead at the gate, a GATE ATTENDANT (Female, 50's) ANNOUNCES
          final boarding to Sitka.   Margaret gets off her phone.

          MARGARET
          So what do I need to know up there?   Bullet
          points.

          RICHARD
          I told âem we've been dating for six months.
          We've kept it a secret from everyone...
          (under his breath)
          ...and that you're a naughty minx in the
          sack.
          Richard and Margaret make it to the attendant at the gate.
          Margaret is not amused by Richard's attempt at humor.

          MARGARET

          (VENOMOUS)
          Don't make me hate you.
          Margaret hands her boarding pass to the attendant and breezes
          through.   The attendant gives Richard a look.

          RICHARD
          Bringing her home to meet my folks.   She's

          

          

          

          

          23.
          Tangled in the bags, Richard struggles to find his boarding pass.
          The impatient attendant is getting frustrated.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I've got it here.   Sorry.   Guess I'm a
          little flustered too.   Haven't been home for
          awhile, hope they like her!
          The gate attendant smiles.

          GATE ATTENDANT
          (heard it all)
          I don't care, sir.
          Richard finds his boarding pass and hands it over.

          RICHARD
          OK then.   You're a sweet lady.   Thanks.
          Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors.

          INT. PLANE TO ALASKA - DAY

          Margaret takes her seat and sits next to a well dressed HANDSOME
          MAN who is READING A BOOK.   She notices the title and he catches
          her stare.   Margaret explains.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry, I hate it when people stare at
          what I'm reading.   It's just... I worked on
          that book.

          HANDSOME MAN
          You wrote it?

          MARGARET
          Edited it.   It was one of my favorites.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Well you did a good job.   It's great.

          MARGARET
          You don't see many guys with that book.
          You, uh, read a lot of love stories about
          Roman concubines?

          HANDSOME MAN
          My ex-girlfriend gave it to me.   I travel a
          lot for work.   I'll read anything...

          MARGARET

          (SUSPICIOUS)
          Ex-girlfriend, huh?

          

          

          

          

          24.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (smiling, embarrassed)
          OK, you got me.   I'm a closet romantic.   But
          let's keep that between us.
          Margaret smiles and makes the "my lips are sealed" motion.   Just
          then, Richard lumbers onto the plane with the bags.

          MARGARET
          There you are.   Give me my lap top.
          Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag.

          RICHARD
          (re: book)
          Hey, he's reading...

          MARGARET
          I know, Richard.
          Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead
          compartment.   The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Did you two want to sit together?

          MARGARET
          Sit together with who?
          The Handsome man nods at Richard.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Your boyfriend?
          Margaret points to Richard indignantly.

          MARGARET
          You mean him?
          The Handsome man nods.   Margaret tries to set the record
          straight.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          No.   No.   No.   He's my assistant.

          HANDSOME MAN
          You're bringing your assistant all the way
          to Alaska?
          Richard smiles, happy that Margaret has to answer.

          RICHARD
          Oh, you can tell him the truth.

          MARGARET
          Well, he's... indispensable.

          

          

          

          

          25.
          The Handsome man isn't buying it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          And gay.   Takes care of me everywhere I go.
          Call him my queen mother.   Aren't you my
          indispensable gay queen mother?
          Margaret shoots Richard a nasty look.   He has to go along.

          RICHARD
          That's me.
          Richard turns to close the overhead compartment.

          HANDSOME MAN
          You're awfully nice to fly him first class.
          Margaret nods her head and agrees.   It sucks to be Richard.

          EXT. AERIAL OF SITKA - DAY

          We see the natural beauty of South Eastern Alaska.   Sitka is an
          island the size of Maui.   Only an eight mile stretch of coast is
          inhabited, the rest is complete wilderness.   At the center of the
          island is a mountain with smaller hills around it.   The coast is
          dotted with fishing boats.   Gorgeous.

          INT. JETWAY - DAY

          Margaret and the Handsome Man chat like old friends while they
          walk off the plane.   Richard follows with all the bags.   As they
          all walk out of the jetway they see...

          INT. AIRPORT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          A big banner that reads: CONGRATULATIONS RICHARD AND MARGARET!!!
          with wedding bells and a graphic showing the journey from New
          York to Sitka.   The banner is being held up by a group of 30
          PEOPLE with excited looks on their faces.
          Richard's mom DEBBIE (60) is front and center.   She's a sweet
          lady who cooked Richard a hot breakfast every morning until he
          left the house.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (89) also waits.   She's lived a long time and
          doesn't have a lot of time to screw around.
          When they see Richard, they SCREAM.   Margaret's face drops.

          ALL
          There he is!!!   Where's Margaret?
          Richard blanches white.   Margaret looks back with eyes that say
          "What the hell is going on?"

          

          

          

          

          26.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (noting banner)
          That's sweet.
          Richard goes over to the group.   Margaret keeps walking.

          RICHARD
          What are you guys doing here?   What's with
          the sign?

          DEBBIE
          So you're "just dating," huh?   I can't
          believe you didn't tell us!

          RICHARD
          Didn't tell you what?

          ANNIE
          We're not saying anything until you let us
          meet Margaret.   Now, where's our girl?
          Richard looks around.   Margaret keeps her head down and tries to
          avoid eye contact.

          RICHARD
          Uh.   Margaret?   You need to come over here.
          Like now.   Honey.
          The Handsome Man sees Richard with the banner people, calling for
          Margaret to come over.   Margaret winces.

          MARGARET
          I have to go now.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (putting it together)
          What kind of sick shit is this?
          Margaret nods.   This would be a tough one to explain.

          MARGARET
          Have a great life.
          Margaret walks toward the group.   Richard puts out his hand and
          silently pleads for Margaret to hold it.   At the last second, she
          takes it.

          RICHARD
          Everyone, this is Margaret.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's nice to meet you.   Now, do you prefer
          being called Margaret, or the Dragon Lady?
          We've heard it both ways.
          Everyone laughs.

          

          

          

          

          27.

          DEBBIE
          Annnie!

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's not like he hasn't told her that he
          used to call her the Dragon Lady.   They're
          getting married.

          RICHARD
          (real "casual")
          Now, ah, where did you hear that?   The whole
          "getting married" thing?

          DEBBIE
          Oh, that man from the government.   Gilber-
          something.   Said he was checking up on you
          two.   Said it was technicality, because
          Margaret was from Canada.

          RICHARD
          What, ah, did you tell him?

          DEBBIE
          Well for one thing, that you were in a lot
          of trouble for not telling us that you two
          were getting married!

          RICHARD
          No.   Really.   What did you say?

          DEBBIE
          Just that you were coming up here this
          weekend.   That we hadn't seen you in a
          while, and that we'd heard about Margaret
          for years, but that we'd never met her.
          Debbie turns to Margaret and takes both of her hands.
          DEBBIE (CONT'D (cont'd)
          The way that Richard talked about you?   I'll
          admit, I didn't see this coming.

          MARGARET
          Me neither.
          Debbie picks up some of the bags and starts walking toward the
          exit.   Everyone else follows her lead.

          ON THE MOVE

          DEBBIE
          So why all the silly secrecy?

          RICHARD
          It wasn't a secret.   We didn't tell anyone.

          

          

          

          

          28.

          DEBBIE
          Well, is your family just anyone?

          RICHARD
          No, I didn't mean...

          DEBBIE
          I should be mad at you two.   But, but... I'm
          just so excited!

          MARGARET
          (re: group)
          Uh, is everyone coming to our hotel?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Oh, we cancelled your reservation.   You're
          part of the family now.     Family doesn't
          stay at a hotel.   Also, we've got another
          little surprise for you two.

          MARGARET
          Surprise?   Another surprise?

          RICHARD
          She's not good with surprises.

          MARGARET
          I'm really not good with surprises.

          EXT. SITKA AIRPORT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Debbie stops.   Sitka Airport is very small, so they are already
          outside by all the cars parked in the loading zone.
          Debbie and Annie excitedly look at each other.

          DEBBIE
          Well you two...

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          ...you're getting married this weekend!

          MARGARET                                                           RICHARD
          What?                                                              What?
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          The whole kit and caboodle.
          Margaret gives both these women a look that says "what are you
          talking about?"

          DEBBIE
          When Gilber-something told us you were
          getting married...

          GRANDMA ANNIE

          

          

          

          

          29.

          DEBBIE
          ...God rest their souls...

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          ...or friends...

          DEBBIE
          ...we decided to give you a wedding.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Engagement party tonight...

          DEBBIE
          ...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight.
          Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks.

          MARGARET
          Are you witches?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Just quaint.   During the solstice it's good
          luck.   It's an Alaskan thing.

          DEBBIE
          We've planned everything.
          Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          I'm old, Margaret.   I don't have much time
          left.   Richard lives so far away, and I
          never see him.   Now I find out he's getting
          married, and I have a chance to see my one
          grandchild's wedding day.   It's a dream come
          true for me.   A dream come true.   Please let
          me see Richard get married before I die.
          Please.
          Long beat.   Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.
          Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.   Finally,
          she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up.
          The crowd cheers.

          EXT. SITKA - DAY

          A procession of cars makes its way through town.

          INT. PICKUP - DAY

          Debbie and Grandma sit in the front of the truck, all smiles.
          Margaret and Richard sit as far away from each other as possible
          in the backseat of the extended cab.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          Margaret tries to get Richard's attention, but he's looking out
          the window.   Finally she pinches him and Richard jumps. He gives
          Margaret a "what did you do that for" look.

          MARGARET

          (MOUTHING)
          The Dragon Lady!?
          Richard shrugs.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the
          plans made already for my birthday.   Just a
          few changes here and there, and we made this
          weekend a wedding.
          Margaret stares at Richard.

          MARGARET
          I'm a lucky woman.
          Margaret does her best to smile.

          EXT. DOCK - DAY

          The cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere, near a small
          dock.   Everyone gets out of the cars and starts walking to the
          ocean.   Margaret is confused.

          MARGARET
          I'm not getting out of this car until you
          tell me where we're going.

          RICHARD
          Come on, it'll be OK.   I promise.
          Richard points to a small island about a mile away.

          EXT. YACHT - DAY

          Everyone rides on a 75 foot yacht.   Lots of polished wood and
          chrome.   Someone passes out beers on board, and the mood is
          festive.   Margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene.

          MARGARET
          Who are you people?
          Richard lets Margaret wonder.

          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY

          The ship docks and we get our first glimpse of the Paxton Estate.
          It sits above the rest of the wooded island and is as tasteful as
          a 15 bedroom Alaskan mansion can be.
          Richard's father, GEOFFREY (60) waits on the dock. He is a bear

          

          

          

          

          31.

          GEOFFREY
          So you must be Margaret.   We've heard a lot
          about you.   All of it bad.
          Margaret tentatively walks off the yacht in her none to practical
          sling backs.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          I mean, I almost shit myself when I heard he
          was marrying the devil woman.

          MARGARET
          I thought it was the dragon lady?

          GEOFFREY
          Either way.

          RICHARD
          Hey dad.
          Richard shakes his father's hand.   It's a little stiff.

          GEOFFREY
          Welcome home.   Good to see âya.

          RICHARD
          You too.

          GEOFFREY
          Been a while.

          RICHARD
          Yeah.   You'd think you could make it to the
          airport to mark the occasion.
          Grandma Annie interrupts.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Help him with the bags Geoffrey.
          (to Richard and Margaret)
          Let's get you two settled.
          As Richard and Margaret move towards the house, Annie shoots
          Geoffrey a look that says "be nice".

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          The house is decked out in sheik Alaskan decor.   Somehow, it
          makes bear heads and deer antlers look good.   Everything is first
          class.   Margaret is a little awe struck.

          DEBBIE
          We'll show you around later.

          MARGARET
          Uh huh.

          

          

          

          

          32.
          Out of nowhere, a small HUSKY PUPPY startles Margaret and jumps
          on her.

          DEBBIE
          Balzac!   Down!   No!
          Debbie pulls the dog off of Margaret and pushes him toward the
          kitchen.   Margaret tries to take it in stride and make small
          talk.

          MARGARET
          What a great name.   Balzac's "Lost
          Illusions" is one of my favorite novels.

          DEBBIE
          Oh.   Well, this Balzac's got epididymitis.
          Debbie makes two big circles with her pointer fingers to
          illustrate how Balzac really got his name.
          Not understanding, Margaret looks over at Balzac as he walks
          away.   Off her shocked reaction, we understand right away that
          this puppy Husky is an anatomic marvel.
          DEBBIE (cont'd)
          No one on the island wanted him when he was
          born.   We figured he deserved a home.

          GEOFFREY
          And don't let him outside, or the eagles
          will snatch him.

          RICHARD
          C'mon dad...

          GEOFFREY
          I mean it.   They come out of that
          rehabilitation center mean.   And hungry.

          RICHARD
          Don't listen to him, Margaret.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE UPSTAIRS - DAY

          Debbie opens a door for Richard and Margaret.

          DEBBIE
          You'll be sleeping here.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          The room is beautiful, right out of Architectural Digest.

          DEBBIE
          Bathroom is there, all the towels are in the
          armoire by the bed.   Just let me know if you

          

          

          

          

          33.

          MARGARET
          Thank you.   Where's Richard's room?

          DEBBIE
          Oh, we took down his "shrine" years ago.
          And don't worry, I'm under no illusion that
          you two haven't slept in the same bed
          before.   Richard can sleep here too.

          MARGARET
          Oh, let's not upset Grandma Annie.

          DEBBIE
          It was her idea.   Anything to help get her a
          great grandchild.
          Richard shrugs his shoulders behind his mother.

          MARGARET
          Great.   You know, I've gotten used to his
          breathing at night.

          DEBBIE
          I thought so dear.
          Debbie leaves and shuts the door.   Margaret reverts back to her
          old self.

          MARGARET
          I'm about 15 seconds from bitch.

          RICHARD
          Calm down.

          MARGARET
          What is going on here?

          RICHARD
          Hell if I know.

          MARGARET
          You had no idea they knew about us getting
          married?

          RICHARD
          You think I'd bring you here if I did?

          MARGARET
          Well, we just gotta tell âem.

          RICHARD
          Tell âem what?

          MARGARET
          Tell âem the truth.   About us.

          

          

          

          

          34.

          RICHARD
          Wrong answer.   No way.

          MARGARET
          What do you mean no way?   This is crazy.

          RICHARD
          No, crazy was lying to the federal officer.

          MARGARET
          Well I don't like this.

          RICHARD
          Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice
          to a Class C felony!   For one second could
          you not be so selfish?

          MARGARET
          Selfish?

          RICHARD
          Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you
          only worry about yourself every second of
          every day?

          MARGARET
          How is it selfish to tell the truth?

          RICHARD
          Look.   We're awful, awful people.   In the
          last forty eight hours, we've lied to...
          everyone.   We need to protect the people
          downstairs.   We can't ask these good,
          decent, not awful people to lie for us.
          Let's keep the darkside to ourselves.
          Margaret takes a second to make up her mind.

          MARGARET
          Fine.   But if we do this, you need to stop
          lying to me.

          RICHARD
          What've I lied to you about?

          MARGARET
          Why did you tell me that you were poor?

          RICHARD
          I never said that.

          MARGARET
          Well, you never told me you were rich.

          RICHARD
          When does that come up?

          

          

          

          

          35.

          MARGARET
          I don't know, how about, "Hi, my name is
          Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry."

          RICHARD
          Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you
          would have fired me if you knew.

          MARGARET
          No I wouldn't.

          RICHARD
          Come on!   You're always yammering on about
          your scrappy childhood, and how you fought
          for those soccer scholarships, and how the
          rich kids made fun of you in prep school for
          working in the kitchen.   You're totally anti-
          rich.

          MARGARET
          I'm not anti-rich.

          RICHARD
          Oh yes you are!   And you know what makes it
          worse?   You have money!

          MARGARET
          I earned...

          RICHARD
          ...every penny I have.   Blah, blah, blah.
          You need new material.

          MARGARET
          Hey.   Watch it.   You're still my assistant.

          RICHARD
          You were going to promote me anyway.

          MARGARET
          Sure of that?

          RICHARD
          Nope.   Not at all.
          Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror.

          MARGARET
          Well, come on.   If we're going to do this,
          we might as well put on a show.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Downstairs, the engagement party is in full swing.   The starched
          wait staff stands out in the crowd, because the raucous party-
          goers are all dressed in flannel, T-shirts and baseball hats.

          

          

          

          

          36.
          Ponytails rule for the women, and almost all the men have shaggy
          hair and beards.   No dress code here.
          Like the house, the party is first class.   Ice sculptures melt,
          champagne is served on silver trays, and the buffet overflows
          with salmon and king crab.
          Margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some
          WELL WISHERS, Richard's parents, and Balzac.

          MARGARET
          I went to Union college in upstate New York.
          It's a small liberal arts school that no one
          has ever heard of.
          Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (looks at glass)
          Lime?

          RICHARD
          Be right back.
          Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges.   Geoffrey elbows Debbie in
          the side, "What was that?"

          WELL WISHER #1
          How long have you been with your company?

          MARGARET
          Since I graduated college.
          Richard comes back with the lime.   Margaret takes it and doesn't
          say thank you.

          RICHARD
          She's been there since she was nineteen.

          GEOFFREY
          Nineteen?   Wow.   That's how long?

          MARGARET
          Oh, who's counting...
          Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her.

          GEOFFREY
          No.   How many years is that?   Exactly.
          Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look.

          MARGARET
          Well, let me see.   That would be sixteen or
          seventeen years.   Exactly.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          GEOFFREY
          I was never good with big numbers.   That
          makes you... thirty six now?

          MARGARET
          Just turned thirty seven.   Born on May 20th.
          I'm a Taurus.
          Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Richard)
          I need some protein.

          RICHARD
          There's some salmon.
          Margaret shakes her head no.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Crab?
          Margaret nods yes.   Richard steps away to find a waiter.
          Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding.

          GEOFFREY
          Keep him on a short leash, huh?   Does he
          roll over when you whistle?
          Debbie hits Geoffrey.

          DEBBIE
          He's just being a good host.
          Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow.   For Geoffrey's
          benefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard.

          MARGARET
          Thank you, honey.   You're being so sweet.
          Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple.

          RICHARD
          Uh, sure.   Honey.

          WELL WISHER #2
          So you just got some big promotion?

          MARGARET
          I'm editor in chief, now.
          Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret.

          RICHARD

          (BEAMING)
          I'm so proud of my girl.

          

          

          

          

          38.
          From behind them, a melodic, etherial VOICE interrupts.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Editor in chief?   You're marrying up,
          Richard.
          Everyone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN (26).   She is
          Grace Kelly in Patagonia and Timberland.   Adding insult to
          injury, she doesn't have eyeliner on.

          RICHARD
          Gert!?
          Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and
          spilling her tonic water on her shirt.   He doesn't notice what
          he's done, and leaves Margaret.   She's peeved.
          RICHARD (cont'd)

          (FLUSTERED)
          What are you?   What are you doing here?

          GERTRUDE
          Your dad made me come.

          RICHARD
          From Chicago?
          Gertrude laughs.   The group watches these two see each for the
          first time in years.   There is instant chemistry, and Richard has
          forgotten about Margaret completely.

          GERTRUDE
          No.   I live here now.

          RICHARD
          You what?

          GERTRUDE
          I moved back about six months ago.   I'm
          teaching second grade.   At Baranof.

          RICHARD
          Did your husband move up here too?

          GERTRUDE
          Uh, no.   I, ah, got divorced.

          RICHARD
          Oh my God.   I'm sorry.

          GERTRUDE
          Me too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna
          meet the bride.
          Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret.

          

          

          

          

          39.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Hi, I'm Gertrude.   But call me Gert.

          MARGARET
          You're a Gertrude?

          GERTRUDE
          A family name from hell.

          MARGARET
          I'm sure it's been a curse.

          GEOFFREY
          Gert and Richard were quite the item in high
          school.
          Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence.

          GERTRUDE
          Oh Please.   Ancient history.

          GEOFFREY
          Feels like yesterday to me.

          GERTRUDE
          (ignoring Geoffrey)
          So tell me everything.   I hear it wasn't
          exactly love at first sight?

          MARGARET
          Not exactly...

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Now Richard, what I want to know is how you
          proposed.
          This grabs the group's full attention.   Everyone loves to hear a
          story like this.

          RICHARD
          Well...
          Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Uh, uh, um, I...

          GEOFFREY
          Yeah.   How did you pop the question?
          Richard is a deer in the headlights.   This is getting ugly.
          Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in.

          MARGARET
          Can I tell this one, honey?

          

          

          

          

          40.

          RICHARD
          Uh.   Sure.

          MARGARET
          I'm an early, early riser and go for a run
          everyday.   Well, it was our six month
          anniversary and I was out for my normal jog
          in the park, when who do I see in a horse
          drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting
          for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So
          I ran up to the carriage and asked him what
          was going on, and he put his finger to his
          lips and says, "shhhh."   So there I am in my
          jogging clothes, next to the most handsome
          mute in the world - have you seen him in a
          tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and
          smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later,
          we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best
          part, we're the only people in the place
          because Richard got them to open up early.
          Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just
          as the sun starts to peek above the trees,
          this beautiful man gets down on one knee,
          and says "I didn't want one more sunrise to
          go by without you knowing that you are the
          light of my life, and that I would be the
          luckiest man in the world if you would be my
          wife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry
          me?"
          The group is silent, waiting for the clincher.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I said yes.
          The group gives a collective "ahh".   Grandma Annie takes both
          Margaret and Richard by the hand.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          You are a good boy Richard, and you make me
          very proud.   I love you Richy.

          RICHARD
          I love you too, Grandma.
          Grandma hugs the couple.   Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and
          Gertrude.

          GEOFFREY
          So did this happen before or after the INS
          agent came sniffing around?

          DEBBIE
          What is wrong with you?   I'm sorry Margaret.
          Margaret doesn't miss a beat.

          

          

          

          

          41.

          MARGARET
          Oh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my
          lawyers have been dealing with all of this.
          When you told us at the airport it was the
          first time I'd heard about it.   I'm so
          embarrassed.

          DEBBIE
          Don't be, dear.   Geoffrey's just an ass.
          While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink
          that says "I've got this under control".   The moment is
          interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He
          takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear.

          RICHARD
          Margaret Mill's phone.
          (off answer)
          One second please.
          Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          It's our friend, Frank.
          Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem.

          MARGARET
          Excuse me, I'll just be a second.
          Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that
          lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't
          notice Balzac follow her outside.

          EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear.   Balzac
          follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him.

          MARGARET
          Don't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the
          wishy washy writer who changes his mind
          every two seconds.
          Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING
          to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking.
          Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the
          phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Balzac)
          Sit and be quiet!
          Balzac sits and pouts.   Margaret walks away and puts the phone
          back to her ear.

          

          

          

          

          42.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I fired Bob because he didn't have your best
          interest in mind.   Our job is to help you
          succeed.   He wasn't doing that.
          Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she
          notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not
          sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him
          peacefully sit in the grass.
          She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret
          shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when --
          WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and
          takes off.   Margaret jumps.
          There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle.
          She stays calm on the phone.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Could you hold on just a second?
          With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the
          eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and
          Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened.
          Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone
          and picks it up.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (NONCHALANT)
          Sorry, dropped my phone.
          Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in
          circles above her.   She decides to wrap up the call quick and get
          back to the house.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything.
          But know this.   This book is your legacy...
          Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac
          again.   She runs.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to
          introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me-
          tomorrow-with-your-decision.   My-phone is-
          always-on.   Talk-to-you-soon.
          The eagle bears down on them with talons out.   Just as the eagle
          is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone
          to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs
          Margaret's phone and flies off.   Margaret freaks.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          

          

          

          

          43.
          Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the
          eagle as an offering.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Take the dog!   Take the dog!

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE

          Inside, the elegant party carries on.

          DEBBIE
          Where's Margaret?   We need to go.

          RICHARD
          Go where?

          DEBBIE
          It's a surprise.   Girls are going into town.
          And the boys stay here.   I told you, we've
          planned everything.

          RICHARD
          Um.   She's outside.
          Debbie and Richard turn around and look out a picture window.
          They see Margaret running with Balzac above her head.

          DEBBIE
          Oh that's sweet, she's playing with my
          Balzac.

          EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY

          The eagle is long gone, but Margaret is still running with the
          dog trying to bait it back.

          MARGARET
          This is a delicious dog, Mr. Eagle.   C'mon,
          bring back the phone.
          Richard calls out from the house.

          RICHARD
          What are you doing?

          MARGARET
          The eagle took my phone!

          RICHARD
          Are you drunk?

          MARGARET
          Your dad was right!   The eagle tried to take
          the dog, so I saved it, then it came back
          and took my phone.

          

          

          

          

          44.

          RICHARD
          Did the dingo eat your baby, too?

          MARGARET
          Frank's going to call me on that phone.   I
          need it!

          RICHARD
          Relax.   I've got your information backed up
          on the laptop.   I'll just get you a new
          phone and switch the number.   No problem.

          MARGARET
          Oh.

          RICHARD
          Now come on.   You're going somewhere with my
          mom and the girls.

          MARGARET
          I'm not going anywhere.

          RICHARD
          You want a new phone?   You're going.

          EXT. PIONEER BAR - DAY

          The Pioneer bar is a classic Alaskan bar, decorated with pictures
          of every fishing vessel that has made Sitka its home.
          But tonight estrogen rules, as all the patrons are women CHEERING
          for an oiled, toned, and BEARDED MAN in a tiny thong who gyrates
          to the beat of Prince's "Sexy Motherfucker."   On stage with the
          dancer, Margaret tries to not look miserable in her NOVELTY

          BACHELORETTE PARTY WEDDING VEIL WITH DEVIL HORNS.

          DEBBIE
          Work it Hank!

          GERTRUDE
          Is that a salmon down your pants?
          The room laughs as Hank works his crotch millimeters away from
          Margaret's face.   Margaret remains straight faced.

          MARGARET
          Definitely not a salmon.
          The women encourage Hank on as he moves Margaret's hands to his
          wiggling ass and gives her a feel.   She can't help but give and
          embarrassed smile.   Finally, the song ends and Hank goes into the
          splits.   Thrilled, the room gives him a standing ovation.
          Margaret plays along and gives Hank a kiss on the cheek.   She
          begins to get off the stage, but Hank takes her by the hand.

          

          

          

          

          45.

          HANK
          Ah, ah, ah.   I was just the warm up.
          Hank sits Margaret down, and blindfolds her with a scarf.

          MARGARET
          What's going on?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Just sit there dear.

          MC
          Don't be shy ladies, tip well and often,
          show Hank how much you appreciate his
          assets!   And now... Ramone!
          The room goes silent as a middle aged RAMONE comes on to the
          stage.   He has a pot belly, threadbare thong and a thin mustache.
          Ramone's dance has a Latin theme to it, and he's very good at it.
          Margaret is oblivious.

          MARGARET
          What's that smell?
          Margaret finally takes off her blindfold, and finds Ramone about
          an inch away from her face.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (belly laugh)
          Ahhh!!!
          Margaret falls out of her chair and her scream frightens Ramone.
          After the initial scare he composes himself and wags his finger
          at her naughty behavior.

          RAMONE
          You are a naughty devil.
          Ramone goes to work another part of the stage, and when he turns,
          Margaret jumps off the stage and joins the ladies.

          MARGARET
          Good lord.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Ramone was the only male dancer on the
          island for years. No one has the heart to
          tell him to hang it up.

          MARGARET
          Want me to do it?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Thank you dear, but let's keep it our
          secret.

          

          

          

          

          46.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - SHORELINE - DAY

          Snow capped mountains watch 20 MEN in short sleeves hit golf
          balls into the ocean.   Green pontoon rafts bob in the water, made
          up to look like golf greens.   Golf balls are stacked in pyramid
          formations at every hitting area.
          Richard comes down from the house to join the group.   Geoffrey
          jokes with MR. MAGUIRE (60's, good natured) as they hit balls.

          GEOFFREY
          ...yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that
          dissolve in the water.

          MAGUIRE
          How does she come up with this shit?

          GEOFFREY
          She just does.   I stopped trying to figure
          out how.
          Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way.   Mr.
          Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is.

          MAGUIRE

          (JOKING)
          I'm mad at you, son!

          RICHARD
          Why's that, Mr. Maguire?

          MAGUIRE
          You fly up here and don't call me?

          RICHARD
          Sorry âbout that.

          MAGUIRE
          What good is me owning an airline if I can't
          give you free tickets?

          RICHARD
          You're right.   Don't know what I was
          thinking...

          MAGUIRE
          Damn, straight.   Don't let it happen again!
          (hands Richard a golf club)
          Here, you take over.   This game is for
          pussies, I'm getting a drink.
          Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with
          one another for the first time.   Things are awkward between
          father and son, and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid
          conversation.   Geoffrey finally makes small talk.

          

          

          

          

          47.

          GEOFFREY
          Maguire's stepping down in January.   He's,
          uh, handing things over to Matty.
          Richard gives his dad a look.   He knows where this is going.

          RICHARD
          That's great for them.

          GEOFFREY
          So.   How's work with you?

          RICHARD
          Good.   Busy.   You know.

          GEOFFREY
          I do.   I do.   Hey, did I tell you that we're
          opening a little office in Japan?

          RICHARD
          Congratulations.

          GEOFFREY
          We're not just a mom and pop operation
          anymore.   We're going global.

          RICHARD
          Uh-huh.
          Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second.   He's been
          thinking about this moment for a long time.

          GEOFFREY
          I could really use your help.

          RICHARD
          Dad.   Please.   I'm in New York.   Margaret's
          in New York.   We have jobs.

          GEOFFREY
          I know.   I know.   It's just...

          RICHARD

          (CHALLENGING)
          It's just what?

          GEOFFREY
          You're only a secretary.
          This pisses Richard off immediately.

          RICHARD
          Again with the secretary thing!   I've told
          you, I'm an assistant!

          

          

          

          

          48.

          GEOFFREY
          Just because you call yourself an
          "assistant" doesn't mean you're not really
          just a secretary.

          RICHARD
          Well if I'm "just a secretary", why would
          you want me up here anyway?   Sounds like
          you're doing great without me.

          GEOFFREY
          It's not like that and you know it.

          RICHARD
          Then how is it?   Explain it to me.
          Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening.

          GEOFFREY
          Last week, a man stuck his finger up my
          butt...

          RICHARD
          This man was a doctor?

          GEOFFREY
          ...and it got me thinking about you.

          RICHARD
          I'm not sure this is coming out right.

          GEOFFREY
          Just shut up for a second, okay?   I want you
          to have what I built.   But I'm running out
          of time to show you things.

          RICHARD
          Stop being so dramatic.

          GEOFFREY
          I'm not being...
          (takes a hard line)
          I need you to stop dicking around down there
          and get serious.

          RICHARD
          So this is all about what you want?

          GEOFFREY
          That's not what I said.

          RICHARD
          And me in New York with Margaret?   That
          isn't serious?

          

          

          

          

          49.

          GEOFFREY
          One day the woman is the Antichrist, and the
          next day she's the love of your life?   How
          is that serious?

          RICHARD
          Things change, dad.

          GEOFFREY

          (INDIGNANT)
          Things change?

          RICHARD
          Things change.

          GEOFFREY
          Things change?

          RICHARD
          Yes.   Things change.

          GEOFFREY
          Things change.   That's your explanation?
          Know what I think?   I think you banged your
          boss and fell in love, that's what I think.
          Some sorta mommy complex.

          RICHARD
          Nice, dad.   We gotta have these Cosby
          moments more often.   This is great.
          Richard drops his club and walks back to the house.

          EXT. PIONEER BAR - DAY

          Margaret steps outside to have a moment to herself.   She's on a
          patio overlooking the ocean.   It is late, but the sun is hanging
          just over the horizon.

          GERTRUDE
          They can be a little overwhelming, but
          they're great people.

          MARGARET
          What?   I'm just working on my tan.
          (off Gertrude's look)
          It's been a long day.
          Margaret looks inside and sees that the party is still raging.

          GERTRUDE
          Around the solstice they don't watch the
          clock.   Pretty much party âtil they fall
          over.

          MARGARET

          

          

          

          

          50.

          GERTRUDE
          I actually missed it when I was in the
          states.

          MARGARET
          Chicago, right?

          GERTRUDE
          Yeah.   Since college.

          MARGARET
          And now you're back?

          GERTRUDE
          Six months now.   Call me crazy, but I love
          it.   Think I'm back for good.

          MARGARET
          Really?   I don't know.   Don't you miss...

          GERTRUDE
          Neimans?   Starbucks?   Escalators?
          Margaret laughs.   She likes this woman.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Yeah.   I miss it.   Believe me, growing up I
          never thought I'd end up divorced and back
          here teaching at my old elementary school.
          That was always Richard's plan.

          MARGARET
          For you to get divorced?

          GERTRUDE
          (smiles, remembering)
          No.   I was going to teach, he was going to
          run his dad's business.   He was like a
          little old man.   Had it all worked out.

          MARGARET
          Are we talking about the same guy?

          GERTRUDE
          What do you mean?

          MARGARET
          Well, Richard's such a player.
          Gertrude looks confused.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I mean he was a total player.   Before we
          started dating.   Six months ago.

          GERTRUDE

          

          

          

          

          51.

          MARGARET
          That surprises you?

          GERTRUDE
          Did he ever tell you why we broke up?

          MARGARET
          We don't really talk much about stuff like
          that.

          GERTRUDE
          Oh.   Well I should shut up...

          MARGARET
          No, no.   Please.   I mean, we are getting
          married.   I want to know these things.
          Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed.

          GERTRUDE
          He proposed to me.   When we were seniors.
          Margaret laughs.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry.   I didn't mean to...   He proposed
          to you in high school?

          GERTRUDE
          He bought this sweet little ring, and got
          down on his knee.   It was so cute.

          MARGARET
          You must have...

          GERTRUDE
          ... freaked out?   Oh you bet.   I broke up
          with him on the spot.

          MARGARET
          I would hope so.

          GERTRUDE
          After getting rejected the first time, I
          can't imagine how hard it was for him to get
          up the courage to ask you.
          Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is
          being so honest with her.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Anyway.   The idea that my little old man
          could be a player...   It's just not the
          Richard I knew.   Good thing you're making an
          honest man of him again.

          

          

          

          

          52.
          Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in
          one swig.   She has a hard time finishing it off.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Well I'm empty.   I'm going to go get
          another.   I think I hear Ramone wrapping up,
          let's get back to the girls.

          MARGARET
          I'll be right in.
          Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean.   Gertrude goes inside.
          Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          We are awful people.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          THWACK!   An axe slams down and splits a log in two.   Hands
          quickly place another log down and THWACK!   We pull back to find
          Richard playing the role of executioner.   He's still mad after
          talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood.   Rage
          Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world.
          Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht.
          Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves.   Debbie's
          mood deflates when she sees Richard.

          DEBBIE

          (SHOUTING)
          Richard!   Honey!   Is everything OK?
          With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear
          or see the girls.
          Annie shakes her head.   Something is up.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY

          Geoffrey pets Balzac as he watches SportsCenter on a sixty inch
          plasma television.   The ladies arrive and Annie and Debbie step
          in front of the TV, blocking his view.   Margaret watches from the
          door, not sure what is going on.

          GEOFFREY
          Excuse me?   I'm watching that.

          ANNIE
          Why is Richard chopping wood?

          DEBBIE
          And don't play dumb.   What did you do?
          Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          GEOFFREY
          Nothing.   I didn't do anything... will you
          please move.
          The showdown intensifies.   Margaret excuses herself.

          MARGARET
          I am so tired.
          Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice.   He's still mad.
          Margaret just smiles.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Think I'm going to take a shower and clean
          off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for
          a great night.
          Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night.   Once
          she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey.   He
          looks genuinely unnerved.

          GEOFFREY
          Stop looking at me like that!

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite
          a sweat.     He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through
          shirt, and gets a whiff of himself.   Ew.   He stinks.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Margaret walks into the private bathroom attached to her room and
          shuts the door.   We hear her turn on the shower.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY

          Geoffrey defends himself to Debbie and Annie with great
          conviction.   Richard walks right by the fighting trio, but
          doesn't notice anyone.   He continues to listen to his iPod and
          his attention is focused on the controls, as he looks for the
          playlist "Songs I Shouldn't Like" and Charlene's hit "I've Been
          to Paradise, But I Haven't Been to Me."

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY


          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret turns off the shower, pulls back the curtain and reaches
          for a towel.   All she finds is a miniature unabsorbent decorative
          hand towel.   Shit.

          IN THE BEDROOM
          Richard enters the room smiling as Charlene sings "...I've been
          undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't

          

          

          

          

          54.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret's ears perk up.   The bathroom is a disaster because she
          has dripped water everywhere looking for a towel.

          MARGARET
          Richard, is that you?

          IN THE BEDROOM
          Richard opens the armoire next to the bed and pulls out an
          incredibly absorbent Egyptian cotton towel.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret cracks the door open to see what the sound was.   Richard
          isn't there, but she sees the armoire open and the towels waiting
          for her.   How did she miss that?

          MARGARET
          Richard, are you...
          Then out of nowhere, Balzac (he followed Richard in) startles
          Margaret.

          BALZAC
          Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!
          Margaret slips on the wet floor and falls on her ass.   Her foot
          kicks the door open as she retreats from the vengeful puppy.

          ON THE BEDROOM'S DECK
          Richard is oblivious as he hangs his wet clothes over a rail on
          the deck attached to the room.   He makes sure that no one is in
          the yard, pulls down his shorts, and hangs them up as well.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Naked, wet, and starting to get a little pissed off, Margaret
          manages to pull herself up by the toilet.   She wants a towel
          badly, but Balzac guards the doorway.   She tries reason.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry bout the eagle.   But I saved you.
          Balzac won't listen to reason and barks angrily.   Margaret grabs
          the ceramic top of the toilet tank to protect herself.

          ON THE BEDROOM DECK
          Richard calmly turns around and sees that the bathroom door is
          open.   That's weird.

          

          

          

          

          55.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Margaret holds the top of the toilet tank like a baseball bat,
          ready to strike.   Balzac will not be intimidated, and continues
          to growl and not let her out of the bathroom.   Margaret knows
          that she can't hit a dog, and looks for another way out.   Then
          she spots the bathroom mat.

          IN THE BEDROOM
          Richard saunters towards the bathroom, wearing only his iPod.

          IN THE BATHROOM
          Balzac puts a paw onto the bath mat.
          Margaret slowly puts back the toilet top.
          Balzac gets to the center of the bath mat, and Margaret pulls
          hard, sliding the bath mat and Balzac to the back of the
          bathroom.   With Balzac out of the way, she runs out, closes the
          door behind her and...

          IN THE BEDROOM
          WHAM!   Margaret crashes into Richard and they fall to the floor.
          It takes a second for them to realize that they are holding each
          other buck naked.

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                        Aaaaahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
          The two quickly separate and spastically try to cover up.   A
          rapid fire back and forth ensues.

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          Why are you naked?                                                   Why are you wet?

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          Don't look at me!                                                    You tackled me!

          MARGARET                                                             RICHARD
          It was the dog!                                                      You're blaming the dog again?

          MARGARET
          Will you just hand me a towel!
          Richard looks for a towel, but forgets he's naked.   When he looks
          under the bed, Margaret shrieks and covers her eyes..
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You're flashing brain!
          Richard quickly changes positions.   Out of desperation, he pulls
          the entire comforter off the bed.   He throws it Margaret's way,
          and she wraps herself in it.

          

          

          

          

          56.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You can cover up any time!
          Richard cups the beans and franks and backs up to his clothes by
          the window.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Explain yourself!

          RICHARD
          I didn't know you were home!   I was outside
          chopping wood!

          MARGARET
          You didn't hear me?

          RICHARD
          I had my iPod on!

          (CONFUSED)
          Why did you jump me?
          Richard reaches his clothes and pulls on his shorts.

          MARGARET
          I didn't jump you.
          (off Richard's look)
          I didn't mean to jump you.   I didn't know
          you were here.

          RICHARD
          You didn't see me?

          MARGARET
          I was running from the dog!
          Richard looks at Margaret suspiciously.

          RICHARD
          Wait.   Were you tryin' to seduce me?

          MARGARET
          Oh please!   Don't flatter yourself.

          RICHARD
          Mmm-Hmmm.

          MARGARET
          Go take a shower.   You stink.

          RICHARD
          Fine.   But don't come sneaking in there.
          You're still my boss.   That'd be sexual
          harassment.

          

          

          

          

          57.
          Richard goes to the bathroom and shuts the door.   Margaret takes
          a breath, but is startled when the door suddenly opens back up
          again.   Richard has Balzac cradled in his arms and scratches his
          neck.   He gently puts him outside their room.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          There you go, buddy.   Go on and play before
          she makes a coat out of you.
          Richard shuts the door and goes into the bathroom.   Without
          looking back, Richard gets the final shot.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Puppy hater.

          LATER
          Richard grabs all the pillows, cushions and blankets he can find
          to create himself makeshift bed on the floor.
          Margaret turns out the lights, leaving the room still bright with
          the sun still shining outside.   She gets into her bed.

          MARGARET
          I'm never gonna to get to sleep.
          Richard pushes a button and motorized metal blinds come down
          outside the window.   The sunlight is instantly blocked out and
          the room is pitch black.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh.   Well.   Thanks.
          Richard settles into his pathetic excuse for a bed.   The two
          silently lie awake and stare at the dark ceiling.

          RICHARD
          It was kinda weird seeing you naked.

          MARGARET
          Can we not talk about this?

          RICHARD
          I'm just saying.   It was weird.

          MARGARET
          It wasn't weird.

          RICHARD
          How was that not weird?

          MARGARET
          Because we're... like teammates.

          RICHARD
          We're like teammates?

          

          

          

          

          58.

          MARGARET
          We are teammates.   And teammates see each
          other naked in the locker room.   All the
          time.   It's not a big deal.

          RICHARD
          Well, if we're teammates can I sleep in the
          bed?

          MARGARET
          Good night, Richard.
          The two lay awake in silence for another beat.

          RICHARD
          Margaret?

          MARGARET
          Yes?

          RICHARD
          Don't take this the wrong way.

          MARGARET
          Okay...

          RICHARD
          You're a very beautiful woman.
          Margaret smiles with her head turned away from Richard.

          MARGARET
          Get some sleep Richard, big day tomorrow.

          INT. PAXTON ESTATE - OFFICE - DAY

          Not a creature is stirring, except for Geoffrey who creeps into
          his office.   He shuts the door softly and goes to his gigantic
          oak desk.   He finds a phone number with a New York City area code
          on a piece of paper.   He dials.

          GEOFFREY
          Yes.   Mr. Gilbertson?   My name is Geoffrey
          Paxton...
          Only the animal trophies that adorn Geoffrey's office hear the
          rest of the conversation.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Margaret wakes up.   She looks over to Richard asleep on the floor
          with a blanket and a pillow.   She stares maybe a beat too long,
          before there is a KNOCK on the door.

          MARGARET
          Who is it?

          

          

          

          

          59.

          DEBBIE (O.S.)
          It's me dear.   I made you two breakfast in
          bed.   Can I come in?

          MARGARET

          (STALLING)
          Uh, sure.   Just a second.
          Margaret can't yell at Richard, so she throws a model wooden
          sailboat to wake him up.   She hits him in the head.

          RICHARD
          What the...

          MARGARET

          (MOUTHING)
          Your mother.
          Richard jumps up and replaces cushions and hides signs of his
          makeshift bed.   He finishes quickly, hops in the bed, and puts
          his arm around Margaret.

          RICHARD
          Come on in mom!
          Debbie enters with a tray of pastries, fruit and coffee.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Ah mom, you made your cinnamon rolls.

          DEBBIE
          Well, it's your special day.
          Debbie smiles, puts down the tray on a bedside table and sits on
          the edge of the bed.   She is buzzing with excitement.
          DEBBIE (cont'd)
          You two need your energy, so eat up.   We've
          got your dress fitting, have to get the
          house ready, and then your wedding.

          RICHARD
          I gotta run into town to get Margaret a new
          phone.

          DEBBIE
          Will you pick up some champagne while you're
          there?

          RICHARD
          No problem.

          DEBBIE
          And don't be gone for too long.   Lots of
          work to be done!

          

          

          

          

          60.

          MARGARET
          You don't have to go to all this trouble.
          Really.
          Debbie sweetly looks back at Margaret.

          DEBBIE
          Don't be silly.   This is the biggest day of
          your life.   You are coming into this family,
          and when it's family, it's no trouble.   If
          your parents were with us, they would do the
          exact same.
          Debbie leaves and Margaret smiles as the door closes.   Richard
          jumps out of bed and goes to the food.

          MARGARET

          (TOUCHED)
          Your mom is just so sweet.   I haven't had
          someone make me breakfast in bed since I was
          a little kid.
          Richard takes a huge bite of cinnamon roll.

          RICHARD
          (mouth full)
          I wish she hadn't.   I mean she almost caught
          us.   Damn, that was close.
          Like a pig in shit, Richard continues to dig in and doesn't pay
          attention to Margaret.

          MARGARET
          You just take all this for granted?   Your
          family, this house...
          Richard takes another big bite and turns to Margaret.

          RICHARD
          (mouth full)
          I'm sorry, what?   You gotta try these.
          Margaret looks at Richard with disgust.

          MARGARET
          Why are you doing this to them?

          RICHARD
          Huh?

          MARGARET
          Why am I here?   You didn't have to bring me
          here.

          RICHARD
          You made me bring you here!   You told me I

          

          

          

          

          61.

          MARGARET
          I didn't make you do anything.   You could of
          said no.

          RICHARD
          And what?   Start over at the bottom again?
          No way.

          MARGARET
          I get why a not rich person would do this.
          But you've got everything.   It doesn't make
          any sense.

          RICHARD
          Know what?   This is none of your business.

          MARGARET
          I wish it wasn't my business.   But
          unfortunately, it has become my business,
          because I made a deal with someone I thought
          I could trust.
          Richard stares at Margaret for a beat.   He's exasperated.

          RICHARD
          You wanna know why you're here?   I'll show
          you why you're here.

          MARGARET
          Fine.

          RICHARD
          We leave in a half hour.

          MARGARET
          I'll be ready in 20 minutes.
          Margaret angrily takes a bite of a cinnamon roll and slams it
          down on the plate.   She goes to her suitcase and looks for
          clothes.   A beat passes, and she comes back to the rolls.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          These are really good.
          She takes a cinnamon roll and leaves.

          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY

          Richard and Margaret board the yacht.   They wear athletic clothes
          and running shoes.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY

          Richard drives the yacht and Margaret sits by herself.

          

          

          

          

          62.

          EXT. PAXTON SEAFOODS PIER - DAY

          Richard docks the boat at the Paxton Seafood pier.   Located in
          the town's harbor, the packing plant consists of three large
          warehouses, and buzzes with activity.   Fishing boats line the
          pier, unload their fish, and forklifts take the fish to be
          processed.   Everything is clean and organized.
          Richard and Margaret walk down the pier.   He points to the SEALS
          that swim everywhere and eat fish scraps.   Damn, they're cute.
          Richard waves hello to WORKERS.   An elderly Phillipino man, BEK
          BEK, yells at them as he walks into a warehouse.

          BEK BEK
          Hey, Richard!   That the lucky lady?

          RICHARD
          Yes sir, it is!

          BEK BEK
          (to Margaret)
          You look much younger than everyone says.

          MARGARET
          That's great to hear.

          RICHARD
          See ya on the line, Bek Bek.

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          Richard opens a locker and points.   We don't see at what.

          RICHARD
          Put this on.   I'll meet you outside.

          MARGARET
          But I don't...

          RICHARD
          Ah.   Put it on.

          EXT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

          Margaret opens the door with a sour look on her face.   She's
          wearing large green hip waders with suspenders, rubber fishing
          boots, and gloves.

          MARGARET
          Is this really necessary?

          RICHARD
          You'll thank me later.
          Richard walks towards the warehouse.   Margaret follows in her

          

          

          

          

          63.

          INT. SLIME LINE - DAY

          Inside one of the brightly lit warehouses, workers at different
          stations process the fish that come off the boats.
          At the top of the line, Bek Bek is HANDCUFFED to the head
          decapitator machine.   He happily feeds whole salmon into a
          guillotine, where the heads are chopped off.   He awkwardly waves
          when he sees Margaret and Richard.

          MARGARET
          Why is he handcuffed to the machine?

          RICHARD
          So his hands don't go too far.   So he
          doesn't...
          Richard makes a chopping motion.   Margaret winces.

          MARGARET
          Nice.
          From the decapitator, fish are fed into the gut puller, where
          their bellies are slit and the intestines are pulled out.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You know, I shouldn't be here.   I was a
          vegetarian for six months in college.
          Richard leads Margaret to the end of slime line, where a long
          line of 20 workers give the fish a final cleaning before they are
          frozen.   With great speed, they take the fish from the gut puller
          line and clean out all the left over intestines.

          WORKER
          There he is!   Big city boy come to show us
          how its done.

          RICHARD
          Ah, it's been a while.

          WORKER
          C'mon.   Show her how we do it.

          RICHARD
          Okay, okay.
          Richard and Margaret go to the end of the line.   Richard expertly
          demonstrates with a knife.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          You grab a fish, but be gentle, cause you
          don't want to bruise it.   Open her up, tilt
          the knife, and then pull with the grain of
          the fish.   Two quick stokes to clear the
          organs attached to the spine.

          

          

          

          

          64.
          Margaret looks nauseous.   Richard enjoys her discomfort.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Then use the tip of the knife to squeeze the
          blood out of the vein.   Then send her down
          the line.
          Richard guts another fish with precision and speed before
          offering a knife to Margaret.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Wanna try it?
          Margaret doesn't say anything.   All the other workers watch.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          If it's too gross for you...

          MARGARET
          Gimme that.
          Up to the challenge, she takes the knife and grabs a fish.
          Margaret puts the knife in and keeps as much distance as possible
          between her and the salmon.

          RICHARD
          I did this for five summers.   Dad wanted me
          to earn my stripes before I took over.

          MARGARET
          Is that why you're still pissed at him?

          RICHARD
          Nah, I loved it here.

          MARGARET
          (re: fish guts)
          You loved this?

          RICHARD
          The slime line?   Hell no.   Nobody loves the
          slime line.   I loved this place.   The
          people.   Growing up, running this place was
          all I wanted.
          Margaret scrapes a huge glop of guts out of a fish.

          MARGARET

          (DISGUSTED)
          You wanted this?

          RICHARD
          I wanted to run this place. It was
          comfortable here.   It was what I knew.
          (re: fish)
          Don't forget the spine.

          

          

          

          

          65.

          MARGARET
          I wasn't gonna forget.
          Margaret squeezes the blood out of the vein, sends the fish on
          its way, and grabs another fish with more confidence.

          RICHARD
          But then things changed.   And it wasn't so
          comfortable anymore.

          MARGARET
          What kind of things changed?

          RICHARD
          Stuff.

          MARGARET
          (as if she didn't know)
          You mean, like, Gertrude?

          RICHARD
          Yeah...
          Richard stops, he can tell Margaret knows something.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Oh my god.   She told you didn't she?

          MARGARET

          (INNOCENT)
          Told me what?
          Richard is embarrassed.   He turns away.

          RICHARD
          About the... you know.

          MARGARET
          The creepy teenage proposal?

          RICHARD
          Ah, shit!

          MARGARET
          You were a freak by the way.

          RICHARD
          OK, get it all out.

          MARGARET
          And she was right to break up with you.

          RICHARD
          You done?
          Margaret nods yes.

          

          

          

          

          66.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I know now that it was the right thing, but
          it screwed me up for a little while.

          MARGARET
          For a little while?   Don't sell yourself
          short.

          RICHARD
          When Gert crushed my heart into little
          pieces, a life up here didn't seem so great
          anymore.

          MARGARET
          So you moved to the open arms of New York
          City?

          RICHARD
          At first it was about getting as far away
          from this place as possible, but then I fell
          in love with it.

          MARGARET
          With scheduling my pilates?

          RICHARD
          With editing.   See, as an only kid I'd
          always read a lot, but until I worked for
          you I didn't love it.   I mean, when I
          realized that we could find the next
          Cuckoo's Nest, or Catch 22, or...

          MARGARET
          (with reverence)
          ...To Kill a Mockingbird.   It's all about To
          Kill a Mockingbird.

          RICHARD
          Exactly!   We could find the next To Kill a
          Mockingbird.   God damn, how great is that?
          Margaret smiles.   She never knew that Richard had this kind of
          passion for the job.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          So when I tell my folks that I want to spend
          my life finding books?   My dad goes ape
          shit.                                                             "How dare you forsake your family...
          you'll come crawling back to us... you're
          nothing without our help."   I left that
          night and we didn't talk for a year.
          Haven't been back here since.

          MARGARET
          So we're "getting married" so you can give
          daddy the finger?

          

          

          

          

          67.

          RICHARD
          No.
          Margaret gives Richard a disbelieving look.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Sorta.   OK, Yes.   Coming back here with
          you...   I get the promotion and I get to
          show off.   You're editor in chief.   You make
          a good prop.

          MARGARET

          (SMILING)
          I guess that's a compliment.

          RICHARD
          So now you know I'm a petty asshole.   Am I
          trustworthy again?

          MARGARET
          Oh yeah, we're good.   By the way, you're
          more screwed up than I am, Paxton.

          RICHARD
          Yeah.   Thanks.

          MARGARET
          One more question...

          RICHARD
          Yes, everyone at work thinks you're a
          lesbian.

          MARGARET
          That wasn't my question.

          RICHARD
          I know.   Just lashing out.
          Margaret smiles.

          MARGARET
          Can we stop gutting fish?   I need my phone.

          INT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY

          Richard and Margaret enter the well appointed general store,
          filled with food, booze and electronics.   A mini Wal Mart.

          RICHARD
          Hey Ramone.

          RAMONE
          Hey Richard.   Hola mi amo.
          Margaret recognizes Ramone, the male dancer from last night.

          

          

          

          

          68.

          MARGARET

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Hey.
          They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You know him?

          RICHARD
          He was my shop teacher.

          MARGARET
          Of course he was.   How many people are on
          this island?
          They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne.

          RICHARD
          Like eight thousand?   Depends on the time of
          the year.

          MARGARET
          Feels smaller.
          With the cart full they head to the checkout.

          RICHARD
          (to Ramone)
          You got the phone I called about?

          RAMONE
          Charged up, ready to go, number changed.
          Ramone throws Richard a phone.

          RICHARD
          Thanks, Ramone.

          RAMONE
          No problem.
          Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave.   She awkwardly waves back.
          Richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay.
          Margaret is confused.

          EXT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Richard keeps pushing the cart, Margaret catches up.

          MARGARET
          Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff?

          RICHARD
          It's our stuff.

          

          

          

          

          69.
          Richard points to the "Paxton General Store" sign.

          MARGARET
          That must have been handy in High School.

          RICHARD
          You have no idea.

          MARGARET
          Should you leave the cart?

          RICHARD
          It's our cart.   I didn't know you were such
          a prude.

          MARGARET
          I've come to realize that being my assistant
          gave you more access to my life than I ever
          imagined, but there are a few things you
          don't know about me.

          RICHARD
          I doubt it.   When I started, you were still
          wearing those Ugg boot things.

          MARGARET
          (deadly serious)
          I told you never to talk about that.

          RICHARD
          I'm just saying it's been a long time.   I
          know it all.
          Margaret turns on her new phone.   It searches for a signal.

          MARGARET
          (up to the challenge)
          Did you know I took disco lessons in the
          sixth grade?

          RICHARD
          Where?

          MARGARET
          The Y.

          RICHARD
          Margaret 1, Richard 0.

          MARGARET
          Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang.

          RICHARD
          At Woodstock?

          

          

          

          

          70.

          MARGARET
          I won tickets on the radio and saw them at
          the fair.

          RICHARD
          What'd they sing again?

          MARGARET
          You know.

          (SINGING)
          Cherish the love we have, we should cherish
          the life we live...
          Richard shakes his head.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Well they were good.

          RICHARD
          You had a lot of soul there, Canada.

          MARGARET
          I really like "The O.C.".   Not fake, ha, ha
          isn't it funny I like this trash.   I really
          like it.

          RICHARD
          Wow.   I'm getting shut out here.

          MARGARET
          Allergic to pine nuts.

          RICHARD
          Knew that.

          MARGARET
          Afraid of penguins.

          RICHARD
          Huh.

          MARGARET
          Haven't slept with a man in a year and a
          half.

          RICHARD
          Holy shit!   You are a lesbian!
          A MOTHER walking by with her 7 year old gives Richard a nasty
          look.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (to mother)
          My bad.
          The mother walks on.   Margaret is mortified and walks faster.

          

          

          

          

          71.

          MARGARET
          Kool and the Gang gets nothing, but that
          gets a Holy shit?   I've been busy!

          RICHARD
          That's a really long time.

          MARGARET
          That hurts coming from Mr. Magic Pants.

          RICHARD
          I knew it had been slow going, but I figured
          there was a booty call in there somewhere.

          MARGARET
          Yeah, well, I'm not good at that.

          RICHARD
          I find that hard to believe.

          MARGARET
          No, not that.   I'm great at that.   Aces.
          Top notch.

          RICHARD
          I'll have to take your word for it.

          MARGARET
          Yes.   You will.

          RICHARD
          How, exactly, do you define top notch?
          Margaret is smiling as she listens to a message on her phone.   In
          an instant, she's all business.

          MARGARET
          I need a computer and the internet.   Now.

          INT. FISHERMAN'S NET INTERNET CAFE - DAY

          Designed to attract tourists, the Fisherman's Net is awash in bad
          nautical props and fishing gear.   A bored TEENAGE CLERK in a
          PIRATE OUTFIT greets Margaret and Richard.

          PIRATE
          Aye lassie, welcome to the cyber seas.   Our
          T-1 line is faster than a clipper ship in a
          hurricane, but for now ye be needing to
          scrawl your mark on this sign up sheet.
          Margaret looks and sees that all the computers are taken.

          

          

          

          

          72.

          MARGARET
          No, no, no.   I need on now.   I've got a
          Booker prize winning author demanding I send
          him an e-mail in the next forty five minutes
          explaining why he should stay with a
          publishing house that "makes" him do
          publicity.
          The Pirate looks at Margaret like she's speaking Chinese.

          PIRATE
          Arrgh...

          MARGARET
          Listen to me asshole...
          The Pirate looks around to make sure his boss can't hear.

          PIRATE
          Look lady.   You gonna put your name down on
          the list or not?
          Margaret is about to throttle the Pirate, when Richard pulls her
          back.

          RICHARD
          C'mon.   I got an idea.
          Richard leads Margaret to the door.   As they are leaving Margaret
          shouts out.

          MARGARET
          I didn't know there were a lot of pirates in
          Alaska!

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OFFICE - DAY

          Margaret sits at a computer, furiously opening her e-mail.
          Richard has brought her to his elementary school, where he and
          his old principal, MRS. WHITING, stand over Margaret.

          MRS. WHITING
          I'm so excited about the wedding!

          RICHARD
          Thanks for letting us use your computer.

          MRS. WHITING
          No problem.
          (to Margaret)
          So what flowers are you going with?
          Margaret turns around annoyed, but manages to keep her cool.

          MARGARET
          I'm sorry, but could I have a minute alone

          

          

          

          

          73.

          MRS. WHITING
          Oh.   Sure.

          RICHARD
          Show me around will you Mrs. Whiting?   It's
          been years.

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALL - DAY

          Richard and Mrs. Whiting walk around the elementary school.

          MRS. WHITING
          Do you think she'll be long?   I've got work
          to do.

          RICHARD
          She'll be out of there in two shakes.
          Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a
          class of second graders.   He stops transfixed.

          MRS. WHITING
          (re: Gertrude)
          We are so lucky to have her.   Mr. Megher
          really left us shorthanded when he ran off
          in the middle of the school year.   He's
          living out in the forest now with his
          wolves.   Full time.
          Richard hasn't heard anything that Mrs. Whiting has said.   He's
          hypnotized by Gertrude.   She looks happy teaching these kids, and
          they hang on her every word.
          MRS. WHITING (cont'd)
          Will you excuse me?   The bell is about to
          ring, I need to get ready for recess.

          RICHARD
          (not paying attention)
          Uh, sure.
          Mrs. Whiting leaves.   Richard goes to the door and Gertrude sees
          him.   Good lord can that woman smile.   She waves him in.

          INSIDE THE CLASSROOM
          The kids all turn to see Richard when he opens the door.

          GERTRUDE
          Class, this is my old friend Richard.

          CLASS
          (all together)
          Hi Richard!

          

          

          

          

          74.

          GERTRUDE
          Richard and I used to be in this very same
          classroom together.   We even had your old
          teacher, Mr. Megher.

          CHILD #1
          Mr. Megher smelled like farty eggs!
          The class giggles.

          GERTRUDE
          That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick.
          The BELL RINGS.   One girl gets up.   Gertrude eyeballs her.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          Marcia?

          CHILD #2
          Sorry.
          The child sits back down.   Gertrude waits a beat.

          GERTRUDE
          OK, everyone is excused for recess.
          All the kids pop up and head to the door.   Mrs. Whiting directs
          traffic outside.   Richard makes his way to Gertrude.

          RICHARD
          Patrick's right.   He did smell like eggs.

          GERTRUDE
          It's still not a nice thing to say.   And
          actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog
          and...
          (makes smoking pot motion)
          ...Matanuska Thunderfuck.   But let's keep
          that between us.

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OFFICE - DAY

          Margaret reads over her e-mail to Frank.

          MARGARET

          (READING)
          I give you my word as an editor and a
          friend...
          The door opens suddenly, and Margaret SHOUTS.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (STERN)
          Five more minutes!   Please!

          

          

          

          

          75.
          Margaret turns to find a PIG TAILED GIRL in the doorway.
          Terrified.   She SHRIEKS and runs off.   Margaret wants to
          apologize, but needs to keep working.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (WEAKLY)
          Sorry.

          INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

          Gertrude and Richard wipe down the chalk boards together.   They
          are very comfortable together and have an easy rapport.

          RICHARD
          Remember when Mr. Megher made us do this
          after school for a week?

          GERTRUDE
          That was your fault.

          RICHARD
          Was not!

          GERTRUDE
          You tried to kiss me.   A girl has to defend
          herself.

          RICHARD
          C'mon!
          (Tom Cruise ala Top Gun)
          I had the shot.   I took it.
          Gertrude rolls her eyes.   She's heard this a hundred times.

          GERTRUDE
          No Top Gun.   Please.

          RICHARD
          What?   You loved my Top Gun.

          GERTRUDE
          No.   You loved your Top Gun.   I just smiled
          and laughed like a good girlfriend.

          RICHARD
          That's right.   Ice... man.   I am dangerous.
          Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise.
          Gertrude is not impressed.

          GERTRUDE

          (LAUGHING)
          Really.   Stop.

          RICHARD
          That cuts deep.   I'll have you know that

          

          

          

          

          76.
          Talk of Margaret immediately shuts Gertrude down.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (noticing her change in mood)
          Uh, is something wrong?

          GERTRUDE
          No.   Nothing's wrong.

          RICHARD
          It's been awhile, but I can still tell when
          something's wrong with you.
          Gertrude doesn't want to say anything.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          What is it?   You know I hate it when you get
          all quiet.

          GERTRUDE
          I wish there was a better way to say this.

          RICHARD
          Better way to say what?

          GERTRUDE
          I made a huge mistake.   With you.   Breaking
          up with you.   I'm sorry.

          RICHARD
          Are you apologizing for high school?

          GERTRUDE
          Yes.

          RICHARD
          Oh, thank God.   I thought this was like,
          something big.

          GERTRUDE
          This is something big.

          RICHARD
          I coulda used this about five years ago, but
          I'm all good now, promise.   Thank you for
          saying that, though.
          Gertrude sees that Richard isn't getting her point.   She pulls
          herself together.

          GERTRUDE
          I think...
          (looking down)
          I want you back.

          RICHARD

          

          

          

          

          77.

          GERTRUDE
          (more to herself)
          Oh God, he's making me say it again.
          (looking at Richard)
          I want you back.   Like... we should be
          together.   All the time.

          RICHARD
          Whoa, whoa, whoa.   Rewind.

          GERTRUDE
          I know this isn't the best time to bring
          this up.

          RICHARD

          (RHETORICAL)
          My wedding day isn't the best time for you
          to bring up the idea of us dating?
          Richard's reaction stings, and Gertrude begins to well up.
          Bringing this up is very hard for her.

          GERTRUDE
          I'm not talking about dating!   You should
          move back here.   We can have the life you
          always talked about in High School.   I'm
          ready for that now.

          RICHARD
          Why are you doing this?

          GERTRUDE
          I know that the timing here sucks.   But we
          are meant to be together.   I know it.   I
          think you know it too...

          RICHARD
          No, I don't.   I don't know it.
          Richard begins to pace.   Not sure what to say.   Every time he
          opens his mouth, he can't find the words.
          Then, from the door, an interruption.

          MARGARET
          Hey guys.
          Holy shit.   Did Margaret hear anything?   Her face gives nothing
          away.   Gertrude and Richard act like nothing just happened, but
          look guilty as hell.

          GERTRUDE
          Oh.   Hey Margaret.

          RICHARD
          Uh, you all done?

          

          

          

          

          78.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   We'll see what he says.

          RICHARD
          Great.   Great.

          MARGARET
          You ready to get back to the house?

          RICHARD
          Uh.   Yeah.   Uh-huh.

          MARGARET
          Well let's go.   See you at the wedding,
          Gertrude.
          Gertrude just smiles.

          GERTRUDE
          Yeah.   See you at the wedding.

          EXT. PAXTON DOCK - DAY

          Richard and Margaret unload champagne.   Richard is still thinking
          about Gertrude and wanting to be alone.

          MARGARET
          So, what did you and Gertrude talk about?
          Richard lies.

          RICHARD
          Nothing.   About her school.   The kids and
          stuff.   Apparently my second grade teacher
          was a pot head.

          MARGARET
          That was it?   I was gone for awhile...

          RICHARD
          (cuts her off)
          Yeah.   That was it.   You know, I can do
          this.   You should really go try on the dress
          for my mom.

          MARGARET
          I was going to go for a run first, it's been
          three days since I got out, I'm feeling
          crazy.

          RICHARD
          (could care less)
          Whatever.
          Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but
          doesn't push it.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          EXT. PAXTON TRAIL - DAY

          Margaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods.   She's running
          hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's
          accumulated over the last thirty six hours.   She's lost in her
          own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop.

          MARGARET
          What now?
          Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.   She
          soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN
          dancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a
          carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as
          he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song
          that sounds centuries old.

          SHAMAN
          Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik
          pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani
          takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm.
          Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance.
          He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs.
          Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath.   He yells out again.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          Margaret, welcome!
          She looks around.   Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          Come to me, Margaret of New York.
          Nope, that's her.   She carefully steps out into the clearing.
          SHAMAN (cont'd)
          It is I, father Paxton.
          Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up.

          MARGARET
          What, ah, are you doing?

          GEOFFREY
          My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and
          clear my head.   As you know, things have
          been a little crazy around here.   You should
          join me.

          MARGARET
          Ya know, I've got to get back.

          GEOFFREY
          You closed minded southerners amuse me.
          Never willing to leave the nest and try

          

          

          

          

          80.

          MARGARET
          I'm a big fan of the nest.
          Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher.

          GEOFFREY
          Dance with me!   You besmirch my ways if you
          deny my circle.
          Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents.

          MARGARET
          OK, OK.   I "accept your circle."
          Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire.

          GEOFFREY
          Clear your mind and follow me.
          Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body.   Margaret
          follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it.   After
          a few moments, Margaret stops.

          MARGARET
          I'm gonna head back.

          GEOFFREY
          We're not done.

          MARGARET
          I think I am.
          Margaret begins to leave.   Geoffrey calls after her.

          GEOFFREY
          Margaret?
          Margaret stops and turns around.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.   But
          I'm making an effort here.   Don't leave now.
          Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.   Geoffrey is pleased.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Thank you.
          (switching gears)
          Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik
          pifiksailiriju m 1k...
          Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and
          speeds up the dance.   Margaret is getting better, but it is still
          painfully awkward.

          

          

          

          

          81.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          ...tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut
          qangalan uarm.
          Geoffrey speeds up the dance.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Now you.

          MARGARET
          Me what?

          GEOFFREY
          Chant.

          MARGARET
          Chant what?

          GEOFFREY
          Whatever comes out, just chant.   It is the
          way.   You'll feel better.

          MARGARET
          I can't...

          GEOFFREY
          Close your eyes.   Chant.
          Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing.   Margaret closes her eyes,
          but can't figure out what to say.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          Chant!

          MARGARET
          I don't know any chants!

          GEOFFREY
          Chant!

          MARGARET

          (GUTTERAL)
          Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...
          Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low
          noise.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...

          GEOFFREY
          Chant!
          The drum beat continues.

          MARGARET

          

          

          

          

          82.
          They continue to dance, Margaret is getting into it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to the wall...
          More sand.   More fire.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to sweat drop down my balls...
          Geoffrey stops dancing.   What did she say?
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...to all these bitches crawl...
          Margaret's eyes are closed, she doesn't realize that she's broken
          out into a âLil John song.   She continues to dance.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...To all skee skee motherfucker...
          Geoffrey takes the bear head mask off.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...all skee skee got damn...
          From the trees, the moment is broken when Debbie shouts out.

          DEBBIE
          Geoffrey!
          Margaret stops chanting âLil John.

          GEOFFREY
          Oh Debbie, I didn't do anything.
          Margaret sees Debbie and Grandma Annie in the clearing.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Is she singing about balls?

          MARGARET
          He told me I had to chant!

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Oh, you poor dear.   Geoffrey, you can't do
          this!
          (to Margaret)
          He's an eighth Tlingit, dear.

          DEBBIE
          He does this to keep in touch with "his
          people".

          

          

          

          

          83.

          GEOFFREY
          Don't make fun of my heritage!   And it was
          helping.   Don't you feel better?   I feel
          better.

          DEBBIE
          Come on sweetie, we need to get you cleaned
          up.   You've got a dress to try on.   And
          Geoffrey, put that fire out and come in and
          help us with this wedding.
          Geoffrey turns off the boom box that was hidden in the trees and
          the drum beat stops.

          GEOFFREY
          Fine.
          With a fire extinguisher, the bonfire comes to an end.

          INT. PAXTON MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

          Debbie and Annie wait outside a bathroom door in a massive master
          bedroom.   They talk to Margaret through the door.

          DEBBIE
          I am so excited.   Aren't you excited?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          This was my dress from 1929.   My mother made
          it by hand.   Amazing how things come back
          into style.   How does it fit?
          Margaret speaks through the door.

          MARGARET (O.S.)
          Just buttoning up here.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Drum roll!
          Grandma and Debbie enthusiastically make drum roll sounds.
          Margaret opens the door and smiles.   She's unsure of herself, but
          looks fantastic.   The dress fits great, except...
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Your boobs are bigger than mine ever were.

          MARGARET
          Yeah, it's a little snug.

          DEBBIE
          Come over here.
          Debbie leads Margaret to a mirror.   Grandma Annie follows.

          

          

          

          

          84.

          MARGARET

          (ADMITTING)
          It's a lovely dress.
          Debbie looks at Margaret, and spontaneously begins crying.

          DEBBIE
          (through the tears)
          You're so beautiful, and such a great match
          for my Richard.   I know I've just met you,
          but a mother can tell.   When he looks at
          you, I can tell he's in love.   I'm so happy
          I get to share your day.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Debbie, please.   We've got work to do.

          DEBBIE
          You're right.
          Debbie collects herself, then starts crying again.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          You go work downstairs, I'll finish this.
          Debbie tries to calm down, but can't.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Go!
          Debbie nods in agreement.   Smiling from ear to ear, she leaves in
          tears.   Margaret and Annie watch her go.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Had to get rid of her before I gave you
          this.   Don't think she woulda recovered.
          Grandma Annie comes from behind and puts her arms around
          Margaret's neck.   When she is done, a stunning blue necklace lays
          on Margaret's neck.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          You needed something blue.   It's silly, but
          I didn't want to take any chances.

          MARGARET
          It's beautiful.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's hematite.   Alaska diamonds.   The blue
          ones like this are very rare.   My great
          grandfather gave it to my great grandmother
          when they were married.   They were quite a
          scandal, you know.   He was Russian and she
          was Tlingit.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          85.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Back then, you had to get approval from
          every person in the tribe before you got
          married.   It almost broke them up.

          MARGARET
          How'd they stay together?

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Don't know.   But I'm sure happy they did,
          none of us would be here if they hadn't.
          Grandma and Margaret admire the necklace in the mirror.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          I want you to have it.
          This is awful news for Margaret.   She might as well be stealing
          from Annie.

          MARGARET
          No, no, no.   I can't.   Really.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          I don't want to hear it.   It's yours.
          Grandmothers like to give their stuff away
          to their grandchildren.   Makes us feel like
          we'll always be a part of your life, even
          after we're gone. Take it.
          Margaret puts her hand to the necklace, and for the first time
          feels like a complete and total fraud.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          Are you feeling all right, dear?
          Margaret doesn't speak.   Annie patiently waits for her reply.

          MARGARET
          Well.   Thing is...
          Margaret deliberates spilling her guts to Annie, but can't.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          ...the dress is just a little tight.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Oh, don't worry about that.   We've got these
          seams by the arm, this'll be easy.
          Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk.
          GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd)
          We can fix this no problem.
          Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard helps WORKERS build a stage for the band.   He's still in
          a foul mood when Margaret interrupts in a panic.

          MARGARET
          We need to talk.

          RICHARD
          I'm a little busy.

          MARGARET
          Well I'm freaking out.   I need to get away
          from here.   From everyone.   Now.

          RICHARD
          Go for another run.

          MARGARET
          No!   I did that.   It did not help.

          RICHARD
          I'm a little tired of you making demands and
          me just jumping...

          MARGARET
          (re: wedding stuff)
          We're not going to need any of this if I
          don't get out of here.

          RICHARD
          OK, high maintenance.   Let's go.

          EXT. PAXTON SPEED BOAT - DAY

          Unlike the bulky yacht, this boat is built for speed and
          maneuverability. Richard starts her up.

          MARGARET
          Move over, I'm driving.
          Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel.

          RICHARD
          You don't know where we're going.
          Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off.

          MARGARET
          It doesn't matter.

          ON THE OPEN OCEAN
          Margaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the
          horizon.

          

          

          

          

          87.
          As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees,
          blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the
          coastline have a calming effect on both of them.   In Alaska, it
          doesn't take long to leave humanity behind.
          Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep
          mountain walls on either side.   Although it is still warm out, an
          icy beach can be seen straight ahead.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Where are we?

          RICHARD
          The north pole.   Congratulations, we made
          it.
          (off Margaret's look)
          It's a glacier.   Tracy's Arm.   You better
          let me take it from here.

          MARGARET
          I'm fine.

          RICHARD
          Oh.   OK.   So like me, you've navigated a lot
          of glacier fields?   And not died?
          Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Lady, you've got issues.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   I'm a control freak.   Fine.

          RICHARD
          It doesn't stop there.

          MARGARET
          This coming from the sociopath.

          RICHARD
          Oh, please.

          MARGARET
          I'd never bring me here.

          RICHARD
          You drove!

          MARGARET
          I mean to Alaska.

          RICHARD
          Are you kidding me?
          Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine.

          

          

          

          

          88.

          MARGARET
          You're sick.   Doing this to them.

          RICHARD
          I explained to you...

          MARGARET
          They love you.   Do you get that?

          RICHARD
          Of course.

          MARGARET
          And you're still willing to lie to them?

          RICHARD
          Like you didn't know.

          MARGARET
          Didn't know what?

          RICHARD
          That we were going to lie to them.

          MARGARET
          I didn't know!

          RICHARD
          Well that makes you either stupid, or
          ignorant.

          MARGARET
          You think I'm stupid?

          RICHARD
          No, but what's behind door number two...

          MARGARET

          (SCREAMS)
          I forgot!   OK?   I forgot!

          RICHARD
          Forgot what?

          MARGARET
          What it was like!

          RICHARD
          What what was like?

          MARGARET
          To have a family!   I forgot what it was like
          to have a family.   I've been on my own since
          I was thirteen, and I'd forgot what it was
          like to have people that love you, and make
          you breakfast, and give you necklaces...

          

          

          

          

          89.
          Suddenly, Margaret has a hard time speaking and is short of
          breath.   She goes to the side of the speed boat.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I'm going to take a walk.

          RICHARD
          We need to head back...

          MARGARET
          Alone.   I need alone time.

          RICHARD
          What?
          Margaret looks at Richard with a scared and confused look.

          MARGARET
          I'm, uh, about to lose my shit.   Big time.
          I need a second.

          RICHARD
          But...

          MARGARET

          (PANICKED)
          Stop right there!
          Richard puts up his hands in surrender and stays put.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I'm going to be over there.   Away from you.
          Just sit down, turn around, and act like
          you're not here.
          Richard goes to speak, but Margaret motions for him to sit down
          and turn around.   He does.   Margaret gets off the boat and walks
          away from him on the glacier.

          ON THE GLACIER
          Margaret tries diaphragmatic breathing to calm down.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (manic, to herself)
          You can do this.   Couple more hours, and
          then you'll never see these people again.
          Eventually you'll write a letter.
          Apologize.   Send the necklace back.

          RICHARD
          (from the boat)
          Margaret!

          MARGARET
          No talking!

          

          

          

          

          90.

          RICHARD
          (from the boat)
          Watch your step, OK?   It can be dangerous.

          MARGARET
          Again, you're not supposed to be...
          Margaret doesn't finish her sentence.

          ON THE BOAT
          Richard sits with his back turned to Margaret, waiting for her
          reply.   He doesn't hear anything.   That's weird.

          RICHARD
          (back still turned)
          Margaret?
          Richard turns around and looks for Margaret.   He doesn't see her.
          He gets out of the boat and goes onto the glacier, walking in the
          direction he last saw Margaret.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Margaret?   I know I'm breaking "the rules"
          here, but where are you?
          He takes one more step before he hears...

          MARGARET (O.S.)

          (YELLING)
          Richard!!!!!!!!   Help!!!!!!!!
          Richard still can't see her, but runs in the direction of her
          voice.   He soon rounds a mound of ice and sees that --
          Margaret's been swallowed by the ice.   Her upper torso sticks out
          of the glacier, held up by her arms.   Her eyes are wide, and
          she's almost hyperventilating.     It's a bizarre sight.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh, thank God!
          Richard tries to control himself, but BURSTS OUT LAUGHING.
          Margaret is really scared.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Wh-, wh-, why are you laughing?

          RICHARD
          I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   Just relax.   I'll
          get you out of there.   You've broken through
          an ice bridge.   It happens all the time.   No
          biggie.

          MARGARET
          Don't do that.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          RICHARD
          Don't do what?

          MARGARET
          The thing that doctors do in E.R. when they
          tell the gunshot victim who is bleeding to
          death that they're going to be OK.   Don't do
          that!

          RICHARD
          It's not like that.   Really.   We do need to
          be careful here though, I don't want us both
          to fall in.   Stay still, OK?

          MARGARET
          Uh-huh.
          Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the
          ice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way.

          RICHARD
          So, I'm going to walk up to you and very
          slowly pull you out.   OK?

          MARGARET
          I'm really cold.

          RICHARD
          Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded
          by ice.

          MARGARET
          (makes sense)

          OK.
          Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to
          his knee.   He calmly looks down on her.

          RICHARD
          So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits.
          I'm probably going to touch boob.   But don't
          freak out.
          Margaret shakes her head yes.   Richard reaches down and slowly
          lifts her out of the ice.   Margaret doesn't say a word.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          When I get you all the way out, I need you
          to hold onto me.   I'm going to carry you
          over there.
          Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.   He's
          strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her "over
          the threshold" style, away from the hole in the ice.   He speaks
          once they're safe.

          

          

          

          

          92.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          I've, uh, never done that before.

          MARGARET
          You said it was "no biggie".

          RICHARD
          Yeah.   Well.   You OK?

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   I'm fine.
          Richard smiles.   Margaret smiles back.
          Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits
          just right.   Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (SMILING)
          You shouldn't of laughed at me.

          RICHARD
          You woulda laughed at me.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   While I was getting my camera.
          The two stare at each other for a beat.   There's a real spark.
          They might kiss.

          RICHARD
          Gertrude wants me back.
          Whoah.   Not what she was expecting.   She looks down.

          MARGARET
          And?

          RICHARD
          Well.   It seemed like you were having...
          second thoughts.

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   I was.

          RICHARD
          Maybe we should do it.   Come clean.

          MARGARET
          Put me down.
          Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.   She tries to regain
          her composure.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          You wanna call it off?

          

          

          

          

          93.

          RICHARD
          If you do.

          MARGARET
          Fine.   It's over.   We'll tell them when we
          get back.

          ON THE BOAT
          Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her.
          Richard drives the boat.   They don't talk.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above
          them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting
          married.   The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a
          hurry.   He's clearly been waiting.

          GEOFFREY
          Come with me.

          RICHARD
          Where's mom, dad?   We all need to talk.

          GEOFFREY
          Not now.   C'mon.
          Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do.
          Geoffrey storms off and they follow.

          EXT. PAXTON GUESTHOUSE - DAY

          Richard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the
          guesthouse.   Geoffrey stops before they go in.

          GEOFFREY
          (to Richard)
          I haven't told your mother about any of
          this, and I don't plan to.
          (to Margaret)
          I was really beginning to like you.   Sorry
          about this.
          Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside.

          INSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE
          The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court.   In the
          middle of the court, a man patiently sits on a metal folding
          chair.   It's Gilbertson.   He smiles.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Hey there kids.   Good to see ya!

          

          

          

          

          94.

          RICHARD
          (to Dad)
          What did you do?
          Geoffrey doesn't answer.   He's not proud of himself.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          (getting angry)
          What did you do, dad?!

          GEOFFREY
          I called him yesterday.   He told me that you
          were lying, and that he was going to catch
          you.   That he was going to send you to
          prison.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          (to Richard)
          We made a deal and dad here flew me up.   Now
          you tell the truth, and get off scott free.
          It's like it never happened for you.

          RICHARD
          You made a deal with him?   On my behalf?

          GEOFFREY
          You were making a mistake...

          RICHARD
          That's none of your business.

          MARGARET
          It's fine.

          RICHARD
          The hell it is.   It is not fine!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Oh quack, quack, quack.   Just tell me what
          really happened, and I'll be on my way.   No
          one gets hurt, we all get what we want.
          Margaret takes Richard's hand.

          MARGARET
          It's OK.   Tell him.

          RICHARD
          (to Geoffrey)
          You do not get to make this decision.   This
          is my decision.
          (to Gilbertson)
          The truth is... I've been working for
          Margaret for three years.   Six months ago we
          started dating.   I recently asked her to
          marry me, and she said yes.   See you both at

          

          

          

          

          95.

          GEOFFREY
          What are you doing, Richard?

          RICHARD
          (grabs Margaret's hand)
          Come on, we gotta get ready.
          Margaret and Richard storm out of the squash court.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          The couple walks briskly to the house.

          RICHARD
          What was I thinking?   They act like they're
          nice, but really, they're evil.

          MARGARET
          He's only doing it because he loves you.

          RICHARD
          Are you defending him?   Are you defending
          the king dick?

          MARGARET
          Just stop.   Think about this.

          RICHARD
          Oh, I've thought about it.   And know what I
          think?   I think you saved my life.   Thank
          you, Margaret.   Getting married to you is
          the best thing that's ever happened to me.
          Without this, I might've ended up back here.
          Up at the house, Debbie opens the door.

          DEBBIE
          There you are!   You two almost gave me a
          heart attack.   C'mon, get dressed!

          RICHARD
          Coming mom!
          (to Margaret)
          Time to sack up.
          Richard winks and goes inside.   Margaret follows, not sure.

          THE WEDDING MONTAGE
          -- Chairs are set up outside.
          -- Guests arrive via boat.
          -- Richard stands on the deck, wearing his tuxedo.   Gertrude
          arrives for the wedding, and they lock eyes.   Richard waves hello
          and mouths "Sorry."   He goes back inside.

          

          

          

          

          96.
          -- Geoffrey sits in his bedroom and watches TV.   He's not dressed
          for the wedding yet.   Debbie shakes her head at him in the mirror
          as she puts on her ear rings.
          -- Gilbertson eats every hors d'oeuvre that's offered to him.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Grandma knocks on the door and comes inside.   We see Margaret
          from head to toe.   The dress, veil and flowers look amazing.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          If I were one to brag, I'd say that dress is
          perfect.

          MARGARET
          Matches the shoes.
          Margaret pulls up the dress to reveal running sneakers.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Those'll be your best friend.   Wedding shoes
          stink.   You ready?

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          With the ocean in the background, 200 GUESTS sit in white chairs.
          Richard stands under a gazebo, and smiles at his mother in the
          front row.   He ignores Geoffrey.
          Gertrude sits nearby, next to Gilbertson.
          From the gazebo, Richard nods at a GROUP OF CELLO PLAYERS, who
          begin playing from downloaded sheet music that reads "Kool and
          the Gang, Cherish".   Heads turn with the start of the music, to
          see Annie walk Margaret down the aisle.
          When Margaret recognizes the song, she smiles.

          MARGARET
          (mouthing to Richard)
          Nice song.
          Richard shrugs his shoulders.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          Is that your song, dear?

          MARGARET
          I guess so.
          Margaret and Annie stop at the end of the aisle.   Looking up,
          Margaret sees the justice of the peace, Ramone.                      (Yes, the same
          guy from the liquor store and the strip club.)

          RAMONE

          

          

          

          

          97.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          It's me, Ramone.
          Margaret gives Annie a kiss, and then turns to Richard.   They
          whisper while they walk up to Ramone.

          RICHARD
          You look gorgeous.

          MARGARET

          (SMILING)
          You look disgusting.

          RICHARD
          So, is this what you dreamed of when you
          were a little girl?

          MARGARET
          Oh, you bet.
          They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Ramone.

          RAMONE

          (QUIETLY)
          Mi amo.
          (To the crowd)
          We are gathered here today to celebrate one
          of life's greatest moments.   To give
          recognition to the beauty, honesty, and
          unselfish ways...
          Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's
          looking straight ahead, determined to get through this.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          ...of Richard and Margaret's true love...
          "True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the
          audience notices.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          ...before their family and friends.
          "Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and
          Geoffrey.   She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in
          order to keep himself seated.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          For it is family and friends who taught
          Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only
          right that family and friends all celebrate
          that love here today.

          

          

          

          

          98.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          And if there is anyone who has cause why
          this couple should not be united in marriage
          and love, they must speak now or forever
          hold their peace.
          Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask.
          Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention.
          He's not sure what to do.
          RAMONE (cont'd)
          Mi amo, do you have a question?
          We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted
          shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself.

          MARGARET
          No.

          RAMONE
          Then why is your hand up?

          MARGARET
          I have something to say.   It's not a
          question though.

          RAMONE
          Can it wait âtil after?

          MARGARET
          Uh.   Um.   No.

          RICHARD
          What are you doing?
          Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd.     They
          stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner.

          MARGARET
          Hey there, folks.   Thanks for coming out.
          I've got a little announcement to make about
          the "wedding."

          RICHARD
          Don't do this.
          Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand.

          MARGARET
          Not sure the best way to tell you all this.
          But, uh... I made Richard marry me.   This is
          all a sham.
          Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air.

          

          

          

          

          99.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I was going to get kicked out of the country
          -- so I told Richard that I would destroy
          his career if he didn't marry me.

          RICHARD
          Now wait...

          MARGARET
          Richard.   Please.   Let me finish.
          (to the Paxton family)
          Richard wanted to stop this when we got off
          the plane, but I wouldn't let him.   Don't
          blame him.   This is all my fault.
          (to Ramone)
          Could you get the band started?   And give
          these people something to drink.
          (to Gilbertson)
          And you.   Meet me at your dingy in ten,
          you're taking me to the airport.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          You got it!
          Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks
          back up the aisle with all eyes on her.   She stops when she gets
          to Gertrude and leans down.

          MARGARET
          Take care of him.

          GERTRUDE
          Promise.
          Margaret walks back into the house.   Alone.

          INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY

          Margaret's wedding dress is laid out on the bed.   Her bag is
          packed.   Richard knocks and comes in.   Margaret is on the phone.

          MARGARET
          (unenthusiastically to phone)
          Uh-huh.   Yeah.   That's great Frank.   Good
          news.   Talk to you on Monday.
          Margaret hangs up.

          RICHARD
          So Frank's back in?
          Margaret nods distractedly.   Getting Frank to do the publicity
          tour doesn't mean much right now.

          MARGARET
          Yup.   He's in.   For now.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          RICHARD
          Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird?

          MARGARET
          Yeah.   Right.
          Margaret starts collecting her bags.

          RICHARD
          Great exit back there.

          MARGARET
          Thanks.   Fun weekend.

          RICHARD
          Same old, same old, around here.

          MARGARET
          Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to
          strip the sheets, so I just left them.

          RICHARD
          I'll let her know.

          (BEAT)
          Why did you tell them all that?

          MARGARET
          It was getting too messy.   We weren't going
          to be able to keep it up.

          RICHARD
          Don't start lying to me now.
          Margaret stops for a moment.

          MARGARET
          I heard you and Gertrude at the school.   I
          think she meant what she said.   She's a
          great girl, you should stay.   It's the right
          thing.   You're perfect for each other.

          RICHARD
          But... but what about you?   What are you
          gonna do?
          Margaret wants to keep the conversation short.

          MARGARET
          Don't worry about me.   I'll survive.

          RICHARD
          So what?   This is it?

          MARGARET
          Yup.   This is it.

          

          

          

          

          101.
          Margaret walks to the door, but stops.   She turns to Richard.
          Despite her best effort to act cold, she can't help herself.
          MARGARET (cont'd)

          (SINCERE)
          Have an amazing life, OK?   You're a good
          person.   You deserve it.
          She puts out her hand, and Richard shakes it.   It's electric, but
          Margaret denies it.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Goodbye, Richard.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Margaret walks down to the dock carrying her suitcase.   She can
          hear that the party is in full swing and smiles.

          EXT. BOAT - DAY

          Gilbertson drives his little speedboat and Margaret holds her
          suitcase tight.   It's choppy, and the outboard motor is loud.
          The two have to yell to talk.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I want you to say the words.

          MARGARET
          I'm not doing great in the dignity
          department, can we not do this right now?

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Say it.
          Margaret closes her eyes.   Hating that it's come to this.

          MARGARET
          I'll publish your book.
          Gilbertson smiles.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Now was that so hard?

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          Richard sits by himself and finishes a beer by the shore.
          Gertrude walks up to him, looking fabulous, with two more beers.

          GERTRUDE
          So here's the deal.   I'm going to have a
          million questions for you tomorrow...
          Gertrude sits down next to Richard.

          

          

          

          

          102.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          ...but for now I thought we'd just sit here
          and drink beer.   OK?
          Richard nods.   Gertrude hands him a beer.

          RICHARD
          Thanks.
          Richard thanks her with a kiss on the cheek.   Then, realizing
          where and who he is with, he puts his beer down.   He turns to
          Gertrude again with a determined look, gives her a kiss on the
          lips, then follows it up with an even bigger kiss.
          When they finish, Gertrude is grinning, eyes closed.
          Richard looks worried.   Something is wrong.

          GERTRUDE
          You have been practicing.

          RICHARD
          Waddya mean?

          GERTRUDE
          Well.   Margaret told me that you, uh, turned
          into bit of a man whore down there.
          Richard looks down.   A bit ashamed.   Gertrude makes light.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          You're gonna have to put that in check if
          you move back.   Cause me and Beth Cable are
          the only two real options up here... and
          I'll kick that bitch's ass.
          Richard gives her a polite smile.   He's not really in the mood to
          joke.   Gertrude notices.
          GERTRUDE (cont'd)
          So no jokes yet?   Too soon?

          RICHARD
          I'm sorry.   I'm just a little... confused.

          GERTRUDE
          That kiss didn't seem "confused."
          Richard takes a beat to collect himself.

          RICHARD
          You're amazing, Gert.   And I've thought
          about being with you for a long time.   A
          long time.   When you said those things at
          the school?   I've dreamed about hearing you
          say those things.

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          103.
          RICHARD                                                         (cont'd)
          But as crazy as this seems.   I know now...
          that we're just not meant to be.
          Gertrude pulls back like she's been punched.
          RICHARD (cont'd)
          Thing is... when I said goodbye to Margaret?
          I felt sick.   For the three years we worked
          together, I wanted to be as far away from
          her as possible.   But now that she's gone?
          I'm just really... sad.   I want her with me.
          What is that?
          The question hangs in the air.

          GERTRUDE
          I don't know.

          RICHARD
          I think I have to find out.

          GERTRUDE
          Find out what?

          RICHARD
          If she feels the same way.
          Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry.

          GERTRUDE
          Well.   OK then.   What's a girl gonna do?
          (voice cracking)
          I guess you want who you want.
          Gertrude gives a melancholy smile.

          RICHARD
          I'm so sorry.

          (BEAT)
          But, I gotta go.

          GERTRUDE
          Uh-huh.
          Richard gets up.

          RICHARD
          Are you OK?

          GERTRUDE
          I'm fine.   Really.   Go.
          Gertrude nods her approval and Richard runs off to the party.

          

          

          

          

          104.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - PARTY - DAY

          Debbie, Geoffrey and Annie sit at a table next to the bar,
          dumbstruck looks on their faces.   Ramone mixes drinks and flips
          bottles.   Richard runs up to them all, looking excited.

          GEOFFREY
          What are you so God damn happy about?

          RICHARD
          What?   Oh.   Well, I'm, uh, going to see
          Margaret.

          GEOFFREY
          What?!

          DEBBIE
          She violated you.   We should report her.

          RICHARD
          Who you gonna report her to, mom?

          DEBBIE
          Oh my God.   He's got the Stockholm syndrome.

          RICHARD
          I don't have the Stockholm syndrome.   And
          she didn't violate me.

          DEBBIE
          What is going on, Richard?
          Richard slows down and explains to his mom.

          RICHARD
          I'm sorry I lied to you.   That was an awful
          thing to do.   But it took this weekend for
          me to see how funny, and screwed up and
          perfect Margaret is for me.   I think
          she's... the one.

          DEBBIE
          But you already thought she was the one.

          RICHARD
          No, I didn't.   Not until she left.

          DEBBIE
          Really?   Does she think that too?

          RICHARD
          I don't know.   I've got to get to the
          airport to find out.
          Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile.

          

          

          

          

          105.

          DEBBIE
          (so romantic)
          He's going to stop her from leaving!   At the
          airport!

          RICHARD
          But I gotta hurry.   Her plane leaves any
          second.   I might not make it.

          DEBBIE
          (so romantic)
          He's not sure he's going to make it!

          GEOFFREY
          Are you buying this horse shit?

          DEBBIE
          Oh, Geoffrey!

          RICHARD
          I don't have time to explain this to you.

          GEOFFREY
          Well then make some god-damn time.   Cause I
          won't let you throw your life away for some
          woman.

          RICHARD
          I don't care.

          GEOFFREY
          Excuse me?

          RICHARD
          I don't care.   I love you and want you to
          understand.   But I'm not asking your
          permission here.   I'm doing this.

          GEOFFREY
          Oh, really?
          From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts.

          ANNIE
          Boys!   Stop it! Stop it!   Stop it!
          But suddenly, a look of panic flashes across Annie's face.   She
          grabs the table to steady herself, but pulls the table cloth,
          causing a loud crash.   Geoffrey and Richard run over.

          GEOFFREY
          Mom, are you OK?

          ANNIE
          I'm having a... I need to go to the
          hospital.   Fast.

          

          

          

          

          106.

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Margaret and Gilbertson board the jet together.   Margaret finds
          her seat in first class and discovers the Handsome Man from the
          flight before sitting nearby.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (re: Gilbertson)
          Is this another gay assistant?
          Margaret doesn't say anything and takes her seat.

          EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY

          TWO COAST GUARDSMAN carry Annie on a gurney to their waiting
          helicopter.   Geoffrey, Richard, and Debbie follow behind.   They
          all pile into a large chopper and fly off.

          INT. COAST GUARD HELICOPTER - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          An oxygen mask covers Annie's face.   Geoffrey holds her hand.
          Annie motions for Geoffrey to come closer and he leans down.
          Geoffrey sits up and shouts over the helicopter noise.

          GEOFFREY
          Richard!   She has something she wants to say
          to us!
          Richard leans down, and joins Geoffrey and Annie.   Their three
          heads are very close together.   Annie speaks to them both through
          the oxygen mask.

          ANNIE
          Listen to me.   You two need to stop
          fighting.   You'll never see eye to eye, but
          you're family.   If this doesn't stop, one
          day you'll regret it.
          (to Geoffrey)
          Promise me you'll stand by Richard, even if
          you don't agree with him.

          GEOFFREY
          I... I promise.

          ANNIE
          And Richard.   Promise you'll work harder to
          be a part of this family.

          RICHARD
          I promise, Grandma.

          ANNIE
          OK, then.
          Annie closes her eyes.   She looks peaceful.   A moment passes.

          

          

          

          

          107.
          Then suddenly Annie takes off her mask, sits up, and yells to th
          pilot.
          ANNIE (cont'd)
          (as if nothing happened)
          I'm feeling much better.   I don't need to go
          to the hospital.   Take us to the airport,
          please.
          Richard and Geoffrey are confused.   Stunned even.

          GEOFFREY
          What... what is going on?
          (so the Coast Guard can't hear)
          Did you fake a heart attack?

          ANNIE
          We didn't have time for your squabbling, and
          I knew a helicopter would be the quickest
          way to the airport.   It seemed like the best
          way.

          RICHARD
          The best way?

          ANNIE
          And remember, you two promised me that
          you're going get along.   I wasn't kidding
          about that.

          COAST GUARD PILOT
          Ma'am, I'm not authorized to take you to the
          airport...

          ANNIE
          (to pilot)
          Larry Ferris!   Don't make me call your
          mother!

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Gilbertson talks non-stop.   Margaret is in hell.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...I want my book launch to be special.   I'm
          thinking we throw a soiree at the Nevsky
          Monastery.   In St. Petersberg?
          Margaret stares at him blankly.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          (as if she should know)
          Where Dostoyevsky is buried?   Hello?   I
          thought you were a professional...
          Margaret closes her eyes to numb the pain.

          

          

          

          

          108.

          EXT. SITKA AIRPORT - DAY

          The helicopter lands, and Richard jumps out.   His family follows
          as they run to the control tower.

          INT. AIRPORT TOWER - DAY

          CHUCK has an easy job.   Jets fly into Sitka, but there are only
          about six flights a day.   He is half awake as he radios
          Margaret's flight.   Reggae music plays in the background.

          CHUCK
          Flight 1601, you're clear for takeoff.

          PILOT (O.S.)
          Roger that, Chuck.
          The PHONE RINGS in the tower.   Chuck picks up.   Intercut as
          necessary, with Richard running on a cell phone.

          CHUCK
          Tower.   Talk to me.

          RICHARD
          Hey Chuck, it's Richard.

          CHUCK
          Hey man.   Heard about your lady bailing.
          How often does this happen to you?

          RICHARD
          Need you to do me a solid, brother.   I gotta
          see my girl and she's on that flight.   Could
          you stop it for me?

          CHUCK
          No can do brohan.   Need a good reason for
          the FAA holes.   Lose my jobby job if I
          delivered that favor.

          RICHARD
          Oh, c'mon Chuck!

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          The plane rattles as it gains speed for takeoff.   Margaret
          studies the safety pamphlet, trying to ignore Gilbertson.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...so next topic.   Celebrities.   Let's
          invite the Bill Clinton's and leave out the
          Paris Hilton's, OK?
          Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane
          leave Sitka.

          

          

          

          

          109.

          EXT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard and his family stand outside the tower and watch
          Margaret's plane take off.

          RICHARD
          Well.   That's it.   Once she gets back to New
          York, it'll be like this never happened.
          Richard looks defeated.   Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and
          takes a deep breath.

          GEOFFREY
          So, you know I think you shouldn't be with
          Margaret, right?

          RICHARD
          You've made that crystal clear.

          GEOFFREY
          Good.
          (looks at Annie)
          Well, consider this me keeping my promise.
          Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button.   He waits
          for an answer.
          GEOFFREY (cont'd)
          (to phone)
          Hey!   Maguire!   Yeah, yeah, yeah, her
          running out was something.   But that's what
          I'm calling about.   I've got a favor to ask
          you, âbout one of your planes...

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Gilbertson continues to talk.   Margaret is in a stupor.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          ...you know those two hundred pages I took
          out?   I'm going to put them back...
          A flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Ms. Mills?   Would you come with me?
          Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson.

          MARGARET
          Yes, of course.
          She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          What's this about?

          

          

          

          

          110.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          (never done this before)
          There's someone on the radio for you.
          The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant CB located at
          the front of the plane, outside the cockpit.
          FLIGHT ATTENDANT (cont'd)
          Uh, a Richard Paxton?
          Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat belt.

          MARGARET
          Tell him I'm not here.

          CUT TO:

          INT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard and his family are huddled around the radio in the tower.
          Chuck sits nearby.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
          (from radio)
          I'm sorry.   She won't come talk to you.

          RICHARD
          Shit!   She's never going to pick up...

          CHUCK
          (to Richard)
          Know what, home slice?   Cut this chica
          loose.   You remember Beth Cable?   She'd
          totally be into you...
          Suddenly, Richard has an idea.   He picks up the hand mic.

          RICHARD
          Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you
          ask the captain to do me one more favor...

          CUT TO:

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          DING!   The captain comes on over the loudspeaker.

          CAPTAIN
          (over plane loudspeaker)
          Welcome to flight 1601 to Seattle, this is
          your captain.   We've reached our cruising
          altitude of 30,000 feet.   Flight time'll   be
          three hours and thirty minutes.   And
          Margaret?   Richard has something he'd like
          to say to you.

          

          

          

          

          111.

          RICHARD (O.S.)
          (over loudspeaker)
          Uh, hey Margaret.   And cause I'm on the
          loudspeaker, hey everyone on the plane.
          The other passengers look around to try and figure out who's
          Margaret.   Meanwhile, Margaret looks down and acts like she
          doesn't know either.
          RICHARD (O.S.) (cont'd)
          (over loudspeaker)
          This certainly isn't how I wanted to do
          this.   I mean, I'm not really into the whole
          baring your soul in front of strangers
          thing, but I figure it's now or never.   So
          here goes.

          CUT TO:

          INT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard puts down the hand mic for a second to gain composure.
          His family encourages him on.

          CHUCK
          You're doing great, man.
          Richard pushes the button down on the hand mike.

          RICHARD
          I know you're used to being on your own.
          And that you're comfortable with your life
          the way it is.   And that in a million years
          you wouldn't have thought that we should be
          together.   I know, because I felt the exact
          same way.

          CUT TO:

          INT. PLANE - DAY

          Every passenger is enraptured by the words coming out of the
          loudspeaker.   The flight attendants, the Handsome Man, everyone.

          RICHARD (O.S.)
          (over loudspeaker)
          And you know what else I know?   I know that
          I'm tired of being alone.   And I think
          you're tired of being alone too.   So come
          on.   Talk to me.   Please.
          The Handsome Man turns to Margaret.

          HANDSOME MAN
          (with genuine concern)
          Do you really feel like you're alone?

          

          

          

          

          112.

          MARGARET
          Oh, good lord.

          CUT TO:

          INT. TOWER - DAY

          Richard and his family stare at the radio, waiting to see if
          there is going to be an answer.   Chuck crosses his fingers.

          MARGARET (O.S.)
          (from radio)
          What the hell are you doing?
          Everyone in the tower smiles.   They're making progress.

          RICHARD
          We need to talk.
          (Intercut as necessary.   Margaret stands at the front of the
          plane with the passengers watching.)

          MARGARET
          About what?

          RICHARD
          Have you ever thought there might be a
          reason we've been together for the last
          three years?

          MARGARET
          As boss and assistant.

          RICHARD
          Things change, Margaret.

          MARGARET

          (INCREDULOUS)
          Things change?

          RICHARD
          Yeah, things change.

          MARGARET
          Is that the best you got?
          Geoffrey hits Richard, as if to say "see, that's what I said."
          Richard composes himself.

          RICHARD
          Now, tell me the truth.   When you left, were
          you relieved or sad that we didn't have an
          excuse to be together anymore?
          Geoffrey gives Richard the thumbs up.   That was a good one.

          

          

          

          

          113.

          MARGARET
          What's your point?

          RICHARD
          Because I am sick that you left.   And if you
          feel sick too, then why shouldn't we just be
          together?
          Margaret goes to answer, but stops.   Richard is right.   She wants
          to go back.   Even the passengers on the plane can see it.
          Gilbertson panics.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Are you thinking about going back to him?
          Margaret doesn't answer.
          MR. GILBERTSON (cont'd)
          We have a deal!   You can't back out now!
          The flight attendant steps in, annoyed that Gilbertson is trying
          to break up Richard and Margaret.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Sir, you need to sit down.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          I will do no such thing.

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Sir, I'm ordering you to return to your
          seat.
          Other passengers yell "sit down asshole" at Gilbertson.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Who said that?

          FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          Sir, this is your third and final warning!

          MR. GILBERTSON
          Listen sweetheart...
          (he pokes the flight attendant)
          I'm a federal officer, so why don't you get
          me another cocktail and mind your own...
          BUZZ! ZAP!                                                            400,000 Volts of electricity surge through
          Gilbertson.   He twitches violently and crashes to the floor.
          Behind him, The Handsome Man holds a stun gun and a badge.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Well, I'm a federal Air Marshall.   And
          you're under arrest for disobeying a crew
          member, assault, and possible intoxication.

          

          

          

          

          114.
          The Handsome Man pulls out flex cuffs, zips them around
          Gilbertson's wrists, and throws him in the bathroom.   He then
          takes the CB from Margaret and speaks to the passengers.
          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)
          Sorry everybody, but protocol says we need
          to get this unruly passenger off the plane
          ASAP.   Sitka's the closest airport, so if
          it's OK with you, I'm gonna have the captain
          turn this bird around.
          There are wild cheers from the passengers.   Margaret blushes.
          HANDSOME MAN (cont'd)
          (winks at Margaret)
          Told you I was a romantic.

          EXT. SITKA AIRPORT RUNWAY - DAY

          Flight 1601 glides to a safe landing.   Richard and his family
          wait on the tarmac, and the plane taxis to them.   A truck drives
          stairs to the front door of the plane and the door opens.
          Margaret steps out.   Richard walks up the steps.

          MARGARET
          This wasn't supposed to happen.
          Richard looks Margaret in the eye.

          RICHARD
          But it did.
          Margaret looks down.   A little embarrassed.

          MARGARET
          I'm not the kind of girl who gets saved.
          Richard smiles, and without warning, Margaret grabs him, and
          plants a long, deep, and wet kiss on him.
          The long kiss is interrupted by the Handsome Man and Gilbertson.

          HANDSOME MAN
          Uh, sorry, but excuse us.
          The Handsome Man leads a handcuffed and still dazed Gilbertson
          down the steps.

          MARGARET
          (to Gilbertson)
          Hey!   Do you think getting arrested might
          affect you at work?
          Gilbertson has no retort.

          

          

          

          

          115.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          Oh, and I'm not going to be able to publish
          your book after all.

          MR. GILBERTSON
          So you are getting married this weekend?

          MARGARET

          (SMILING)
          Absolutely not.   But who knows?
          (looking at Richard)
          We might by the time you get out of jail.
          Gilbertson makes a "go to hell" face and shuffles off.
          Margaret turns back to Richard.   All smiles.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          I've got some explaining to do.
          Margaret and Richard walk down the steps and stand in front of
          Richard's family.
          MARGARET (cont'd)
          (to Debbie)
          Hi.   I'm Margaret.   I've known your son for
          years, but we've just recently begun to see
          each other romantically.
          (to Geoffrey)
          I want to get to know you all, and spend
          some real time up here in Alaska.
          (to Annie)
          I'm not sure when you are going to see him
          get married, but I promise as long as I'm
          with him, he'll be happy.
          Passengers cram up to the plane windows to see what will happen.

          GRANDMA ANNIE
          That's all we ever wanted.
          Grandma Annie gives Margaret and Richard a big hug.   Debbie joins
          in.   Then Geoffrey.   Passengers cheer.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. PAXTON ISLAND - DANCEFLOOR - DAY

          The party is in full swing.
          Balzac chases his balls.
          Ramone slides onstage and SINGS with the band.   He has a
          beautiful voice.
          Debbie and Geoffrey cut a rug.   They've done this before.

          

          

          

          

          116.
          Gertrude and Annie chat and laugh at a nearby table.   The
          Handsome Man brings Gertrude a drink.   Grandma Annie winks and
          leaves these two alone.
          Margaret and Richard dance.   All smiles, even though they aren't
          very good.
          And as everyone dances, we track up the tallest tree on the
          island, to an eagle's nest at the very top.   Inside the nest,
          three eaglets chirp along to the music, snuggled up to Margaret's
          phone.

INT. WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING

CAMERA (STEADICAM) holds on a man in a suit, sitting behind
a desk, on the phone: BARRY EGAN (Adam Sandler)

                         BARRY
            ...yes I'm still on hold...

                         OPERATOR
            And what was this?

                         BARRY
            I'm looking at your advertisement
            for the airline promotion and
            giveaway?

                         OPERATOR
            This is "Fly With Us?"

                         BARRY
            It's hard to understand because it
            says in addition to but I can't
            exactly understand in addition to
            what because there's actually
            nothing to add it too...

                         OPERATOR
            I think that's a type-o then, that
            would be a mistake.

                         BARRY
            So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten
            purchases of any of your Healthy
            Choice products equals five hundred
            miles and then with the coupon the
            same purchases would value one
            thousand miles --

                         OPERATOR
            That's it.

                         BARRY
            Do you realize that the monetary
            value of this promotion and the
            prize is potentially worth more
            than the purchases?

                         OPERATOR
            I don't know...I mean: I don't know.

OC DISTANT SOUND OF A CAR SKIDDING TO A STOP, SOME VAGUE,
DISTANT SCREAMING IS HEARD...THEN SILENCE. Barry hears this,
gets distracted, then back to the phone call;

                         BARRY
            Can I call you back if I have any
            further questions...? Can I get
            your extension?

                         OPERATOR
            It's extension 215 if you want to
            try me back.

                         BARRY
            Ok. Thank you.

He hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse. It's
fairly non-descript place, boxing materials, etc. Products
seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key
chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc)

He lifts a LOADING DOOR and LIGHT POURS INSIDE, WASHES OUT
THE FRAME....he's silhouette....CAMERA follows him
out...stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks
down towards the street.....

...his business is situated at the end of a common driveway,
shared with a few other nondescript places and an Auto
mechanic....distant SOUND of a car SPEEDING and SKIDDING....

....hold, then:

....a JEEP CHEROKEE comes FLIPPING into FRAME, far off at
the mouth of the alley, on the street. The JEEP ends up
landing RIGHT SIDE UP....HOLD....

.....Barry flinches a little, stares.....the JEEP sits idle
for a moment....then it drives off....then:

A speeding, small TOYOTA comes into view at the mouth of the
alley, screeching to a halt. The passenger side door opens
and a small, wooden HARMONIUM (like a portable organ) is
placed on the ground. The TOYOTA speeds away.....

....a moment or two later another NON-DESCRIPT CAR flies
past very fast....

BEAT. Barry squints, looks at the small HARMONIUM sitting
alone in the middle of the street.

He hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside
his warehouse.

INT. BARRY'S WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

Barry on the phone again;

                         BARRY
            ....I'm not exactly sure what that
            means...

                         VOICE
            If they break or something. What is
            it, plastic?

                         BARRY
            It's a plastic, yeah.

                         VOICE
            Right. Alright, lemme call you
            first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run
            the numbers, see what's what and
            I'll give you a call back --

                         BARRY
            Did you have my home phone number?

                         VOICE
            For what?

                         BARRY
            If you wanted to call me back I
            could...

                         VOICE
            I'm fine, I have your work number.

                         BARRY
            Ok...because of the time difference
            if you needed to call me early?

                         VOICE
            It's fine. I can just get you at
            your office.

                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         VOICE
            Ok, bye, bye.

                         BARRY
            Bye.

He hangs up the phone and walks outside, CAMERA follows him
again, out to the alley, over his shoulder......he looks
down the length of the alley at the Harmonium. HOLD, THEN:

A small FORD ESCORT pulls into the driveway, around the
Harmonium, parks......a young woman named LENA LEONARD
(Emily Watson) exits the car and starts to walk down the
length of the alley towards him.....CAMERA stays over his
shoulder and turns into a profile 2-shot;

                         LENA
            Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         LENA
            They're not open yet?

                         BARRY
            They don't get opened until eight.

BEAT. Barry gently steps back and out of the FRAME.

                         LENA
            Is it ok if I leave my car you think?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            I thought they opened at seven.
                   (beat)
            If I left my car would it be ok?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Do you know them.

                         BARRY
            Not very well.

                         LENA
            Can I ask you, can I trust to leave
            my keys with you and give them to
            you so that when they get here you
            could give them to them?
                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         LENA
            You think it's ok where I left it,
            right there?

                         BARRY
            I think that'll be fine.

Lena hands him her keys, he steps back into FRAME, THEN:

                         LENA
            There's a piano in the street.

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

BEAT.

                         LENA
            Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank
            you for your help.

                         BARRY
            Thank you.

                         LENA
            Maybe I'll see you later, when I
            pick up my car?

                         BARRY
            Ok.

She walks away....he starts back inside the warehouse,
hesitates, watches her go.....right before she reaches the
end of the alley, she glances back quickly, over her
shoulder....he dodges inside real quick.....

HOLD THE EMPTY FRAME......then he steps back out.....looks
off at the Harmonium.....and the empty street.....he looks
around some more....then he makes the long walk down the
street.

ON THE STREET.
Barry stares at the Harmonium a little bit, looks around,
both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards
his business.....

He brings it into his office and places it on his desk. He
tries a few keys....pressing down...there's no sound.

He presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and
a small note is made.....BEAT....he does it again....and
holds the note.....

                                            CUT TO BLACK.

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Barry enters the warehouse with harmonium and runs into his
office. He places it on the desk and hits a key: no sound.

Barry goes to his knees and unlatched the bellows. He pumps
the bellow, reaches up, presses a note, and another...then
stands up into CU. and presses the 5 note
melody......SUDDENLY: THE SOUND OF THE POD BAY DOOR SLIDING....

....Barry spins around, scared shitless, sees: LANCE, who
enters the warehouse, Barry rushes out to greet him;

                         LANCE
            Hey, good morning, Barry.

                         BARRY
            Hey...Lance....can I.....

                         LANCE
            You ok?

                         BARRY
            Yes I'm fine.

                         LANCE
            Why you wearin' a suit?

                         BARRY
            Um....I bought one. I thought maybe
            it would be nice to get dressed for
            work, can I show you something?

                         LANCE
            Yeah.....you got here early huh?

                         BARRY
            ....yes.....

They enter into the office, Lance sees the harmonium;

                         LANCE
            What is this?

                         BARRY
            I don't know. I think it's a
            piano....a small piano.

                         LANCE
            That's not a piano.....I have a
            piano at home.....where'd you get it?

Lance walks around behind the harmonium....leaving Barry
alone....towards the warehouse......he starts to back up a
little.....

                         BARRY
            Well.....it was dropped on the
            street.....

Sal, Ernesto and Rico all start to come into work behind
Barry.....he sees them: CAMERA pushes in on Barry....

                         LANCE (OC)
            Why is it here? Barry....Barry?

                         BARRY
            ...it just....I don't know....I
            don't know.

INT. WAREHOUSE/MAIN AREA - DAY

CAMERA pushes in slow as Barry and Lance talk to TWO
CUSTOMERS about the plungers which are on display in front
of them. They speak all over each other doing shop talk, etc;

                         CUSTOMER
            You do guaranteed sale? etc.

                         BARRY
            We back our plungers 100% and we do
            ask for a 30 to 60 day display on
            the floor.....

In the b.g., RICO over the laud speaker says:

                         RICO
            Barry, your sister's on line one.

Barry doesn't move....

                         BARRY
            Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60
            days....

                         CUSTOMER
            I think you have a call?

Rico turns around, without loudspeaker;

                         RICO
            Barry, your sister is on line one.

They look at him a moment....

                         BARRY
            I'm just gonna grab this call real
            quick?

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry turns and heads for the phone nearby
at Rico's station;

                         BARRY
                   (into phone)
            .....This is Barry.

                         RHONDA
            Hey it's me, it's Rhonda. Are you
            coming to the party tonight?

                         BARRY
            Hi, Rhonda, yes I am.

                         RHONDA
            Bye.

She hangs up.

                         BARRY
            Ok. Yes I'll see you tonight.

Barry takes a few steps back to the Customers:

                         BARRY
            Sorry about that: One thing I
            wanted to point out, Dave, is that
            we've just received a large order
            from the Rio Hotel and Casino in
            Las Vegas where we're going to be
            supplying their hotel rooms with
            the dice and money plunger, so
            these babies are really moving well
            right now...

                         RICO

            Barry, your sister's on line two.
            Barry, your sister's on line two.

Barry tries again to ignore it....

                         BARRY
            With the Aqua Blast Whales and
            Speed Boats we're gonna ask for a
            display at eye level for the little
            kids.....

            Barry --

                         BARRY
            -- excuse me.

Barry walks back to the phone;

                         BARRY
            This is Barry.

                         KAREN
            Hey it's me, what are you doing?

                         BARRY
            Hello, Karen. I'm just working.

                         KAREN
            Yeah but what are you doing?

                         BARRY
            I'm just working....I have some
            customers here.....

                         KAREN
            So you can't talk to me?

                         BARRY
            I have a few people here, I can't
            really chat right now.

                         KAREN
            "chat?" Did you just say "chat?"

                         BARRY
            Well, I can't talk though --

                         KAREN
            You just fucking said "chat," that
            is so -- what are you now? "chat."
            I'm just calling to make sure you
            show up at this party tonight.

                         BARRY
            Yes, I'll be there.

                         KAREN
            Fine. You get back to chatting with
            your precious customers.

                         BARRY
            Ok, bye-bye.

Barry snaps out of this, turns, claps his hands in confidence
and walks back to the customers and says:

                         BARRY
            Sorry about that.

                         CUSTOMER
            I didn't know you had a sister?

                         BARRY
            .....Well yes I do....
                   (beat)
            But one more thing I wanted to tell
            you guys about the new plungers is
            that we're making the handles now
            in a non-breakable material
            called.....

He takes one of the plungers and to demonstrate smacks it on
the table....it SMASHES and rice falls out everywhere....

                         BARRY
            Ok...this is one of the old ones, I
            think. Lance do we have any new
            plungers around?

Lance moves to get a new plunger....

                         BARRY
            That was a little embarrassing and
            that was one of the old handles so
            let me get a new one to show you --

                         RICO
                   (loudspeaker)
            Barry, your sister is on line one.

Barry holds, then;

                         CUSTOMER
            How many sisters do you have?

                         BARRY
            ....I have seven.

                         CUSTOMER #2
            Holy shit. You have seven sisters?

                         BARRY
            They're calling because we're
            having a party tonight for my
            sister and the they're just
            calling....can you hang on for just
            two more minutes....?

Barry walks this time into his office......CAMERA tracks
with Barry to his office, seeing him try and shake this
off.....He EXITS FRAME.

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

Barry enters, takes a quick moment to size up the
harmonium.....He picks up the phone and through the
conversation gently moves the harmonium to a different spot
on the desk;

            This is Barry.

            You can't be late though.

                         BARRY

                         KATHLEEN
            You can't just not show up like you
            do, you have to go.

workers;

                         WORKER
            Telephone Barry on line one.

A mechanic passes by at this moment, keeps walking past;

                         BARRY
            What's wrong with her car?

                         MECHANIC
            Wha?

                         BARRY
            Is that car gonna be ok?

                         MECHANIC
            It's fine.

Barry and the boys are prepping some boxes for shipping.
Ernesto walks over, says;

            Barry, your sister's here.

Barry stands up fast, stumbles back a bit over some boxes,
recovers, ELIZABETH enters:

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey, how are you?
                         BARRY
            I'm fine, hi, how are you?

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm just stopping by to say hello.

                         BARRY
            Hello.

                         ELIZABETH
            So you're coming tonight, right?

                         BARRY
            Yes, indeed, yes I am.

                         ELIZABETH
            There's this girl, this friend of
            mine from work that I think is
            really cute and really cool and I
            want you to meet her so I was
            thinking about bringing her to the
            party tonight.

                         BARRY
            Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why?

                         BARRY
            Well I don't want to do something
            like that.

                         ELIZABETH
            She's my friend and you should meet
            her. You'd like her.

                         BARRY
            Yeah, but please don't do that.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm not really asking you, I'm
            telling you.

                         BARRY
            Yeah but please don't do that:
            everyone would be looking at me.

                         ELIZABETH
            It's a free country, we can look at
            you if we want to.

                         BARRY
            Yes but I get tense and I feel like
            I can't be myself if that happens.

                         ELIZABETH
            That's your fault not mine.

                         BARRY
            I don't think I'm going to the party.

                         ELIZABETH
            So it's ok if I bring her.

                         BARRY
            Please don't.

                         ELIZABETH
            She's really cute and she's really
            nice.

            ...please, I just don't want it....

                         ELIZABETH
            ....wait a minute: why is this
            about you now? Why is it always
            about you?

                         BARRY
            Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm trying to be your friend.

                         BARRY
            I know.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.

                         BARRY
            Well, yeah, thank you, but --

                         ELIZABETH
            -- but since you're not going I
            guess none of this matters and I'll
            bring her anyway.

BEAT. HOLD. She stares him down.

                         ELIZABETH
            All I'm trying to do is be your
            friend.

She leaves. HOLD ON BARRY. He air punches/twitch.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER/BLUE HOUR - NIGHT

Barry is alone, closing up. He takes a look at the Harmonium
and presses it, makes a sound....a little bit more....makes
a few notes. END SCORE QUE as it blends and fades into the
notes that Barry plays.

BEAT. He closes its small cover, does something on his desk
and then:

His face gets bright red, he holds back tears, opens his
mouth and has a serious but small burst of overwhelming
emotion and then it's over.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

CU. BIRTHDAY CARD.
Barry's hands reaches in and picks a birthday card.

ANGLE, WIDER, THAT MOMENT.
Barry grabs the card and starts to push his cart....but he
pushes it straight into a SIX YEAR OLD KID who's pushing a
cart around....they slam into each other....

Barry apologizes....the KID just takes off....Barry's cart
now has a slightly damaged wheel that wobbles like crazy....

ANGLE, FROZEN FOOD AISLE.
CAMERA tracks left to right with Barry as he heads for the
Healthy Choice Frozen Dinner. He grabs one.

CU. BARRY. LOW ANGLE.
He looks at box.

BARRY'S POV - THE BOX
Slow zoom in. The sticker reads: "Fly Away With Us! The More
You Buy The More You Earn."

ANGLE, SOUP SECTION.
CAMERA tracks along right to left with Barry as he moves
towards some SOUP. He grabs one, inspects it.....then puts
it back.

CU. SOUP CAN.
It's put back on the shelf: TILT down to price: 79 cents.

Barry turns his cart around and SMACKS right into someone
else again, screwing up another wheel on his cart.

ANGLE, BARRY.
CAMERA, tracks alongside him, left to right as he comes
across: PUDDING. The price: 4/$1.00.

MED. BARRY in the middle of the aisle.
He reacts......smiles...holds....thinks....looks around,
then starts to load up on the pudding.

ANGLE, BARRY.
He pushes TWO SHOPPING CARTS FULL OF PUDDING over to the
STORE MANAGER who's on his knees, stacking milk.....Barry
kneels down, CAMERA PUSHES INTO A CU. as he speaks sotto;

                         MANAGER
            Hello.

                         BARRY
            Hello, sir. My name is Barry Egan
            and I'd like to ask if you have any
            more Healthy Choice pudding in the
            back?

                                            CUT TO:

INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens slowly and Barry peers his head around and
into the house very cautiously, CAMERA PUSHES IN and PANS
slightly LEFT to reveal: THE KITCHEN.

Barry's SEVEN SISTERS are all there, preparing dinner and
talking away....they turn and see him;

                         SUSAN
            There he is! Do you remember when
            we used to call you gay and you'd
            get all mad?

                         KATHLEEN
            -- we were calling you gay and you
            got so mad that you threw a hammer
            through the sliding glass door --
            do you remember?

                         BARRY
            I don't really remember that.

                         KATHLEEN
            Yes you do. We were calling you Gay
            Boy and you got so mad....

                         BARRY
            Yes, yes, right.

                         SUSAN
            We're trying to remember why you
            had the hammer in the first place?

                         BARRY
            ...um.....

                         KATHLEEN
            The hammer that you threw....why
            did you have it?

                         SUSAN
            You don't remember -- you had the
            hammer and you threw it -- ?

                         BARRY
            I remember, yes.....

                         SUSAN
            Why did you have it?

Another sister, RHONDA, enters from behind, Barry jumps, says:

                         RHONDA
            He was building a ramp for the dog.

                         KATHLEEN
            He was making a ramp for the dog!
            That's right!

                         SUSAN
            That's right....ramp for the
            dog..... And you just threw the
            hammer.

                         BARRY
                   (to Rhonda)
            Happy Birthday, Rhonda.

                         RHONDA
            Thank you. Thank you so much, Barry.

She gives him a very quick hug and kiss and sets the cake
next to a bigger, cooler looking cake.

Mia approaches holding a baby.....Barry tries to say hello
to the baby, but Mia slowly turns the baby out of Barry's
grasp....making herself the center of his attention;

KITCHEN/DINING ROOM, THAT MOMENT

Barry gets slightly turned around trying to reach the
baby...and ends up in a doorway that leads to the dining
room, revealing himself to: ELIZABETH, KAREN, NICOLE AND
ANNA. There are also: THREE BROTHER IN LAW'S (WALTER, LARRY
AND STEVE)

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey....I was just telling everyone
            about how I was gonna bring this
            girl for you but you wouldn't let
            me do it.

                         BARRY
            Hello everyone.

KAREN steps up and greets him;

                         KAREN
            Did you think that we'd all be
            looking at you?

                         BARRY
            No, no, no.

                         KAREN
            Well it's just not true. We
            wouldn't be looking at you -- why
            are you wearing this suit? Did you
            say hello to your brother in law's?

                         STEVE/LARRY
            Hi, Barry. How ya doin? Good, good.

                         KAREN
            Say hello to them, that's right,
            good, good. Ok. Come on, we're
            gonna eat now.....let's go.....

Barry shakes hands and hello's with the brother in law's.
He's left alone for a moment with Walter and Elizabeth;

                         WALTER
            How you doin' Barry?

                         BARRY
            Hi Walter.

                         WALTER
            How's business?

                         BARRY
            Business is very food, thanks.
                         ELIZABETH
            What's very food?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         ELIZABETH
            You just said very food.

                         BARRY
            Did I say that?

                         WALTER
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            That was weird. I meant good.

                         WALTER
            Maybe you said that because you're
            hungry.....

Walter moves to help everyone...they're moving to set the
table......

CAMERA CLOSES IN ON BARRY AND ELIZABETH alone for a beat:

                         ELIZABETH
            You're lucky. She couldn't come
            anyway --

                         BARRY
            Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.

                         ELIZABETH
            She couldn't come I said. Are you
            nervous?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         ELIZABETH
            You look nervous.

                         BARRY
            I'm not, I'm very happy.

RHONDA passes;

                         RHONDA
            Come on homo-boy, we're eating now.

Elizabeth leaves, HOLD ON BARRY.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TOWARDS EVERYONE SETTING THE
TABLE.....CAMERA ROTATES AROUND.....everyone is still
chatting a bit about "Barry gay boy," and "the girl that was
gonna be here that Barry wouldn't allow."

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry is standing in front of the floor to
ceiling sliding glass doors.....in an INSTANT, he TURNS AND
THROWS HIS FIST STRAIGHT THROUGH THREE OF THEM, THEY
SHATTER....he turns back, they are all staring straight at
him in silence. HOLD, THEN:

In unison they all go ape shit:

                         GROUP
            WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM.
            GODDAMNIT BARRY. YOU FUCKIN' MANIAC.
            ETC. ETC.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

It's later and WALTER and BARRY walk down a small hall and
into a kids room. They're OC for a few moments as the CAMERA
slowly pushes in and towards the room. Following sotto;

                         WALTER
            What's up?

                         BARRY
            Well I'm sorry. Before...

                         WALTER
            Mhm.

                         BARRY
            And I'm sorry that I did that.

                         WALTER
            It's alright.

                         BARRY
            I wanted to ask you because you're
            a doctor, right?

                         WALTER
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I don't like the way I am sometimes.
                   (beat)
            Can you help me?
                         WALTER
            Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of
            help do you think I can give you?

                         BARRY
            I know that. Maybe you know other
            doctors?

                         WALTER
            Like a psychiatrist?

                         BARRY
            I don't have anyone to talk to
            things about and I understand it's
            confidential with a doctor - I'm
            embarrassed about that and I don't
            want my sisters to know?

                         WALTER
            You want a number for a
            psychiatrist, I can get you one,
            that's not a problem. but what
            exactly is wrong?

                         BARRY
            I don't know if there's anything
            wrong with me because I don't know
            how other people are.....Sometimes
            I cry a lot.....for no reason.

Barry starts to cry. Walter just stares at his. HOLD.

Barry stops, recuperates, then leaves.....as he does;

                         BARRY
            Please don't tell my sisters.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S APARTMENT - LATER

CU. HEALTHY CHOICE COUPON.
Barry's scissors cut out a coupon and reveal an image
beneath in another section of the newspaper...it's the sexy

HOLD ON HIS FACE. He looks....then:

            No I just....I don't want to, I
            just want to be connected to talk

                         OPERATOR GIRL (OC)
            It's a call back service -- a girl

            Hi. This is Jack.

                         SEXY VOICE
            So what are you doing tonight, Jack?

                         BARRY
            Nothing.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Nothing, huh, do you know what I'm
            doing?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I'm just laying on my bed.

                         BARRY
            Where are you?

                         SEXY VOICE
            I'm in my bedroom.

                         BARRY
            No, I mean, what city, what state
            are you in?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Are you watching a porno movie?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Do you like porno movies?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah....? So...Jack...are you
            stroking that big fat fucking cock
            of yours?

He walks into something.

                         BARRY
            ....no....

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah? So what are you doing, then?

                         BARRY
            ...just talking to you....

                         SEXY VOICE
            Are your pants off?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I'm wearing a t-shirt and panties.

                         BARRY
            Really?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah. And looking at myself in the
            mirror. Do you wanna know what I
            look like?

                         BARRY
            It doesn't matter.

                         SEXY VOICE
            What do you mean it doesn't matter?

                         BARRY
            Well. I have no way of knowing. So
            it doesn't matter.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8,
            blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I
            work out. My pussy's shaved. My
            friends say I'm pretty cute, so....

                         BARRY
            Really?

                         SEXY VOICE
            What do you mean, "really?" Yeah.
            Really. What about you?

                         BARRY
            It doesn't matter.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah....you're married aren't you,
            Jack?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You have a girlfriend?

                         BARRY
            ...yes...

                         SEXY VOICE
            Where is she?

                         BARRY
            She's...not here...she went out.
            She went out of town, she travels a
            lot.

Barry holds his head in his hands for minute, then stands
out of it --

INT. BARRY'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

                         SEXY VOICE
            I'm horny, Jack, what about you?

                         BARRY
            ...yeah.....

                         SEXY VOICE
            Does Jack like to Jack Off?

                         BARRY
            Sometimes when I'm lonely.

                         SEXY VOICE
            ...yeah....well you have me now.

                         BARRY
            You sound very cute, very nice.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Thank you. What do you do, Barry?

                         BARRY
            I have my own business....I work. I
            work hard at doing my business.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah....do you do well, do you make
            alotta money?

                         BARRY
            I do pretty good, I think. I wish I
            was making more, doing a little bit
            better. I can,t get over a certain
            hump. I will...I will crack
            something soon I think and really
            do better...I'd like to
            diversify...but I'm doing great, I
            think, as a start.

                         SEXY VOICE
            So.....are you stroking it, yet,
            honey?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Well why don't you take your pants
            off and stroke it for me?

                         BARRY
            Ok.
                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah...that's it...God I Am So
            Horny...I wish I was there to help
            you.....I wish I was there for you,
            Barry.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S BATHROOM/BEDROOM - LATER

It's a little bit later and Barry stands in his bathroom,
washes his face....HOLD....then he dries his face, walks
into his bedroom, gets into bed wearing T-shirt and
underwear.....he crawls in, curls up in fetal position....

                                            JUMP CUT TO:

INT. SAME EXACT ANGLE - MORNING

Sun comes in now. Barry is somehow dressed in a FULL ADIDAS
SWEAT SUIT complete with SNEAKERS. He wakes up, looks down
and sees this, confused;

                         BARRY
            Whassis?

                                            CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Barry is dressed for work in another suit now. He grabs some
stuff and heads for the door when the phone rings;

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Hey. What are you doing? How are you?

                         BARRY
            I'm fine. Who is this?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Georgia.

BEAT.

                         BARRY
            Hi....what....what's up....?

                         SEXY VOICE
            It's ok that I'm calling, right, I
            mean? It's ok.

                         BARRY
            Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?

                         SEXY VOICE
            I just wanted to call and talk to
            you, thank you for last night, try
            and get you before you went to work
            and say, "hey."

BEAT.

                         BARRY
            I'm going to work.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed
            up too late last night, what about
            you, when did you go to sleep?

                         BARRY
            Not very late.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You're going to work now?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Can I ask you a question?

                         BARRY
            Uh-huh.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Remember last night I was talking
            to you and I was telling you about
            my apartment, my rent -- ?
                   (beat)
            Do you remember?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         SEXY VOICE
            This is really weird and really
            embarrassing for me but....uh....
                   (beat)
            I was wondering if you could help
            me out with a little bit of money.

                         BARRY
            Me?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I
            can't afford it.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You don't even know how much it is.

                         BARRY
            I know but I....how much is it?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?

                         BARRY
            Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't
            afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Really? Please?

                         BARRY
            You have trouble, financial trouble?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Yeah. It's so hard these days and I
            really need it.

                         BARRY
            Yes I can't....I don't make enough
            money to be able to do that.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I thought you had your own business.
            You said you were gonna diversify
            and all that stuff....

BEAT. Barry steps back a little....

                         SEXY VOICE
            So you think you can?

                         BARRY
            No. I'm sorry.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Should I call back and talk to your
            girlfriend?

                         BARRY
            ....what....?

                         SEXY VOICE
            I was wondering if it's better to
            ask your girlfriend for the money?
            It could be really easy. I mean, I
            have all your information, credit
            card information and billing stuff --

Barry hangs up the phone real fast. HOLD. He doesn't move.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S WORK/WAREHOUSE - MORNING/LATER

CAMERA (HAND HELD) behind Barry, as he walks through the
warehouse, greets the boys, says hello to Lance, etc. Lance,
taking his cue from Barry, is a bit more dressed up today....

                         LANCE
            Good morning, Barry....

                         BARRY
            Hi, Lance.

                         LANCE
            What's with all this pudding, what
            is this?

CAMERA sees that all the pudding Barry bought has been
stacked neatly in a corner. Barry stops dead in his tracks
to explain;

                         BARRY
            That's part of a very interesting
            airline promotion giveaway that's
            really tremendous. I'm going to
            start a collection of pudding and
            coupons that can be redeemed for
            frequent flyer miles through
            Healthy Choice and American
            Airlines --

                         LANCE
            You're goin' on a trip?

                         BARRY
            No.........but airline miles are
            just like a currency these days.

                         LANCE
            You should go on a trip.

                         BARRY
            No thanks.

                         LANCE
            So what should I do with the pudding?

                         BARRY
            Let's just leave it there for now.

Barry goes into his office and looks at the Harmonium. BEAT.
He presses some keys, makes a little more noise with it. (a
quarter of some sort of melody starts here...)

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.
Barry is cutting up his CREDIT CARD with some scissors. He
throws it away.

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.
Barry paces around a little bit.....CAMERA stays inside and
watches him as he walks outside for a moment, looks
around....he sees something outside, hesitates, then dodges
back inside the warehouse --

-- once inside, he takes a horrendous, hurtful fall over
something....He stands up quick;

                         BARRY
            This is not supposed to be here.
            Seriously. Carlos, Carlos, this is
            really not supposed to be here. I
            don't mean to be a dick; but that's
            gonna hurt someone. It already did
            hurt someone: It hurt me, so please
            let's move that.

He backs away, then steps OUT OF FRAME...a moment later
ELIZABETH (his sister) and LENA (from the opening) enter the
warehouse, walking towards Barry;

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Lena)
            He's wearing a suit again, I don't
            know why he's wearing a suit, he
            doesn't usually dress like that --

                         LENA
            It's fine.

CAMERA pushes in towards LENA and blends to 30fps...she
smiles, looks ahead, CAMERA slowly pans a 180 around to
become her POV.

Barry is standing near the harmonium, fiddling around. He
looks up, sees Elizabeth and Lena walking towards him and
tenses....they meet in the middle of the warehouse;

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey, what are you doing? Why are
            you wearing a suit again?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Hi.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         LENA
            Do you remember me, I left my car,
            yesterday.

                         BARRY
            Yes I do.

                         ELIZABETH
            This is Lena, she's a good friend
            of mine from work. We were in the
            neighborhood and she had to pick up
            her car and we're getting breakfast
            before we go in, so did you want to
            go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.

                         BARRY
            Yeah I can't.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why?

                         BARRY
            I have work, I can't leave.

                         ELIZABETH
            Seriously, though: We're going to
            eat, I said.

                         BARRY
            I'm sorry.

                         LENA
            It's ok. That's alright.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you learning how to play the
            piano? What is that?

                         BARRY
            It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE!
            MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN
            TOLEDO.

                         LANCE (OC)
            WHICH?

                         BARRY
            ...I'll tell you later.

                         ELIZABETH
            You don't wanna come to eat with us?

                         ELIZABETH
            What's all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            I don't know. Can you hang on a
            second?

CAMERA follows Barry as he walks back to his little office,
picks up the phone;

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            We got disconnected before....

                         BARRY
            No. No. We got disconnect --
            why?.....you're calling me at
            work....how did you get this
            number -- ?

                         SEXY VOICE
            See the thing is I could make it
            really easy on you -- I already
            have your credit card number, your
            information, address and stuff.
            This is so awkward asking like
            this, I'm sorry --

                         BARRY
            This makes me very uncomfortable.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I need help.

BEAT.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Should I just ask your girlfriend?
                   (beat)
            Maybe I should call back and talk
            to your girlfriend?

                         BARRY
            I don't have a girlfriend --

                         SEXY VOICE
            -- you said you did.

                         BARRY
            I know I did. But I don't.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You lied to me?

                         BARRY
            I didn't lie.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Why did you tell me you did, then?

                         BARRY
            This is....illegal....I'll call the
            police.

                         SEXY VOICE
            No you won't.

ANGLE, ELIZABETH AND LENA

                         LENA
            I'll go pay for my car.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you sure?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         ELIZABETH
            He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have
            no idea why he's being weird and
            dressed in a suit --

                         LENA
            It's not bad, it's ok.

                         ELIZABETH
            -- he's so strange I don't know if
            you really even would want to go
            out with him, someone like him, I
            said I'd try, but it's just --

                         LENA
            It's ok, it's alright. I'll come
            right back, I'll just go pay for my
            car.

                         ELIZABETH
            Sorry.

She leaves. Elizabeth heads for Barry's office;

ANGLE, BARRY on the phone

                         SEXY VOICE
            Come on, I thought we had fun, rich
            boy --

                         BARRY
            This is not cool.

                         SEXY VOICE
            It was cool last night.

                         BARRY
            I have to go.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Are you telling me no?

                         BARRY
            No I'm sorry, now I have to get off
            the phone....

                         SEXY VOICE
            ....this is your mistake....

Elizabeth comes walking into his office, starts whispering
to him as he's on the phone;

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey, hey, you should ask her out --
            what do you think, she's cute, right?

                         BARRY
                   (into phone)
            I'm gonna call you back.

He starts to hang up the phone, turns to Elizabeth as we hear;

                         SEXY VOICE
                   (trailing off)
            ...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....

                         BARRY
            She is. I think, why did you come
            here like this?

                         ELIZABETH
            It's not cool?

                         BARRY
            It's fine, but --

                         ELIZABETH
            -- do you think you'll ask her out?

                         BARRY
            I feel really on the spot now.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you gonna do it?

                         BARRY
            I don't do that. I don't - things
            like that.

                         ELIZABETH
            You don't do anything, why are you
            being scared?

                         BARRY
            I'm not being scared, you're just
            going to rag me if I do this --

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I
            do this just to rag you?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'll leave then, I'll go to get
            something from my car, go away so
            you don't feel pressure. Can I ask
            you a serious question:

                         BARRY
            What?

                         ELIZABETH
            Did you ask Walter to get you a
            shrink?
                   (beat)
            Barry, did you ask Walter to get
            you a shrink? What's wrong with you?
            Are you ok?

                         BARRY
            I didn't ask him that. He's lying.

                         ELIZABETH
            You're being weird again, see. Come
            on. Please don't be weird.

ANGLE, BARRY AND ELIZABETH, MOMENTS LATER
They walk out and as they do, Lena comes back in with her
keys in her hand, Elizabeth keeps walking past;

                         ELIZABETH
            I gotta grab something from my car....

                         LENA
            We should be going --

                         ELIZABETH
                   (over her shoulder)
            Yeah, no, I have to get something
            from my car, I said.

Barry and Lena about to be alone as Lance walks up;

                         LANCE
            Which guy in Toledo are you talking
            about?

                         BARRY
            I'll tell you...the
            guy...with...just talk to me later
            about it, ok?

                         LANCE
            You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?

                         BARRY
            I have to talk to you in a second
            about that, Lance, ok?

He walks away, Lena turns to him;

                         LENA
            I'm sorry I couldn't come to your
            sister's birthday party last night,
            Elizabeth had invited me and I
            couldn't make it --

                         BARRY
            It's fine. It was fun, though.

                         LENA
            It must be weird for you to have so
            many sisters?

                         BARRY
            No. Not at all. It's nice.

                         WORKER (OC)
            Telephone, Barry Line One!

Barry turns instantly and walks away....he turns back as he
walks....TWO SHOT - track left with him....

                         BARRY
                   (turns back)
            One second, sorry.

IN THE OFFICE, THAT MOMENT
He picks up the phone.

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Hang up again and see the trouble
            it's gonna make.

Barry instantly hangs up the phone, turns around and walks
back to Lena;

                         LENA
            Business is good, you're busy?

                         BARRY
            Yeah, not really.

                         LENA
            I saw a picture of you.

                         BARRY
            Yes.
                         LENA
            Elizabeth has a picture of you
            guys -- your sisters and you, it's
            a lot of family, it must be nice.

                         BARRY
            Do you have brothers or sisters?

                         LENA
            No. I'm the exact opposite --

                         BARRY
            That must be nice. That must be
            really, really, really great.

                         LENA
            It's terrible, no.

No response from Barry. (cut to reverse 2-shot as they look)

                         LENA
            What do you do with all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            That's not mine it's one of the
            guys that works here. That
            pudding's not mine.

BEAT. In the b.g., two WORKERS are dealing with getting a
large crate on top of a large stack of crates, they're using
a fork lift....in an instant the large CRATE tumbles to the
ground and SMASHES....Barry attempts to not notice this;

                         LENA
            Oh My God.

                         BARRY
            It's ok. That's ok. How long have
            you worked with Elizabeth?

The workers start calling out and apologizing for this to
Barry, who keeps looking straight ahead to Lena;

                         LENA
            Six months, maybe five, five or six
            months...do you wanna check that?

                         BARRY
                   (to the guys)
            Are you guys hurt?

                         WORKERS/LANCE
            No, no, we're ok....Barry, sorry --
                         BARRY
                   (back to Lena)
            So you do what she does, the same
            work, the same job?

                         LENA
            I do, but I do field consultations
            mainly too which is cool because I
            get to travel. I travel. A lot of
            the time. I'm going to Hawaii on
            Friday.

                         BARRY
            That's great -- Hawaii. I was
            thinking about going there.

                         LENA
            Really?

                         BARRY
            I was, yeah, I was thinking about
            going there for business --

                         LENA
            -- well, if you're gonna go --

                         BARRY
            -- I'm probably not gonna go though.

                         LENA
            -- oh that's too bad, it's so great
            over there and if you were there we
            could say hello to each other or
            something --

                         BARRY
            -- yeah that would be great, if I
            was gonna go but I'm not exactly
            sure, I have so much goin on
            here -- A lot depends on this thing
            I might do here and if that happens
            I can't go and if it doesn't happen
            then I probably will, but I doubt it.

There's another LOUD CRASH as they try to reposition the box
that's fallen, giving way to something else that FALLS. In
other words, to correct the mistake they've already made,
they have to sacrifice another CRATE that CRASHES. She
looks, Barry just flinches, tries to stay looking straight
ahead; CAMERA (HAND HELD) with Elizabeth, comes walking back
in.....says to Barry:

                         ELIZABETH
            I can't find that thing in my car,
            I can't find it so I'll just get it
            and give it to you later. So?

                         LENA
                   (to Elizabeth)
            You ready?

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you coming to eat with us?

                         BARRY
            Yeah I can't.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (at the crates)
            OH MY GOD. Look at that.

                         LENA
                   (to Barry)
            It was great to meet you again. To
            see you again, thanks for helping
            me yesterday --

                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Barry)
            What's all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            It's not mine.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why's it here?

                         BARRY
            I have no idea.

                         LENA
                   (to Elizabeth)
            Are you ready?

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Barry)
            Will you call me later to talk
            about asking Walter for the shrink?
            And we can talk about - he said you
            have this crying problem or something?

                         LENA
            Bye, Barry.

                         BARRY
            Goodbye.

                         ELIZABETH
            Call me later.

Lena and Elizabeth leave. CAMERA leads them as they walk;
Sound starts to drop out, we see Barry and the boys cleaning
up the boxes in the back....move into a CU on Lena....Music
Cue. Score. treated piano, small rhythm/melodic(notes of
harmonium so far)/gentle.

                         ELIZABETH
            So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?

                         LENA
            Ok.

Lena gets into her car. Elizabeth keeps walking. She waits
until Elizabeth is out of sight at the mouth of the driveway
and then she gets back out of her car and walks straight
back into the warehouse.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

She comes walking in and over to Barry;

                         LENA
            I'm going to go and eat tomorrow
            night do you want to go with me?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

                         LENA
            Do you want to pick me up?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

                         LENA
            Can I write down my address and
            phone number for you?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

They do a small search for a piece of paper, get it all
written down and sorted out and then -- as they do this
there is even more CRASHING AND SMASHING in the b.g., by the
boys -- Barry and Lena settle up and say so long.

                         BARRY
            This is funny.

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I didn't ask anyone for a shrink,
            that was someone else. Also: This
            pudding is not mine. Also: I'm
            wearing a suit because I had a very
            important business meeting this
            morning and I don't have a crying
            problem.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY
            Alright?

                         LENA
            ....Hi.....

                         BARRY
            ....Hi.....

She walks off. CAMERA leads her out, holds a CU. as she
smiles to herself -- lead her a bit more until she's
outside, and she gets in her car --

CU. BARRY. He smiles, looks around, holds back his emotion
so it looks like he'll explode....tenses, smiles, tears,
looks around....HOLD. End Music Que.

                         LANCE (OC)
            Barry, Line One, Telephone!

Barry walks in. HOLD. He picks up the phone.

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            You've just made a war that you
            cannot afford.

She hangs up real quick. HOLD. Barry and his harmonium.

INT. STEVENS BROTHERS HOUSE - DAY

CAMERA behind a BLONDE GIRLS HEAD (LATISHA). She speaks to
two blonde brothers, DAVID and JIM. In the b.g., walking
around holding a BABY is NATE. (Maybe a girlfriend or wife
or two).

                         DAVID
            I'll do it.

                         JIM
            I'll do it too.

                         DAVID
            But it's gotta wait until my knee
            is better. I can't risk it.

                         LATISHA
            You have to do it now.

                         JIM
            If we drive there it's a problem.

                         LATISHA
            Dean will loan you one of his cars.

                         JIM
            Which one?

                         LATISHA
            You have to talk to him --

                         DAVID
            How do you know he's rich?

                         LATISHA
            Because I know, I just know. I
            mean, I talked to him, I know.

Nate emerges a bit from the b.g.

                         NATE
            Where are you guys going?

                         DAVID
            California. Los Angeles.

                         NATE
            When are you leaving?

                         DAVID
            Right now.

                         LATISHA
            Let's go talk to Dean.

INT. LOCAL BAR/PROVO - LATER

LATISHA, DAVID, JIM and NATE enter and meet DEAN TRUMBELL,
listening to AFTER EDEN play onstage, standing in the middle
of the room.

                         DEAN
            Hey guys.

                         DAVID/JIM/NATE
            Hey, Dean.

                         LATISHA
            So they'll go.

                         DEAN
            I'm only paying two of you guys.

                         DAVID
            That's cool.

                         DEAN
            When can you leave?

                         DAVID
            As soon as you want.

                         DEAN
            I want you to go right away, I
            think that's best. I also need you
            to check out a car for me down
            there that this guy is selling.

They walk towards a back room, as they do they pass a
REGULAR JOE who bumps into Dean accidentally, Dean explodes;

                         DEAN
            You wanna fuck around, asshole? You
            wanna get tough, wanna see me kick
            some motherfuck around here?

                         REGULAR JOE
            Take it easy, man, relax. Don't --
                         DEAN
            I'll relax your fucking head --
            this is my personal space, man,
            this is my personal fucking space,
            you don't violate that, you don't
            do that.

                         REGULAR JOE
            I've got a glass in my hand why
            don't you chill out?

                         DEAN
            You've got a glass?

Dean takes a BEER BOTTLE and SMASHES it in half on the bar,
holds it up to the guy --

                         DEAN
            YEAH. YOU'VE GOT A GLASS, NOW I'VE
            GOT A GLASS. I'VE GOT A GLASS TOO
            MOTHERFUCK.

                                            JUMP CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL BAR/PROVO - MOMENTS LATER

They're all walking towards a back room of the bar, they
walk past a COUPLE that is fighting. The WOMAN is screaming
at the top of her lungs at the MAN;

                         WOMAN
            I WILL CRUSH YOU. I WILL FUCKING
            CRUSH YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

Dean gets in the middle of it;

                         DEAN
            Take it easy, take it easy you guys
            in here, I need to talk to you
            later, Tommy -- I wanna know if you
            wanna book the boys --

He motions over his shoulder to Ashes to Ashes.

                         MAN
            I'll talk to you later.

                         WOMAN
            YOU WON'T FUCKIN' TALK TO HIM
            LATER, I WILL CRUSH YOU. I WILL
            CRUSH YOU, ASSHOLE.

INT. DEAN'S OFFICE/UPSTAIRS/BACKROOM - MOMENTS LATER

They enter into an upstairs office area. It has a couple
desks and off to the side, in a small, partitioned off room
is The Phone Sex Area; a GIRL on the phone. (We hear bits of
her call, e.g. "Me? I'm in Florida. Laying on my bed.")

There are posters for Ashes to Ashes, filing cabinets,
posters of CARS, lots of various small business items like
order forms and pamphlets, etc. Dean collects a piece of
paper and hands it to David/Nate/Jim;

                         DEAN
            Your expenses are your own.

                         DAVID
            I thought Latisha said you would --

                         DEAN
            -- she didn't know what she was
            talking about --

                         DAVID
            It's....whatever....that's not cool.

                         DEAN
            David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It
            doesn't make sense if you think
            about it in a fair deal like sense.
            Ok? It's business. Seriously. One
            hundred dollars for two days work
            is a lot more than your family is
            making sitting around your house.
            I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now.
            Just stop.

He hands him a set of KEYS and goes through the info;

                         DEAN
            ...keys for the track. You have to
            gas it up and save the receipts on
            that. His address. We have a
            business address too if you need
            that -- but hit him at his house
            first, see what this little bad boy
            is all about and shake him up --
            give him a little doe-see-doe --

                         LATISHA
            Uch. Shut up, Dean.

                         DEAN
            What's the problem?

                         LATISHA
            You don't need to talk all macho,
            "shake him out, little bad boy."
            Whatever -- you're not an action
            hero, tough guy, you're not a
            gangster --

He makes a very SUDDEN AND QUICK MOVE towards her and she
FLINCHES.

                         DEAN
            Flinchy. That's what I thought.
            Shut up.
                   (to Greg)
            Call me when you see this guy --
            check him out see what's what. She
            asked him for seven fifty when she
            was on the phone with him, so --
            just call me when you get there.

He hands him another piece of paper and a photo;

                         DEAN
            This is this place called Ace
            Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't
            know exactly where this is and I
            don't understand these maps so just
            go there and check it out. It's a
            '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says
            is fine, but I need to figure out
            why he's only asking 23 for it. So
            take a look, the whole thing, call
            me about that, if it seems alright
            then I'll head down there and check
            it out.

                         DAVID
            Ok.

                         DEAN
            That's it.

                         DAVID
            Can we maybe ask for more money on
            this?

                         LATISHA
            Why?

                         DAVID
            ...because it's California? I mean
            it's like a nine or ten hour drive.
            It's not like going to Salt Lake
            and getting the Mormon's, it's
            different...

After a long, long staring contest with David, Dean SUDDENLY
AND VERY VIOLENTLY PUTS HIS FIST THROUGH THE WALL....then
turns to David......Latisha rolls her eyes. David, Nate and
Jim leave.

EXT/INT. LENA'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - EVENING

This is a SPLIT SCREEN SEQUENCE shot with TWO CAMERAS.

THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN holds Lena. She waits in her
small, nondescript apartment doing the things you do while
waiting for someone else. She sits, stands, sits, stands....

THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE THE SCREEN travels (STEADICAM) with
Barry as he walks into the RECEPTION AREA. There is a
SECURITY GUARD (black, female) who asks him his name, where
he's going and to sign in. The Security Guard calls up to
Lena's place....

....and we watch Lena answer the phone....

...The Security Guard gives Barry some very complicated
directions....we follow/lead Barry as he makes his way
through the maze/up elevators/down corridors looking for
Lena's apartment.....Finally, he arrives, knocks;

                         LENA
            Who is it?

                         BARRY
            It's Barry.

As she opens the door, THE SPLIT SCREEN SLIDES AWAY AND THE
IMAGES GIVE WAY TO THE ONE OF LENA standing;

                         LENA
            Hi.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Lena and Barry at a table. They talk (see notes.)

                         LENA
            So I want to tell you something, I
            gotta tell you: I saw a picture of
            you guys, your sisters and you and
            I saw your picture and I really
            wanted to meet you.
                   (beat)
            I came to drop my car off there on
            purpose, to try and meet you.

Barry leans a little bit out of FRAME.

                         BARRY
            ...really? That's nice...are you
            lying?

                         LENA
            ...I thought I should tell you. I
            didn't want to get too far along on
            going out and be hiding something --

BEAT. He leans slightly back in FRAME.

                         BARRY
            That's very nice. Thank you. Thank
            you for saying that.
                   (beat)
            You're friends with my sister?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            How long have you known her?

                         LENA
            About six months.

                         BARRY
            You like her?

                         LENA
            Yeah. Yeah we get along well.
                   (beat)
            You didn't get along with her very
            well?

                         BARRY
            Did you really come to meet me on
            purpose or are you lying about that?

                         LENA
            No, no. I did.

                         BARRY
            That's nice. It's nice.
                   (beat)
            I've been looking around a lot
            lately at promotional giveaways,
            cross promotional work by some
            companies. Do you remember all that
            pudding?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            So that pudding was bought, I
            bought that pudding because of a
            pretty interesting promotion that's
            sponsored by Healthy Choice and
            American Airlines. It's designed to
            encourage airline travel and
            obviously designed to encourage
            buying Healthy Choice products.
            They make frozen meals, deli meats,
            pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice
            creams, this sort of thing.....

                         LENA
            Yeah?

                         BARRY
            ....I'm sorry....I lost my
            thoughts, what I was saying....

                         LENA
            You were talking about the
            promotion --

                         BARRY
            -- the promotion says: buy any 10
            Healthy Choice products and get 500
            miles of airline travel or 1,000
            for purchases made with a special
            coupon. So in the supermarket, you
            notice their products, first you
            notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken
            Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty
            good deal....but then I noticed
            they had soup at 89 cents a
            can.....and you start to do the
            math and you start to notice that
            it's a really amazing deal because
            I stumbled across the pudding at 25
            cents a cup. Now the crucial thing
            is the bar codes on the label.
            That's those little bar codes, you
            know? The universal product codes?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            That's what's used to redeem the
            mileage, so in noticing the
            pudding, each cup had an individual
            bar code -- in other words: Two
            dollars and fifty cents for ten
            cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add
            in the coupon: it's one thousand.
            You see?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            You see?

                         LENA
            Yeah, no, I see --

                         BARRY
            You see if you spent $3,000 dollars
            on pudding you could earn over one
            million frequent flyer miles.

                         LENA
            That's insane. That is really,
            really crazy. That's just crazy if
            you spend three thousand dollars on
            pudding.

                         BARRY
            ....yeah....

                         LENA
            So that was your pudding?

                         BARRY
            ....No....

                         LENA
            I'm sorry. I thought you said --

                         BARRY
            No I didn't say that.

                         LENA
            I thought you said you bought all
            that pudding --

                         BARRY
            My friend Carlos is doing it who
            works with me. It's his. It's his
            pudding, he's doing it. It's not
            mine. He's crazy. I told him not to
            do it. He's the one who's insane.
            He only spent about one hundred
            dollars so far though --

                         LENA
            Your sister was telling me a pretty
            funny story about you, when you
            guys were kids and you were
            building a ramp for your dog and
            you threw a hammer through a window?
            Is that right? You threw a hammer
            through a sliding glass door?

Barry starts to WELL WITH TEARS, which he hides very
quickly, holds a hand up to his face as if he's touching his
nose, and then he smiles;

                         BARRY
            I don't remember that, she might be
            lying. I have to go the bathroom.

He gets up and goes.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Barry walks in and goes a little crazy. He's mad at himself
and he HITS a stall....it seems loose already and falls
straight to the floor.

This makes him go crazier and he continues to BEAT and KICK
the shit out of the bathroom/stall.

HOLD. He collects himself and then he hesitates, looks
around, tries to collect the bathroom but it's in ruins, he
exits....

                                            CUT TO:

INT. RESTARAUNT - MOMENTS LATER

Barry comes back and sits down, seems a little better. Tries
to be a little flirtatious for half a moment before: the
MANAGER comes over, leans in carefully;

                         MANAGER
            Hello.

                         LENA & BARRY
            Hi.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, can I talk to you?

                         BARRY
            Why?

                         MANAGER
            Just have you for one second, please.

He looks to Lena, excuses himself.

ANGLE, OFF TO THE SIDE.
The Manager and Barry step away, in a quiet section of the
restaraunt, 2-shot, profile, in sotto; SLOW ZOOM IN.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

                         MANAGER
            Did you do it?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         MANAGER
            You didn't just smash up the bathroom?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         MANAGER
            Well who did?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         MANAGER
            You're hand is bleeding.

                         BARRY
            I cut myself.

                         MANAGER
            How?

                         BARRY
            On my knife.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, a young man saw you coming out
            of the bathroom.

                         BARRY
            I didn't do that.

BEAT.

                         BARRY
            Why? ...what?

                         MANAGER
            Your hand is bleeding.

                         BARRY
            I know.

                         MANAGER
            I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

                         BARRY
            Why?

                         MANAGER
            Sir, I have no way of proving that
            you demolished the bathroom --

                         BARRY
            I didn't do it.

                         MANAGER
            Alright, well you're gonna have to
            leave. You're gonna have to go.

                         BARRY
            Yeah, but I didn't do anything.

                         MANAGER
            I'm gonna call the police then, sir.

                         BARRY
            Please don't do this to me.

                         MANAGER
            The police are on their way.

                         BARRY
            Sorry.

He starts to move back....

                         BARRY
            Can I pay you here? Can I pay you
            for our drinks and salad?

                         MANAGER
            That's fine.

Barry takes out some money and hands it over.

                         BARRY
            Keep the change, please.

ANGLE, BACK AT THE TABLE.
They walk back to the table and Barry whispers down to her,
very close, STEADICAM (leads them out - continuous)

                         BARRY
            We should go I think, I don't like
            it here.

                         LENA
            Ok.

They head out of the restaraunt.

                         LENA
            Is everything ok?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         LENA
            What happened?

                         BARRY
            Nothing.

                         LENA
            What did he want?

                         BARRY
            Nothing.

They walk a bit.

                         BARRY
            I have a better idea of where we
            can go.

                         LENA
            Ok.

They walk some more.

                         BARRY
            There's a better place for us to eat.

                         LENA
            Did something happen; are you alright?

                         BARRY
            Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok.
            It's fine. Everything is fine.

They walk some more and get in the car.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

75mm OVER ONTO BARRY. 75mm OVER ONTO LENA. Rear process or
poor man's process.

                         LENA
            So....how is your harmonium doing?

Barry looks at her......

                         LENA
            Your portable reed organ....the piano.

                         BARRY
            Well, it's fine. Thank you.

                         LENA
            Did you pick it up from the street?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         LENA
            Did you take it from the street in
            front of your work?

                         BARRY
            ...yes I did...?

                         LENA
            Are you learning how to play it?

                         BARRY
            Yes? I'm trying.

                         LENA
            Oh that's great.

BEAT.

                         LENA
            So you must travel a lot with all
            that pudding you bought?

                         BARRY
            Yes no not really.

INT. LENA'S APARTMENT - LATER

Lena and Barry finishing up the date;

                         BARRY
            Ok....well...I'm gonna go.

                         LENA
            ...yeah...

                         BARRY
            It was nice to see you again, to
            see your face again, to go out with
            you --

                         LENA
            I'll be around and back in town in
            a few days --

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

                         LENA
            If you come to Hawaii --

                         BARRY
            Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about
            that.

                         LENA
            You don't think you'll go --

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Ok. Well call me when you get back,
            I mean, I'll call you when I get
            back. I'll be back for three weeks
            and then I go away for a month
            after that. So maybe in that time....

                         BARRY
            Ok. Have a good trip.

They do a shake hands/kiss on cheek goodbye.

INT. RECEPTION AREA/LENA'S BUILDING

Barry steps out of the elevator and walks to the exit,
passing a RECEPTION DESK WOMAN.....we hear the PHONE
RINGING......she calls out;

                         RECEPTION WOMAN
            Are you Barry?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         RECEPTION WOMAN
            It's for you.

Barry walks towards the phone;

                         BARRY
            This is Barry.

                         LENA (OC)
            This is Lena.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         LENA (OC)
            I just wanted you to know, wherever
            you're going or whatever you're
            doing right now I want you to know
            that I wanted to kiss you just then.

                         BARRY
            Really?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            So what do I do then?

INT. MAZE OF CORRIDORS - MOMENTS LATER

Barry is walking up and around, looking for the spot. Two or
three shots of various, him getting a little/slightly
lost.....running/walking....

                                            CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA pushes down towards him as he walks towards the door.
He knocks, she opens up, CAMERA SLIDES right in and lands as
they KISS and then the kiss turns into a small hug and then
they talk, real close. HOLD.

                         BARRY
            That was good.

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I'll see you later.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY
            I don't freak out very often.

                         LENA
            What do you mean?

                         BARRY
            I don't, no matter what my sisters
            say, ok?

                         LENA
            ...I don't know what you mean....

                         BARRY
            I don't freak out.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY

bag out.

EXT. BARRY'S APARTMENT - LATER

CAMERA is behind Barry now in a new location....he's walking
from his garage where he's just parked his car over to his
garbage area as he throws something out...

....he looks up and sees... Jim and Nate driving the Toyota
Pick Up Truck...he cruises past slowly....keeps going....then
makes a u-turn...Barry turns around and DAVID and MIKE D are
right there...

                         DAVID
            Hey.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         DAVID
            I need to talk to you for a second.

                         BARRY
            What?

                         DAVID
            You gotta give me some money.

Barry starts to walk away....David walks alongside him,
casually.....Barry looks over and sees the car has pulled
up....

                         DAVID
            You made a phone call and you said
            you'd help a girl out and then you
            didn't....I'm here to get the money.

                         BARRY
            Wait a minute --

                         DAVID
            No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't
            make it a thing --

                         BARRY
            Please don't do this.

                         DAVID
            It's just you need to give me the
            money...do you have it right now?

MIKE D violently PUSHES BARRY STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND.

                         BARRY
            Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't
            please....

                         DAVID
            How much money do you have in your
            pockets?

                         BARRY
            Just take it, take the money in my
            pockets, take it, it's fine --

They grab the money from his pockets as they hold him down
on the ground;

                         BARRY
            It's three hundred and twenty
            dollars, just take it.

                         DAVID
            What do you have in the house?

                         BARRY
            Nothing....I mean, really...change,
            nothing....that's the cash I have....

                         DAVID
            You have an ATM?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         DAVID
            Is this where you live?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         DAVID
            You have another house somewhere or
            something?

                         BARRY
            I didn't promise her money. She
            said that it was confidential, this
            isn't fair --

Mike D pushes Barry's face.

                         MIKE D
            Shut up, be quiet. Be quiet.

            HEY. You made a fucking sex call
            and now you're gonna pay. It's not
            a big thing -- just give us some
            money and then it's over -- we'll
            just walk down to the ATM and get
            your money out --

                         BARRY
            Alright, alright.

They pick him up and then;

            How do you want to do this?

                         MIKE D

            a place on the corner, you'll just
            get your max out and that's it --

            remember you. Who's this?

                         BARRY
            That's not true. That's not true at
            all. You said that your name was
            Georgia and you said our
            conversation was confidential and I
            trusted you and you kept calling
            and asking me for money, c'mon now
            I want to talk to your owner, your
            supervisor, whoever runs this, you
            understand. Please connect me now.

                         LATISHA

She puts him on hold and dials another number, she's real

INT. DEAN'S MATTRESS/FURNITURE STORE - THAT MOMENT

Dean also seems to own a mattress/furniture store in Provo.
Somebody walks towards him, says:

                         WORKER
            Dean, line one....

Dean walks back to the phone and picks it up;

                         DEAN
            Hello?

                         LATISHA
            Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A.,
            Barry Egan is calling on the other
            line and saying all this stuff, he
            wants to talk to a supervisor or
            whatever --

                         DEAN
            What did you say?

                         LATISHA
            Nothing.

                         DEAN
            Put him through.

                         LATISHA
            No, no. This is bad, something
            might have happened, we should
            just --

                         DEAN
            Shut up, just put him on the phone,
            it doesn't matter, just shut up --

INTERCUT NOW WITH BARRY/LATISHA/DEAN; She clicks over to him;

                         LATISHA
            Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you
            through to my supervisor.

                         BARRY
            Fine, thank you.

                         LATISHA
            Ok. You're connected.

            Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I
            called your service --

                         DEAN
            Why don't you shut the fuck up?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         DEAN
            I said calm down and shut the fuck
            up. What's your problem?

                         BARRY
            I haven't even told you what's
            happened. Your girl that you have
            that works there for you threatened
            me and two men just chased me --
            extorted money --
                         DEAN
            Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't
            have anything to do with me - this
            is a legitimate bossiness.

                         BARRY
            YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK
            YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY
            LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM
            IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU
            AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT.
            YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.

                         DEAN
            CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM
            DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --

They stop screaming. Then:

                         DEAN
            Now are you threatening me, dick?

                         BARRY
            You are bad. You are a bad person.
            you are a bad person and you have
            no right to take people's confidence
            in your service --

                         DEAN
            You better watch your mouth, cunt,
            you're gonna get hurt.

                         BARRY
            NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.

                         DEAN
            I'll say whatever I want --

                         BARRY
            YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE
            I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER.
            YOU HURT HER.

                         DEAN
            You just told me to fuck off. That
            wasn't good. You're dead.

Dean hangs up the phone.

ANGLE, BARRY. He turns away and walks quickly out of his
office with the phone receiver to his ear.....the base of
the phone slides off the desk.....and then the receiver RIPS
from the base and he starts to run....

Barry walks towards the back.....he rounds a corner....to
reveal:

DEAN is in a back room, he's getting his hair cut by
LATISHA.....he turns and looks at Barry, who stands there
with the phone in his hand.

They stare at each other.

                         BARRY
            I'm a nice and reasonable man. I
            didn't do anything wrong. Please
            don't make me hurt you. And I'm
            telling you: that if you ever hurt
            me or if you hurt someone that I
            love.....I will hurt you many,
            many, many times over.....because
            it's not right to take people's trust.

                         DEAN
            You came all the way from Los
            Angeles to tell me that?

                         BARRY
            Yes I did.

Dean doesn't respond.

                         BARRY
            Can we agree that that is that?

                         DEAN
            That's that.

                         BARRY
            Thank you.

Barry hands him the phone.

Barry exits.....as he's about to go out the doors, Dean
screams;

                         DEAN

INT. WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING

CAMERA (STEADICAM) holds on a man in a suit, sitting behind
a desk, on the phone: BARRY EGAN (Adam Sandler)

                         BARRY
            ...yes I'm still on hold...

                         OPERATOR
            And what was this?

                         BARRY
            I'm looking at your advertisement
            for the airline promotion and
            giveaway?

                         OPERATOR
            This is "Fly With Us?"

                         BARRY
            It's hard to understand because it
            says in addition to but I can't
            exactly understand in addition to
            what because there's actually
            nothing to add it too...

                         OPERATOR
            I think that's a type-o then, that
            would be a mistake.

                         BARRY
            So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten
            purchases of any of your Healthy
            Choice products equals five hundred
            miles and then with the coupon the
            same purchases would value one
            thousand miles --

                         OPERATOR
            That's it.

                         BARRY
            Do you realize that the monetary
            value of this promotion and the
            prize is potentially worth more
            than the purchases?

                         OPERATOR
            I don't know...I mean: I don't know.

OC DISTANT SOUND OF A CAR SKIDDING TO A STOP, SOME VAGUE,
DISTANT SCREAMING IS HEARD...THEN SILENCE. Barry hears this,
gets distracted, then back to the phone call;

                         BARRY
            Can I call you back if I have any
            further questions...? Can I get
            your extension?

                         OPERATOR
            It's extension 215 if you want to
            try me back.

                         BARRY
            Ok. Thank you.

He hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse. It's
fairly non-descript place, boxing materials, etc. Products
seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key
chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc)

He lifts a LOADING DOOR and LIGHT POURS INSIDE, WASHES OUT
THE FRAME....he's silhouette....CAMERA follows him
out...stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks
down towards the street.....

...his business is situated at the end of a common driveway,
shared with a few other nondescript places and an Auto
mechanic....distant SOUND of a car SPEEDING and SKIDDING....

....hold, then:

....a JEEP CHEROKEE comes FLIPPING into FRAME, far off at
the mouth of the alley, on the street. The JEEP ends up
landing RIGHT SIDE UP....HOLD....

.....Barry flinches a little, stares.....the JEEP sits idle
for a moment....then it drives off....then:

A speeding, small TOYOTA comes into view at the mouth of the
alley, screeching to a halt. The passenger side door opens
and a small, wooden HARMONIUM (like a portable organ) is
placed on the ground. The TOYOTA speeds away.....

....a moment or two later another NON-DESCRIPT CAR flies
past very fast....

BEAT. Barry squints, looks at the small HARMONIUM sitting
alone in the middle of the street.

He hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside
his warehouse.

                         BARRY

He hangs up the phone and walks outside, CAMERA follows him
again, out to the alley, over his shoulder......he looks
down the length of the alley at the Harmonium. HOLD, THEN:

A small FORD ESCORT pulls into the driveway, around the
Harmonium, parks......a young woman named LENA LEONARD

            They don't get opened until eight.

BEAT. Barry gently steps back and out of the FRAME.

                         LENA
            Is it ok if I leave my car you think?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            I thought they opened at seven.
                   (beat)
            If I left my car would it be ok?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Do you know them.

                         BARRY
            Not very well.

                         LENA
            Can I ask you, can I trust to leave
            my keys with you and give them to
            you so that when they get here you
            could give them to them?
                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         LENA
            You think it's ok where I left it,
            right there?

                         BARRY
            I think that'll be fine.

Lena hands him her keys, he steps back into FRAME, THEN:

                         LENA
            There's a piano in the street.

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

BEAT.

                         LENA
            Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank
            you for your help.

                         BARRY
            Thank you.

                         LENA
            Maybe I'll see you later, when I
            pick up my car?

                         BARRY
            Ok.

She walks away....he starts back inside the warehouse,
hesitates, watches her go.....right before she reaches the
end of the alley, she glances back quickly, over her
shoulder....he dodges inside real quick.....

HOLD THE EMPTY FRAME......then he steps back out.....looks
off at the Harmonium.....and the empty street.....he looks
around some more....then he makes the long walk down the
street.

ON THE STREET.
Barry stares at the Harmonium a little bit, looks around,
both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards
his business.....

He brings it into his office and places it on his desk. He
tries a few keys....pressing down...there's no sound.

He presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and
a small note is made.....BEAT....he does it again....and
holds the note.....

                                            CUT TO BLACK.

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Barry enters the warehouse with harmonium and runs into his
office. He places it on the desk and hits a key: no sound.

Barry goes to his knees and unlatched the bellows. He pumps
the bellow, reaches up, presses a note, and another...then
stands up into CU. and presses the 5 note
melody......SUDDENLY: THE SOUND OF THE POD BAY DOOR SLIDING....

....Barry spins around, scared shitless, sees: LANCE, who
enters the warehouse, Barry rushes out to greet him;

                         LANCE
            Hey, good morning, Barry.

                         BARRY
            Hey...Lance....can I.....

                         LANCE
            You ok?

                         BARRY
            Yes I'm fine.

                         LANCE
            Why you wearin' a suit?

                         BARRY
            Um....I bought one. I thought maybe
            it would be nice to get dressed for
            work, can I show you something?

                         LANCE
            Yeah.....you got here early huh?

                         BARRY
            ....yes.....

They enter into the office, Lance sees the harmonium;

                         LANCE
            What is this?

                         BARRY
            I don't know. I think it's a
            piano....a small piano.

                         LANCE
            That's not a piano.....I have a
            piano at home.....where'd you get it?

Lance walks around behind the harmonium....leaving Barry
alone....towards the warehouse......he starts to back up a
little.....

                         BARRY
            Well.....it was dropped on the
            street.....

Sal, Ernesto and Rico all start to come into work behind
Barry.....he sees them: CAMERA pushes in on Barry....

                         LANCE (OC)
            Why is it here? Barry....Barry?

                         BARRY
            ...it just....I don't know....I
            don't know.

INT. WAREHOUSE/MAIN AREA - DAY

CAMERA pushes in slow as Barry and Lance talk to TWO
CUSTOMERS about the plungers which are on display in front
of them. They speak all over each other doing shop talk, etc;

                         CUSTOMER
            You do guaranteed sale? etc.

                         BARRY
            We back our plungers 100% and we do
            ask for a 30 to 60 day display on
            the floor.....

In the b.g., RICO over the laud speaker says:

                         RICO
            Barry, your sister's on line one.

Barry doesn't move....

                         BARRY
            Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60
            days....

                         CUSTOMER
            I think you have a call?

Rico turns around, without loudspeaker;

                         RICO
            Barry, your sister is on line one.

They look at him a moment....

                         BARRY
            I'm just gonna grab this call real
            quick?

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry turns and heads for the phone nearby
at Rico's station;

                         BARRY
                   (into phone)
            .....This is Barry.

                         RHONDA
            Hey it's me, it's Rhonda. Are you
            coming to the party tonight?

                         BARRY
            Hi, Rhonda, yes I am.

                         RHONDA
            Bye.

She hangs up.

                         BARRY
            Ok. Yes I'll see you tonight.

Barry takes a few steps back to the Customers:

                         BARRY
            Sorry about that: One thing I
            wanted to point out, Dave, is that
            we've just received a large order
            from the Rio Hotel and Casino in
            Las Vegas where we're going to be
            supplying their hotel rooms with
            the dice and money plunger, so
            these babies are really moving well
            right now...

                         RICO

            Barry, your sister's on line two.
            Barry, your sister's on line two.

Barry tries again to ignore it....

                         BARRY
            With the Aqua Blast Whales and
            Speed Boats we're gonna ask for a
            display at eye level for the little
            kids.....

            Barry --

                         BARRY
            -- excuse me.

Barry walks back to the phone;

                         BARRY
            This is Barry.

                         KAREN
            Hey it's me, what are you doing?

                         BARRY
            Hello, Karen. I'm just working.

                         KAREN
            Yeah but what are you doing?

                         BARRY
            I'm just working....I have some
            customers here.....

                         KAREN
            So you can't talk to me?

                         BARRY
            I have a few people here, I can't
            really chat right now.

                         KAREN
            "chat?" Did you just say "chat?"

                         BARRY
            Well, I can't talk though --

                         KAREN
            You just fucking said "chat," that
            is so -- what are you now? "chat."
            I'm just calling to make sure you
            show up at this party tonight.

                         BARRY
            Yes, I'll be there.

                         KAREN
            Fine. You get back to chatting with
            your precious customers.

                         BARRY
            Ok, bye-bye.

Barry snaps out of this, turns, claps his hands in confidence
and walks back to the customers and says:

                         BARRY
            Sorry about that.

                         CUSTOMER
            I didn't know you had a sister?

                         BARRY
            .....Well yes I do....
                   (beat)
            But one more thing I wanted to tell
            you guys about the new plungers is
            that we're making the handles now
            in a non-breakable material
            called.....

He takes one of the plungers and to demonstrate smacks it on
the table....it SMASHES and rice falls out everywhere....

                         BARRY
            Ok...this is one of the old ones, I
            think. Lance do we have any new
            plungers around?

Lance moves to get a new plunger....

                         BARRY
            That was a little embarrassing and
            that was one of the old handles so
            let me get a new one to show you --

                         RICO
                   (loudspeaker)
            Barry, your sister is on line one.

Barry holds, then;

                         CUSTOMER
            How many sisters do you have?

                         BARRY
            ....I have seven.

                         CUSTOMER #2
            Holy shit. You have seven sisters?

                         BARRY
            They're calling because we're
            having a party tonight for my
            sister and the they're just
            calling....can you hang on for just
            two more minutes....?

Barry walks this time into his office......CAMERA tracks
with Barry to his office, seeing him try and shake this
off.....He EXITS FRAME.

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

Barry enters, takes a quick moment to size up the
harmonium.....He picks up the phone and through the
conversation gently moves the harmonium to a different spot
on the desk;

            This is Barry.

A mechanic passes by at this moment, keeps walking past;

                         BARRY
            What's wrong with her car?

                         MECHANIC

Ernesto walks over, says;

            Barry, your sister's here.

Barry stands up fast, stumbles back a bit over some boxes,
recovers, ELIZABETH enters:

            Hey, how are you?
                         BARRY
            I'm fine, hi, how are you?

            I'm just stopping by to say hello.

                         BARRY
            Hello.

                         ELIZABETH
            So you're coming tonight, right?

                         BARRY
            Yes, indeed, yes I am.

                         ELIZABETH
            There's this girl, this friend of
            mine from work that I think is
            really cute and really cool and I
            want you to meet her so I was
            thinking about bringing her to the
            party tonight.

                         BARRY
            Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why?

                         BARRY
            Well I don't want to do something
            like that.

                         ELIZABETH
            She's my friend and you should meet
            her. You'd like her.

                         BARRY
            Yeah, but please don't do that.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm not really asking you, I'm
            telling you.

                         BARRY
            Yeah but please don't do that:
            everyone would be looking at me.

                         ELIZABETH
            It's a free country, we can look at
            you if we want to.

                         BARRY
            Yes but I get tense and I feel like
            I can't be myself if that happens.

                         ELIZABETH
            That's your fault not mine.

                         BARRY
            I don't think I'm going to the party.

                         ELIZABETH
            So it's ok if I bring her.

                         BARRY
            Please don't.

                         ELIZABETH
            She's really cute and she's really
            nice.

                         BARRY
            ...please, I just don't want it....

                         ELIZABETH
            ....wait a minute: why is this
            about you now? Why is it always
            about you?

                         BARRY
            Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm trying to be your friend.

                         BARRY
            I know.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.

                         BARRY
            Well, yeah, thank you, but --

                         ELIZABETH
            -- but since you're not going I
            guess none of this matters and I'll
            bring her anyway.

BEAT. HOLD. She stares him down.

                         ELIZABETH
            All I'm trying to do is be your
            friend.

She leaves. HOLD ON BARRY. He air punches/twitch.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER/BLUE HOUR - NIGHT

Barry is alone, closing up. He takes a look at the Harmonium
and presses it, makes a sound....a little bit more....makes
a few notes. END SCORE QUE as it blends and fades into the
notes that Barry plays.

BEAT. He closes its small cover, does something on his desk
and then:

His face gets bright red, he holds back tears, opens his
mouth and has a serious but small burst of overwhelming
emotion and then it's over.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

CU. BIRTHDAY CARD.
Barry's hands reaches in and picks a birthday card.

ANGLE, WIDER, THAT MOMENT.
Barry grabs the card and starts to push his cart....but he
pushes it straight into a SIX YEAR OLD KID who's pushing a
cart around....they slam into each other....

Barry apologizes....the KID just takes off....Barry's cart
now has a slightly damaged wheel that wobbles like crazy....

ANGLE, FROZEN FOOD AISLE.
CAMERA tracks left to right with Barry as he heads for the
Healthy Choice Frozen Dinner. He grabs one.

CU. BARRY. LOW ANGLE.
He looks at box.

BARRY'S POV - THE BOX
Slow zoom in. The sticker reads: "Fly Away With Us! The More
You Buy The More You Earn."

ANGLE, SOUP SECTION.
CAMERA tracks along right to left with Barry as he moves
towards some SOUP. He grabs one, inspects it.....then puts
it back.

CU. SOUP CAN.
It's put back on the shelf: TILT down to price: 79 cents.

Barry turns his cart around and SMACKS right into someone
else again, screwing up another wheel on his cart.

ANGLE, BARRY.
CAMERA, tracks alongside him, left to right as he comes
across: PUDDING. The price: 4/$1.00.

MED. BARRY in the middle of the aisle.
He reacts......smiles...holds....thinks....looks around,
then starts to load up on the pudding.

ANGLE, BARRY.
He pushes TWO SHOPPING CARTS FULL OF PUDDING over to the
STORE MANAGER who's on his knees, stacking milk.....Barry
kneels down, CAMERA PUSHES INTO A CU. as he speaks sotto;

                         MANAGER
            Hello.

                         BARRY
            Hello, sir. My name is Barry Egan
            and I'd like to ask if you have any
            more Healthy Choice pudding in the
            back?

                                            CUT TO:

INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens slowly and Barry peers his head around and
into the house very cautiously, CAMERA PUSHES IN and PANS
slightly LEFT to reveal: THE KITCHEN.

Barry's SEVEN SISTERS are all there, preparing dinner and
talking away....they turn and see him;

                         SUSAN
            There he is! Do you remember when
            we used to call you gay and you'd
            get all mad?

                         KATHLEEN
            -- we were calling you gay and you
            got so mad that you threw a hammer
            through the sliding glass door --
            do you remember?

                         BARRY
            I don't really remember that.

                         KATHLEEN
            Yes you do. We were calling you Gay
            Boy and you got so mad....

                         BARRY
            Yes, yes, right.

                         SUSAN
            We're trying to remember why you
            had the hammer in the first place?

                         BARRY
            ...um.....

                         KATHLEEN
            The hammer that you threw....why
            did you have it?

                         SUSAN
            You don't remember -- you had the
            hammer and you threw it -- ?

                         BARRY
            I remember, yes.....

                         SUSAN
            Why did you have it?

Another sister, RHONDA, enters from behind, Barry jumps, says:

                         RHONDA
            He was building a ramp for the dog.

                         KATHLEEN
            He was making a ramp for the dog!
            That's right!

                         SUSAN
            That's right....ramp for the
            dog..... And you just threw the
            hammer.

                         BARRY
                   (to Rhonda)
            Happy Birthday, Rhonda.

                         RHONDA
            Thank you. Thank you so much, Barry.

She gives him a very quick hug and kiss and sets the cake
next to a bigger, cooler looking cake.

Mia approaches holding a baby.....Barry tries to say hello
to the baby, but Mia slowly turns the baby out of Barry's
grasp....making herself the center of his attention;

KITCHEN/DINING ROOM, THAT MOMENT

Barry gets slightly turned around trying to reach the
baby...and ends up in a doorway that leads to the dining
room, revealing himself to: ELIZABETH, KAREN, NICOLE AND
ANNA. There are also: THREE BROTHER IN LAW'S (WALTER, LARRY
AND STEVE)

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey....I was just telling everyone
            about how I was gonna bring this
            girl for you but you wouldn't let
            me do it.

                         BARRY
            Hello everyone.

KAREN steps up and greets him;

                         KAREN
            Did you think that we'd all be
            looking at you?

                         BARRY
            No, no, no.

                         KAREN
            Well it's just not true. We
            wouldn't be looking at you -- why
            are you wearing this suit? Did you
            say hello to your brother in law's?

                         STEVE/LARRY
            Hi, Barry. How ya doin? Good, good.

                         KAREN
            Say hello to them, that's right,
            good, good. Ok. Come on, we're
            gonna eat now.....let's go.....

Barry shakes hands and hello's with the brother in law's.
He's left alone for a moment with Walter and Elizabeth;

                         WALTER
            How you doin' Barry?

                         BARRY
            Hi Walter.

                         WALTER
            How's business?

                         BARRY
            Business is very food, thanks.
                         ELIZABETH
            What's very food?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         ELIZABETH
            You just said very food.

                         BARRY
            Did I say that?

                         WALTER
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            That was weird. I meant good.

                         WALTER
            Maybe you said that because you're
            hungry.....

Walter moves to help everyone...they're moving to set the
table......

CAMERA CLOSES IN ON BARRY AND ELIZABETH alone for a beat:

                         ELIZABETH
            You're lucky. She couldn't come
            anyway --

                         BARRY
            Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.

                         ELIZABETH
            She couldn't come I said. Are you
            nervous?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         ELIZABETH
            You look nervous.

                         BARRY
            I'm not, I'm very happy.

RHONDA passes;

                         RHONDA
            Come on homo-boy, we're eating now.

Elizabeth leaves, HOLD ON BARRY.

CAMERA PUSHES IN TOWARDS EVERYONE SETTING THE
TABLE.....CAMERA ROTATES AROUND.....everyone is still
chatting a bit about "Barry gay boy," and "the girl that was
gonna be here that Barry wouldn't allow."

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry is standing in front of the floor to
ceiling sliding glass doors.....in an INSTANT, he TURNS AND
THROWS HIS FIST STRAIGHT THROUGH THREE OF THEM, THEY
SHATTER....he turns back, they are all staring straight at
him in silence. HOLD, THEN:

In unison they all go ape shit:

                         GROUP
            WHAT THE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM.
            GODDAMNIT BARRY. YOU FUCKIN' MANIAC.
            ETC. ETC.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. SUSAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

It's later and WALTER and BARRY walk down a small hall and
into a kids room. They're OC for a few moments as the CAMERA
slowly pushes in and towards the room. Following sotto;

                         WALTER
            What's up?

                         BARRY
            Well I'm sorry. Before...

                         WALTER
            Mhm.

                         BARRY
            And I'm sorry that I did that.

                         WALTER
            It's alright.

                         BARRY
            I wanted to ask you because you're
            a doctor, right?

                         WALTER
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I don't like the way I am sometimes.
                   (beat)
            Can you help me?
                         WALTER
            Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of
            help do you think I can give you?

                         BARRY
            I know that. Maybe you know other
            doctors?

                         WALTER
            Like a psychiatrist?

                         BARRY
            I don't have anyone to talk to
            things about and I understand it's
            confidential with a doctor - I'm
            embarrassed about that and I don't
            want my sisters to know?

                         WALTER
            You want a number for a
            psychiatrist, I can get you one,
            that's not a problem. but what
            exactly is wrong?

                         BARRY
            I don't know if there's anything
            wrong with me because I don't know
            how other people are.....Sometimes
            I cry a lot.....for no reason.

Barry starts to cry. Walter just stares at his. HOLD.

Barry stops, recuperates, then leaves.....as he does;

                         BARRY
            Please don't tell my sisters.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S APARTMENT - LATER

CU. HEALTHY CHOICE COUPON.
Barry's scissors cut out a coupon and reveal an image
beneath in another section of the newspaper...it's the sexy
LEG of a woman....

BARRY very casually pushes some papers aside and looks at
the ad...

HOLD ON HIS FACE. He looks....then:

MOMENTS LATER, BARRY ON THE PHONE.

He listens;

            That's fine. Can I have a telephone
            number, area code first on where we
            can call you back?

                         BARRY
            No I just....I don't want to, I
            just want to be connected to talk
            to a girl.

                         OPERATOR GIRL (OC)
            It's a call back service -- a girl
            will call you back.

                         BARRY
            I thought I was just gonna be
            connected to talk to a girl -
            that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's,
            um.....818....

            look like?

                         BARRY
            It doesn't matter.

            What do you mean it doesn't matter?

                         BARRY
            Well. I have no way of knowing. So
            it doesn't matter.

                         SEXY VOICE

            I do pretty good, I think. I wish I
            was making more, doing a little bit
            better. I can,t get over a certain
            hump. I will...I will crack
            something soon I think and really
            do better...I'd like to
            diversify...but I'm doing great, I
            think, as a start.

            Me?

            I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I
            can't afford it.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You don't even know how much it is.

                         BARRY
            I know but I....how much is it?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?

                         BARRY
            Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't
            afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.

            Really? Please?

            Yeah. It's so hard these days and I
            really need it.

                         BARRY
            Yes I can't....I don't make enough
            money to be able to do that.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I thought you had your own business.
            You said you were gonna diversify

            I was wondering if it's better to

            It could be really easy. I mean, I

INT. BARRY'S WORK/WAREHOUSE - MORNING/LATER

CAMERA (HAND HELD) behind Barry, as he walks through the
warehouse, greets the boys, says hello to Lance, etc. Lance,
taking his cue from Barry, is a bit more dressed up today....

                         LANCE
            Good morning, Barry....

                         BARRY
            Hi, Lance.

                         LANCE
            What's with all this pudding, what
            is this?

CAMERA sees that all the pudding Barry bought has been
stacked neatly in a corner. Barry stops dead in his tracks
to explain;

                         BARRY
            That's part of a very interesting
            airline promotion giveaway that's
            really tremendous. I'm going to
            start a collection of pudding and
            coupons that can be redeemed for
            frequent flyer miles through
            Healthy Choice and American
            Airlines --

                         LANCE
            You're goin' on a trip?

                         BARRY
            No.........but airline miles are
            just like a currency these days.

                         LANCE
            You should go on a trip.

                         BARRY
            No thanks.

                         LANCE
            So what should I do with the pudding?

                         BARRY
            Let's just leave it there for now.

Barry goes into his office and looks at the Harmonium. BEAT.
He presses some keys, makes a little more noise with it. (a
quarter of some sort of melody starts here...)

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.
Barry is cutting up his CREDIT CARD with some scissors. He
throws it away.

ANGLE, MOMENTS LATER.
Barry paces around a little bit.....CAMERA stays inside and
watches him as he walks outside for a moment, looks
around....he sees something outside, hesitates, then dodges
back inside the warehouse --

-- once inside, he takes a horrendous, hurtful fall over
something....He stands up quick;

                         BARRY
            This is not supposed to be here.
            Seriously. Carlos, Carlos, this is
            really not supposed to be here. I
            don't mean to be a dick; but that's
            gonna hurt someone. It already did
            hurt someone: It hurt me, so please
            let's move that.

He backs away, then steps OUT OF FRAME...a moment later
ELIZABETH (his sister) and LENA (from the opening) enter the
warehouse, walking towards Barry;

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Lena)
            He's wearing a suit again, I don't
            know why he's wearing a suit, he
            doesn't usually dress like that --

                         LENA
            It's fine.

CAMERA pushes in towards LENA and blends to 30fps...she
smiles, looks ahead, CAMERA slowly pans a 180 around to
become her POV.

Barry is standing near the harmonium, fiddling around. He
looks up, sees Elizabeth and Lena walking towards him and
tenses....they meet in the middle of the warehouse;

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey, what are you doing? Why are
            you wearing a suit again?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Hi.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         LENA
            Do you remember me, I left my car,
            yesterday.

                         BARRY
            Yes I do.

                         ELIZABETH
            This is Lena, she's a good friend
            of mine from work. We were in the
            neighborhood and she had to pick up
            her car and we're getting breakfast
            before we go in, so did you want to
            go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.

                         BARRY
            Yeah I can't.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why?

                         BARRY
            I have work, I can't leave.

                         ELIZABETH
            Seriously, though: We're going to
            eat, I said.

                         BARRY
            I'm sorry.

                         LENA
            It's ok. That's alright.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you learning how to play the
            piano? What is that?

                         BARRY
            It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE!
            MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN
            TOLEDO.

                         LANCE (OC)
            WHICH?

                         BARRY
            ...I'll tell you later.

                         ELIZABETH
            You don't wanna come to eat with us?

                         WORKER VOICE
            TELEPHONE BARRY ON LINE TWO!

                         ELIZABETH
            What's all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            I don't know. Can you hang on a
            second?

CAMERA follows Barry as he walks back to his little office,
picks up the phone;

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            We got disconnected before....

                         BARRY
            No. No. We got disconnect --
            why?.....you're calling me at
            work....how did you get this
            number -- ?

                         SEXY VOICE
            See the thing is I could make it
            really easy on you -- I already
            have your credit card number, your
            information, address and stuff.
            This is so awkward asking like
            this, I'm sorry --

                         BARRY
            This makes me very uncomfortable.

                         SEXY VOICE
            I need help.

BEAT.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Should I just ask your girlfriend?
                   (beat)
            Maybe I should call back and talk
            to your girlfriend?

                         BARRY
            I don't have a girlfriend --

                         SEXY VOICE
            -- you said you did.

                         BARRY
            I know I did. But I don't.

                         SEXY VOICE
            You lied to me?

                         BARRY
            I didn't lie.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Why did you tell me you did, then?

                         BARRY
            This is....illegal....I'll call the
            police.

                         SEXY VOICE
            No you won't.

ANGLE, ELIZABETH AND LENA

                         LENA
            I'll go pay for my car.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you sure?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         ELIZABETH
            He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have
            no idea why he's being weird and
            dressed in a suit --

                         LENA
            It's not bad, it's ok.

                         ELIZABETH
            -- he's so strange I don't know if
            you really even would want to go
            out with him, someone like him, I
            said I'd try, but it's just --

                         LENA
            It's ok, it's alright. I'll come
            right back, I'll just go pay for my
            car.

                         ELIZABETH
            Sorry.

She leaves. Elizabeth heads for Barry's office;

ANGLE, BARRY on the phone

                         SEXY VOICE
            Come on, I thought we had fun, rich
            boy --

                         BARRY
            This is not cool.

                         SEXY VOICE
            It was cool last night.

                         BARRY
            I have to go.

                         SEXY VOICE
            Are you telling me no?

                         BARRY
            No I'm sorry, now I have to get off
            the phone....

                         SEXY VOICE
            ....this is your mistake....

Elizabeth comes walking into his office, starts whispering
to him as he's on the phone;

                         ELIZABETH
            Hey, hey, you should ask her out --
            what do you think, she's cute, right?

                         BARRY
                   (into phone)
            I'm gonna call you back.

He starts to hang up the phone, turns to Elizabeth as we hear;

                         SEXY VOICE
                   (trailing off)
            ...MOTHERFUCKER, NO....

                         BARRY
            She is. I think, why did you come
            here like this?

                         ELIZABETH
            It's not cool?

                         BARRY
            It's fine, but --

                         ELIZABETH
            -- do you think you'll ask her out?

                         BARRY
            I feel really on the spot now.

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you gonna do it?

                         BARRY
            I don't do that. I don't - things
            like that.

                         ELIZABETH
            You don't do anything, why are you
            being scared?

                         BARRY
            I'm not being scared, you're just
            going to rag me if I do this --

                         ELIZABETH
            I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I
            do this just to rag you?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         ELIZABETH
            I'll leave then, I'll go to get
            something from my car, go away so
            you don't feel pressure. Can I ask
            you a serious question:

                         BARRY
            What?

                         ELIZABETH
            Did you ask Walter to get you a
            shrink?
                   (beat)
            Barry, did you ask Walter to get
            you a shrink? What's wrong with you?
            Are you ok?

                         BARRY
            I didn't ask him that. He's lying.

                         ELIZABETH
            You're being weird again, see. Come
            on. Please don't be weird.

ANGLE, BARRY AND ELIZABETH, MOMENTS LATER
They walk out and as they do, Lena comes back in with her
keys in her hand, Elizabeth keeps walking past;

                         ELIZABETH
            I gotta grab something from my car....

                         LENA
            We should be going --

                         ELIZABETH
                   (over her shoulder)
            Yeah, no, I have to get something
            from my car, I said.

Barry and Lena about to be alone as Lance walks up;

                         LANCE
            Which guy in Toledo are you talking
            about?

                         BARRY
            I'll tell you...the
            guy...with...just talk to me later
            about it, ok?

                         LANCE
            You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?

                         BARRY
            I have to talk to you in a second
            about that, Lance, ok?

He walks away, Lena turns to him;

                         LENA
            I'm sorry I couldn't come to your
            sister's birthday party last night,
            Elizabeth had invited me and I
            couldn't make it --

                         BARRY
            It's fine. It was fun, though.

                         LENA
            It must be weird for you to have so
            many sisters?

                         BARRY
            No. Not at all. It's nice.

                         WORKER (OC)
            Telephone, Barry Line One!

Barry turns instantly and walks away....he turns back as he
walks....TWO SHOT - track left with him....

                         BARRY
                   (turns back)
            One second, sorry.

IN THE OFFICE, THAT MOMENT
He picks up the phone.

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            Hang up again and see the trouble
            it's gonna make.

Barry instantly hangs up the phone, turns around and walks
back to Lena;

                         LENA
            Business is good, you're busy?

                         BARRY
            Yeah, not really.

                         LENA
            I saw a picture of you.

                         BARRY
            Yes.
                         LENA
            Elizabeth has a picture of you
            guys -- your sisters and you, it's
            a lot of family, it must be nice.

                         BARRY
            Do you have brothers or sisters?

                         LENA
            No. I'm the exact opposite --

                         BARRY
            That must be nice. That must be
            really, really, really great.

                         LENA
            It's terrible, no.

No response from Barry. (cut to reverse 2-shot as they look)

                         LENA
            What do you do with all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            That's not mine it's one of the
            guys that works here. That
            pudding's not mine.

BEAT. In the b.g., two WORKERS are dealing with getting a
large crate on top of a large stack of crates, they're using
a fork lift....in an instant the large CRATE tumbles to the
ground and SMASHES....Barry attempts to not notice this;

                         LENA
            Oh My God.

                         BARRY
            It's ok. That's ok. How long have
            you worked with Elizabeth?

The workers start calling out and apologizing for this to
Barry, who keeps looking straight ahead to Lena;

                         LENA
            Six months, maybe five, five or six
            months...do you wanna check that?

                         BARRY
                   (to the guys)
            Are you guys hurt?

                         WORKERS/LANCE
            No, no, we're ok....Barry, sorry --
                         BARRY
                   (back to Lena)
            So you do what she does, the same
            work, the same job?

                         LENA
            I do, but I do field consultations
            mainly too which is cool because I
            get to travel. I travel. A lot of
            the time. I'm going to Hawaii on
            Friday.

                         BARRY
            That's great -- Hawaii. I was
            thinking about going there.

                         LENA
            Really?

                         BARRY
            I was, yeah, I was thinking about
            going there for business --

                         LENA
            -- well, if you're gonna go --

                         BARRY
            -- I'm probably not gonna go though.

                         LENA
            -- oh that's too bad, it's so great
            over there and if you were there we
            could say hello to each other or
            something --

                         BARRY
            -- yeah that would be great, if I
            was gonna go but I'm not exactly
            sure, I have so much goin on
            here -- A lot depends on this thing
            I might do here and if that happens
            I can't go and if it doesn't happen
            then I probably will, but I doubt it.

There's another LOUD CRASH as they try to reposition the box
that's fallen, giving way to something else that FALLS. In
other words, to correct the mistake they've already made,
they have to sacrifice another CRATE that CRASHES. She
looks, Barry just flinches, tries to stay looking straight
ahead; CAMERA (HAND HELD) with Elizabeth, comes walking back
in.....says to Barry:

                         ELIZABETH
            I can't find that thing in my car,
            I can't find it so I'll just get it
            and give it to you later. So?

                         LENA
                   (to Elizabeth)
            You ready?

                         ELIZABETH
            Are you coming to eat with us?

                         BARRY
            Yeah I can't.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (at the crates)
            OH MY GOD. Look at that.

                         LENA
                   (to Barry)
            It was great to meet you again. To
            see you again, thanks for helping
            me yesterday --

                         BARRY
            Ok.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Barry)
            What's all this pudding?

                         BARRY
            It's not mine.

                         ELIZABETH
            Why's it here?

                         BARRY
            I have no idea.

                         LENA
                   (to Elizabeth)
            Are you ready?

                         ELIZABETH
                   (to Barry)
            Will you call me later to talk
            about asking Walter for the shrink?
            And we can talk about - he said you
            have this crying problem or something?

                         LENA
            Bye, Barry.

                         BARRY
            Goodbye.

                         ELIZABETH
            Call me later.

Lena and Elizabeth leave. CAMERA leads them as they walk;
Sound starts to drop out, we see Barry and the boys cleaning
up the boxes in the back....move into a CU on Lena....Music
Cue. Score. treated piano, small rhythm/melodic(notes of
harmonium so far)/gentle.

                         ELIZABETH
            So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?

                         LENA
            Ok.

Lena gets into her car. Elizabeth keeps walking. She waits
until Elizabeth is out of sight at the mouth of the driveway
and then she gets back out of her car and walks straight
back into the warehouse.

INT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

She comes walking in and over to Barry;

                         LENA
            I'm going to go and eat tomorrow
            night do you want to go with me?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

                         LENA
            Do you want to pick me up?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

                         LENA
            Can I write down my address and
            phone number for you?

                         BARRY
            Sure.

They do a small search for a piece of paper, get it all
written down and sorted out and then -- as they do this
there is even more CRASHING AND SMASHING in the b.g., by the
boys -- Barry and Lena settle up and say so long.

                         BARRY
            This is funny.

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I didn't ask anyone for a shrink,
            that was someone else. Also: This
            pudding is not mine. Also: I'm
            wearing a suit because I had a very
            important business meeting this
            morning and I don't have a crying
            problem.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY
            Alright?

                         LENA
            ....Hi.....

                         BARRY
            ....Hi.....

She walks off. CAMERA leads her out, holds a CU. as she
smiles to herself -- lead her a bit more until she's
outside, and she gets in her car --

CU. BARRY. He smiles, looks around, holds back his emotion
so it looks like he'll explode....tenses, smiles, tears,
looks around....HOLD. End Music Que.

                         LANCE (OC)
            Barry, Line One, Telephone!

Barry walks in. HOLD. He picks up the phone.

                         BARRY
            Hello?

                         SEXY VOICE
            You've just made a war that you
            cannot afford.

She hangs up real quick. HOLD. Barry and his harmonium.

INT. STEVENS BROTHERS HOUSE - DAY

CAMERA behind a BLONDE GIRLS HEAD (LATISHA). She speaks to
two blonde brothers, DAVID and JIM. In the b.g., walking
around holding a BABY is NATE. (Maybe a girlfriend or wife
or two).

                         DAVID
            I'll do it.

                         JIM
            I'll do it too.

                         DAVID
            But it's gotta wait until my knee
            is better. I can't risk it.

                         LATISHA
            You have to do it now.

                         JIM
            If we drive there it's a problem.

                         LATISHA
            Dean will loan you one of his cars.

                         JIM
            Which one?

                         LATISHA
            You have to talk to him --

                         DAVID
            How do you know he's rich?

                         LATISHA
            Because I know, I just know. I
            mean, I talked to him, I know.

Nate emerges a bit from the b.g.

                         NATE
            Where are you guys going?

                         DAVID
            California. Los Angeles.

                         NATE
            When are you leaving?

                         DAVID
            Right now.

                         LATISHA
            Let's go talk to Dean.

INT. LOCAL BAR/PROVO - LATER

LATISHA, DAVID, JIM and NATE enter and meet DEAN TRUMBELL,
listening to AFTER EDEN play onstage, standing in the middle
of the room.

                         DEAN
            Hey guys.

                         DAVID/JIM/NATE
            Hey, Dean.

                         LATISHA
            So they'll go.

                         DEAN
            I'm only paying two of you guys.

                         DAVID
            That's cool.

                         DEAN
            When can you leave?

                         DAVID
            As soon as you want.

                         DEAN
            I want you to go right away, I
            think that's best. I also need you
            to check out a car for me down
            there that this guy is selling.

They walk towards a back room, as they do they pass a
REGULAR JOE who bumps into Dean accidentally, Dean explodes;

                         DEAN
            You wanna fuck around, asshole? You
            wanna get tough, wanna see me kick
            some motherfuck around here?

                         REGULAR JOE
            Take it easy, man, relax. Don't --
                         DEAN
            I'll relax your fucking head --
            this is my personal space, man,
            this is my personal fucking space,
            you don't violate that, you don't
            do that.

                         REGULAR JOE
            I've got a glass in my hand why
            don't you chill out?

                         DEAN
            You've got a glass?

Dean takes a BEER BOTTLE and SMASHES it in half on the bar,
holds it up to the guy --

                         DEAN
            YEAH. YOU'VE GOT A GLASS, NOW I'VE
            GOT A GLASS. I'VE GOT A GLASS TOO
            MOTHERFUCK.

                                            JUMP CUT TO:

INT. LOCAL BAR/PROVO - MOMENTS LATER

They're all walking towards a back room of the bar, they
walk past a COUPLE that is fighting. The WOMAN is screaming
at the top of her lungs at the MAN;

                         WOMAN
            I WILL CRUSH YOU. I WILL FUCKING
            CRUSH YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.

Dean gets in the middle of it;

                         DEAN
            Take it easy, take it easy you guys
            in here, I need to talk to you
            later, Tommy -- I wanna know if you
            wanna book the boys --

He motions over his shoulder to Ashes to Ashes.

                         MAN
            I'll talk to you later.

                         WOMAN
            YOU WON'T FUCKIN' TALK TO HIM
            LATER, I WILL CRUSH YOU. I WILL
            CRUSH YOU, ASSHOLE.

                                            CUT TO:
INT. DEAN'S OFFICE/UPSTAIRS/BACKROOM - MOMENTS LATER

They enter into an upstairs office area. It has a couple
desks and off to the side, in a small, partitioned off room
is The Phone Sex Area; a GIRL on the phone. (We hear bits of
her call, e.g. "Me? I'm in Florida. Laying on my bed.")

There are posters for Ashes to Ashes, filing cabinets,
posters of CARS, lots of various small business items like
order forms and pamphlets, etc. Dean collects a piece of
paper and hands it to David/Nate/Jim;

                         DEAN
            Your expenses are your own.

                         DAVID
            I thought Latisha said you would --

                         DEAN
            -- she didn't know what she was
            talking about --

                         DAVID
            It's....whatever....that's not cool.

                         DEAN
            David, Don't. Just. Seriously. It
            doesn't make sense if you think
            about it in a fair deal like sense.
            Ok? It's business. Seriously. One
            hundred dollars for two days work
            is a lot more than your family is
            making sitting around your house.
            I'm serious now. Ok. Please. Now.
            Just stop.

He hands him a set of KEYS and goes through the info;

                         DEAN
            ...keys for the track. You have to
            gas it up and save the receipts on
            that. His address. We have a
            business address too if you need
            that -- but hit him at his house
            first, see what this little bad boy
            is all about and shake him up --
            give him a little doe-see-doe --

                         LATISHA
            Uch. Shut up, Dean.

                         DEAN
            What's the problem?

                         LATISHA
            You don't need to talk all macho,
            "shake him out, little bad boy."
            Whatever -- you're not an action
            hero, tough guy, you're not a
            gangster --

He makes a very SUDDEN AND QUICK MOVE towards her and she
FLINCHES.

                         DEAN
            Flinchy. That's what I thought.
            Shut up.
                   (to Greg)
            Call me when you see this guy --
            check him out see what's what. She
            asked him for seven fifty when she
            was on the phone with him, so --
            just call me when you get there.

He hands him another piece of paper and a photo;

                         DEAN
            This is this place called Ace
            Vintage, you gotta find it, I don't
            know exactly where this is and I
            don't understand these maps so just
            go there and check it out. It's a
            '61 AC Cobra that this old guy says
            is fine, but I need to figure out
            why he's only asking 23 for it. So
            take a look, the whole thing, call
            me about that, if it seems alright
            then I'll head down there and check
            it out.

                         DAVID
            Ok.

                         DEAN
            That's it.

                         DAVID
            Can we maybe ask for more money on
            this?

                         LATISHA
            Why?

                         DAVID
            ...because it's California? I mean
            it's like a nine or ten hour drive.
            It's not like going to Salt Lake
            and getting the Mormon's, it's
            different...

After a long, long staring contest with David, Dean SUDDENLY
AND VERY VIOLENTLY PUTS HIS FIST THROUGH THE WALL....then
turns to David......Latisha rolls her eyes. David, Nate and
Jim leave.

EXT/INT. LENA'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - EVENING

This is a SPLIT SCREEN SEQUENCE shot with TWO CAMERAS.

THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SCREEN holds Lena. She waits in her
small, nondescript apartment doing the things you do while
waiting for someone else. She sits, stands, sits, stands....

THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE THE SCREEN travels (STEADICAM) with
Barry as he walks into the RECEPTION AREA. There is a
SECURITY GUARD (black, female) who asks him his name, where
he's going and to sign in. The Security Guard calls up to
Lena's place....

....and we watch Lena answer the phone....

...The Security Guard gives Barry some very complicated
directions....we follow/lead Barry as he makes his way
through the maze/up elevators/down corridors looking for
Lena's apartment.....Finally, he arrives, knocks;

                         LENA
            Who is it?

                         BARRY
            It's Barry.

As she opens the door, THE SPLIT SCREEN SLIDES AWAY AND THE
IMAGES GIVE WAY TO THE ONE OF LENA standing;

                         LENA
            Hi.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Lena and Barry at a table. They talk (see notes.)

                         LENA
            So I want to tell you something, I
            gotta tell you: I saw a picture of
            you guys, your sisters and you and
            I saw your picture and I really
            wanted to meet you.
                   (beat)
            I came to drop my car off there on
            purpose, to try and meet you.

Barry leans a little bit out of FRAME.

                         BARRY
            ...really? That's nice...are you
            lying?

                         LENA
            ...I thought I should tell you. I
            didn't want to get too far along on
            going out and be hiding something --

BEAT. He leans slightly back in FRAME.

                         BARRY
            That's very nice. Thank you. Thank
            you for saying that.
                   (beat)
            You're friends with my sister?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            How long have you known her?

                         LENA
            About six months.

                         BARRY
            You like her?

                         LENA
            Yeah. Yeah we get along well.
                   (beat)
            You didn't get along with her very
            well?

                         BARRY
            Did you really come to meet me on
            purpose or are you lying about that?

                         LENA
            No, no. I did.

                         BARRY
            That's nice. It's nice.
                   (beat)
            I've been looking around a lot
            lately at promotional giveaways,
            cross promotional work by some
            companies. Do you remember all that
            pudding?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            So that pudding was bought, I
            bought that pudding because of a
            pretty interesting promotion that's
            sponsored by Healthy Choice and
            American Airlines. It's designed to
            encourage airline travel and
            obviously designed to encourage
            buying Healthy Choice products.
            They make frozen meals, deli meats,
            pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice
            creams, this sort of thing.....

                         LENA
            Yeah?

                         BARRY
            ....I'm sorry....I lost my
            thoughts, what I was saying....

                         LENA
            You were talking about the
            promotion --

                         BARRY
            -- the promotion says: buy any 10
            Healthy Choice products and get 500
            miles of airline travel or 1,000
            for purchases made with a special
            coupon. So in the supermarket, you
            notice their products, first you
            notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken
            Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty
            good deal....but then I noticed
            they had soup at 89 cents a
            can.....and you start to do the
            math and you start to notice that
            it's a really amazing deal because
            I stumbled across the pudding at 25
            cents a cup. Now the crucial thing
            is the bar codes on the label.
            That's those little bar codes, you
            know? The universal product codes?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            That's what's used to redeem the
            mileage, so in noticing the
            pudding, each cup had an individual
            bar code -- in other words: Two
            dollars and fifty cents for ten
            cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add
            in the coupon: it's one thousand.
            You see?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            You see?

                         LENA
            Yeah, no, I see --

                         BARRY
            You see if you spent $3,000 dollars
            on pudding you could earn over one
            million frequent flyer miles.

                         LENA
            That's insane. That is really,
            really crazy. That's just crazy if
            you spend three thousand dollars on
            pudding.

                         BARRY
            ....yeah....

                         LENA
            So that was your pudding?

                         BARRY
            ....No....

                         LENA
            I'm sorry. I thought you said --

                         BARRY
            No I didn't say that.

                         LENA
            I thought you said you bought all
            that pudding --

                         BARRY
            My friend Carlos is doing it who
            works with me. It's his. It's his
            pudding, he's doing it. It's not
            mine. He's crazy. I told him not to
            do it. He's the one who's insane.
            He only spent about one hundred
            dollars so far though --

                         LENA
            Your sister was telling me a pretty
            funny story about you, when you
            guys were kids and you were
            building a ramp for your dog and
            you threw a hammer through a window?
            Is that right? You threw a hammer
            through a sliding glass door?

Barry starts to WELL WITH TEARS, which he hides very
quickly, holds a hand up to his face as if he's touching his
nose, and then he smiles;

                         BARRY
            I don't remember that, she might be
            lying. I have to go the bathroom.

He gets up and goes.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Barry walks in and goes a little crazy. He's mad at himself
and he HITS a stall....it seems loose already and falls
straight to the floor.

This makes him go crazier and he continues to BEAT and KICK
the shit out of the bathroom/stall.

HOLD. He collects himself and then he hesitates, looks
around, tries to collect the bathroom but it's in ruins, he
exits....

                                            CUT TO:

INT. RESTARAUNT - MOMENTS LATER

Barry comes back and sits down, seems a little better. Tries
to be a little flirtatious for half a moment before: the
MANAGER comes over, leans in carefully;

                         MANAGER
            Hello.

                         LENA & BARRY
            Hi.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, can I talk to you?

                         BARRY
            Why?

                         MANAGER
            Just have you for one second, please.

He looks to Lena, excuses himself.

ANGLE, OFF TO THE SIDE.
The Manager and Barry step away, in a quiet section of the
restaraunt, 2-shot, profile, in sotto; SLOW ZOOM IN.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

                         MANAGER
            Did you do it?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         MANAGER
            You didn't just smash up the bathroom?

                         BARRY
            No.

                         MANAGER
            Well who did?

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         MANAGER
            You're hand is bleeding.

                         BARRY
            I cut myself.

                         MANAGER
            How?

                         BARRY
            On my knife.

                         MANAGER
            Sir, a young man saw you coming out
            of the bathroom.

                         BARRY
            I didn't do that.

BEAT.

                         BARRY
            Why? ...what?

                         MANAGER
            Your hand is bleeding.

                         BARRY
            I know.

                         MANAGER
            I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

                         BARRY
            Why?

                         MANAGER
            Sir, I have no way of proving that
            you demolished the bathroom --

                         BARRY
            I didn't do it.

                         MANAGER
            Alright, well you're gonna have to
            leave. You're gonna have to go.

                         BARRY
            Yeah, but I didn't do anything.

                         MANAGER
            I'm gonna call the police then, sir.

                         BARRY
            Please don't do this to me.

                         MANAGER
            The police are on their way.

                         BARRY
            Sorry.

He starts to move back....

                         BARRY
            Can I pay you here? Can I pay you
            for our drinks and salad?

                         MANAGER
            That's fine.

Barry takes out some money and hands it over.

                         BARRY
            Keep the change, please.

ANGLE, BACK AT THE TABLE.
They walk back to the table and Barry whispers down to her,
very close, STEADICAM (leads them out - continuous)

                         BARRY
            We should go I think, I don't like
            it here.

                         LENA
            Ok.

They head out of the restaraunt.

                         LENA
            Is everything ok?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         LENA
            What happened?

                         BARRY
            Nothing.

                         LENA
            What did he want?

                         BARRY
            Nothing.

They walk a bit.

                         BARRY
            I have a better idea of where we
            can go.

                         LENA
            Ok.

They walk some more.

                         BARRY
            There's a better place for us to eat.

                         LENA
            Did something happen; are you alright?

                         BARRY
            Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok.
            It's fine. Everything is fine.

They walk some more and get in the car.

                                            CUT TO:

INT. BARRY'S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

75mm OVER ONTO BARRY. 75mm OVER ONTO LENA. Rear process or
poor man's process.

                         LENA
            So....how is your harmonium doing?

Barry looks at her......

                         LENA
            Your portable reed organ....the piano.

                         BARRY
            Well, it's fine. Thank you.

                         LENA
            Did you pick it up from the street?

                         BARRY
            What?

                         LENA
            Did you take it from the street in
            front of your work?

                         BARRY
            ...yes I did...?

                         LENA
            Are you learning how to play it?

                         BARRY
            Yes? I'm trying.

                         LENA
            Oh that's great.

BEAT.

                         LENA
            So you must travel a lot with all
            that pudding you bought?

                         BARRY
            Yes no not really.

INT. LENA'S APARTMENT - LATER

Lena and Barry finishing up the date;

                         BARRY
            Ok....well...I'm gonna go.

                         LENA
            ...yeah...

                         BARRY
            It was nice to see you again, to
            see your face again, to go out with
            you --

                         LENA
            I'll be around and back in town in
            a few days --

                         BARRY
            Yeah.

                         LENA
            If you come to Hawaii --

                         BARRY
            Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about
            that.

                         LENA
            You don't think you'll go --

                         BARRY
            I don't know.

                         LENA
            Ok. Well call me when you get back,
            I mean, I'll call you when I get
            back. I'll be back for three weeks
            and then I go away for a month
            after that. So maybe in that time....

                         BARRY
            Ok. Have a good trip.

They do a shake hands/kiss on cheek goodbye.

INT. RECEPTION AREA/LENA'S BUILDING

Barry steps out of the elevator and walks to the exit,
passing a RECEPTION DESK WOMAN.....we hear the PHONE
RINGING......she calls out;

                         RECEPTION WOMAN
            Are you Barry?

                         BARRY
            Yes.

                         RECEPTION WOMAN
            It's for you.

Barry walks towards the phone;

                         BARRY
            This is Barry.

                         LENA (OC)
            This is Lena.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         LENA (OC)
            I just wanted you to know, wherever
            you're going or whatever you're
            doing right now I want you to know
            that I wanted to kiss you just then.

                         BARRY
            Really?

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            So what do I do then?

INT. MAZE OF CORRIDORS - MOMENTS LATER

Barry is walking up and around, looking for the spot. Two or
three shots of various, him getting a little/slightly
lost.....running/walking....

                                            CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA pushes down towards him as he walks towards the door.
He knocks, she opens up, CAMERA SLIDES right in and lands as
they KISS and then the kiss turns into a small hug and then
they talk, real close. HOLD.

                         BARRY
            That was good.

                         LENA
            Yeah.

                         BARRY
            I'll see you later.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY
            I don't freak out very often.

                         LENA
            What do you mean?

                         BARRY
            I don't, no matter what my sisters
            say, ok?

                         LENA
            ...I don't know what you mean....

                         BARRY
            I don't freak out.

                         LENA
            Ok.

                         BARRY

INT. BARRY'S APARTMENT/KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

CAMERA on Barry's trash can, the kitchen light comes
on....SLOW PUSH IN....He enters FRAME and lifts the trash
bag out.

EXT. BARRY'S APARTMENT - LATER

CAMERA is behind Barry now in a new location....he's walking
from his garage where he's just parked his car over to his
garbage area as he throws something out...

....he looks up and sees... Jim and Nate driving the Toyota
Pick Up Truck...he cruises past slowly....keeps going....then
makes a u-turn...Barry turns around and DAVID and MIKE D are
right there...

                         DAVID
            Hey.

                         BARRY
            Hi.

                         DAVID
            I need to talk to you for a second.

                         BARRY
            What?

                         DAVID
            You gotta give me some money.

Barry starts to walk away....David walks alongside him,
casually.....Barry looks over and sees the car has pulled
up....

                         DAVID
            You made a phone call and you said
            you'd help a girl out and then you
            didn't....I'm here to get the money.

                         BARRY
            Wait a minute --

                         DAVID
            No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't
            make it a thing --

                         BARRY
            Please don't do this.

                         DAVID
            It's just you need to give me the
            money...do you have it right now?

MIKE D violently PUSHES BARRY STRAIGHT TO THE GROUND.

                         BARRY

            How much money do you have in your
            pockets?

                         BARRY
            Just take it, take the money in my
            pockets, take it, it's fine --

They grab the money from his pockets as they hold him down
on the ground;

                         BARRY
            It's three hundred and twenty
            dollars, just take it.

                         DAVID
            What do you have in the house?

            nothing....that's the cash I have....

            You have an ATM?

                         BARRY

            Is this where you live?

                         BARRY

            You have another house somewhere or

            This is three hundred and twenty.
            Let's just go to your ATM and
            that'll be it --

                         BARRY
            I didn't promise her money. She
            said that it was confidential, this
            isn't fair --

Mike D pushes Barry's face.

                         MIKE D
            Shut up, be quiet. Be quiet.

            HEY. You made a fucking sex call
            and now you're gonna pay. It's not
            a big thing -- just give us some
            money and then it's over -- we'll
            just walk down to the ATM and get
            your money out --

                         BARRY
            Alright, alright.

They pick him up and then;

                         BARRY
            How do you want to do this?

                         MIKE D
            Let's just go to the corner, we saw
            a place on the corner, you'll just
            get your max out and that's it --

            Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you
            through to my supervisor.

            up. What's your problem?

                         BARRY
            I haven't even told you what's
            happened. Your girl that you have
            that works there for you threatened
            me and two men just chased me --
            extorted money --

            Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't
            have anything to do with me - this
            is a legitimate bossiness.

            DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --

They stop screaming. Then:

                         DEAN
            Now are you threatening me, dick?

                         BARRY
            You are bad. You are a bad person.
            you are a bad person and you have
            no right to take people's confidence
            in your service --

            You better watch your mouth, cunt,
            you're gonna get hurt.

                         BARRY
            NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.

                         DEAN
            I'll say whatever I want --

                         BARRY
            YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE
            I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER.
            YOU HURT HER.

                         DEAN
            You just told me to fuck off. That
            wasn't good. You're dead.

Dean hangs up the phone.

DEAN is in a back room, he's getting his hair cut by
LATISHA.....he turns and looks at Barry, who stands there

They stare at each other.

                         BARRY
            I'm a nice and reasonable man. I
            didn't do anything wrong. Please
            don't make me hurt you. And I'm
            telling you: that if you ever hurt
            me or if you hurt someone that I
            love.....I will hurt you many,
            many, many times over.....because
            it's not right to take people's trust.

                         DEAN
            You came all the way from Los
            Angeles to tell me that?

                         BARRY
            Yes I did.

Dean doesn't respond.

                         BARRY
            Can we agree that that is that?

                         DEAN
            That's that.

                         BARRY
            Thank you.

Barry hands him the phone.

Barry exits.....as he's about to go out the doors, Dean
screams;

                           for yourself. (To Kym) This is all

                           It was a mistake. I'm lucky I
                           didn't get fired. We've discussed
                           this. (She offers her hand) Good

              barely... so very, very faintly.
              Kym's dad, PAUL BUCHMAN, a tired, prosperous man in his late
              50's steps around the car and trots up the porch steps. He is
              wearing a big smile and his glasses are foggy. They hug. Kym
              talks rapidly over his shoulder...

                           you were going to abandon me in
                           rehab. It's 12:30. You guys are

              leaves.

              featuring a beautiful old church.

              The station wagon pulls into a CIRCULAR DRIVEWAY lined with
              trees and bushes of beautiful blue hydrangea. There are
              several late model cars parked in the driveway of the
              SPRAWLING, SHINGLED HOUSE. Young people crawling everywhere
              in the midst of WEDDING PREPARATION, wrapping garlands and
              hanging paper lanterns. A LITTLE GIRL tosses rose petals in
              the swimming pool. The atmosphere is slightly punch drunk and
              friendly.

          
              Paul unloads Kym's bags.

              Kym charges into the house where NORMAN SKLEAR and more
              friends of Rachel are decorating. They stare at her as she
              runs up the stairs to the second floor. CAMERA RUNS ALL THE

              WAY UP WITH HER.

          
              We hear...

              Kym slams open the master bedroom door and finds her older
              sister, RACHEL, trying on her wedding dress with the help of
              her best friend EMMA. Radiant and sexy, Rachel glows like an
              angel in her creamy white and gold sari. Emma has pins in her
              mouth and a tape measure around her neck.

              Rachel and Kym squeal and embrace. Rachel is slightly awkward
              as Emma frantically tries to keep the billowing fabric from
              combustion.

                           No seriously, you're so tiny it's
                           like you're Asian. Dad wants us to
                           sleep in the same room so you'll be
                           able to watch me while he's asleep
                           and I won't sneak out of the house
                           and blow dealers and shoot heroin.

                           Dad did not say "blow dealers."

              Kym laughs. A little too loud.

                           you're starting your drama already,
                           however it's Rachel's wedding and

              Kym flops on the bed and gazes adoringly at her sister for a
              moment. Rachel beams back.

              then flushes the butt down the toilet in the tiny bathroom.

              They collapse in laughter. Kym studies her ass in the mirror.

                           I should call her right this
                           second. Is she really coming? Who
                           are all these energetic young
                           people decorating the house?

               in the mirror. Kym bangs open the door of her stall with her

               The room breaks up. Kym struggles to rearrange the fallen
               chairs. She is pissed.

               PASTOR MEL, a guest speaker, shares details of his struggles
               inside the "12 Step" Process. Kym, like everyone present, is
               riveted.

               Sweaty and fed up with Carol's bike, Kym cycles into the
               Buchman driveway. Paul has been watching for her out the
               kitchen window while doing dishes. He waves and yells to his
               wife.

          

                                   PAUL
                         Carol, she's here!

                         I made you a sandwich, sweetheart!
                         Meatloaf!

          
               Kym's shoulders slump.

          
               Watching from an upstairs window, Rachel observes Kym wheel
               the bike up the driveway and Paul hurrying from the kitchen
               to meet her, carrying a meat loaf sandwich and a glass of
               milk. There is an awkward exchange of items. Paul hugs and
               mushes Kym and kisses her on the forehead.
               Rachel opens the window, calls down.

               Fiancee SIDNEY, sexy, compact, thirties, and best man KIERAN,
               are stringing lights all over the house and yard. Kieran is
               on a ladder. He is the same ATTRACTIVE GUY from the meeting.
               Sidney is completely wrapped, chest to knees, in twinkly
               white lights and he unspools himself as needed. Rachel
               arrives with Kym who is holding the aircraft carrier sized
               meatloaf sandwich that's oozing lettuce and ketchup and the
               enormous glass of milk. She holds them both like they're
               suspended in formaldehyde. Emma is working on her tan.

               Kym and Kieran, having SEX in the cavernous basement. It
               runs practically the length of the house and there are nooks
               and caves everywhere. An ancient sofa, riddled with
               cigarette burns, some futons, dragged down and thrown
               haphazardly in corners, Unicorn posters hideously and
               pornographically defaced, and squat jars of ancient household
               products (Oil of Olay, self tanner) filled with cigarette
               butts offer proof of years of inhabitation.

                            I wasn't sure if you'd have time
                            for a fitting.

                            Bullshit. It's a sari. You take a
                            bolt of cloth and wrap it around
                            you. Jesus Christ I've been home
                            one day and I can't get a straight
                            answer out of anybody.

                            I'm talking about Dad offering me
                            food every ten seconds...

                            No. He has to know where I am and
                            what I'm doing all the time because
                            he has never resolved his own trust

               The girls clamber up. Kym brushes curry off Rachel's shirt.
               ABBY, the girl's mom, and ANDREW, her husband, enter the
               dining room. Abby is a beautiful, wise woman in her fifties.
               Elegant, ladylike and graceful.
               Andrew looks foxy in his Abby-selected Armani, but he has the
               shoulders and knuckles of a heavyweight. As the girls
               approach, Abby acknowledges Paul across the room but makes no
               move to go beyond an exchange of long distance little waves
               and tight smiles.

               shoulders.

               Abby steps towards her daughters, taking them in.

                            He personifies many of life's
                            grandest cliches, even as he
                            breathes fresh life into most of
                            them. He has never, ever "ceased to
                            amaze me," and only in the best of
                            ways. The magnitude of his artistry
                            and his business acumen are matters
                            of public record and delight. He's
                            been a great friend "through thick
                            and thin," and sometimes it's
                            gotten very, very thin -- but he
                            "stood by me" at all times, so it
                            is my privilege and honor to stand
                            by him on this profound occasion...

                            Well I would like to share with
                            everyone that Miss Rachel-before
                            she got her license or even had any
                            idea how to drive- out maneuvered
                            an irate, screaming cab driver
                            across 96th street to the East
                            river, handily avoiding two EMT
                            guys loading an old lady on a
                            gurney, while at the same time,
                            applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the
                            rearview mirror.

          
               Bravos all around.

                            Wait, wait. She actually got the
                            number of one of the E.M.T guys and
                            went out with him. Twice.

                            Anyway, when the taxi driver
                            finally caught up with us, Rachel
                            talked him down from his Middle
                            Eastern fury in pretend Farsi, and
                            ended up using his radio thing to
                            call his dispatcher and recommend
                            this guy for a commendation.

                            So I spent a lot of time calling up
                            people who barely remembered me -
                            who barely remembered anything -
                            and apologizing to them for
                            bouncing a check or passing out in
                            the bathtub and flooding their
                            house, or otherwise involving them
                            in sordid activities they were
                            desperately trying to forget. I had
                            to call this one girl who was, I
                            think, fourteen, but I couldn't
                            talk to her because her Mom took
                            out a restraining order.

          
               Kym thinks this is hysterical. Paul does not.

                            to people who were practically
                            strangers so I very much want to

                            to apologize to my extraordinary

                            Rachel. I've been a nightmare and
                            you've been a saint. I'm so damned
                            glad I'm here with you and Sidney
                            and his family and ours, and I am
                            so happy for you guys, I really am.
                            So, I am hereby raising my seltzer
                            in celebration of my laudatory
                            sister and herewith making amends.
                            Sidney, you are robbing our
                            dysfunctional family of one of it's

                            You're so cynical. Dad, since when

                            An effort. That's what it was?
                            Because I think she presumes that
                            since everything has always
                            revolved around her disease,

                            people to understand? It's like
                            you're not happy unless I'm in some
                            kind of desperate situation. You

                            unless I'm desperate. God. Why am I
                            the only one who's willing to say

               Dead silence. Everyone stares at Rachel. Rachel looks at
               Sidney. Sidney passes the look right back to her.

               Paul hugs Rachel and kisses her hair. Sidney and Kieran hug.
               Emma hugs Rachel and kisses Sidney. Hugging all around. Kym
               is pissed. Paul grabs Kym and Rachel, and hugs both daughters
               at once. Rachel and Kym's faces are mushed right next to each
               other. Kym is impatient and stiff in the dreaded double mush.

          
               Kym breaks from Paul's vice-like grip.

               Kieran and Kym lie entangled in the basement, sharing a
               cigarette, disheveled. The floor of this entire section of
               the basement is now covered with all of the carefully
               arranged mattresses and futons that were stacked down here
               before. All of Kym's mismatched bags have been moved down
               here too. There's a little lamp there now as well but it's
               not on. Only one of the small, cobwebby windows casts a
               dappled light onto the scene.

                            That was such a set-up.

                            She probably didn't realize she was
                            doing it.

                                      KYM
                            Ha! She's such an operator. Now I'm
                            the bad guy again. Or still.

                                      KIERAN
                            They're lucky to have you.

                                      KYM
                            Thank you! Otherwise they'd have to
                            pay attention to their own
                            suspicious lives. Nobody actually
                            wants me to actually change, you
                            know. What would they obsess about?
                            I'm like a blessing.

                            Dad had an actual "Blueprint for

                            intervention. On graph paper. He
                            goes all out with the response, my

                            friend of mine actually rang the
                            door once and tells my mother, "Kym
                            is sitting in her apartment? With
                            the shades drawn? Doing all this
                            heroin and cocaine? And I think
                            she's going to, like, die?" And Mom
                            smiles and says "Thank you" like he
                            was speaking in Sanskrit.

                            Sanskrit.

                            Exactly! I nodded out into the
                            poached salmon at Dad's wedding two
                            years ago and he told Carol he
                            thought it was jet lag.

                            I did that in soup once. It made

               basement giving Kieran a guided tour of the subterranean
               world of which she was the ruler and where Ethan was her
               loyal companion -- the secret hide-and-seek rooms, the
               mattress room, the scary little side rooms, etc...

                         Look how exquisite this is. I can't
                         borrow this. What do you carry in
                         here? A vital organ? A tiny spleen?

          36   EXT./INT. SCOTTY'S JAMAICAN RESTAURANT. DAY.              36

          
               A neighborhood place, but on the other side of the parkway
               from the Buchmans' neighborhood. Friendly, bustling, kids on
               bikes and skateboards, etc. Large windows offer a view of a
               stop sign, Fanny's Beauty Salon, Soul to Soul Liquor, a
               barber shop, etc.

               The restaurant is fluorescently lit, with a Jamaican flag on
               the wall and photos of Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, and Bob
               Marley. There is a counter at the front where you place your
               order and pick up your food. There is a Foosball table, and a
               pinball machine.

          
               Kym and Kieran are playing Foosball at the ancient table
               where someone has painted Jamaican jerseys on all the
               players. They are both viciously competitive and genuinely
               irritated with each other.

                            So?

                            So we have to do it over now. It
                            was your shot and you get to do it
                            over.

                            having one hand on the turf makes
                            the play null.

                            Sometimes playing next to each
                            other is easier than playing
                            together.

                            He's very possessive. We're working
                            through it.

                            Yes. I may be a degenerate dope
                            fiend but I love my horse. I don't
                            have a wife or a girlfriend and
                            I've been clean almost seven years.
                            You could just ask, you know. Your
                            sister doesn't ask direct questions
                            either. She's incredibly cryptic.

                            Percoset. I was unbelievably high.

                            He had thrown away his shoes- and I
                            was like "Mom's going to kill me"
                            because I had no idea where his
                            shoes were- but he was so happy
                            about it. And he had his red socks
                            and he was running around kicking
                            up the leaves. You know in movies
                            where they show a person's high or
                            whatever and the camera careens all
                            around? It was like that. But fun.
                            You know. We were having so much
                            fun. We were leaping around in huge
                            piles of leaves. He buried me. I
                            buried him in a big pile. I was on
                            baby sitting detail. He was
                            pretending he was a train. So he
                            was charging through the leaf pile,
                            making tracks, you know? I was the
                            caboose. And he kept going "Coal,
                            caboose! Coal caboose!" So it's
                            time to go and we're driving home
                            and he's in his car seat still
                            demanding coal, and I couldn't
                            focus and I drove off the bridge.
                            The car went into the lake. I
                            couldn't get him out of his car
                            seat. He drowned.

               Paul, Rachel, Emma, Sidney, and Norman Sklear are sprawled on
               the porch eating sandwiches and figuring out the seating
               arrangement for the wedding by manipulating tiny origami
               chickens, a tiny turtle, Monopoly pieces, spools of thread,
               etc...each with a small name tag.

                            Cookie Puss and the Chicago cousins
                            because they always get really

                            about 10% more stuff in the

                            I find it touching but ultimately
                            sad when the warriors of yesteryear
                            are reluctant to lay down their
                            plastic containers from Zabar's and
                            retire gracefully.

               Kym yanks open a cupboard and passes a handful of dishes to
               Paul. He begins to load them.

               He has a bowl in his hands. We see the bowl is a plastic
               child's bowl with Engines and Cabooses all over it. Paul
               turns the bowl around in his hands like a steering wheel.

          
               It dawns on Kym that she's handed her father Ethan's bowl.
               She is stricken.
               Paul looks to Carol. He seems bewildered. The kitchen falls
               silent and Carol takes Ethan's bowl and places it in the
               sink, out of sight. She leads Paul gently out of the kitchen.

               and Norman Sklear step out onto the porch.
               Kieran takes the Ethan bowl from the sink and puts it quietly
               back in the cupboard and shuts the door. Kym doesn't know
               what to do.

               tries to light a cigarette.

                         ceremony. It's a way of honoring

                         It will look really nice too,
                         mainly. Millions of little candles
                         all over the place, and one huge
                         rice paper candle - representing
                         Ethan - glowing near the couple.

               Kym and Rachel have foils in their hair, situated a few
               chairs apart. Rachel is intently working on a crossword

               Kym glances back at her magazine to discover one of the

               Kym does a little double-take.

                            I found it so profoundly
                            inspirational that you could be
                            there for her during your own
                            incredible ordeal. I thank God that
                            you came in here today. I never
                            thought I'd ever have the chance to
                            thank you. It was your strength
                            that gave me the courage to
                            confront my own abuse and help me
                            turn my life around.
               Rachel slams down her magazine and leaves the salon. Kym runs
               after her. Both girls have foils in their hair.

               Rachel is being trailed by her sister through the parking
               lot.

               Rachel doesn't stop. She is searching for her keys in the
               fading daylight. Kym catches up, takes Rachel's arm.

          

                                   RACHEL

               Rachel yanks open the car door, jumps in.

               Rachel, yanking the foils out of her hair, perches on the
               sofa next to Carol and Paul. She is furious.

                            It was an accident.

                            Yes! I was stoned out of my mind!
                            Jesus Christ, who do I have to be
                            now? Mother Theresa? Did I use up
                            all the love I'm allowed for this
                            lifetime because I killed our
                            little brother?

          

                                      PAUL
                            No, it was an accident!

                            I'm sorry! I'm sorry, okay? I'm
                            sorry!

          
               Paul bursts out weeping.

                            It was an accident.
               Kym, her hair still in foils, rushes out of the house.

          
               Carol turns to Rachel. Rachel bolts upstairs. Carol turns to
               Paul. Paul waves her away. Carol is bawling too.

               A STATE TROOPER, sitting in his patrol car, looks up from his
               coffee as Paul's Mercedes station wagon screeches into a
               nearby parking space. The cop watches Kym get out of the car
               and stalk into the 7/11.

               Steam rises from the surface of Abby's high-tech and
               sumptuous bathtub, as she quickly turns the water off and
               speaks into her cell phone.

                         Hello Abby. It's Paul.

          
               INTERCUT the conversation:

          

                                   ABBY
                         Hello Paul.

          

                                   PAUL
                         Is Kym with you?

                                   ABBY
                         No. Why? Did she go somewhere?

                                   PAUL
                         She left the house about an hour
                         ago.

                                   ABBY
                         To a meeting?

                         She and Rachel had an argument.

                                   ABBY
                         Oh, dear. The night before her
                         wedding? What was it about?

                                   PAUL
                         Look, Abby, it doesn't matter. She
                         left the house. She took the car.

          

                                   ABBY
                         What was the argument about?

                         I don't know. They were both

                            saying?

                            For god's sake Abby! I'm trying to
                            figure out where she went before I
                            call the police!

                                      ABBY
                            Well, last time you called the
                            police looking for her she was
                            upstairs, asleep in the guest room.

          

                                      PAUL
                            She wasn't asleep, she was
                            unconscious! And I'm glad I called
                            the police because it took twenty
                            minutes to wake her up and at least
                            something was being done!

                            You're trying to dismiss
                            everything!

                            You're disregarding everything I'm
                            saying, and this failure to listen,
                            failure to understand what is right
                            in front of you is exactly why you
                            will never be able...

                         Excuse me, but when you're trying
                         to get better there's a lot of
                         pressure in rehabs... when someone
                         isn't ready to take responsibility
                         they create something, like an
                         Uncle Stan, to take responsibility
                         until they're ready.

                         and look for her?

          53   INT. ABBY'S/ANDREW'S HOUSE. NIGHT.                           53
               Abby is in her kitchen preparing tea, dressed in loose-
               fitting yoga-style PJs, hair still wet from her bath. A door
               opens behind her and Kym emerges from the bathroom rubbing
               her hands over her face.

          

                                       KYM
                            Ahhh....

          

                                      ABBY
                            You should call your father.

          
               The air seems to go out of Kym for a moment.

                                      KYM
                            In a minute. I need a glass of
                            water.

                                      ABBY
                            I've made some tea.

          
               Abby picks up the tray, leading the way from the kitchen into
               the living room. Trailing behind her, Kym looks around her
               mother's unfamiliar house -- the spaciousness and stark
               modernity of Andrew's house stand in marked contrast to the
               rampant folksy-ness of the Buchman house.

          

          

          

          

                                                                 (CONTINUED)

               Abby places the tea service on a low table in front of a
               sprawling sofa in the stone-walled living room.

          

                                      ABBY
                            Here darling. Sit down. You look
                            upset.

          
               Kym sits, pours and sips. Abby remains standing and tightens
               the belt of her bathrobe.

          

                                      KYM
                            When will Andrew be back?

          

                                      ABBY
                            Not too late. He's at a dinner.

          
               Beat.

                                      ABBY
                            I spoke to grandma today. She sends
                            her love. Is everything all right
                            with the wedding?

          

                                      KYM
                            Yes.

          

                                      ABBY
                            Good.

                            Dad was loading the dishwasher...

                            And I handed him Ethan's bowl with
                            the trains on it by accident.

          
               Kym begins to weep. Abby remains still. Kym's weeping becomes
               louder and louder. She is having trouble breathing.
               Just as Abby reaches out to touch her...

          

                                      KYM
                            Why did you leave me in charge of
                            him?
               Abby stops.

                            I was a crazy drug addict. I stole
                            from you. I lied to your face. I
                            weighed six pounds and my hair was
                            falling out. I spent every dinner
                            in the bathroom.

          

                                      ABBY
                            You were sick.

                                      KYM
                            You know what I was. It's not like
                            there weren't any clues. I stayed
                            in my room for days. I passed out
                            all the time. Where were you, Mom!
                            What were you thinking? Why did you
                            leave me? Why did you leave me in
                            charge of him?
               Abby closes her fists and beats Kym with all her strength.

                                      ABBY
                            You weren't supposed to kill him!
                            You weren't supposed to kill him!
               Kym curls up protectively and Abby suddenly stops.

          

                                        KYM
                            Mom?

          
               Abby swings at Kym again and connects.
               Kym punches Abby right back -- twice -- now she is on her
               feet.
               Both women stop, terrified, and look at each other.

          
               Kym moves toward her mother.

               Kym stops. Keeping her back to the door she backs out of her
               mother's house.

               Kym falls down the front steps. Her nose is bleeding and her
               eye starts to swell. Where are the car keys? Here they are.
               Where is the door handle? Here it is. She drives off.

               Windshield wipers. It's not raining. A curve in the road,
               squealing around it. The road forks twenty yards ahead, woods
               in between. Left or right? Kym drives straight ahead,
               careening off the road, smashing down a couple of saplings,
               losing speed, right fender smashing into a big rock --
               AIRBAGS blast up into Kym's face -- airbag deflates, Kym's
               head falls forward, bangs against the steering wheel. A tiny
               moan. That's it.

               The station wagon has come to a halt far off the road,
               concealed by undergrowth and trees in the foreground. There
               is no movement in the car. A Volvo station wagon drives by,
               continuing on its way.

               Paul and Sidney are drinking red wine, Kieran something else.
               An empty bottle is in front of them and Sidney is uncorking a
               fresh one.

                         running around with their tummies
                         sticking out in their diapers. They
                         used to bite me on the nose, the
                         two of them.

                            I'd hold both of them in the pool

                            nose. Ethan never did that. He
                            preferred pinkies. Or knuckles...

               laughter, pours some more wine.

               Rachel and Emma are curled up in the middle of the bed, spoon-
               style, with clothes still on. Emma is behind Rachel, lost to
               the world, gently snoring. Rachel's eyes are wide open.
               Carol swings the door cautiously open and peers inside.
               Rachel and Carol look at each other for a long time. Carol
               withdraws, closing the door behind her.

               Kym jolts awake as a STAMFORD POLICEMAN raps on her closed
               window. She is a mess. A black eye. A split, bloody lip. A
               gash across her forehead.

          
               The cop is simultaneously gesturing for her to roll her
               window down and speaking into his radio.

          
               Kym tries to start the car. No luck.

          
               The cop bangs on the window.
               Kym leans her head against the steering wheel. The horn
               starts blowing.

          
               The joggers, a couple of early dogwalkers, and a couple of
               kids on bikes are gathered by the roadside, whispering and
               watching.

               NOW -- The cop is studying Kym's license and registration.
               NOW -- An AMBULANCE has arrived. Red lights flashing.

          
               The crowd of onlookers has swelled considerably.

          
               NOW -- The cop gives a clearly upset Kym a Breathalyzer test
               as PARAMEDICS wrap a pressure cuff around her arm -- she
               exhales into the Breathalyzer tube, her eyes darting between
               the cop, the cracked windshield of the car and the gawking
               crowd up on the road.

          
               TIME CUT -- The paramedic holds Kym firmly by the chin
               and peers deeply into her right eye. The other paramedic
               blots at Kym's swollen lip with a gauze and hands her an ice
               pack.

          
               TIME CUT -- The cop gives Kym her license and hands her

          64   EXT. THE BUCHMAN HOUSE. DAY.                                 64

                                                                                   
               A truck towing the beat-up station wagon comes to a halt in
               the street in front of the Buchman house. Kym steps down from       
               the passenger seat, ignoring whatever the driver just said in       
               parting.                                                            
               The house is festooned with peonies and lights and WORKERS          
               hurrying about. Everything looks absolutely beautiful.              
               CATERERS are running from their vans into the house with            
               armloads of food, drinks, etc. Abby's flowers are being             
               unloaded from another van. Decorative chandeliers are being         
               carried inside.                                                     
               VALETS are setting up their car-parking operation (a                
               decorated picnic table) at the foot of the driveway.                

          
               Kym squares her shoulders and begins her long walk up to the        
               Buchman house, back into the chaos.                                 
               A CUTE VALET passes Kym on the lawn, carrying two paper cups        
               of coffee, dressed in an Indian military tunic. He takes in         
               Kym's disheveled and bruised appearance.

               Kym continues her walk toward the house.

               Kym runs onto the porch as a group of GOFERS carry more of

               sari but not her earrings.

               Kym in her dress with her striped hair, split lip and black
               eye, trying to find her game face. The wedding guests are
               slack-jawed. Mrs. Williams (Sidney's mom) looks like she's
               passing a stone.

          
               Abby stands quietly with Andrew in the first row. She looks
               composed and lovely and has the tiniest hint of a bruise on
               her chin.
               The procession reaches the altar and the wedding party turns
               to face Rachel and Paul.
               Paul is beaming, walking his beautiful daughter from the side
               of the house and across the terrace to the living room. She
               glows in her white and gold Sari.

          
               They reach the altar of blossoms. Rachel kisses her dad's
               cheek and he hugs her. Things are set up so that Rachel and
               Sidney stand just inside the living room, facing the
               beautiful backyard.
               Kym reaches for Rachel's bouquet but Rachel has handed it to
               Emma by reflex. Kym tries to cover her gesture.
               Rachel and Sidney join hands.

                            Exactly.
               Everybody cracks up, especially Kym. She laughs a beat longer
               than anybody else.

               Rachel and Sidney are saying their vows.

                            I always just wanted to hear music,
                            and when I met you I heard you. You
                            are the most beautiful thing I've
                            ever heard. Thanks for marrying me.

               Rachel is crying. Sidney takes his pocket square and
               carefully dries her tears.

          
               Abby is drying her own eyes.

                                                                                 
               Rachel makes her own declaration to Sidney.
               Norman Sklear hands Sidney an acoustic guitar and Sidney
               strums it and plucks a delicate melody.

               Rachel licks the frosting off Sidney's finger then gives his
               mom a big wholesome smile.

          
               Mrs. Williams shakes her head but she's okay with this.

               She drags Paul to the temporary poolside patio dance floor.       
               Paul is a fantastic dancer! Sidney drags his dad to the dance
               floor. He's dramatic and weird! Abby smiles politely at Kym
               and goes to sit down with Andrew. Kieran spirits Kym to the
               patio, where they join the dancers.

               Everybody is spruced and rested. Rachel and Sidney have
               changed into awesome party outfits.

               currently laying down an evocative, hypnotic and extremely

               The tent is fairly packed now with about 60-SOME ODD PEOPLE.
               Everybody is getting along fine. With a single dramatic
               gesture, Norman Sklear silences the band. Upon Norman's
               instructions, the drummer works his cymbals in such a way
               that the party-goers realize that something big is about to
               happen. Norman Sklear now gestures for complete silence and
               he gets it.
               Rachel and Emma grin madly at each other.

               CARNIVAL GIRLS COMPLETE WITH HEADDRESSES AND FEATHERS DANCE

               bang on drums. The cafe-au-lait beauties gyrate and pull
               guests out of their chairs.

          
               Rachel leaps from her chair into Sidney's arms and he gives
               her a huge, sexy kiss as he rubs her tummy. Wedding guests
               scream with delight and rush to the floor.
               The drummers become more   impassioned with every beat. They
               travel allover the dance   floor, a trail of guests behind
               them. Sweat is dripping,   the girls are glistening wet, the
               guests are pulled into a   massive pulsing heartbeat on the
               dance floor.
               Emma, Kayra and Victoria are dancing together screaming until
               Cousin Joseph, Matt and another male friend muscle their way
               in.

          
               Little kids swing each other around in circles.

          
               Rachel and Sidney are practically doing it on the dance
               floor. A Brazilian beauty shimmies over to them, her
               headdress bobbing, her smile enormous.

               Sidney immediately puts his head on her bosom. After a beat
               Rachel does too, laughing.

               Carol stands quietly besides Paul and takes his hand and
               whispers to him. Though not dancing, they are clearly
               enjoying the carnival. Paul gives a little shimmy.
               Abby and Andrew are huddled together at a table, talking
               intensely. It's like they are blind to the spectacle.
               Kieran offers his hand to Kym. She leaps up, spilling her
               flowers. Kieran pulls her to the middle of the crowd. They
               circle each other. They come together almost violently and
               dance like there's no tomorrow. Kym's head is thrown back.
               Shoulders heaving, Kieran swings her around by the waist.

               The brown, glittering dancers are shaking thisclose to the
               drummers who have their shirts off.

          
               A dancer rocks with an older gentleman who gulps oxygen from
               a tank.

          
               Rachel and Sidney are bathed in sweat, kissing. Sidney is
               gulping champagne.

          
               Kieran and Kym have their foreheads together and their eyes
               closed, chests heaving.

               The exotic tent looks beautiful out there in the sprawling
               backyard, reflections of the POOL LIGHTS shimmering off its
               sides. The whole backyard is enchanted -- with magically
               deployed twinkle lights, Japanese lanterns and other special
               lighting effects adding to the aura...

          
               "Rachel Loves Sidney" is being played in a mellow, super-
               romantic trumpet solo mode now by Christian Scott.

          
               An assorted bunch of guests have relocated to the poolside
               patio in their finery. The oxygen guy and his matronly wife
               are seated on a transplanted living room couch, talking
               intently to a be-feathered headdressed Dancer.
               Norman Sklear and Emma are sharing a stylish, quietly
               triumphant slow dance, whispering punctuated by gusts of
               laughter. Angela Paylin is out there too.
               Little kids are running around the lawn and a few are playing
               with OLIVE the Dog.
               Kym kneels at the far corner of the swimming pool, unnoticed
               by anyone. A wooden serving tray floats on the surface of the
               water, supporting a candle wrapped in rice paper. A couple of
               smaller candles surround the slightly larger one. Kym lights
               the candles, extinguishes the match, gently slides the
               illuminated tray out towards the center of the pool, watches.
               Kym rises and walks towards the house, looking for something.

               The girl throws a rebellious dance move in Kym's direction.

               The girl laughs and runs off.

               where she finds Rachel and Sidney slow dancing alone and
               dreamy in the center of the darkened room, the walls still
               covered with the ceremonial flowers. A single candle flickers
               nearby.

          
               The dancers are oblivious to Kym's presence.

                            Hi. Where's Mom?

          
               Rachel has her head on Sidney's shoulder, her eyes closed.

                            How can you take a break from your
                            own daughter's wedding?

                                      RACHEL
                            Mom doesn't actually participate in
                            things.

                            And anyway, she hasn't even done
                            anything all day.

                            I was thinking about getting her a
                            cat. Cats are really annoying. At
                            some point you have to deal with
                            them, right? Or they starve to
                            death and piss on your sheets.

               Suddenly Kieran sweeps into the room.

                            You can run but you can't hide!
               Kym shrieks as Kieran grabs her and plants a wet one on her,
               dipping her to the floor. They careen into Sidney and Rachel.
               Sidney grabs Rachel and starts molesting her.

               Rachel and Sidney fall to the floor writhing, sounding way

                            Logistically it's just a dream. You
                            could stay in your old room. I
                            could chauffeur you around. You
                            wouldn't have to worry about rent.

                            Have you already talked to Carol
                            about me staying here?

                                      PAUL
                            Of course. She's fine about it. You
                            could stay in your old room.

                            Monday, okay?
               She hands Kym a business card and kisses Paul on the cheek.

          

                                      SUSANNA
                            Goodbye Paul. It was just
                            beautiful. Bye Kym.
               She leaves.

                            I meant stupid. Do you want me to
                            hold that for you? You've got no
                            pockets.

                            I've got it. Thanks, Dad. I'll be

               At the edge of the porch Kym sees Abby standing in the
               moonlight at the front of the driveway with Andrew, waiting
               for their car. Kym pauses.
               Abby turns her head slightly in Kym's direction.

          
               Kym, in the half dark, watches her mother.

          
               Abby does not move a muscle.

          
               Kym steps off the porch.
               The valet pulls up in the car, jumps out.

               The Absolute End of a Wedding. The place is a gorgeous mess
               of wedding detritus.

          
               The tent looks so lonely. A weary caterer packs away his
               trays.

          
               Kieran is talking and smoking with Sidney at the end of the
               lawn.

               A freshly scrubbed Kym, in her own clothes, takes a moment in
               Ethan's room. She collects a few snapshots of her sister and
               brother and stuffs them in her shoulder bag.

               As Kym approaches the stairs, Emma staggers into the hallway,
               bleary-eyed. She is in her underwear, heading for the
               bathroom. She stops at the sight of Kym. They stare at each
               other. Emma gives a tiny wave. Kym responds, heads down the
               stairs.

               weird mish-mash of bags waiting by the door.

          
               Kieran is there.

               Kym looks back in through the window, sees her father awake,
               in his robe, tired, gamely tidying.

               A `98 maroon CAMRY is idling in the circular driveway out
               front, exhaust vaporizing against the chilly morning air. A
               cute two-year-old girl is visible in a carseat and Rosa, the
               staff nurse from Kym's halfway house, is at the wheel. The
               car radio plays quietly as Kym opens the passenger door,
               wiggling her finger at the little girl.
               Like a ghost, Rachel appears on the porch.

          
               Kym jumps a little.

          
               The sisters lock eyes.
               Kym looks pained. Paul is still moving around in there. She
               wants to go.
               Rachel floats down the porch stairs and joins her sister at
               the car.
               She takes in Rosa who meets Rachel's look with a nod.

          

                                      ROSA
                         Hi.

               Rachel nods. Kym is crying.

                                   KYM
                         I love your baby!

                         Me too.

          
               Rachel hugs her sister fiercely.
               Kym gets into the passenger seat but leaves the car door
               open.

          
               Rachel smiles her huge, luminous smile.
               Kym shuts the car door and rolls down the window.

               The car pulls out of the driveway, Carol watching it go from
               the dining room window.

          Based on the novel by Bernhard Schlink
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY. CREDITS
          
          1995. A modern apartment, all cool and glass. MICHAEL BERG is
          preparing breakfast, laying the table for two. He is 51, dark-
          haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate
          quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom
          to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an
          egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a
          sparkling clean plate.
          
          MICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the
          sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can,
          turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and
          BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger. The
          credits end.
          
                              BRIGITTE
                    You didn't wake me.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You were sleeping.
          
                              BRIGITTE
                    You let me sleep because you can't
                    bear to have breakfast with me.
          
          It's half-serious. MICHAEL doesn't react.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Nothing could be further from the
                    truth. I boiled you an egg. See?
          
          MICHAEL produces a second boiled egg in a cup, seemingly from
          nowhere, like a magician, and puts it on the table.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'd hardly have boiled you an egg
                    if I didn't want to see you. Tea or
                    coffee?
          
          BRIGITTE has re-appeared from the bedroom, now in a dressing
          gown. She's still half-serious.
          
                              BRIGITTE
                    Does any woman ever stay long
                    enough to find out what the hell
                    goes on in your head?
          
          MICHAEL smiles to himself.
          
                              BRIGITTE
                    What are you doing tonight?
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm seeing my daughter.
          
                              BRIGITTE
                    Your daughter? You've kept very
                    quiet about her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Have I? She's been abroad for a
                    year. Did you say tea?
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY
          
          MICHAEL kisses BRIGITTE on the cheek as she departs.
          
                              BRIGITTE
                    I'm going. Give my love to your
                    daughter.
          
          He closes the door, then turns to the open door of the
          bedroom. He looks at the mess of last night's love-making.
          Then he goes to the window and looks out. A yellow U-Bahn
          goes by.
          
          INT. TRAM. DAY.
          
          December 1958. MICHAEL, now 15, is sitting on a tram. He is
          in a well-cut suit he's inherited, ill-fitting, with two-tone
          shoes and tangled mop of hair. Sweat breaks out all over his
          face. A WOMAN is staring at him. He's plainly feeling ill.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          1995. MICHAEL stands at the window, looking out.
          
          INT. TRAM. DAY
          
          1958. Impulsively MICHAEL gets up, rings the bell and gets
          off at the next stop.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          1995. MICHAEL closes the window.
          
          EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
          
          1958. It has come on to rain. MICHAEL is walking along the
          street, looking more and more sickly. There is an archway
          leading to a courtyard, and impulsively he darts inside to
          get out of the rain. He begins to vomit. Opposite him is a
          wood workshop open to the yard. A uniformed TRAM CONDUCTRESS
          walks past.
          
                                                                    3.
          
          
          MICHAEL'S body is turned away, his face invisible, his hand
          over his mouth. She puts down her ticket machine on the
          pavement and seizes him by the arm.
          
                                HANNA
                    Hey. Hey!
          
          HANNA SCHMITZ has ash-blonde hair and is in her mid-thirties.
          She disappears. He's sick again. She reappears with a bucket
          of water to sluice down the pavement. She wipes his face down
          with a wet cloth. Then she fills another bucket.
          
                              HANNA
                    Hey, kid. Hey.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
          
          Effortlessly, HANNA takes MICHAEL in her arms. She holds his
          head against her breasts. MICHAEL buries himself and slowly
          he stops sobbing. Then he lifts his head.
          
                              HANNA
                    Where do you live?
          
          EXT. STREET. DAY
          
          HANNA and MICHAEL walk at a fair pace along a street, dotted
          with the scaffolding of new building. HANNA is carrying his
          satchel, she is pulling him by the arm.
          
          EXT. BLUMENSTRASSE. DAY
          
          They come up the road. It is now snowing. MICHAEL stops
          outside his block, as if nervous she might come in.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's here. I'll be fine now. Thank
                    you.
          
                              HANNA
                    Look after yourself.
          
          MICHAEL smiles `Thank you' and goes in. HANNA is left alone.
          She looks round, frowning, then sets off, stopping
          uncertainly at the crossroads to check for the way she came.
          MICHAEL turns and watches, curious at her indecision.
          
          INT. BERG APARTMENT. BLUMENSTRASSE. NIGHT
          
          CARLA BERG is at the stove in the kitchen. She takes dinner
          through for the BERG family, at a round table in a
          traditional apartment, under a five-candled brass chandelier.
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          MICHAEL'S father, PETER, is a balding, abstracted man, eating
          in oppressive silence. Next to him, his older brother THOMAS,
          18, his older sister, ANGELA, and his younger sister, EMILY.
          MICHAEL has his book in front of him, not touching his food.
          
                              CARLA
                    I'm worried about him. He looks
                    terrible.
          
                              PETER
                    The boy's saying he doesn't need a
                    doctor.
          
                                 EMILY
                    He does.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I don't need a doctor.
          
                                 PETER
                    Good then.
          
          CARLA looks reproachful.
          
                                 CARLA
                    Peter.
          
                              PETER
                    We're not going to argue about
                    this. People have to take
                    responsibility for their own lives.
          
          INT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is lying in a single bed, his face violently
          inflamed. CARLA is with the DOCTOR, a much older man.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Remind me, how old are you now?
          
                              CARLA
                    Michael's fifteen.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    It's scarlet fever. He'll be in bed
                    for several months. At least.
          
          MICHAEL turns into the pillow, a wet patch beneath his head.
          Delusional with fever, he senses a presence at the door. He
          turns. It's EMILY. But at once CARLA's arm pulls her away.
          
                              CARLA
                    Keep away. He's contagious.
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
          
          They vanish. The door closes. In the corridor the DOCTOR is
          heard.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Burn the sheets. Complete
                    isolation. And three months is the
                    minimum.
          
          INT & EXT. BERG APARTMENT. DAY
          
          1959. A sunny day in March. MICHAEL's bed has been moved
          beside open windows so he can profit from the weak sun. He is
          sitting up, working on his stamp collection. CARLA is moving
          round behind him, tidying the room.
          
                              CARLA
                    How are you feeling?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Better. By the way, I meant to tell
                    you, the day I got ill... a woman
                    helped me. A woman in the street.
          
                              CARLA
                    She helped you?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yes. She brought me home.
          
                              CARLA
                    Do you have her address?
          
          EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is standing holding a small bunch of flowers. He is
          looking puzzled at a row of bells with numbers only. The
          woodyard is busy. WORKMEN come out of the building.
          
          INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL comes up the stairwell, once grand, now in decay -
          green linoleum and faded red paint. The sound of a
          sentimental song at the open door of a small apartment.
          Inside, HANNA is ironing in a sleeveless smock, blue with red
          flowers. Her hair is fastened in a clip. She looks at him a
          moment.
          
                               HANNA
                    Come in.
          
                                                                   6.
          
          
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          The flat is without decoration, an enfilade of small rooms. A
          stove, a sink, a tub, a boiler, a table, a few wooden chairs.
          There is no window, just a balcony door to let light into the
          room. HANNA carries on ironing.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    I brought you these flowers. To say
                    thank you.
          
                              HANNA
                    Put them down there.
          
          MICHAEL puts them beside the sink. HANNA has a blanket and a
          cloth over the table : nothing disturbs her rhythm, as she
          irons one piece of laundry after another, then folds it and
          puts it over one of the chairs.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I would have come earlier, but I've
                    been in bed for three months.
          
                              HANNA
                    You're better now?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Thank you.
          
                              HANNA
                    Have you always been weak?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Oh no. I'd never been ill before.
                    It's incredibly boring. There's
                    nothing to do. I couldn't even be
                    bothered to read.
          
          HANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with
          the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers.
          He watches her bare arms moving back and forth. She looks
          broad-planed, strong. She is at peace with being watched. She
          puts one pair of knickers down, then does another. Then she
          upends the iron.
          
                              HANNA
                    I have to go to work. I'll walk
                    with you. Wait in the hall while I
                    change.
          
          MICHAEL goes out into the hall. The kitchen door is slightly
          open. HANNA takes off her smock and stands in a green slip.
          Her stockings are hanging over the back of a chair.
          
                                                                     7.
          
          
          She picks one up, rolls it, smooths it up over her calf and
          knee, then attaches it to her suspender. She reaches for the
          other. The flesh is bare between her legs. MICHAEL watches,
          riveted. HANNA seems oblivious. But as she is about to put
          the second stocking on, she looks at him. She drops her
          dress, and straightens, holding her stare. In response, he
          blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat. The door
          slams.
          
          INT. STAIRS. DAY
          
          MICHAEL runs down the stairs in terror and shame, and out the
          front door.
          
          EXT. COURTYARD. DAY
          
          The WORKMEN look up, curious, as MICHAEL flies by, slamming
          the outer door.
          
          INT. BEDROOM. DAWN
          
          MICHAEL is lying in bed. He looks up at the sound of a tram
          going by outside.
          
          EXT. STREET. DAWN
          
          The tram making its way along the quiet street.
          
          INT. BEDROOM. DAWN
          
          MICHAEL gets out of bed and quickly gets dressed.
          
          INT. TRAM. DAY
          
          MICHAEL, reading a book, watches unobserved, fascinated as
          HANNA collects tickets. She calls out the name of the next
          stop. She doesn't see him as she works.
          
          EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is standing on the other side   of the street from
          HANNA'S courtyard. He is in two minds   about whether to go in.
          The WOODWORKERS are loading a van. He   waits for them to
          finish before he slips in through the   archway, making his way
          to the stairs.
          
          INT. LANDING. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is sitting on the steps of the first landing. Then,
          as if from nowhere, HANNA is suddenly standing behind him, in
          uniform, carrying a box of coal in one hand, a scuttle in the
          other. She looks tired but not surprised to see him.
          
                                                                   8.
          
          
          
                              HANNA
                    There are two more buckets
                    downstairs. You can fill them and
                    bring them up.
          
          HANNA walks straight past him. For a moment he tenses as if
          there might be some contact. But she goes by.
          
          INT. CELLAR. DAY
          
          MICHAEL opens the door. He turns on a dim light. There is a
          flight of wooden stairs into the murk of a huge pile of coke,
          poured in from the street. He goes down to the bottom, and
          picks up a bucket. He digs in to the coke, and at once it
          comes tumbling down on him in a cloud of dust.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          HANNA is at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of milk. She
          has taken off her jacket and loosened her tie. MICHAEL comes
          in with the two buckets of coal, his face and clothes filthy.
          She roars with laughter, full-throated.
          
                              HANNA
                    You look ridiculous, look at you,
                    kid.
          
          MICHAEL sees himself in the mirror, but she has already got
          up, going towards the tub in the corner of the kitchen.
          
                              HANNA
                    You can't go home like that. Give
                    me your clothes, I'll run you a
                    bath.
          
          HANNA opens the tap. There's a boiler, and steaming hot water
          comes out. MICHAEL takes off his sweater, then stops.
          
                              HANNA
                    What, do you always take a bath in
                    your trousers?
          
          HANNA takes his sweater and goes to open the balcony door. He
          undresses. She puts his sweater on the balcony rail.
          
                              HANNA
                    It's all right, I won't look.
          
          On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him.
          MICHAEL is naked. HANNA takes his clothes from the chair. He
          gets into the bath. She goes to the balcony. In the bath, he
          submerges himself. HANNA goes out and shakes his clothes out
          in the open air.
          
                                                                   9.
          
          
          When he comes up from under the water, she is laying his
          clothes back on the chair. She picks up the shampoo and hands
          it to him.
          
                              HANNA
                    Wash your hair, I'll get you a
                    towel.
          
          MICHAEL washes his hair, then submerges again. When he comes
          back up, HANNA is holding out a large towel. He gets out,
          turning away to hide his erection. From behind, she wraps his
          body and rubs him dry. Then she lets the towel fall. She puts
          her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. He
          turns and faces her.
          
                              HANNA
                    So. That's why you came back.
          
          MICHAEL looks at her, awed.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You're so incredibly beautiful.
          
                              HANNA
                    Now, kid, you know that's not true.
          
          At once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. MICHAEL
          goes down onto the floor, HANNA on top of him. All the time,
          she's staring into his eyes. He can't take it. He closes his
          eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. She puts her hand
          over his mouth to smother the noise.
          
          INT. DINING ROOM. BERG APARTMENT. NIGHT
          
          The family is half-way through their meal. MICHAEL is sitting
          watching them eat, thinking about his lovemaking with HANNA.
          
                              PETER
                    You've inconvenienced your mother.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How many more times? I've said I'm
                    sorry.
          
                              PETER
                    You scared her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's hardly my fault, I got lost,
                    that's all. That's why I was late.
                    Can I have some more?
          
          He reaches for more stew. THOMAS goes on eating, a look of
          contempt on his face, too superior to engage in this.
          
                                                                  10.
          
          
          
                              EMILY
                    How can anyone get lost in their
                    own home town?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The doctor told me I had to take
                    walks.
          
                              EMILY
                    So?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I meant to head for the castle, I
                    ended up at the sports-field.
          
                              EMILY
                    They're in opposite directions.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's none of your business.
          
                              EMILY
                    He's lying.
          
                              CARLA
                    He's not lying. Michael never lies.
          
          CARLA smiles benignly. EMILY knows she's right. They all eat
          on for a few moments.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Dad, I've decided, I want to go
                    back to school tomorrow.
          
                              CARLA
                    The doctor says you need another
                    three weeks.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Well I'm going.
          
                              CARLA
                    Peter?
          
                              PETER
                    If he wants to go back, then he
                    must.
          
          MICHAEL can't breathe, as if some decisive moment in his life
          has been reached. PETER is looking at him, seeming to know
          what's going on.
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
          
          EXT. SCHOOL. DAY
          
          A massive brownstone building. The whole SCHOOL is coming
          out, but MICHAEL is first, in a desperate hurry, waving
          goodbye to his friends and running quickly away.
          
          INT. STAIRS & LANDING. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL comes quickly up the stairs. The door of HANNA'S
          apartment is ajar. He pushes it open.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          HANNA is at the sink. MICHAEL comes in, precipitate, tearing
          off his clothes and embracing her at the same time. He drops
          his trousers and lifts her onto the sink. He comes in about
          twenty seconds. He stands sweating.
          
                              HANNA
                    All right, kid, it's not just about
                    you.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          They are on the bed. He is lying underneath her. HANNA leads
          his hands to her face, then down her body. She begins to
          move, and in response, he moves too. He watches awed as she
          comes.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          HANNA has fallen asleep on MICHAEL'S chest. He is awake,
          looking at the birthmark on her left shoulder. The sound of
          the wood yard below. He kisses the birthmark. She stirs.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What's your name?
          
          She opens her eyes. A look of suspicion.
          
                                 HANNA
                    What?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Your name.
          
                              HANNA
                    Why do you want to know?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I've been here three times. You
                    haven't told me your name.
          
                                                                     12.
          
          
          
          MICHAEL waits a moment.
          
                              HANNA
                    It's Hanna. What's yours, kid?
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Michael.
          
                              HANNA
                    Michael. Hmm. So I'm with a
                    Michael.
          
          HANNA smiles, as if there were something funny about it.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    `Hanna'.
          
          INT. CLASSROOM. SCHOOL. DAY
          
          A TEACHER, in his sixties, has scrawled the words `Odysseus',
          `Hamlet' and `Faust' on the blackboard. The class of BOYS is
          attentive. Next to him, his friend HOLGER SCHLUTER. Across
          the way, RUDOLF.
          
                              TEACHER
                    The notion of secrecy is central to
                    Western literature. You may say the
                    whole idea of character in fiction
                    is defined by people holding
                    specific information which for
                    various reasons - sometimes
                    perverse, sometimes noble - they
                    are determined not to disclose.
          
          MICHAEL looks content. The bell goes.
          
          INT. CORRIDOR. SCHOOL. DAY
          
          The BOYS come pouring out cheerfully into the corridor and
          head to the next classroom. MICHAEL'S demeanour has changed.
          There's a knowingness, a swagger, a confidence which is new.
          MICHAEL lingers for a moment, then slopes off in the opposite
          direction, alone.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL. DAY
          
          MICHAEL comes out the back door of the school, unobserved,
          climbs over the railings and starts to run down the street.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. EVE
          
          Later. Dark. MICHAEL is almost asleep, HANNA awake.
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
          
                              HANNA
                    You never tell me what you've been
                    studying.
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Studying?
          
                              HANNA
                    At school. Do you learn languages?
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Yes.
          
                              HANNA
                    What languages?
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Latin.
          
                              HANNA
                    Say something in Latin.
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Oh...
          
          MICHAEL thinks a moment.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Quo, quo scelesti ruitis? Aut cur
                    dexteris aptantur enses conditi?
          
          MICHAEL smiles slightly.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's Horace.
          
                              HANNA
                    It's wonderful.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Do you want some Greek?
          
          MICHAEL grins, pleased to be able to do something. He goes
          and gets his satchel. HANNA turns on a light.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Oi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon
                    oi da naon phais epi gan malainan
                    emmenai kalliston, ego de ken otto
                    tis eratai.
          
                              HANNA
                    It's beautiful.
          
                                                                  14.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How can you tell? How do you know
                    when you've no idea what it means?
          
          HANNA looks at him a moment.
          
                              HANNA
                    What about in German?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    In German?
          
                              HANNA
                    Do you have anything?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Well, I'm writing an essay. It's
                    about a play. By a writer called
                    Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Perhaps
                    you've heard of him?
          
          HANNA makes no reaction.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The play's called Emilia Galotti.
          
                              HANNA
                    Have you got it?
          
          MICHAEL reaches down to the satchel and pulls out a book.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Here. You can read it.
          
                              HANNA
                    I'd rather listen to you.
          
          There is a silence as MICHAEL absorbs the idea.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    All right. I'm not very good.
          
          MICHAEL grins, embarrassed, then opens the book.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Act One. Scene One. The setting :
                    one of the prince's chambers.
                    Prince - "Complaints, nothing but
                    complaints, petitions, nothing but
                    petitions. For goodness' sake, just
                    imagine that people actually envy
                    us."
          
                                                                  15.
          
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Later. They are in the bath together. HANNA takes a piece of
          soap and runs it lovingly down his cheek. Then she passes the
          soap across his stomach.
          
                                 HANNA
                       You're good at it, aren't you?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                       Good at what?
          
                                  HANNA
                       Reading.
          
          He smiles.
          
                                 HANNA
                       Why are you smiling?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                       Because I didn't think I was good
                       at anything.
          
          INT. GYMNASIUM. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is playing handball with terrific physical
          confidence. A couple of bruising physical encounters. HOLGER,
          RUDOLF and MICHAEL all laugh. The whistle blows. Game over.
          
          EXT. TRAM. DAWN
          
          An empty tram moving through the eerie early morning streets.
          MICHAEL appears walking alongside it and gets on.
          
          INT. TRAM. DAWN
          
          MICHAEL is sitting in the second carriage. He looks up. The
          CONDUCTRESS is HANNA. At first, she does not notice him.
          MICHAEL watches, waiting to be noticed. She turns round and
          looks at him. He smiles in greeting but she makes no
          acknowledgement at all. She turns away. He frowns,
          bewildered.
          
          EXT. TRAM. DAY
          
          The tram is heading out of town.
          
          INT. TRAM. DAY
          
          HANNA is now talking animatedly to the DRIVER. They are
          getting on very well, laughing together and chatting. MICHAEL
          is still by himself in the second carriage, looking foolish.
          
                                                                    16.
          
          
          
          EXT. TRAM. DAY
          
          The tram comes to a halt and PASSENGERS get on.
          
          INT. TRAM. DAY
          
          HANNA is now in the busy second carriage, collecting tickets.
          MICHAEL looks up expectantly. But as he holds up his ticket,
          HANNA makes no reaction except to clip it. She turns away
          without speaking. The tram comes to a halt again, and
          MICHAEL, humiliated, bolts for the door.
          
          EXT. ROAD. DAY
          
          MICHAEL watches the tram disappears up the hill. He looks
          around, lost, in the middle of nowhere. A tractor goes by,
          WORKERS heading to the fields. MICHAEL sets off to walk back
          to town.
          
          INT. LANDING. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is on the stairs as HANNA comes up, in her uniform.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What was all that about?
          
          HANNA lets herself in, saying nothing.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          HANNA has gone in to put down her things at the kitchen
          table. MICHAEL follows, desperate.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I got up - at 4.30 - specially -
                    it's the first day of the holidays,
                    I'd been planning to surprise you -
          
                              HANNA
                    Poor little baby. Got up at four
                    thirty - and on your holidays too.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What is this? I was on your tram!
                    You totally ignored me! What do you
                    think I was doing? Why the hell do
                    you think I was there?
          
          MICHAEL has yelled in desperation. HANNA looks him straight
          in the eye.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
          
                              HANNA
                    I haven't the slightest idea. And
                    what you do is your business not
                    mine.
          
          HANNA turns and moves away.
          
                              HANNA
                    And if you wanted to speak to me, I
                    was in the first carriage. So why
                    did you sit in the second?
          
          HANNA goes to run a bath.
          
                              HANNA
                    And now, thanks very much, I've
                    been working, I need a bath. Get
                    out, I'd like to be by myself.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I didn't mean to upset you.
          
                              HANNA
                    You don't have the power to upset
                    me. You don't matter enough to
                    upset me.
          
          She takes off her clothes to get in. As soon as she does, he
          gets up and goes into the other room. He sits by himself,
          miserable. He hears her, bathing. Then finally gets up and
          goes back in. She is still in the bath.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I don't know what to say. I've
                    never been with a woman. We've been
                    together four weeks and I can't
                    live without you. I can't. Even the
                    thought of it kills me.
          
          HANNA looks at him thoughtfully.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I sat in the second carriage
                    because I thought you might kiss
                    me.
          
                               HANNA
                    Kid, you thought we could make love
                    in a tram?
          
          They smile. But MICHAEL has a more urgent question.
          
                                                                    18.
          
          
          
                                MICHAEL
                      Is it true what you said? That I
                      don't matter to you?
          
          In the bath, she shakes her head.
          
                                MICHAEL
                      Do you forgive me?
          
          She nods.
          
                                MICHAEL
                      Do you love me?
          
          She looks at him. Then she nods.
          
          INT. BEDROOM. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is sitting on the side of the bed. HANNA comes in,
          wrapped in a towel.
          
                                HANNA
                      Do you have a book?
          
                                MICHAEL
                      Oh. Well I do. I took something
                      with me this morning.
          
                                HANNA
                      What is it?
          
                                MICHAEL
                      It's another play.
          
          MICHAEL gets it out of his pocket. HANNA has lain down on the
          bed, completely content.
          
                                HANNA
                      We're changing the order we do
                      things. Read to me first, kid. Then
                      we make love.
          
          MICHAEL sits at the foot of the bed and starts to read.
          
                                MICHAEL
                      Intrigue and Love, a play by
                      Friedrich Schiller...
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          HANNA is baking bread. MICHAEL is on a chair beside her with
          a book.
          
                                                                  19.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The Odyssey by Homer.
          
                              HANNA
                    What's an odyssey?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's a journey. He sets out on a
                    journey.
          
          He starts to read.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    "Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the
                    man of twists and turns
                    Driven time and again off course,
                    once he had plundered
                    The hallowed heights of Troy.
                    Many cities of men he saw and
                    learned their minds,
                    Many pains he suffered, heartsick
                    at the open sea,
                    Fighting to save his life and bring
                    his comrades home...
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. EVE
          
          HANNA is in the bath. MICHAEL is reading a Shakespeare sonnet
          to her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    "And we will some new pleasures
                    prove of golden sands and crystal
                    brooks, with silken lights and
                    silver hooks..."
          
                                 HANNA
                    Come here.
          
          She pulls him into the bath.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
          
          HANNA is sewing. MICHAEL is reading Huckleberry Finn.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I poked into the place aways and
                    encountered a little open patch as
                    big as a bedroom, all hung around
                    with vines and found a man lying
                    there asleep, and by Jinks it was
                    my old Jim...
          
                                                                   20.
          
          
          
          He starts acting out Jim, and the two of them collapse
          laughing.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is at the bottom of the bed. HANNA is lying inside.
          He is reading Lady Chatterley's Lover.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    "Lady Chatterley felt his naked
                    flesh against her as he came into
                    her. For a moment he was still
                    inside her...
          
                              HANNA
                    This is disgusting. Where did you
                    get this?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I borrowed it from someone at
                    school.
          
                              HANNA
                    You should be ashamed. Go on.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. EVE
          
          MICHAEL reads Tin-Tin to HANNA, who is lying on the bed. They
          are both looking at the pictures.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    `Blistering Barnacles and a
                    thundering typhoon. It is water.'
                    `But what on earth did you expect
                    it to be?'
          
                              HANNA
                    Whisky.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Whisky! By thunder, whisky.
                    `Whisky? Come now captain, you
                    can't be serious.'
          
                              HANNA
                    All right, kid, that's enough for
                    today.
          
          They fall back onto the bed.
          
                                                                     21.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I was wondering, do you think you
                    could get some time off? Maybe we
                    could go for a trip.
          
                              HANNA
                    What sort of trip?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'd love to go bicycling. Just for
                    two days.
          
          MICHAEL reaches for a book.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I've got a guide-book. I've worked
                    out the route. Look, what do you
                    think?
          
          HANNA'S look is so far-away she doesn't seem to hear the
          question. Silence. Then :
          
                              HANNA
                    I think you like planning, don't
                    you?
          
          She throws the book away and they begin to make love.
          
          INT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAWN
          
          First light. Dawn breaking outside the window. MICHAEL is
          working at his desk, the surface covered in stamps, his
          collection book open. He picks one with a pyramid on it and
          looks at it. Underneath, MICHAEL'S VOICE reading Intrigue and
          Love by Schiller.
          
                              MICHAEL'S VOICE
                    "I'm not frightened. I'm not
                    frightened of anything. Why should
                    I be? I welcome obstacles, because
                    they'll be like mountains I can fly
                    over to be in your arms. The more I
                    suffer, the more I'll love...
          
          
          INT & EXT. SHOP. DAY
          
          Seen from outside, a shop full of stamps. MICHAEL and a STAMP
          DEALER with white hair and a moustache. MICHAEL is offering
          his pyramid stamp, his gestures becoming desperate as the
          STAMP DEALER shakes his head, clearly not giving him as much
          as he hopes.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
          Then MICHAEL concedes, the DEALER concedes, and a bunch of
          notes are handed across. MICHAEL runs exhilarated out into
          the street.
          
                              MICHAEL'S VOICE
                    "Danger will only increase my love,
                    it will sharpen it, it will give it
                    spice. I'll be the only angel you
                    need. On this arm, Luise, you will
                    go dancing through life. You will
                    leave life even more beautiful than
                    you entered it. Heaven will take
                    you back and look at you and say
                    `Only one thing can make a soul
                    complete, and that thing is love.'
          
          EXT. HILL. DAY
          
          HANNA and MICHAEL are whizzing down a hill together on
          bicycles. He has a rucksack. It's a rural paradise - hills on
          all sides, a gleaming river below, the sun shining brightly.
          She is wearing a blue dress.
          
          EXT. CAFE. DAY
          
          They come to a cafe and sit down outside. They pick up the
          menus on the table. A WAITRESS arrives.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    So what would you like to have?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What are you having?
          
                              HANNA
                    You order. I'll have what you have.
          
          MICHAEL starts giving the order. Next to them are a group of
          BOY SCOUTS, who are laughing among themselves.
          
                              BOYS
                    There's sausages, sausages or
                    sausages. Give it to me, come on,
                    give it here. Let me have a look.
                    You always have the same thing.
          
          They all laugh. HANNA watches them nervously.
          
          EXT. CAFE. DAY
          
          The meal finished, MICHAEL is alone, paying the bill.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    I hope your mother was happy.
          
                                                                  23.
          
          
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Thank you. She enjoyed her meal
                    very much.
          
          The WAITRESS goes. HANNA returns from inside. MICHAEL holds
          out his arm to her, which she takes. They walk away towards
          their bikes. He is smiling. MICHAEL looks round, then dares
          to reach across and kiss her on the lips. The WAITRESS
          watches.
          
          EXT. CHURCH. DAY
          
          They get off their bikes at a small church. MICHAEL stops and
          gets out a map and a guide book.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Here, let me show you where we're
                    going.
          
                              HANNA
                    It's OK, kid. I don't want to know.
          
          The sound of a choir from inside.
          
          INT. CHURCH. DAY
          
          MICHAEL and HANNA enter tentatively to find a choir
          rehearsing Bach. It is a traditional German scene - whole
          families singing together at the altar. HANNA is transported,
          entranced at the sound of the music. MICHAEL watches.
          
          EXT. RIVERSIDE. DAY
          
          HANNA is in a river, the water up to her calves, her skirt
          tied round her thighs. She is completely absorbed. Then she
          looks up, aware of being watched. MICHAEL is sitting with a
          notebook.
          
                              HANNA
                    What are you doing?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm writing a poem. About you.
          
                              HANNA
                    Can I hear it?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's not ready. I'll read it to you
                    one day.
          
                                                                     24.
          
          
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. DAY
          
          1995. MICHAEL, now 51, is standing by his desk. He opens a
          drawer. He takes out the recognizable notebook. He opens its
          yellowing pages and looks at the poetry. Then flips the
          pages, to some handwritten lists - the words `Odyssey',
          `Schnitzler', `Chekhov', `Zweig' with numbers beside them.
          MICHAEL flaps it shut, puts it back and turns to go out.
          
          INT. STREET. DAY
          
          MICHAEL leaves his apartment block. He gets into his black
          Mercedes.
          
          INT. CAR. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is listening on the radio to the same Bach music they
          heard in the church. He drives through the thriving modern
          city. Beyond, the huge cranes and gouged-out building sites
          of a city under construction.
          
          EXT. STREET. DAY
          
          MICHAEL swings his car into place. He gets out and heads
          across the road, prosperous, purposeful.
          
          INT. LOBBY. COURTHOUSE. DAY
          
          An ASSISTANT meets MICHAEL with his robe which he pulls on as
          he walks quickly through an elaborate lobby. GERHARD BADE,
          also in his fifties, also robed, falls in step.
          
                              GERHARD
                    You all right, Michael?
          
                                MICHAEL
                    I'm fine.
          
                              GERHARD
                    You'd better hurry. You know what
                    she's like.
          
          A robed ASSISTANT is waiting outside the door with documents
          he hands to MICHAEL. They all go in.
          
          INT. COURTROOM. DAY
          
          MICHAEL joins his CLIENT, just seconds before the FEMALE
          JUDGE comes in and everyone stands. Silence. The JUDGE looks
          at MICHAEL disapprovingly, sensing his lateness. Everyone
          sits. MICHAEL sits, thinking back.
          
                                                                     25.
          
          
          
          INT. STAIRWAY. SCHOOL. DAY
          
          1958. A sheriff's posse of sixteen-year old GIRLS, come
          laughing, blushing towards the classroom. One of them is
          talking excitedly to the other.
          
                              SOPHIE
                    I'm just going to pretend I've been
                    here for years, I'm not going to
                    behave in any special way.
          
                              GIRL
                    You just wait. You wait and see.
          
          They smile together and head for the classroom.
          
          INT. SCHOOL. DAY
          
          The BOYS are already in place, dotted round, as the GIRLS
          come in. There are cries of `Here they come'. Then the
          TEACHER comes in.
          
                              TEACHER
                    Good morning, ladies. Gentlemen,
                    please welcome your new fellow-
                    students, treat them with courtesy,
                    please.
          
          Not far from MICHAEL, a GIRL sits across the aisle, virginal
          with brown hair, brown summer skin.
          
                              SOPHIE
                    Hello. My name's Sophie.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm Michael.
          
          The TEACHER comes in. The class quietens.
          
          INT. SCHOOL. DAY
          
          Later. The TEACHER is in full flow. MICHAEL can't take his
          eyes off SOPHIE.
          
                              TEACHER
                    Everyone believes that Homer's
                    subject is homecoming. In fact, The
                    Odyssey is a book about a journey.
                    Home is a place you dream of, it's
                    not a place you ever attain.
          
          The TEACHER breaks off.
          
                                                                   26.
          
          
          
                              TEACHER
                    Berg, I don't mean to distract you,
                    but we're meant to studying Homer,
                    not studying Sophia.
          
          The whole class cracks up. MICHAEL blushes.
          
          EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is riveted as SOPHIE swims fast and lithe through the
          water. Around him, YOUNG PEOPLE are lounging round on towels.
          It's the social centre. HOLGER and RUDOLF are rubbing their
          hair with towels as SOPHIE approaches.
          
                              HOLGER
                    Michael the water's fantastic.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's wonderful, isn't it?
          
                              HOLGER
                    Wonderful. It's going to be a great
                    summer.
          
          MICHAEL looks across to where a group of AMERICANS are
          shouting and playing a very loud game of volleyball.
          
                              HOLGER
                    Now the Americans have allowed us
                    back in our own lake.
          
                              SOPHIE
                    Why are they so loud?
          
                              HOLGER
                    You should see their stores. They
                    have everything.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Oh sure. Everything mankind could
                    ever dream of.
          
                              SOPHIE
                    You don't like Americans?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Just it's more fun without them.
          
          He looks SOPHIE straight in the eye. There is a sudden
          silence, MICHAEL looking straight at SOPHIE. SOPHIE looks
          down. Then MICHAEL moves slightly to pack up his stuff.
          
                                                                  27.
          
          
          
                              SOPHIE
                    Why do you leave early?
          
                              HOLGER
                    He always leaves early.
          
          EXT. BANHOFSTRASSE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is cycling back towards town, a smile on his face.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          MICHAEL flies up the stairs, then goes in. HANNA is sitting
          sewing. He kisses her on the cheek as he gets out a book.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    I'm sorry I'm late. I was held up
                    at school.
          
          At once he sits down opposite her. A ritual.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The Lady with the Little Dog. By
                    Anton Chekhov.
          
          HANNA looks, seeing right through him.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    "The talk was that a new face had
                    appeared on the promenade, a lady
                    with a little dog."
          
          INT. GARAGE. DAY
          
          A huge tram-shed full of empty trams. HANNA is at the end of
          the garage, talking to the SUPERVISER, a large man in his
          fifties.
          
                              SUPERVISER
                    Schmitz, one moment. We've got good
                    news for you. Your work is good,
                    we're going to promote you. To work
                    with me in the office. It's more
                    money. Congratulations.
          
          He moves away. HANNA looks distraught.
          
          EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is watching SOPHIE swimming, a look of anxiety in his
          eye, when HOLGER touches his shoulder.
          
                                                                  28.
          
          
          
                              HOLGER
                    Get a move on, we're leaving early
                    today.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Why? What for?
          
                              HOLGER
                    We're going back to Sophie's. It's
                    your birthday. We're giving you a
                    party.
          
          HOLGER and RUDOLF disappear to get dressed. SOPHIE appears in
          her swimming costume.
          
                              SOPHIE
                    Come on, it's a surprise. We
                    thought you'd like it. We've been
                    planning it for weeks.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm sorry. Really. I promised
                    someone I'd do something else.
          
          The others are furious with him. They all go off.
          
          EXT. STREET. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is cycling towards HANNA'S apartment, his hair wet
          from the lake, looking equally unhappy.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          HANNA is sitting unhappily as MICHAEL reads to her. They are
          both in a bad mood.
          
                              HANNA
                    Oh kid, kid. Stop.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What's wrong?
          
                              HANNA
                    Nothing's wrong. It's nothing.
          
          HANNA just shrugs. She goes and sits at the table to drink
          tea. MICHAEL is irritated.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You never ask, you never bother to
                    ask how I am.
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
          
                              HANNA
                    You never say.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It just happens to be my birthday.
                    It's my birthday, that's all. In
                    fact, you've never even asked when
                    it is.
          
                              HANNA
                    Look if you want a fight, kid...
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No, I don't want a fight. What's
                    wrong with you?
          
                              HANNA
                    What business is it of yours?
          
          She has snapped at him, razor-like.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's always on your terms.
                    Everything. We do what you want.
                    It's always what you want. My
                    friends were giving me a party!
          
                              HANNA
                    Well then why are you here? Go back
                    to your party. Isn't that what you
                    want?
          
          HANNA puts down her cup, angry. She goes into the bedroom and
          slams the door. He sits, the magic of the day gone. He gets
          up and opens the bedroom door. HANNA is on the bed.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    And it's always me that has to
                    apologize.
          
          Silence. HANNA lets time go by. Then :
          
                              HANNA
                    You don't have to apologize. No-one
                    has to apologize. No-one can make
                    you.
          
          HANNA reaches for a book from beside the bed. She throws it
          down on the cover.
          
                              HANNA
                    War and Peace, kid.
          
                                                                   30.
          
          
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          HANNA is on the edge of the bath, running water. She has a
          pale blue flowered smock. She is running with sweat. The
          smock sticks to her. MICHAEL gets out a book. HANNA drops
          lavender oil into the bath. MICHAEL stands in the bath and
          she washes his body.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          They are making love on the bed. It's intense. At one point
          she moves on top of him. She holds his head between her
          hands, as if she would crush the life out of him. Then she
          lets go.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          They are both sweating, exhausted. She looks a moment.
          
                              HANNA
                    Now you must go back to your
                    friends.
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          MICHAEL has gone. HANNA washes out milk bottles and empties
          them into the sink. Then she picks up her luggage and leaves
          the empty apartment.
          
          EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is sitting on the pier watching as HOLGER, RUDOLF and
          SOPHIE swim competitively out to a pontoon, then turn back,
          full of energy and high spirits. MICHAEL watches for a while,
          then suddenly he gets up and starts to run away from them
          all.
          
                              SOPHIE
                    Michael. You all right?
          
          But MICHAEL is running away across the lakeside beach.
          
          INT. LANDING & HANNA'S APARTMENT. DUSK
          
          MICHAEL opens the door. He goes in. The apartment is emptied,
          the rented furniture in place, all trace of HANNA gone. He
          looks round. He looks at the empty bath, the tap above it. He
          opens the kitchen cupboards - some coffee, sugar, that's
          about it. He goes into the bedroom, the bed stripped bare. He
          lies down on the bed.
          
                                                                  31.
          
          
          
          INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
          
          MICHAEL lying on the bed, curled up, in his clothes, like a
          foetus, asleep.
          
          INT. APARTMENT. DAY
          
          The family at breakfast. MICHAEL slips quietly in the main
          door, trying to go to his room without being heard. EMILY
          runs to look.
          
                                 EMILY
                    It's him.
          
          Sheepishly MICHAEL appears.
          
                              CARLA
                    Where were you last night? What
                    happened?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I stayed at a friend's.
          
                                 PETER
                    Carla.
          
          PETER looks. He seems to know exactly what's been going on.
          
                              PETER
                    Get the boy something to eat. I
                    think we all knew you'd come back
                    to us eventually.
          
          EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DUSK
          
          MICHAEL is alone in the deserted pool. He is on the jetty. He
          takes off his clothes and slips into the water. Just his
          head, like a seal's, at one end, just out of the water, quite
          still.
          
          INT. COURTHOUSE. NIGHT
          
          1995. MICHAEL sitting alone, thinking back.
          
          EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DUSK
          
          1958. The sun slants, and for a few seconds the water
          dazzles. He slips his head under.
          
          INT. COURTHOUSE. DAY
          
          1995. MICHAEL still sitting thoughtfully by himself in the
          empty court. Then he looks up. An ASSISTANT has appeared.
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
          
                              ASSISTANT
                    Mr Berg. It is eight o'clock. Your
                    daughter.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Thank you.
          
          He gets up.
          
          INT. BRASSERIE. BERLIN. NIGHT
          
          JULIA is already at the table in a chic modern brasserie. She
          is a sympathetic young woman of around 23. MICHAEL
          approaches. When she sees him, she gets up.
          
                              JULIA
                    I was early.
          
          MICHAEL leans in and kisses her on the cheek.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Julia.
          
          They're uneasy. She looks a moment, then they sit down.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Welcome back.
          
          INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT
          
          Later. They have eaten. They both have big glasses of red
          wine. It's more relaxed.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    So how will you decide?
          
                              JULIA
                    I don't know. I'm happy back in
                    Berlin, I suppose.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You've seen your mother?
          
          JULIA nods.
          
                              JULIA
                    I wanted to get away. There was
                    nothing more to it. It was Paris,
                    but it could have been anywhere.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Away from your parents?
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          
          JULIA doesn't answer.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm aware I was difficult. I wasn't
                    always open with you. I'm not open
                    with anyone.
          
                              JULIA
                    I knew you were distant. I'd always
                    assumed it was my fault.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Julia. How wrong can you be?
          
          JULIA colours, on the verge of tears. Then she looks away.
          
          INT & EXT. CAR. NIGHT
          
          They drive through the gleaming streets. It's been raining -
          Berlin is glistening. Their voices :
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I admit it now, I was nervous.
          
                              JULIA
                    I was nervous too. It's silly isn't
                    it?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It is silly.
          
                              JULIA
                    Thank you for dinner.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'll see you very soon.
          
          EXT. CAR. DAY
          
          MICHAEL lets JULIA out, and is watching her safely to her
          door from the car.
          
                              JULIA
                    Good night, Dad.
          
          MICHAEL suddenly gets out himself.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Julia, wait. I want to ask you a
                    favour.
          
                              JULIA
                    What favour?
          
                                                                  34.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I want to take you on a trip. I
                    want to show you something.
          
                                 JULIA
                    When?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Tomorrow, maybe. Can I pick you up
                    in the car?
          
          JULIA doesn't need to say anything.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    At ten, say.
          
          JULIA smiles.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Then good.
          
          MICHAEL hugs her, his heart aching with love. JULIA goes in
          to her place. MICHAEL is left standing still in the plaza
          outside, not moving. Underneath the sound of what follows,
          thirty years previously.

          their hair, their dress, it could only be the 1960s.
          
                              LECTURER
                    Those of you for the special
                    seminar group on The Legal System
                    in the Third Reich, please stay on
                    in this room. Professor Rohl will
                    be here in a moment.
          
          Nearly all the STUDENTS leave, talking among themselves. Just
          eight are left, dotted around the huge room. MICHAEL is one
          of them, now 22, in a corduroy jacket and tie. There is a
          lull. MICHAEL looks round at the group of oddballs, then
          finds ROHL, distinguished, greying, is already in front of
          them.
          
                              ROHL
                    Well, we seem to be quite a small
                    group. A small group and a select
                    one. Clearly, this is going to be a
                    unique seminar. Let me start by
                    thanking those of you who've chosen
                    to take part. Good for you. A
                    reading list, gentlemen.

                              ROHL (cont'd)
                    Karl Jaspers, The Question of
                    German Guilt...
          
          A calm STUDENT with long hair smiles at MICHAEL. She looks
          like Francoise Hardy. She murmurs.
          
                              MARTHE
                    And ladies.
          
          INT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT
          
          MICHAEL is working alone at his desk, a light on. The door of
          his extremely modest student digs is open. MARTHE appears at
          the door, silently. He looks up.
          
                              MARTHE
                    So this is where you are.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yes. Come in.
          
          But neither of them move. MARTHE just smiles from the door.
          
                              MARTHE
                    You take work seriously.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Oh I don't know.
          
                              MARTHE
                    You're rather a serious boy.
          
          MARTHE shrugs slightly.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's how I was brought up. What
                    about you? Are you serious?
          
                              MARTHE
                    You're sure you want to work
                    tonight?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Well I do. But I won't work every
                    night.
          
                              MARTHE
                    See you tomorrow.
          
          They smile at one another. She goes.
          
                                                                   36.
          
          
          
          INT. TRAIN. DAY
          
          The seminar group, long-haired, hippyish, is on the train :
          PROFESSOR ROHL, with MARTHE, DIETER and a few others. MICHAEL
          catches MARTHA'S eye. They smile. Then he opens the window,
          cheerful.
          
          EXT. TOWN HALL. MANNHEIM. DAY
          
          The STUDENTS are having a cigarette in front of the huge
          building. Two black vans with barred windows come by,
          carrying prisoners. The first one veers close to MICHAEL on
          the pavement, then disappears into the inner courtyard. ROHL
          smiles at MICHAEL.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Why all the police?
          
                              ROHL
                    They're worried about
                    demonstrators.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    For or against?
          
                                ROHL
                    Both.
          
          INT. TOWN HALL. DAY
          
          A courtroom has been improvised inside the town hall. There
          are large windows, with milky glass, down the left-hand side.
          As ROHL and the STUDENTS arrive, the court is a melee of
          PHOTOGRAPHERS, LAWYERS and PUBLIC. The three JUDGES are
          already in place, next to six selected CITIZENS. MICHAEL and
          the others take places in the gallery
          
                              CLERK
                    All photographers are now asked to
                    leave.
          
          The PHOTOGRAPHERS go.
          
                              JUDGE
                    The defendants, please.
          
          From being noisy and chaotic, the court is now silent.
          
                              JUDGE
                    The first thing I'm going to do is
                    hear motions from each of the
                    defendants' lawyers.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  37.
          
                              JUDGE (cont'd)
                    They're going to be arguing that
                    there's no reason to keep the
                    defendants in jail until the
                    outcome of the forthcoming trial.
          
          DIETER grins at MICHAEL in anticipation.
          
                              JUDGE
                    I am going to take these cases one
                    by one.
          
          MICHAEL is leaning down to get stuff out of his briefcase, as
          MARTHE shakes a pen which isn't working.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Do you want a pen?
          
                              MARTHE
                    I've got a pen.
          
          So MICHAEL doesn't hear as the JUDGE speaks.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Hanna Schmitz.
          
          There is a row of six DEFENDANTS. The fifth woman is HANNA,
          her hair tied in a knot, her gaze fixedly into the middle
          distance, not looking towards the SPECTATORS. She is wearing
          a grey dress with short sleeves. They all sit, sideways to
          the gallery. HANNA rises to her feet. The words seem to come
          very quietly, across a great distance.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Your name is Hanna Schmitz?
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes.
          
          It is only when the JUDGE repeats the name that MICHAEL looks
          up, hearing it for the first time.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Can you speak louder please?
          
                              HANNA
                    My name is Hanna Schmitz.
          
          MICHAEL is rigid, blank, just staring.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Thank you. You were born on October
                    21st, 1922?
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes.
          
                               JUDGE
                    At Hermannstadt. And you're now 43
                    years old?
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes.
          
                              JUDGE
                    You joined the SS in 1943?
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes.
          
                              JUDGE
                    What was your reason? What was your
                    reason for joining?
          
          HANNA doesn't answer.
          
                              JUDGE
                    You were working at the Siemens
                    factory at the time?
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes.
          
                              JUDGE
                    You'd recently been offered a
                    promotion. Why did you prefer to
                    join the SS?
          
          HANNA has a DEFENCE COUNSEL, a young man, beside her, who is
          about to get up. But the JUDGE forestalls him.
          
                              JUDGE
                    I'll re-phrase my question. I'm
                    trying to ascertain if she joined
                    the SS freely. Of her own free
                    will.
          
          Everyone waits.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Well?
          
                              HANNA
                    I heard there were jobs.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Go on.
          
                                                                   39.
          
          
          
                              HANNA
                    I was working at Siemens when I
                    heard the SS was recruiting.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Did you know the kind of work you'd
                    be expected to do?
          
                              HANNA
                    They were looking for guards. I
                    applied for a job.
          
          MICHAEL is intent now, so are the STUDENTS beside him.
          
                              JUDGE
                    And you worked first at Auschwitz?
          
                                HANNA
                    Yes.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Until 1944. Then you were moved to
                    a smaller camp near Cracow?
          
                                HANNA
                    Yes.
          
          ROHL leans into MICHAEL.
          
                              ROHL
                    Are you OK?
          
                                MICHAEL
                    I'm fine.
          
                              JUDGE
                    You then helped move the prisoners
                    west in the winter of 1944 in the
                    so-called death marches?
          
          INT. TRAIN. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is hanging out of the window of the train, smoking a
          cigarette.
          
          INT. TRAIN. DAY
          
          MICHAEL sits down in his seat. ROHL moves to sit opposite
          him.
          
                              ROHL
                    So what did you think?
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I don't know. It wasn't quite what
                    I expecting.
          
                              ROHL
                    Wasn't it? In what way? What were
                    you expecting?
          
          ROHL is looking at him. MICHAEL doesn't answer.
          
                              DIETER
                    I thought it was exciting.
          
                                ROHL
                    Exciting?
          
                                DIETER
                    Yes.
          
                              ROHL
                    Why? Why did you think it exciting?
          
                              DIETER
                    Because it's justice.
          
          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY
          
          The train hurtles through the German countryside.
          
          INT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT
          
          A student party, in a candle-lit room. MARTHE is singing to a
          guitar. It's been going on for hours - the STUDENTS are on
          the floor with beer and cigarettes. The front door is open.
          DIETER, beer in hand, looks out to the balcony where he can
          see MICHAEL bent away from them, all by himself.
          
          EXT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT
          
          MICHAEL, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out
          into the night. His eye lands on a student room in which a
          couple are making love.
          
          INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY
          
          The small STUDENT GROUP is now rattling around informally in
          the big lecture room.
          
                              ROHL
                    I need to correct an impression.
                    Dieter said yesterday this was
                    about justice. But is it?
                              (MORE)
          
                                                          41.
          
                              ROHL (cont'd)
                    If it were about justice you might
                    ask why has it taken so long? The
                    war ended twenty years ago.
                    Remember, there've been no
                    significant trials between
                    Nuremburg in 1946 and the Auschwitz
                    trials a couple of years ago.
                    That's a long gap. What's the
                    reason for the gap?
          
          ROHL waits a moment for a STUDENT to answer.
          
                              DIETER
                    I'd have thought it was obvious.
          
                              ROHL
                    Say.
          
                              DIETER
                    Cowardice. It's cowardice, isn't
                    it? It's bad conscience. It's the
                    big cover-up.
          
                              ROHL
                    Go on.
          
                              DIETER
                    After the war. The German people
                    didn't want to look at what they'd
                    done.
          
                              ROHL
                    Is that right?
          
                              DIETER
                    Because they had too much to hide.
                    All our parents are liars. All
                    right, mine are. So it's left to
                    us, isn't it?
          
                              ROHL
                    How so?
          
                              DIETER
                    Because we're not implicated.
          
                              ROHL
                    Aren't you? Good. So that's all
                    right then.
          
          Everyone laughs.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
          
                              MARTHE
                    No, but seriously, Dieter's right.
                    My parents, I can't even talk to
                    them. I don't love them. How could
                    I? How could anyone love them?
                    Because they've told themselves so
                    many lies, they can't remember the
                    truth, let alone admit it. Isn't
                    that why we signed up for this
                    seminar?
          
                              ROHL
                    I don't know. You tell me.
          
                              MARTHE
                    Speaking for myself.
          
                               ROHL
                    Michael?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm not sure any more.
          
          ROHL is staring at him thoughtfully.
          
                              ROHL
                    What did your father do, Dieter?
          
                               DIETER
                    If you want to know, he was in the
                    Waffen SS.
          
          There are some smiles, but DIETER rides over the reaction.
          
                              DIETER
                    That's what I mean, that's what I'm
                    saying. So were a million other
                    Germans.
          
                              ROHL
                    That's exactly my point. That's why
                    it's better not to pretend this is
                    about justice. Forgive me, nor is
                    it about getting into an emotional
                    state. It has no purpose if it's
                    just the young giving their parents
                    a bad time.
          
          There's a silence. That's clearly why some of them are there.
          
                              MARTHE
                    So what is it about? What do you
                    think?
          
                                                                    43.
          
          
          
                              ROHL
                    Societies think they operate by
                    something called morality. But they
                    don't. They operate by something
                    called law. You're not guilty of
                    anything merely by working at
                    Auschwitz. 8,000 people worked at
                    Auschwitz. Precisely 19 have been
                    convicted, and only 6 for murder.
                    To prove murder you have to prove
                    intent. That's the law. Remember,
                    the question is never `Was it
                    wrong?' but `Was it legal?' And not
                    by our laws, no, by the laws at the
                    time.
          
          DIETER frowns, unhappy.
          
                              DIETER
                    But isn't that...
          
                              ROHL
                    What?
          
                              DIETER
                    Narrow?
          
                              ROHL
                    Yes. The law is narrow.
          
          ROHL looks unapologetic.
          
                              ROHL
                    On the other hand, I suspect people
                    who kill other people tend to be
                    aware that it's wrong.
          
          INT. COURTROOM. MANNHEIM. DAY
          
          ROHL is leaning forward, attentive. HANNA is standing,
          opposite the JUDGE, who holds up a book called MOTHER &
          DAUGHTER : A STORY OF SURVIVAL.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Miss Schmitz, you're familiar with
                    this book...
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes...
          
                              JUDGE
                    Parts of it have already been read
                    out in court.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  44.
          
                              JUDGE (cont'd)
                    It's an American publication, which
                    has been translated. It's by a
                    survivor, a prisoner who survived,
                    Ilana Mather...
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes I know. I know Ilana Mather.
          
                              JUDGE
                    She was in the camp, wasn't she,
                    when she was a child? She was with
                    her mother.
          
          The judge waits. HANNA seems arrogant, defiant.
          
                              JUDGE
                    In the book, she describes a
                    selection process. At the end of
                    the month's labour, every month,
                    sixty inmates were selected. They
                    were picked out to be sent from the
                    satellite camp back to Auschwitz.
                    That's right, isn't it?
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes, it's right.
          
                              JUDGE
                    And so far, each of your fellow
                    defendants has specifically denied
                    being part of that process. Now I'm
                    going to ask you. Were you part of
                    it?
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes.
          
          There is a stir among the other DEFENDANTS and in the court.
          They start talking to their LAWYERS.
          
                              JUDGE
                    So you helped make the selection?
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes.
          
                              JUDGE
                    You admit that? Then tell me, how
                    did that selection happen?
          
          HANNA shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious.
          
                                                                  45.
          
          
          
                              HANNA
                    There were six guards, so we
                    decided we'd choose ten people
                    each. That's how we did it - every
                    month. We'd all choose ten.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Are you saying your fellow
                    defendants took part in the
                    process?
          
                              HANNA
                    We all did.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Even though they've denied it? But
                    you admit it. You're saying you
                    took part in the process.
          
          The other DEFENDANTS stir with animosity, but the JUDGE is
          intent, following his own line.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Did you not realise you were
                    sending these women to their
                    deaths?
          
          He waits. HANNA nods slightly.
          
                              HANNA
                    Yes but there were new arrivals,
                    new women were arriving all the
                    time, so of course we had to move
                    some of the old ones on.
          
                              JUDGE
                    I'm not sure you understand...
          
                              HANNA
                    We couldn't keep everyone. There
                    wasn't room.
          
          The JUDGE frowns, genuinely surprised that she doesn't seem
          to understand his point.
          
                              JUDGE
                    No, but what I'm saying : let me
                    rephrase : to make room, you were
                    picking women out and saying `You
                    you and you have to be sent back to
                    be killed.'
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
          
                              HANNA
                    Well, what would you have done?
          
          HANNA is looking at the JUDGE - a perfectly straight
          question. MICHAEL smiles slightly, proud of her. Everyone in
          the court waits for the JUDGE to answer. Silence. ROHL is
          impassive. But HANNA follows her own thoughts. She quietly
          asks herself a question.
          
                              HANNA
                    So should I never have signed up at
                    Siemens?
          
          INT. LOBBY. TOWN HALL. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is alone, smoking. On a bench, side by side, are two
          women. One is very small, dark, in her sixties. The other is
          composed, formidable, elegant, in her thirties. ROSE and
          ILANA MATHER. They look up, catching MICHAEL's eye. Then a
          CLERK leans in to the younger woman.
          
                              CLERK
                    Ms. Mather, they're ready for you
                    now.
          
          The two women go into the court. The door closes.
          
          INT. LOBBY & COURTROOM. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is alone in the now-deserted lobby, unwilling to go
          back. Then he goes to the door. He opens it a little. The
          sound of the trial. He opens the door fully. MICHAEL can see
          that it is ILANA who is testifying. The court is
          conspicuously packed. Large black-and-white photographs of
          the labour camp now dominate the room. MICHAEL comes quietly
          into the back of the room as the trial goes on.
          
          MICHAEL has pushed past a couple of people to sit down near
          ROSE who is sitting in the body of the court. He looks across
          to the DEFENDANTS. RITA BECKHART, a large older woman, is one
          of a couple who isn't bothering to listen.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    In your book you describe the
                    process of selection...
          
                              ILANA
                    Yes. You were made to work and
                    then, when you were no longer any
                    use to them, then they sent you
                    back to Auschwitz to be killed.
          
                                                                  47.
          
          
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    Are there people here today who
                    made that selection?
          
                              ILANA
                    Yes.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    I need you to identify them. Can
                    you please point them out?
          
          ILANA points with her finger at the DEFENDANTS.
          
                              ILANA
                    Her. And her. And her. And her. And
                    her. And her.
          
          The last finger has been to HANNA. MICHAEL watches, but HANNA
          does not react.
          
                              ILANA
                    Each of the guards would choose a
                    certain number of women. Hanna
                    Schmitz chose differently.
          
                              JUDGE
                    In what way differently?
          
                              ILANA
                    She had favourites. Girls, mostly
                    young. We all remarked on it, she
                    gave them food and places to sleep.
                    In the evening, she asked them to
                    join her. We all thought - well,
                    you can imagine what we thought.
          
          HANNA stares back, impassive. MICHAEL watches.
          
                              ILANA
                    Then we found out - she was making
                    these women read aloud to her. They
                    were reading to her. At first we
                    thought this guard, this guard is
                    more sensitive, she's more human,
                    she's kinder. Often she chose the
                    weak, the sick, she picked them
                    out, she seemed to be protecting
                    them almost. But then she
                    dispatched them. Is that kinder?
          
          HANNA looks back, not apologizing.
          
                                                                  48.
          
          
          
          INT. LOBBY. TOWN HALL. DAY
          
          MICHAEL sits alone, head in hands, in despair.
          
          INT. COURTROOM. DAY
          
          Now ROSE is testifying. The court is quiet, focused.
          
                              JUDGE
                    I want to move on now to the march.
                    As I understand it, you and your
                    daughter were marched for many
                    months.
          
                              ROSE
                    Yes. It was the winter of 1944. Our
                    camp was closed down, we were told
                    we had to move on. But the plan
                    kept changing every day. Women were
                    dying all around us in the snow.
                    Half of us died on the march. My
                    daughter says in the book, less a
                    death march, more a death gallop.
          
          MICHAEL looks along the row to where ILANA is now sitting.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Please tell us about the night in
                    the church.
          
          MICHAEL watches as ROSE looks across to ILANA. ILANA stares
          back at her. MICHAEL watches the exchange as ROSE nods, as if
          accepting she must go ahead and speak.
          
                              ROSE
                    That night we actually thought we
                    were lucky because we had a roof
                    over our heads. We'd arrived in a
                    village, as always, the guards took
                    the best quarters, they took the
                    priest's house. But they let us
                    sleep in a church. There was a
                    bombing raid. In the middle of the
                    night. At first we could only hear
                    the fire, it was in the steeple.
                    Then we could see burning beams,
                    and they began to crash to the
                    floor. Everyone rushed, rushed to
                    the doors. But the doors had been
                    locked on the outside.
          
                                                                     49.
          
          
          
                                 JUDGE
                       The church burned down? Nobody came
                       to open the doors? Is that right?
          
                                 ROSE
                       Nobody.
          
                                 JUDGE
                       Even though you were all burning to
                       death?
          
          ROSE nods.
          
                                 JUDGE
                       How many people were killed?
          
                                 ROSE
                       Everyone was killed.
          
                                 JUDGE
                       How did you survive?
          
                                 ROSE
                       I needed to get away from the other
                       women. Because they were panicking,
                       they were screaming. I couldn't
                       stand it. I couldn't stand their
                       screaming. I was more frightened of
                       the other women than I was of the
                       fire. So I too my daughter and led
                       her to the upper floor. I can't
                       defend what I did. It's impossible
                       to defend. I took Ilana in my arms
                       and I led her towards the fire.
                       There was a small gallery at the
                       side of the church on the upper
                       level. It saved our lives. The
                       gallery didn't burn.
          
          ROSE turns, in tears, to look at ILANA.
          
                                 JUDGE
                       Thank you. I want to thank you for
                       coming to this country today to
                       testify.
          
          INT. LECTURE ROOM. LAW SCHOOL. DAY
          
          The group is back in the big hall. But the atmosphere is
          grim. It's a while before DIETER speaks.
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          
                              DIETER
                    I don't know. I don't know what
                    we're doing any more.
          
                                 ROHL
                    Don't you?
          
                              DIETER
                    You keep telling us to think like
                    lawyers, but there's something
                    disgusting about this.
          
          ROHL is very still, like an analyst who is finally leading
          his patient to the heart of things.
          
                                 ROHL
                    How so?
          
                              DIETER
                    This didn't happen to the Germans.
                    It happened to the Jews.
          
          Everyone is shocked at his violent passion.
          
                              DIETER
                    What are we trying to do?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    We're trying to understand.
          
                              DIETER
                    Six women locked    three hundred Jews
                    in a church, and    let them burn.
                    What is there to    understand? Tell
                    me, I'm asking :    what is there to
                    understand?
          
          MICHAEL can't answer. DIETER gets up, outraged now.
          
                              DIETER
                    I started out believing in this
                    trial, I thought it was great, now
                    I think it's just a diversion.
          
                              ROHL
                    Yes? Diversion from what?
          
                              DIETER
                    You choose six women, you put them
                    on trial, you say `They were the
                    evil ones, they were the guilty
                    ones'. Brilliant!
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  51.
          
                              DIETER (cont'd)
                    Because one of the victims happened
                    to write a book! That's why they're
                    on trial and nobody else. Do you
                    know how many camps there were in
                    Europe?
          
          DIETER turns, furious.
          
                              DIETER
                    People go on about how much did
                    everyone know? `Who knew?' `What
                    did they know?' That isn't the
                    question. The question is `How
                    could you let it happen?' And -
                    better - `Why didn't you kill
                    yourself when you found out?'
          
          One of the group walks out.
          
                              DIETER
                    Thousands! That's how many. There
                    were thousands of camps. Everyone
                    knew.
          
          DIETER'S passion is so great that everyone is shaken.
          
                              DIETER
                    Look at that woman...
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Which woman?
          
                              DIETER
                    The woman you're always staring at.
                    I'm sorry but you are.
          
          MICHAEL is white. The atmosphere is electric.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I don't know which woman you mean.
          
                              DIETER
                    You know what I'd do? Put the gun
                    in my hand, I'd shoot her myself.
          
          EXT. EMPTY ROAD. DAY
          
          MICHAEL walks along an empty wooded road, miles from
          anywhere. The sun is shining through the trees behind him.
          
                                                                    52.
          
          
          
          EXT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY
          
          The wire fence of a concentration camp, deserted. MICHAEL,
          with a back-pack, goes alone through the metal gate. MICHAEL
          walks among the deserted empty huts.
          
          INT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY
          
          Inside one of the huts, MICHAEL is by himself staring at a
          line of empty beds. He moves on, overwhelmed, lost. He passes
          through the showers. Then he comes to a room with vast metal
          cages on either side. In the cages, the countless dusty shoes
          of the exterminated.
          
          INT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY
          
          MICHAEL opens a door and walks into a room with a line of gas
          ovens. He walks past them. Then he stands beside them, his
          head down.
          
          INT. COURTROOM. DAY
          
          HANNA is standing being examined by the JUDGE. Large
          photographs and maps of the village, with the lay-out of the
          church, are now on display.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Why did you not unlock the doors?
          
          He waits. HANNA doesn't reply.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Why did you not unlock the doors?
          
          The JUDGE turns to the row of DEFENDANTS.
          
                              JUDGE
                    I've asked all of you and I'm
                    getting no answer. Two of the
                    victims are in this court. They
                    deserve an answer.
          
          ILANA and ROSE are not far away from MICHAEL and the
          STUDENTS. The JUDGE puts down a bound handwritten document.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Here, this is the SS report. You
                    all have copies.
          
          There is a flurry of paperwork among the DEFENDANTS and
          LAWYERS as they turn to their copies.
          
                                                                  53.
          
          
          
                              JUDGE
                    This is the report which was
                    written, approved and signed by all
                    of you immediately after the event.
                    In the written report, you all
                    claim you didn't even know about
                    the fire until after it happened.
                    But that isn't true, is it?
          
          The JUDGE waits.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Well? It isn't true.
          
                              HANNA
                    I don't know what you're asking.
          
                              JUDGE
                    The first thing I'm asking is, why
                    didn't you unlock the doors?
          
          HANNA takes a look to the other DEFENDANTS. For the first
          time her poise is crumbling.
          
                              HANNA
                    Obviously. For the obvious reason.
                    We couldn't.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Why? Why couldn't you?
          
                              HANNA
                    We were guards. Our job was to
                    guard the prisoners. We couldn't
                    just let them escape.
          
                              JUDGE
                    I see. And if they escaped, then
                    you'd be blamed, you'd be charged,
                    you might even be executed?
          
                                 HANNA
                    No.
          
                                 JUDGE
                    Well then?
          
          The JUDGE waits.
          
                              HANNA
                    If we opened the doors, then there
                    would have been chaos. How could we
                    have restored order?
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                   54.
          
                              HANNA (cont'd)
                    It happened so fast. It was
                    snowing. The bombs - There were
                    flames all over the village. Then
                    the screaming began. It got worse
                    and worse. And if they'd all come
                    rushing out, we couldn't just let
                    them escape. We couldn't. We were
                    responsible for them.
          
                              JUDGE
                    So you did know what was happening?
                    You did know? You made a choice.
                    You let them die rather than risk
                    letting them escape.
          
          HANNA can't answer - she has no answer.
          
                              JUDGE
                    The other defendants have made an
                    allegation against you. Have you
                    heard this allegation?
          
          HANNA does not reply.
          
                              JUDGE
                    They say you were in charge.
          
                              HANNA
                    It isn't true. I was just one of
                    the guards.
          
          The other DEFENDANTS interrupt to call out `She was in
          charge'.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Did you write the report?
          
                              HANNA
                    No. No. We all discussed what to
                    say. We all wrote it together.
          
                              BECKHART
                    She wrote it! She wrote the report.
                    She was in charge.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Is that true?
          
                              HANNA
                    No. And I didn't write the report.
                    Does it matter who did?
          
          RITA BECKHART has called out from her place. The JUDGE looks
          at HANNA a moment.
          
                                                                  55.
          
          
          
                              JUDGE
                    I need to see a sample of your
                    handwriting.
          
                              HANNA
                    My handwriting?
          
                              JUDGE
                    Yes. I need to establish who wrote
                    the report.
          
          At once HANNA'S COUNSEL rises.
          
                              HANNA'S COUNSEL
                    I'm sorry, but I really don't see
                    how that's appropriate. Nearly
                    twenty years have gone by.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Somebody take her this piece of
                    paper.
          
                              HANNA'S COUNSEL
                    Are you really going to compare
                    handwriting of twenty years ago,
                    with handwriting of today?
          
                              JUDGE
                    Give her the paper. Counsel,
                    approach the bench.
          
          A piece of paper and a pen are put down in front of HANNA.
          Her COUNSEL moves to the bench. MICHAEL stares, first at her,
          then at the pen and paper, an apprehension rising in him.
          
          INT & EXT. DAY AND NIGHT. FLASHBACKS
          
          MICHAEL thinks back, to HANNA in her bedroom saying `No you
          read', to her looking puzzled at the menu on the bicycle
          trip, and to her throwing a book away in the apartment. At
          this moment, MICHAEL realises she is illiterate.
          
          INT. COURTROOM. DAY
          
          Back in the courtroom, HANNA looks up to the JUDGE to stop
          the conference.
          
                              HANNA
                    There's no need. I wrote the
                    report.
          
                                                                  56.
          
          
          
          MICHAEL, in a panic, pushes along his row, past ROHL and the
          others, who all look up, knowing something is going on. HANNA
          turns, as if sensing him behind her.
          
          INT. STAIRS. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is sitting on the steps outside the lecture room.
          ROHL walks straight past him.
          
                              ROHL
                    You've been skipping seminars.
          
          INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY
          
          MICHAEL comes into the room and sits down, smoking a
          cigarette. ROHL waits.
          
                              ROHL
                    So?
          
          MICHAEL looks at him.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I have a piece of information.
                    Concerning one of the defendants.
                    Something they're not admitting.
          
                              ROHL
                    What information?
          
          MICHAEL stubs out his cigarette.
          
                              ROHL
                    You don't need me to tell you. It's
                    perfectly clear you have a moral
                    obligation to disclose it to the
                    court.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It happens this information is
                    favourable to the defendant. It can
                    help her case. It may even affect
                    the outcome, certainly the
                    sentencing.
          
                              ROHL
                    So?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    There's a problem. The defendant
                    herself is determined to keep this
                    information secret.
          
                                                                  57.
          
          
          
          Two STUDENTS come in for the seminar.
          
                              ROHL
                    A moment, please. Please.
          
          Chastened, they leave.
          
                              ROHL
                    What are her reasons?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Because she's ashamed.
          
                              ROHL
                    Ashamed? Ashamed of what?
          
          MICHAEL doesn't answer.
          
                              ROHL
                    Have you spoken to her?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Of course not.
          
                              ROHL
                    Why of course not?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I can't. I can't do that. I can't
                    talk to her.
          
                              ROHL
                    What we feel isn't important. It's
                    utterly unimportant. The only
                    question is what we do.
          
          ROHL gets up.
          
                              ROHL
                    If people like you don't learn from
                    what happened to people like me,
                    then what the hell is the point of
                    anything?
          
          INT. REMAND CELL. EVE
          
          HANNA is sitting on the edge of her bed. A GUARD comes to the
          door.
          
                              GUARD
                    You have a visitor. Michael Berg.
          
          HANNA is taken aback for a moment. Then she gets up.
          
                                                                    58.
          
          
          
          EXT. PRISON WAITING ROOM. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is standing smoking a cigarette in the waiting area.
          A whole number of visitors, old people, children, families
          are waiting. Some kids are playing with a football. Then a
          GUARD arrives and calls out names. MICHAEL's name is called.
          
          INT. MEETING ROOM. PRISON. DAY
          
          HANNA is led swiftly down a prison corridor towards her
          meeting and sat down at a desk to wait.
          
          EXT. PRISON YARD. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is led in the GROUP towards the visiting room. It has
          come on to snow. As he walks towards the room, he loses
          heart. He changes his mind. The rest of the GROUP go on, as
          he falls behind, watching them go. He begins to turn back.
          
          INT. MEETING ROOM. PRISON. DAY.
          
          HANNA sits down at the empty table, waiting.
          
          EXT. PRISON YARD. DAY
          
          MICHAEL turns away and heads back the way he came.
          
          INT. MEETING ROOM. PRISON. DAY
          
          HANNA looks round. Nobody is coming. She waits more.
          
                                 GUARD
                    Time's up.
          
          INT. PRISON. EVE
          
          HANNA is still waiting. Then she is led back to her cell.
          
          INT. MARTHE'S ROOM. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT
          
          MICHAEL appears at the door of MARTHE'S room. She is working
          at her desk. He smiles and closes the door.
          
                              MARTHE
                    You've taken your time.
          
          They kiss. She starts to pull his clothes off. He lets her.
          He makes no move to undress her. She takes all his clothes
          off until he is naked, and she remains clothed. He looks at
          her a moment, then takes her in his arms and they go down on
          the bed. They make love.
          
                                                                  59.
          
          
          
          INT. MARTHE'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          MARTHE is apparently asleep, MICHAEL awake. As quietly as he
          can MICHAEL tries to slip away.
          
                              MARTHE
                    Where are you going?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm sorry. I need to sleep by
                    myself.
          
          INT. REMAND CELL. DAWN
          
          HANNA is standing naked at the sink, preparing herself for
          the day.
          
          INT. STUDENT DIGS. MICHAEL'S ROOM. DAWN
          
          MICHAEL is lying in his own bed, staring up at the ceiling,
          not able to sleep. MICHAEL reluctantly pushes back the cover
          and gets naked out of bed. Slowly he begins to dress.
          
          INT. REMAND CELL. DAY
          
          HANNA washes herself, naked.
          
          INT. STUDENT DIGS. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is dressed now. He stands in front of his mirror,
          adjusting his tie.
          
          INT. REMAND CELL. DAY
          
          HANNA stands in front of the mirror, tying her tie. There is
          a small, inadequate mirror in which she checks her dress - a
          black suit, a white blouse and black tie. She looks very
          formal.
          
          INT. PRISON. DAY
          
          HANNA is led through the prison by a GUARD.
          
          EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY
          
          A lot of people heading into the courtroom. As the seminar
          group goes in, MICHAEL hangs back. ROHL looks at him as he
          goes through the doors. MICHAEL is left outside, then goes to
          watch as the vans arrive.
          
                                                                   60.
          
          
          
          INT. COURTROOM. TOWN HALL. DAY
          
          HANNA and the PRISONERS are led into the court. HANNA'S suit
          is so formal that members of the public call out. `Nazi!
          Nazi!' DIETER leans in to MARTHE. HANNA walks on to her
          place.
          
          INT. COURTROOM. DAY
          
          Everyone rises as the JUDGES come in to take their places.
          HANNA's face is resigned, without expression. The JUDGES sit.
          The whole court goes quiet.
          
                              JUDGE
                    The court finds guilty the
                    defendants Rita Beckhart, Karolina
                    Steinhof, Regina Kreutz, Angela
                    Zieber, Andrea Luhmann jointly
                    aiding and abetting murder in three
                    hundred cases. The court finds the
                    defendant Hanna Schmitz guilty of
                    murder in three hundred cases.
          
          There are tears in MICHAEL's eyes as he watches.
          
                              JUDGE
                    The court sentences the accused as
                    follows. Rita Beckhart, Karolina
                    Steinhof, Regina Kreutz, Angela
                    Zieber, and Andrea Luhmann, you
                    will each serve a total sentence in
                    prison of four years and three
                    months.
          
          ROHL, MARTHE, DIETER and the students are looking down on the
          sentencing. MICHAEL is crying.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Hanna Schmitz, in view of your own
                    admissions and your special role,
                    you are in a different category.
                    The court sentences the accused
                    Schmitz to imprisonment for life.
          
          HANNA is impassive, not reacting. Then she turns and looks up
          to the gallery.
          
          EXT. COURTHOUSE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL walks away through the cameras and news crews.
          
                                                                     61.
          
          
          
          INT. TRAIN. DAY
          
          MICHAEL sits on the train, thinking. The younger MICHAEL
          becomes the older.
          
          INT. TRAIN. DAY
          
          1976. MICHAEL is sitting beside JULIA. MICHAEL is 32, JULIA
          is a bright little 4 year-old in a coat. The countryside
          speeding by.
          
                              JULIA
                    Where are we going?
          
                               MICHAEL
                    I said : I'll tell you when we get
                    there. You told me you liked
                    surprises.
          
                              JULIA
                    I like surprises.
          
          EXT. BLUMENSTRASSE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL walks with JULIA towards their old house. He looks
          round, the memory of coming with HANNA as a sick boy 18 years
          earlier clear in his mind. The same landmarks.
          
          INT. DINING ROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAY
          
          They are all three eating at the dinner table, eating a small
          roast chicken.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    She's grown, hasn't she?
          
                              CARLA
                    I don't know. It's so long since I
                    saw her, Michael, how can I tell?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    My fault. We shouldn't have come
                    unannounced.
          
                              JULIA
                    Daddy, why's she angry?
          
          MICHAEL smiles. Even CARLA smiles slightly.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm afraid I've have some bad news.
                    Julia knows.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  62.
          
                              MICHAEL (cont'd)
                    We've already told her. Gertrud and
                    I are getting a divorce.
          
                              JULIA
                    Daddy's going to live in his own
                    house.
          
                              CARLA
                    You didn't come for your father's
                    funeral, but you come for this?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You know, it's not easy for me to
                    visit this town.
          
                              CARLA
                    Were you really so unhappy?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    That's not what I'm saying. It's
                    not what I meant.
          
                                 CARLA
                    Well then?
          
          CARLA looks at him hard.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You mustn't worry about Gertrud.
                    I'm going to look after her. And
                    anyway, let's face it, she's
                    already a state prosecutor, she
                    earns far more than I do.
          
                              CARLA
                    Michael, I'm not worried about
                    Gertrud. I'm worried about you.
          
          INT. TRAIN. EVE
          
          Exhausted by her day, JULIA is sleeping in MICHAEL'S arms. He
          looks down at her, full of love.
          
          EXT. SCHONEBERG. BERLIN. NIGHT
          
          On the other side of a busy Berlin street full of traffic,
          MICHAEL holds JULIA'S hand, a loving father, to guide her
          across the street.
          
          INT. LANDING. GERTRUD'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. NIGHT
          
          GERTRUD has come to the door, a shrewd-looking intelligent
          woman, a little older than MICHAEL, very thin, in slacks and
          a blouse. MICHAEL is standing outside with JULIA.
          
                                                                  63.
          
          
          
                              JULIA
                    Hello Mummy.
          
                              GERTRUD
                    Hello beautiful.
          
          GERTRUD leans down and scoops JULIA up, kisses her. MICHAEL
          stands on the step, hovering.
          
                              GERTRUD
                    Do you mind if I don't ask you in?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I don't mind at all. I've a lot to
                    do, in fact.
          
          It doesn't look like it. He stands, not going.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I took her to see where I grew up.
          
                              GERTRUD
                    You went to the West? My God, what
                    a trip.
          
                              JULIA
                    We went to say hello to granny.
          
                              GERTRUD
                    Oh. Daddy took you to see Carla,
                    did he?
          
                              JULIA
                    She was strange.
          
                              GERTRUD
                    Come on, let's see what's on TV.
          
          GERTRUD gives JULIA her supper and puts her in front of the
          TV. Then she comes back to MICHAEL.
          
                              GERTRUD
                    I bet she was strange.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You could say.
          
                              GERTRUD
                    She always was. Why on earth did
                    you decide to do that?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I don't know. Impulse.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          
          GERTRUD says nothing.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I suppose if I'm honest we went
                    because I wanted to re-establish
                    contact.
          
                              GERTRUD
                    With your mother? And did you
                    succeed?
          
          They both smile.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Are you all right?
          
          He touches her arm.
          
                              GERTRUD
                    Michael you're meant to be an
                    intelligent man. Don't you know,
                    it's very hard to receive contact
                    if you're not willing to give it?
          
          GERTRUD looks level, not unkind.
          
                              GERTRUD
                    Say goodbye to Julia.
          
                              JULIA
                    Goodbye, Daddy.
          
          MICHAEL turns to say goodbye.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. NIGHT
          
          MICHAEL standing in the empty room. It's eerily silent. He
          goes to his bookcase. He runs his fingers along the spines,
          as HANNA once did. He takes out a paperback of the Odyssey.
          He looks at it a moment, then he starts to read to himself.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    "Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the
                    man of twists and turns
                    Driven time and again off course,
                    once he had plundered
                    The hallowed heights of Troy...
          
          He sits back.

          INT. HANNA'S CELL. DAWN
          
          HANNA is in her cell, folding her blanket. She is 53, a new
          austerity, a greyness about her. Her cell is modern, but
          without decoration.
          
          INT. PRISON. CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          A GUARD comes along the corridor, calling out `Mail'. She
          leans into Hanna's cell to tell her she has mail. HANNA is
          obviously surprised.
          
          INT. MAIL ROOM. PRISON. DAY
          
          HANNA reports to the mail room where she is given a big
          parcel, which she is told to open. Inside, a huge batch of
          casette tapes and a tape machine.
          
          INT. CELL. DAY
          
          HANNA is opening the box, taking out the tapes.

          MICHAEL gets out a tape machine.
          
          INT. CELL. DAY
          
          In her cell HANNA takes out the machine.

          MICHAEL holds the microphone.

          In panic, she turns it off.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. EVE
          
          MICHAEL presses the recording button and speaks into the
          machine.
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The Odyssey by Homer.
                    "Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the
                    man of twists and turns
                    Driven time and again off course,
                    once he had plundered
                    The hallowed heights of Troy...
                    Many cities of men he saw and
                    learned their minds,
                    Many pains he suffered, heartsick
                    at the open sea,
                    Fighting to save his life and bring
                    his comrades home...
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
          
          Later. MICHAEL is now walking up and down, in his shorts and
          T-shirt, microphone in hand, still reading.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    "Ah, how shameless - the way these
                    mortals blame the gods.
                    From us alone, they say, come all
                    their miseries...
          
          INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          Middle of the night. MICHAEL is lying on his back, still
          reading.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    "Who are you? Where are you from?
                    Your city? Your parents?
                    I'm wonderstruck - you drank my
                    drugs, you're not bewitched..."
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY
          
          MICHAEL takes a cassette and puts it into a white box. He
          writes on the side ODYSSEY 6. Then he reaches up to put it on
          a shelf next to boxes separately marked ODYSSEY 1,2,3,4,5.
          Then he takes out a small notebook and cross-references the
          new tape in a handwritten list.
          
          INT. CELL. NIGHT
          
          It's dark. HANNA is lying on the bed.
          
                              MICHAEL'S VOICE
                    Zeus from the very start, the

                    His trustiest weapon women's
                    twisted wiles...
          
          HANNA smiles with pleasure at his reading.
          
          INT & EXT. MONTAGE. DAY & NIGHT
          
          A montage of MICHAEL reading and HANNA listening. MICHAEL is
          reading different books. He is animated now, excited. There
          are extracts from The Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway) ;
          Anatol (Schnitzler) ; The World of Yesterday (Zweig) and
          Doctor Zhivago (Pasternak). MICHAEL catching fire with
          excitement with what he is doing. HANNA collecting the tapes
          from the mail room and organizing on her shelves - her
          library growing.
          
          INT. CELL. NIGHT
          
          HANNA is lying in bed listening to a new tape.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The Lady with the Little   Dog, by
                    Anton Chekhov. "The talk   was that a
                    new face had appeared on   the
                    promenade, a lady with a   little
                    dog..."
          
          EXT. EXERCISE YARD. PRISON. DAY
          
          HANNA is walking round with other PRISONERS, in sequence.
          Suddenly she stops dead, an idea hitting her.
          
          INT. PRISON LIBRARY. DAY
          
          The library is right next to the mail room. HANNA walks past
          the mail room and goes to the library counter.
          
                              HANNA
                    I want to take out a book.
          
                              LIBRARIAN
                    Which book?
          
                              HANNA
                    Do you have The Lady with the
                    Little Dog?
          
                              LIBRARIAN
                    What's your name?
          
                              HANNA
                    Hanna Schmitz.
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
          
          The LIBRARIAN goes to get it. HANNA stands, waiting and looks
          at the stacks of books, for the first time seeing
          possibility.
          
          INT. CELL. DAY
          
          HANNA is back in the cell. She puts down a new parcel and a
          book. She puts the parcel to one side, then opens the book.
          She then winds back the tape which is already in the
          recorder.
          
                              MICHAEL'S VOICE
                    The Lady with the Little Dog, a
                    story by Anton Chekhov. The talk
                    was...
          
          She turns off the tape. She runs her finger along the title
          `The Lady with the Little Dog'. She gets down a small
          decorated metal tin, and takes a pencil from it. She starts
          making the sounds. `The', `the', `the'... L, L, L, etc.
          
          INT. CELL. NIGHT
          
          HANNA is working now, circling the word `the' each time it
          comes in the book. The book is covered in marks.
          
          EXT & INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. EVE
          
          1981. MICHAEL is coming down a busy Kreuzberg street. He is
          37. He goes into his block. He opens the door : the place is
          much more lived-in. He picks up his mail. Thumbing through
          it, he sees a letter in childish handwriting. MICHAEL frowns,
          opening it and taking out a piece of paper.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. EVE
          
          MICHAEL is holding a letter. He looks down at the writing :
          `Thanks for the latest, kid. I really liked it.' He stares,
          then puts it down and steps back stunned.
          
          INT. CELL. DAY
          
          HANNA stands with a new package. She opens it excitedly. She
          takes out tapes. She looks for writing, a letter. There is
          none. She turns the packing paper over and over, but there's
          nothing. She stands, desolate.
          
          INT. CELL. PRISON. NIGHT. MONTAGE
          
          HANNA effortfully writing various letters - just a single
          message on each. The pen working agonizingly across the
          paper. First :
          
                                                                     69.
          
          
          
          I WOULD LIKE MORE ROMANCE, LESS ADVENTURE

          MICHAEL continuing to read to her on the machine.
          
          INT. CELL. PRISON. NIGHT. MONTAGE
          
          HANNA still writing.
          
          DO YOU STILL LIKE DICKENS?
          
          Then finally, many attempts at the same sentence, written
          many times :
          
          DO YOU RECEIVE MY LETTERS? WRITE TO ME, KID
          
          INT. STUDY. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is reading the latest letter from HANNA. He looks at
          it. "Do you receive my letters? Write to me, kid." MICHAEL
          opens a drawer in a file box on the floor. There is a stack
          of her letters inside. He puts the latest on top of the pile
          and closes the drawer.
          
          INT. CELL. PRISON. DAY
          
          HANNA stands at her window, in despair.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY
          
          1988. MICHAEL, 44, is at his desk, with the phone in his
          hand, with a typed letter in front of him.
          
                              MS BRENNER (VOICE ON PHONE)
                    You're Michael Berg?
          
                                 MICHAEL'S VOICE
                    Yes.
          
                              MS BRENNER (VOICE ON PHONE)
                    You got my letter?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I have it here.
          
                              MS BRENNER (PHONE)
                    As I say, Hanna Schmitz is coming
                    up for release very soon.
          
                                                                     70.
          
          
          
          MICHAEL fingers the letter a moment.
          
          INT. BRENNER'S OFFICE. PRISON. DAY
          
          MS BRENNER is sitting at her desk in a simple, modern office.
          
                               MS BRENNER
                    Hanna has been in prison for over
                    twenty years. She has no family.
                    She has no friends. You're her only
                    contact. And I'm told you don't
                    visit her.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is sitting quite still.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No. I don't.
          
          INT. BRENNER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
                              MS BRENNER
                    When she gets out, she's going to
                    need a job. She's going to need
                    somewhere to live. You can't
                    imagine how frightening the modern
                    world will seem to her.
          
          There is a silence.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yes. I'm still here.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY
          
                              MS BRENNER
                    I have no-one else to ask. If you
                    don't take responsibility for her,
                    then Hanna has no future at all.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's kind of you. Thank you for
                    letting me know.
          
          MICHAEL puts the phone down. He looks as if he has just been
          handed a sentence. He gets up and stares at the wall which is
          now stacked with all the books he has read. Then he goes to
          his balcony.
          
          EXT & INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY
          
          MICHAEL stands looking out over Berlin from his balcony.
          
                                                                    71.
          
          
          
          EXT. PRISON. DAY
          
          MICHAEL walks along the road by the prison wall, then goes to
          the guichet to sign in.
          
          EXT. PRISON YARD. DAY
          
          MICHAEL is waiting in a small barred waiting area as MS
          BRENNER walks across the yard to open the gate and let
          MICHAEL in.
          
                              MS BRENNER
                    You're Michael Berg?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yes.
          
                              MS BRENNER
                    Louisa Brenner. We were expecting
                    you earlier.
          
          INT & EXT. STAIRS & PASSAGE. PRISON. DAY
          
          MS BRENNER is walking MICHAEL up the steps towards the prison
          canteen. They pass GUARDS and INMATES.
          
                              MS BRENNER
                    I should warn you: for a long time
                    Hanna held herself together. She
                    was very purposeful. In the last
                    few years she's different. She's
                    let herself go.
          
          INT. CANTEEN. PRISON. DAY
          
          MS BRENNER leads MICHAEL to the door of the canteen.
          
                              MS BRENNER
                    They're in the canteen. They're
                    just finishing lunch.
          
          MICHAEL sees an OLD WOMAN who is sitting at a table. Her blue
          dress is stretched too tight across her heavy body. Her hair
          is grey. She has a book in her lap, but she's not reading it.
          A few PRISONERS are finishing their meal.
          
          It takes MICHAEL a moment to realise the OLD WOMAN is HANNA.
          Then HANNA becomes aware of being watched. She turns and
          looks round. At once her face lights up. MICHAEL smiles back,
          but as he approaches her, he fixes onto her inquiring look
          and sees the light go out of her eyes, as if she has looked
          at him and been disappointed. He sits down opposite her. She
          smiles, weary.
          
                                                                  72.
          
          
          
                              HANNA
                    You've grown up, kid.
          
          She takes his hand. There is a long silence, MICHAEL unable
          to think of anything to say. He withdraws his hand.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I've got a friend who's a tailor,
                    he makes my suits. He'll give you a
                    job. And I've found you somewhere
                    to live. It's a nice place. Quite
                    small but nice. I think you'll like
                    it.
          
                                 HANNA
                    Thank you.
          
          There's a moment's silence.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    There are various social
                    programmes, cultural stuff I can
                    sign you up for. And there's a
                    public library very close.
          
          HANNA nods slightly.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You read a lot?
          
                              HANNA
                    I prefer being read to.
          
          There is a short silence.
          
                              HANNA
                    That's over now, isn't it?
          
          MICHAEL doesn't answer.
          
                              HANNA
                    Did you get married?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I did. Yes I did. We have a
                    daughter. I'm not seeing as much of
                    her as I would like. I'd like to
                    see a great deal more of her.
          
          After a few moments, he concedes.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The marriage didn't last.
          
                                                                  73.
          
          
          
          There is a silence.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Have you spent a lot of time
                    thinking about the past?
          
                              HANNA
                    You mean, with you?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No. No, I didn't mean with me.
          
                              HANNA
                    Before the trial I never thought
                    about the past. I never had to.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    And now? What do you feel now?
          
          HANNA looks a moment, a haunting look, searching him.
          
                              HANNA
                    It doesn't matter what I think. It
                    doesn't matter what I feel. The
                    dead are still dead.
          
          There's a silence.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I wasn't sure what you'd learnt.
          
                              HANNA
                    I have learnt, kid. I've learnt to
                    read.
          
          MICHAEL stares, devastated.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'll pick you up next week, OK?
          
                              HANNA
                    That sounds a good plan.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Good. Quietly, or shall we make a
                    big fuss?
          
                                HANNA
                    Quietly.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    OK. Quietly.
          
                                                                     74.
          
          
          
          They look at each other. The other PRISONERS have already
          gone. They stand up. She scans his face again, searching for
          his thoughts. He takes her in his arms, a little awkward.
          
                              HANNA
                    Take care, kid.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    You too.
          
          They walk side by side, back towards the door. Then by way of
          saying goodbye, she takes his hand.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    See you next week.
          
          She stretches her arm out before she lets go of his hand,
          then vanishes inside. MICHAEL walks on alone.
          
          EXT. PRISON. EVE
          
          MICHAEL comes out of the main entrance. He stands a moment,
          looking round at the evening. MICHAEL walks to his car.
          
          INT. HANNA'S ROOM. EVE
          
          The room is simple, a bedroom to one side, a bathroom to the
          other. It is all furnished with simple functional furniture.
          The end of a hard day's work. MICHAEL hangs a picture over
          the desk - a landscape, reminiscent of where they once went
          cycling. The job is done. He looks round, grimly content.
          
          INT. CELL. DAWN
          
          HANNA is lying on her bed, fully dressed. She gets up and
          gets some books down from the shelf. She puts them, one by
          one, in a pile on the table. Then she takes off her shoes.
          She stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table.
          Her bare feet on the books. Then she reaches up.
          
          EXT & INT. PRISON. DAY
          
          MICHAEL gets out of the car. He is carrying a bunch of
          flowers. He walks towards the prison. He leans in to the
          GUARD who is in a modern office.
          
          INT. PRISON. DAY
          
          From the far end of the corridor, MICHAEL is seen sitting on
          a bench. MS BRENNER comes out of her office and murmurs in
          his ear. MICHAEL is seen nodding, ashen.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          
          INT. CORRIDOR & CELL. PRISON. DAY
          
          The two of them come together down the corridor. They stop at
          the open door of the cell. The body has been removed. The
          books are still on the floor. MICHAEL goes in. A bare table,
          a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the
          door. There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed
          bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    She didn't pack. She never intended
                    to leave.
          
          MS BRENNER looks at him in confirmation. MICHAEL looks at the
          two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the
          cassette machine.
          
          Above the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from
          magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees.
          One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours. MICHAEL
          kneels on the bed to look at them. There are quotations,
          articles, recipes, even sayings in HANNA'S childish
          handwriting : `Spring lets its blue banner flutter through
          the air' is one. Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the
          young MICHAEL BERG receiving a prize from the school
          principal. The headline `Michael Berg receives school
          literature prize.'
          
          MS BRENNER reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf. Then she
          sits next to MICHAEL on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet
          of paper from her suit pocket.
          
                              MS BRENNER
                    She left me a message, a sort of
                    will. I'll read out the bit that
                    concerns you.
          
          MICHAEL looks at the effortful handwriting on the page.
          
                              MS BRENNER
                    "There is money in the old tea tin.
                    Give it to Michael Berg. He should
                    send it, alongside the 7,000 marks
                    in the bank, to the daughter who
                    wrote the book. It's for her. She
                    should decide what to do with it.
                    And tell Michael I said hello. Tell
                    him to get on with his life."
          
          MS BRENNER looks at him.
          
                              MS BRENNER
                    Do you want to see her?
          
                                                                  76.
          
          
          
          MICHAEL shakes his head.
          
          EXT. BRIDGE. MANHATTAN. DAY
          
          MICHAEL rides in a taxi into Manhattan. A view of the
          familiar skyline.
          
          EXT. FIFTH AVENUE. DAY
          
          MICHAEL'S taxi comes up Fifth Avenue. It draws up outside an
          expensive apartment block. MICHAEL gets out and goes in, the
          Manhattan skyline opening up behind him.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM. ILANA'S APARTMENT. DAY
          
          A superbly appointed space full of great and expensive art.
          MICHAEL has taken his coat off. ILANA MATHER appears,
          elegant, well-dressed - on the surface, the spirit of
          prosperous New York. She is now in her early fifties.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Ms Mather?
          
                              ILANA
                    Yes. You're Michael Berg. I was
                    expecting you.
          
                              ILANA
                    So you must tell me: what exactly
                    brings you to the United States?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I was already here. I was at a
                    conference in Boston.
          
                              ILANA
                    You're a lawyer?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yes.
          
                              ILANA
                    I was intrigued by your letter but
                    I can't say I wholly understood it.
                    You attended the trial?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yes. Almost twenty years ago. I was
                    a law student. I remember you, I
                    remember your mother very clearly.
          
                                                          77.
          
          
          
                              ILANA
                    My mother died in Israel - a good
                    many years ago.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'm sorry.
          
          MICHAEL hesitates for a moment.
          
                              ILANA
                    Go on, please.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Perhaps you heard. Hanna Schmitz
                    recently died. She killed herself.
          
          ILANA shakes her head.
          
                              ILANA
                    She was a friend of yours?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    A kind of friend. It's as simple as
                    this. Hanna was illiterate for the
                    greater part of her life.
          
                               ILANA
                    Is that an explanation of her
                    behaviour?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No.
          
                              ILANA
                    Or an excuse?
          
          MICHAEL shakes his head.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No. No. She taught herself to read
                    when she was in prison. I sent her
                    tapes. She'd always liked being
                    read to.
          
          ILANA shifts slightly.
          
                              ILANA
                    Why don't you start by being honest
                    with me? At least start that way.
                    What was the nature of your
                    friendship?
          
                                                                78.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    When I was young I had an affair
                    with Hanna.
          
          ILANA looks at him for a moment.
          
                              ILANA
                    I'm not sure I can help you, Mr.
                    Berg. Or rather, even if I could
                    I'm not willing to.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I was almost sixteen when I took up
                    with her. The affair only lasted a
                    summer. But.
          
                                ILANA
                    But what?
          
          MICHAEL just looks at her.
          
                               ILANA
                    I see. And did Hanna Schmitz
                    acknowledge the effect she'd had on
                    your life?
          
          MICHAEL stares back, understood for the first time.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    She'd done much worse to other
                    people. I've never told anyone.
          
                              ILANA
                    People ask all the time what I
                    learned in the camps. But the camps
                    weren't therapy. What do you think
                    these places were? Universities? We
                    didn't go there to learn. One
                    becomes very clear about these
                    things.
          
          ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.
          
                              ILANA
                    What are you asking for?
                    Forgiveness for her? Or do you just
                    want to feel better yourself? My
                    advice, go to the theatre, if you
                    want catharsis. Please. Go to
                    literature. Don't go to the camps.
                    Nothing comes out of the camps.
                    Nothing.
          
                                                                  79.
          
          
          
          ILANA looks at him, unrelenting.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What she wanted...what she wanted
                    was to leave you her money. I have
                    with me.
          
                              ILANA
                    To do what?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    As you think fit.
          
          MICHAEL reaches for his briefcase. He takes out the lavender
          tea-tin, which he sets down on the table in front of ILANA.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Here.
          
          ILANA lifts the tin.
          
                              ILANA
                    When I was a little girl, I had a
                    tea-tin for my treasures. Not quite
                    like this. It had Cyrillic
                    lettering. I took it with me to the
                    camp, but it got stolen.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What was in it?
          
                              ILANA
                    Oh. Sentimental things. A piece of
                    hair from our dog. Some tickets to
                    operas my father had taken me to.
                    It wasn't stolen for its contents.
                    It was the tin itself which was
                    valuable, what you could do with
                    it.
          
          She sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin.
          
                              ILANA
                    There's nothing I can do with this
                    money. If I give it to anything
                    associated with the extermination
                    of the Jews, then to me it will
                    seem like absolution and that is
                    something I'm neither willing nor
                    in a position to grant.
          
          MICHAEL nods slightly.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I was thinking maybe an
                    organization to encourage literacy.
          
                                ILANA
                    Good.
          
          There's a silence.
          
                                ILANA
                    Good.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Do you know if there's a Jewish
                    organization?
          
                              ILANA
                    I'll be surprised if there isn't.
                    There's a Jewish organisation for
                    everything. Not that illiteracy is
                    a very Jewish problem.
          
          There is the shadow of a smile.
          
                               ILANA
                    Why don't you find out? Send them
                    the money.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Shall I do it in Hanna's name?
          
                              ILANA
                    As you think fit.
          
          ILANA smiles slightly. She puts her hand on top of the tin.
          
                              ILANA
                    I'll keep the tin.
          
          INT. ILANA'S HOUSE. DAY
          
          ILANA is standing at the window watching down to the street
          where MICHAEL is walking away. She has the tin in her hand.
          When he's vanished, she turns and goes into her bedroom.
          There on the dressing table, there is a framed photo of ILANA
          with her mother in Germany before the war. She sets the tin
          down beside the photo.
          
          INT & EXT. CAR. DAY
          
          1995. MICHAEL is driving JULIA in the big Mercedes through
          the German countryside. He is tense, silent. JULIA takes a
          sideways look at him, but he does not respond.
          
                                                                     81.
          
          
          
                              JULIA
                    Where are we going?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I thought you liked surprises.
          
                              JULIA
                    I do. I do like surprises.
          
          EXT. COUNTRY. DAY
          
          They draw up at a church. It is the same one he and HANNA
          passed on their bicycles years before. MICHAEL and JULIA get
          out and walk towards the graveyard at the side.
          
          EXT. CEMETERY. DAY
          
          MICHAEL & JULIA stand at a deserted grave-side. The whole
          cemetery is seen. MICHAEL stoops down and uncovers a simple
          stone : HANNA SCHMITZ 1923-1988. JULIA watching, says her
          name.
          
                              JULIA
                    Hanna Schmitz.
          
          JULIA waits a moment.
          
                              JULIA
                    Who was she?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    That's what I wanted to tell you.
                    That's why we're here.
          
          JULIA looks, waiting. MICHAEL looks for a moment as if he
          will not go on.
          
                              JULIA
                    So tell me.
          
          There is a moment, then they turn to stroll, MICHAEL talking,
          starting to tell the story.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I was 15, I was coming home from
                    school, I was ill...
          
          They walk away among the trees.
          
          
          
                                                     FADE TO BLACK

1   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT                 1

    It's very late. It's quiet. Just the sounds of The City

    LINDA SANTANA CRAIG, an attractive Hispanic woman in her
    thirties, waits at the ELEVATED STATION for the F train.

    Linda looks great. She's dressed festively but tastefully.
    Next to her is her eleven year old DAUGHTER, ALICIA. She is
    twirling about the platform, still jazzed from the birthday
    party they attended in The City.

    Alicia wears a black dress with a pink cardigan and has a pink
    handbag. We notice a CHARM BRACELET with four-leaf clovers on
    her right wrist.

    The mother and daughter wait alone at one end of the station
    platform.

    TWO TEENAGE BOYS wait at the other end. They speak soft,
    SLURRED SPANISH to each other.

    Linda gives the boys a glance and evaluates. She watches them
    as Alicia spits a wad of gum into her mom's open hand.

    The Boys approach. Linda tenses. At the last second the boys
    make a hard left turn and disappear down the stairwell. It's
    quiet again. Linda relaxes, smiles at her daughter. The F
    TRAIN is rounding the final bend into the station.

    Their focus is on this train. It's getting closer, louder.

    And so they don't see, don't hear the Boys coming back up the
    stairwell behind them.

    Not until the boys have the mother and daughter boxed in and
    the one who can hardly grow a mustache is showing them his
    gun.

    Linda puts her arm around her daughter. Alicia looks
    terrified.

    The train roars INTO THE STATION as Linda quickly hands over
    her purse, her watch. She hands over her engagement ring and
    her wedding band.

    One of the boys yanks Alicia's little purse away from her.

    The other boy fumbles the wedding band. The ring CLANGS to
    the ground and rolls to a stop a few feet away.

    We hear MEN'S VOICES echoing up the stairwell.

    Now the Boys are boxed in. And starting to panic.
                                                                2.


    -- THE TRAIN DOORS SLIDE OPEN --.

    The Boys see their way out and step into the last empty rail
    car, leaving the mother and daughter alone on the platform.

    Through the window on the train, Linda stares at the boy
    holding her daughter's purse, her face hardening into a MASK
    OF CONTEMPT.

    The boy clocks it. Who does she think she is?

    -- THE TRAIN DOORS BEGIN TO CLOSE --

    When a HAND WITH TATTOOED KNUCKLES reaches out and stops the
    car doors from closing.

    A forearm and gun extend out of that last subway car ...
    There's a muzzle flash... a distant POP... a cloud of smoke
    ... a mist of blood... and Linda's body collapses on itself.

    Alicia's face, shock, terror and blood.


2   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- LATER THAT NIGHT --   M.O.S        2

    A WORKING CRIME SCENE, lots of uniforms and light, a white
    sheet draped over Linda's body where it fell.

    BLUE AND RED LIGHT dances against the stairwell wall where a
    man is taking the stairs two at a time. Late thirties, big,
    plain clothes, he is SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG. When he reaches
    the platform, he stops.

    Craig kneels before the white sheet. Peels it back. We stay
    on him. We don't see what he sees. We just see how he sees
    it. Then he turns...

    THE WEDDING BAND. It's been tagged and numbered as evidence.
    Craig picks it right out of the chalk outline and slips it
    into his pocket.

    Alicia, wrapped in a blanket, standing next to a round police
    MATRON. The Matron is tenderly trying to clean Alicia's face.
    Alicia locks eyes with Craig and stumbles towards him, her
    legs not quite working.

    Craig saves her from the stumble and envelops her, lifting
    her as the blanket falls to the ground.

    Alicia makes little gasping noises. Trying to speak but
    can't.

    Craig walking back now, carrying his entire world. He reaches
    the stairwell and suddenly falls to one knee. Alicia gasps.
                                                                3.


    The closest UNIFORM puts a hand on his arm. A moment.
    Composure. A deep breath. Then as quickly as he went down,
    he's back up.

    Craig looks back now, taking it all in. Is it real? Sees all
    the cops looking at him, then begins down the stairs.

    WE DRIFT UP above the station until we find ourselves with a
    clear view of the southern tip of Manhattan, where the TWIN
    TOWERS STAND TALL.


3   INT. LOWER EAST SIDE RAILROAD FLAT -- BEDROOM -- MORNING        3

    SUBTITLE: "Eight Years Later"

    Tiny kitchen, clutter, a MESSENGER BIKE hanging from hooks on
    the wall, a lot of books. There is a PHONE RINGING under the
    bed.

    TYLER ROTH, early twenties, handsome, looking haggard. He is
    sitting on the floor, shirtless, bed head, wrapped in a
    blanket. A GUITAR is on his lap. Tyler has propped some well
    worn, hand written pages of MUSIC against a box of off-brand
    laundry detergent and is squinting at the notes, frustration
    etched in his face.

    A forgettable BLONDE lies sleeping on the bed.

    Tyler, not a born musician, is trying to teach himself one of
    the PHRASES OF MUSIC in front of him. He is completely lost
    in the moment, with DEEP GROOVES in his fingers. By the
    ASHTRAY next to him, we can tell he's been at this a couple
    of hours.

    The Blonde in the bed re: the ringing phone...

                        BLONDE
                  (out of it)
              Hello?

    Tyler gropes around the floor with one hand until he finds the
    phone, simultaneously glancing at the digital clock. His eyes
    widen in alarm.

                        TYLER
              Yeah...
                  (listens)
              Of course. I'm on my way. I
              know...I know...I know...I know.

    Tyler climbs out of his blanket and yanks on a pair of dark
    suit pants. Before he pulls on his white undershirt we
    observe a TATTOO that simply says "Michael" over his heart.
                                                                 4.


    He searches through a beat-up chest of drawers, seeking a
    reasonably clean button down shirt...

                        TYLER V/O
              Gandhi said that whatever you do in
              life will be insignificant but it
              is very important that you do it...

    ...And scrubs at a mysterious stain on the shoulder of an
    expensive but worn to hell suit jacket with a dishwasher
    brush.

                        TYLER V/O
              ...I tend to agree with the first
              part.


4   EXT. GREEN WOOD CEMETERY --BROOKLYN -- LATER                     4

    A cluster of MOURNERS stand before a tombstone in the
    distance. They are not in funeral dress, as this is not a
    funeral. It's a memorial.

    A beat up GYPSY CAB with a WEST INDIAN DRIVER pulls to a
    stop. From the trees and the sky we know its LATE
    SPRING/EARLY SUMMER. A gorgeous day.

    Tyler gets out of the cab, holding the rim of his empty
    coffee cup in his teeth. He sorts a rumpled wad of singles
    and hands some to the driver, who screeches into reverse.
    Time is money.

    Tyler crushes the coffee cup flat and slips it in his jacket
    pocket then lights up a smoke. He takes one long drag then
    extinguishes it and slips the butt into his pocket. He begins
    towards the mourners.

    His mother... DIANE HOFFMAN, a beauty. Past burdens etched in
    the lines on her face. Dressed tastefully in expensive
    bohemian. She smiles like someone who's been crying but
    doesn't want anyone to know she has.

                        TYLER
                  (sweetly)
              Hello, your majesty. How are you?

                        DIANE
              I'm fine... you look good...

    He kisses his mother's hand and he's moving to greet his
    stepfather...

    LES HOFFMAN, Unruly curls streaked in gray, tweed jacket and
    tie. They exchange a firm handshake and muttered hellos.
                                                              5.


    The weight of Tyler's gaze falls to CAROLINE ROTH, his
    diminutive bespectacled, eleven year old sister. She's
    holding a little paper bag.

    She flashes him a look. He kneels besides her and whispers...

                        TYLER
              Thanks for organizing everybody.

    Caroline makes a face. Turns her nose away from him.

                        CAROLINE
              You smell like Listerine and beer.

    He snorts and kisses her cheek.

    Caroline reaches into her bag and takes out a handful of
    smooth white stones, on which she has painted the names:
    "Mom" "Tyler" "Les", "Dad", "Caroline". She begins to arrange
    them in a little circle on the grave.

    Tyler's father...

    CHARLES ROTH, late fifties, breathes power, precisely
    dressed, two hundred dollar haircut. A predator.

                        CHARLES
                  (aside, to Tyler)
              You couldn't wear a tie?

    Tyler holds his father's eye.

                        TYLER
              Could have.

    Beat.

    Charles adjusts his own collar like it's an explosive.

    POV: The Tombstone. The four adult family members stand side-
    by-side. They look like strangers on the subway as Caroline
    sits on the ground, arranging the stones.


5   INT. JUNIOR'S RESTAURANT-- BROOKLYN -- AFTER                  5

    The family sits together in a booth. Tyler rolls a Bic
    lighter over his knuckles. Caroline draws a funny portrait of
    Tyler on her napkin. He is smoking nine cigarettes at once.
    Diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention. Les is
    eyeing the Cheesecake. Charles subtly aligns his silverware.
                                                             6.


                    DIANE
          ...This is nice... I think it's
          nice that we still do this...

                       CAROLINE
                 (gently)
          Mom.

                    DIANE
          I forgot. I'm trying to purge
          "nice" from my vocabulary. Michael
          would like that we still do this.

Tyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Without saying a word
his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass.

                    DIANE
              (to Caroline)
          Did you tell Tyler what your art
          teacher said about your portrait?

Caroline, as bemused as an eleven year old can be, looks at
her mother, then at her brother. She adopts a very motherly
tone.

                    CAROLINE
          Tyler, did I tell you what my art
          teacher said about my portrait?

                    TYLER
          Why no, Caroline. What did your art
          teacher say about your portrait?

                    DIANE
              (smiling)
          You two. I quit.

She flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes Les'
hand.

                    CAROLINE
          ...She was very impressed. She said
          I captured a moment like a young
          James Whistler.

The WAITRESS brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to
the table. Les dives in. Charles is having toast. He sips a
glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his Patek
Phillippe.
                                                             7.


                    TYLER
          Young Whistler... good... 'cause
          Whistler really fell off late in
          his career. He's the Michael
          Jackson of European art history.

                    DIANE
          She suggested your sister take
          Pratt's Summer Art Intensive and
          that's hugely prestigious.

Caroline looks a bit sheepish, Tyler high fives Caroline.

Diane, again, flickers a glance at Charles.

                    CAROLINE
          I would be the youngest one, ever,
          practically...

                    CHARLES
          Tyler, would you please pass the
          butter?

Beat.

                    DIANE
          Caroline was speaking.

                    TYLER
              (to Charles)
          Are you really this clueless? Are
          you really dismissing her like
          this?

Diane touches Caroline's hair.

                    CHARLES
          Caroline is perfectly capable of
          speaking up if she is feeling
          dismissed. Caroline, are you
          feeling dismissed?

                      CAROLINE
          I'm okay.

                    CHARLES
              (solicitous, to Caroline)
          I didn't mean to change the
          subject.

                    TYLER
          What was the subject?
                                                              8.


                           CHARLES
              Excuse me?

                        TYLER
              The subject we were discussing.
              What was it?

    Beat.

                        CHARLES
              Now's not the time for your heroics
              Tyler

                        TYLER
              No. It's the perfect time.

    Charles makes a minute adjustment to his collar.

    Father and son lock eyes until...

                        TYLER
                  (whispering, to Caroline)
              Do you need me to take you
              anywhere?

    Caroline shakes her head.

                        CAROLINE
              I'll stay with mom.

    Diane glares at her ex-husband.

    Tyler rises and kisses his sister's forehead.

                        TYLER
              Then I'll see you after school.

                           CAROLINE
              Kay.

    He exits as Caroline sips her lemonade, avoiding everybody's
    eyes.


6   INT. SUBWAY CAR -- JUST AFTER                                 6

    Tyler standing although there are a few seats available. The
    car window strobes behind him. He takes off his jacket and
    button down and ties them both around his waist.
                                                                  9.


7   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER                             7

    Tyler in his pants and white tee shirt looks completely out
    of place amidst all the business types.

    He sits in the last booth facing the street. His tattered
    JOURNAL lies open in front of him, a BINDER CLIP holds his
    page as he works quietly crafting an entry.

    The HOSTESS, tired, in her 60's, slides a piece of baklava on
    the table as she shuffles past.

                        HOSTESS
              Eat something.

    Tyler gives her a huge grin.

                        TYLER
              Yes, ma'am.


8   EXT. 4TH STREET -- JUST AFTER                                     8

    Tyler and his roommate, AIDAN BREWER, 22, energetic,
    inappropriate, walking west towards N.Y.U. Young people in
    easy, summery dress. Tyler smokes. Aidan doesn't. Aidan
    remembers something, smirks.

                        AIDAN
              I sold your girlfriend a
              toothbrush.

                        TYLER
              You sold my who? ...What?

                        AIDAN
              That voluptuous, delightfully
              oblivious little blonde you left in
              your bed this morning... I sold her
              a toothbrush. Got three bucks.

                        TYLER
              ...Congratulations?

                        AIDAN
              Are in order, yes. Because that
              sale inspired our newest business
              venture: "The S.L.U.T."

                        TYLER
              I was unaware we had a previous
              business venture.
                                       10.


          AIDAN
The 'Single Lady's Universal Tote'.
It's the one-night-stand travel
pack for women. We throw in some
make-up, toiletries, cell phone
charger, cab numbers. Retail it at
S19.95, maybe do an infomercial.

          TYLER
And you think women would buy this?
With money?

          AIDAN
Hey one-night-stands happen... It's
a part of life... like stubbing
your toe. Sometimes you misjudge a
corner and bend back your pinky
toe, other times you wake up in a
freshman dorm wearing a field
hockey tee shirt wondering why your
balls smell like cinnamon...

          TYLER
    (nodding sagely)
Of course. Yes.

          AIDAN
Don't underestimate the novelty
gift market. Think about it...
instead of giving that token slutty
friend a ten-inch purple dildo for
her birthday, you hook her up with
"The SLUT." Everyone has a laugh
and the implication that she'll
probably use it someday remains.
What do you say? Are you down?

          TYLER
I'm down with getting you on some
sort of medication.

          AIDAN
OK...fine...be cynical...just
remember at some point in history
two people had a conversation just
like this about the light bulb. One
of them went on to fame and fortune
and the other one probably went to
work at Mickey D's or something.

          TYLER
Or Denny's. Denny's was big in the
19th century.
                                                              11.


9    EXT. COBBLE HILL -- MORNING                                   9

     A TINTED TOWN CAR stops in-front of a funky corner brownstone
     where Caroline waits in a plaid jumper on the front steps.
     THE DRIVER opens the back door of the car.


10   INT. TOWN CAR. (DRIVING) -- LATER                         10

     Caroline in the cavernous backseat alone. Her pink knapsack
     her only company.

     The Town Car stops at a crosswalk for a GROUP OF CHILDREN in
     jeans and tee- shirts on their way to a local Public School.
     Caroline sees them through the tinted glass. They couldn't
     see her even if they wanted to.

                         PROFESSOR (O.S.)
               It's an unfortunate reality but a
               reality nonetheless ...


11   INT. LECTURE HALL -- NYU --DAY                            11

     TYLER sits in the back of the room. Their PROFESSOR addresses
     the few students paying attention.

                         PROFESSOR
               ...in the wake of terrorist attacks
               these insurance company actuaries
               are provided a unique opportunity
               to raise premiums and profits to
               protect against events that will
               likely never occur again...

     One girl, a focused brunette with beautiful eyes, takes notes
     relentlessly. She is present, absorbing the material. She
     raises her hand.

                         GIRL
               Isn't that also an ethical
               question?

     Tyler shoots her a glance. He takes in her lovely face, her
     casual dress, and the CHARM BRACELET with its four leaf
     clovers. WE REALIZE this is Alicia "Ally" Craig, now 19.

     Tyler grimaces at the question and its implications of hope.


12   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- AFTERNOON                            12

     At the Alice in Wonderland statue where KIDS climb all over
     the faded bronze mushroom caps and characters.
                                                         12.


The statue is warm, the bronze absorbing the late spring sun.
Tyler is perched on the Mad Hatter, his face turned towards
the sun while Caroline hides with the dormouse.

Tyler lights a cigarette. AN UPTIGHT MOMMY glares at him.

                    UPTIGHT MOMMY
          Why don't we make this a non-
          smoking statue?

                    CAROLINE
              (emerging)
          Yeah, Tyler . Why don't we make
          this a non-smoking statue?

He makes a face.

                    CAROLINE
          You promised you'd quit...

                    TYLER
          I know.

                    CAROLINE
          You're gonna get emphysema and then
          you're gonna have to drag an oxygen
          tank with you everywhere...

                    TYLER
          You think that would be the worst
          part about having emphysema?

                    CAROLINE
          Everywhere you go, Tyler. Even the
          bathroom.

Tyler takes a final drag. Tosses it on the ground.

                    CAROLINE
          Why do you think Dad doesn't
          wanna...like, listen to me?

                    TYLER
          Dad loves you.

Caroline gives him a look.

                    CAROLINE
          So? You can love someone and not
          want to spend any time with them.

Caroline is climbing around Alice. Her hands on Alice's hair.
                                                                13.


                         TYLER
               You've got that right.

                         CAROLINE
               Mom loves Aunt Sara. But at
               Christmas, last year, she wouldn't
               let Les leave them in a room
               together 'cause she said there
               would be a "yule tide homicide."

                         TYLER
               That's because Aunt Sara drinks...
               You don't drink, right?

                            CAROLINE
               Duh.

                         TYLER
               So why would anyone wanna avoid
               you?

     Caroline shrugs, not convinced. A silent moment passes.

                         CAROLINE
               Michael used to drink.

                         TYLER
               Yeah. He did. But Michael was 21.
               All 21 year olds drink because it's
               new and exciting. Aunt Sara drinks
               because she wishes she was 21.

     A shared smile.

                            CAROLINE
               You're 21.

     Tyler's smile fades.


13   INT. THE STRAND BOOKSTORE -- DAY                            13

     Tyler on a rolling ladder, shuffling books around. Aidan on
     the floor, eating two pieces of pizza, folded down the
     middle, at the same time.

                         AIDAN
               What about Atlantic City for your
               birthday this year? Get a suite.
               Couple of ladies. You could call
               Toothbrush Girl, what do you think?

                         TYLER
               I think I'd rather be sodomized.
                                                         14.


                    AIDAN
          Hey, it's your day.

He gestures to the shelves.

                    AIDAN
          What's the point? How do you know
          where anything is in this place,
          anyway? There's like...

                    AIDAN/TYLER
          "Eight Miles of Books!"

                    TYLER
          I don't expect you to appreciate
          this, but the schematic for this
          particular shelf is authors who
          were sleeping together...

                     AIDAN
          No shit?

                    TYLER
          And ended up dead or in prison.

Beat.

                    AIDAN
          This is why chicks dig you.

Tyler laughs.

                    AIDAN
          Seriously. They like this freaky
          poetic crap. I ran into Megan
          yesterday. She's bartending at Don
          Hill's tonight. She wants us to
          stop by. She practically begged me.

                     TYLER
          Eh.

Aidan, visibly frustrated with Tyler's reluctance, grabs the
rolling ladder and pushes Tyler into the Romance novels.

                     TYLER
          Hey!

                    AIDAN
          Hey nothing. You've been a ghost
          the past couple weeks. You never
          wanna go out. I'm feeling
          unappreciated here.
                    (MORE)
                                                                 15.

                         AIDAN (cont'd)
               I can't deal with this brooding
               introvert shit anymore man. I'm
               ready to set up an intervention.

     A silent moment passes.

                         TYLER
               You realize interventions typically
               discourage binge drinking?

                         AIDAN
               One drink. Come out for one drink.

                         TYLER
               When's the last time you had one
               drink?


14   INT. DON HILL'S -- THAT NIGHT                                14

     A hip venue on Greenwich Street. Deejay. Music pumping.
     Aidan and Tyler make their way through the crowd to a
     congested bar where the CUTE BARTENDER is swamped.

                         AIDAN
               Hey, Megan!

     She ignores him.

                          AIDAN
               You look great! Can I get two
               Heinekens?

                         MEGAN
               Do. Not. Speak.

     Tyler snorts with laughter.

                         AIDAN
                   (genuine)
               Is she mad at me or something?

                         TYLER
               No no. Girls are like that when
               they're way into you.

                            AIDAN
               Oh.

     Two nubile young GIRLS approach Aidan. Tap his shoulder.

                            GIRL #1
               Excuse me?
                                                                 16.


     Aidan flashes a winning smile.

                         AIDAN
               Well, hello...

                         GIRL #1
               Could you take a picture for us?

     She holds out her camera. Aidan hesitates, then smiles.

                         AIDAN
               My pleasure...

     The girls pose. Aidan takes the camera. Turns it around.
     Extends it. Smiles. And promptly SNAPS A PICTURE OF HIMSELF.
     He casually returns the camera to the confused young woman.

     Megan returns and practically flings the beers at Aidan.

                         AIDAN
               Thanks. You've met my roommate...

                         MEGAN
               I hope you die.

     Tyler laughs his ass off.

                         TYLER
               She's all over you. Cheers.

     They clink bottles.


15   EXT. GREENWICH STREET -- LATE NIGHT                          15

     Tyler and Aidan stand with the girls from Aidan's photo
     opportunity. All are thoroughly intoxicated. There is a knot
     of CLUB GOERS halfway down the block, drinking and having a
     fine time.

                         AIDAN
               I love this street. I love this
               city. Where are you guys from,
               again?

                           AIDAN'S GIRL
               Miami.

                         AIDAN
               Miami. Miami, Barcelona, Rio. New
               York is it, man. God broke the mold
               when he made this city.
                                                          17.


                    TYLER
          You ever actually been to any of
          those places?

                    AIDAN
          What's your point?

There's a gust of wind. Aidan's girl shivers. She's wearing a
tiny dress.

                    AIDAN'S GIRL
          What are we doing? I'm freezing.

                    AIDAN
          Shoulda worn a jacket. Like me.

O/S WE HEAR: a beer bottle crashing on the ground, and from
far away a ghostly, plaintive girl's voice disappearing into
the night...

                    VOICE O/S
          Michael...Mi-i-chael!

Tyler turns towards the sound. It's as if he's trying to spot
a train in the distance. His hand goes to his pocket and
fishes out his pack of cigarettes.

                    AIDAN'S GIRL
              (to Aidan)
          Asshole.

She walks away, looking back at her friend, annoyed.

                    AIDAN'S GIRL
          Are you coming?

Tyler's Girl looks at Tyler, who is still preoccupied.

                    TYLER'S GIRL
              (to her friend)
          Hold on, Lauren.

The girls step away. Tyler's Girl appears to be trying to
convince her friend to stay. Aidan watches them, hopefully.

Tyler isn't watching them. He's watching two cool looking
MUSICIANS, crossing the street with the LIGHT, carrying SOUND
EQUIPMENT.

A quartet of NEANDERTHALS pulls up at the light in front of
them in a car, aggressive music playing. The Neanderthal at
the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch
the car forward, startling the musicians, toying with them.
                                                         18.


MUSICIAN #1 glares, but gives no further response, he just
wants to get across the street. The Neanderthal revs and
lurches again.

MUSICIAN #2 slams his hand on the hood of the car.

                    MUSICIAN#2
          What's your problem?

                    NEANDERTHAL DRIVER
          My problem? Keep your hands off my
          car, asshole.

                    MUSICIAN#2
          Blow it out your ass, Guido.

                    MUSICIAN#1
          Go back to Long Island.

The car's four doors open, and the Neanderthals lope to the
front of the car. The driver is holding a mini baseball bat
at his side.

                    NEANDERTHAL DRIVER
          I'm from Queens, faggot

A Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver
starts wailing on the other with the bat. Tyler watches as
the Neanderthals overpower them. The altercation has turned
into a full on assault. The Musicians are getting stomped
into the pavement.

                    TYLER'S GIRL
          So we were thinking we could go...

Tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her.

                    AIDAN
              (under his breath)
          God damn it.

Aidan runs off after Tyler.

Tyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing
the beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the
guy's face. He fights like a pit bull. Not feeling, not
stopping.

Aidan gets punched in the face. Tyler elbows the nose of the
guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood. Then someone hits
Tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the
chin. The musicians get back to their feet and fight back.
It's a brawl.
                                                                19.


     Aidan's girl is screaming for the cops. Tyler's girl,
     following the instincts of the inebriated, has teetered near
     enough to the brawl to imperil herself.

     A Neanderthal swings at Aidan and misses, grazing the girl.
     She jerks away in her high heels and crashes to the pavement,
     splitting her lip on impact. Tyler head butts the guy.


16   EXT. SIDE STREET -- LATER                                   16

     An AMBULANCE and TWO E.M.T.'S are on site.

     THE COMBATANTS from the brawl are lined up on the curb.

     SERGEANT JAMES CRAIG, a little older and heavier than when we
     first met him at the train station, is standing with the
     Girl, who is a mess. Her nose bloody, her dress torn.

     Craig shields the Girl with his body, listening carefully to
     her and her friend as the two girls GESTURE ANGRILY at the
     Neanderthals. Craig's eyes flicker in the same direction.

     Craig's PARTNER, LEO, AFRICAN AMERICAN, a few years younger,
     is on the radio to Dispatch.

     Craig snaps his fingers at one of the E.M.T.'s and receives a
     blanket, which he carefully wraps around the girl. Then, to
     his partner, indicating Tyler and Aidan...

                         CRAIG
               Cut those two loose.

     Leo puts down the handset and uncuffs the guys.

                         LEO
                   (quiet)
               Take a walk.

     Tyler takes a beat, looking at the lineup. Aidan, rubbing his
     wrists, gestures "Let's go". Tyler looks at the bloodied Girl
     and...

     Craig, going through the pockets of Neanderthal #1.

                         CRAIG
               Anything in here that's going to
               stab me, Einstein?

     Craig finds a packet, or a vial.

                         CRAIG
               Nice. You like to get high and hit
               women?
                                                            20.


Aidan gives Tyler's elbow a gentle tug. Tyler's caught up in
the action.

                    NEANDERTHAL#1
          I don't even know the bitch.

Rage flickers across Craig's face.

Craig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going
through their pockets.

                    CRAIG
          How about you two?

Tyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action.

                    MUSICIAN#1
          It wasn't us, man!

                    NEANDERTHAL#1
          That cocksucker kicked my car!

                    CRAIG
          Shut up, genius.

                    MUSICIAN#1
              (to Neanderthal)
          Eat shit, pencil dick.

                    CRAIG
          Alright. That's it. Everybody goes
          downtown.

Tyler steps forward, interrupting...

                    TYLER
          It wasn't them.

Aidan, who has been edging away, jerks around to his friend.

                    AIDAN
              (sotto)
          Tyler...

                    LEO
              (quietly, to the guys)
          Take a walk, I said.

                    TYLER
          Hey!

Craig, big angry Irish cop, turns to Tyler.
                                                         21.


                    TYLER
          They didn't do anything. They
          didn't start this. Those assholes
          did. Why do these guys have to go
          downtown?

                    CRAIG
          What are you still doing here?

                    TYLER
          This is bullshit. It was those
          gorillas who started this.

Craig moves slowly toward Tyler and starts going through
Tyler's pockets, roughly. He finds his wallet. Starts rifling
through.

                    CRAIG
          Well, Mr. Roth. What makes you
          think I give a shit?

                    TYLER
          You're a police officer. You're
          supposed to.

What the hell? Craig looks from the guy he was frisking to
Tyler's girl, wrapped in a blanket. She spits blood. He turns
a bit to Tyler.

                    CRAIG
          It's a great relief to me, Mr.
          Roth, to know that you're on top of
          the situation. Now go the fuck
          home.

He turns back to work.

Tyler looks briefly at Aidan. Aidan looks desperate "Please!
Let's get out of here!"

Tyler TOUCHES CRAIG'S ELBOW.

Aidan's jaw drops. Leo takes several silent steps in. Craig
looks at his own elbow then looks at Tyler. The kid must be
out of his mind.

                    TYLER
          How about you do your job?

SLAM. Craig takes Tyler's legs out, driving his face into the
pavement, a GASH opens above Tyler's LEFT EYE. Tyler lies
there dazed and disoriented as Craig, with one knee on
Tyler's neck, crushes his face into the ground. He slaps the
cuffs on.
                                                                22.


17   INT. PEARL STREET LOCKUP -- AFTER                           17

     Who knows what time it is. A lovely ASSORTMENT OF
     PERPETRATORS, Tyler and the musicians are in lockup.
     Everybody looks like shit. Tyler sits on a bench in the
     holding cell, looking quite relaxed.

     The lock up door slides open and Aidan is returned to the
     perch. The ESCORTING OFFICER shouts across the din to Tyler.

                         ESCORTING OFFICER
               You can have your call now.

                           TYLER
               I'm good.

     The door slides shut behind Aidan.

                         AIDAN
               You're good? Thank God you're good.

     Beat.

                         AIDAN
               What are you trying to do? What did
               you want from that cop guy?

                         TYLER
               That was a messed up situation.
               Those guys...

     He cups his hands to make a megaphone...

                         TYLER
               ...Are pussies!

     From Off Screen a chorus of:

                           NEANDERTHAL#1 O/S
               Faggot!

                         NEANDERTHAL#2 O/S
               Candy-ass faggot!

                           NEANDERTHAL#3 O/S
               Fag!

                          TYLER
               There was no justice in that
               situation.

                         AIDAN
               No justice. Okay, Green Hornet ...
               Lantern ... Asshole.
                         (MORE)
                                                               23.

                         AIDAN (cont'd)
               You may not be actually
               matriculating in school, you may be
               having a nice time by yourself
               lurking in the stacks of your book
               store, but I actually plan on
               graduating, and having a career and
               a wife and a girlfriend and a
               divorce and a mid-life stalking
               episode and erectile dysfunction,
               and I will thank you to keep your
               complexes and nihilistic
               bullshit...

                         TYLER
               Did you just say "nihilistic"?

                         AIDAN
               Yeah. I got it off a cereal box.

     Tyler smiles.

     The Escorting Officer returns with a white male LAWYER
     wearing a two thousand dollar suit.

                         ESCORTING OFFICER
               Roth, Brewer.

     Tyler glares at Aidan.

                         AIDAN
               Yeah, I called your dad's office.
               Sue me.


18   INT. FAR ROCKAWAY - CRAIG FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN -- MORNING   18

     Ally, with a cup of coffee, is on the house phone.

                         ALLY
               So when would that be
               available?...No, that's sooner than
               I'd thought. And is there any kind
               of deposit?.. Okay.

     Craig comes in through the kitchen door, takes off his jacket
     and starts washing his hands at the sink.

                         ALLY
               I'll call you back. Thanks.

     Ally hangs up. Makes a quick appraisal of her dad. He has a
     little blood on his cuff. He splashes his face with water.
                                                                 24.


     On automatic pilot, Ally flips on the toaster, pours some hot
     coffee into a Sesame Street Mug, pours in a measured dose of
     brown sugar from the dispenser, then flips open a bottle of
     Aspirin and deposits two of the tablets into the mug.

     She packs up her back pack with school stuff as Craig gulps
     his coffee.

                         ALLY
               What did you tell me you were going
               to do when things got tight?

     The toaster dings. She extracts an English muffin and
     squeezes honey from a bottle shaped like a bear.

                          CRAIG
               Breathe.

                          ALLY
               Did you?

                         CRAIG
               I did. I'm breathing right now. Who
               was that?

                         ALLY
               The lady from student housing. We
               talked about it. Remember?

     Beat.

                          CRAIG
               Sure.

     Ally grabs her sweatshirt.

                         ALLY
               Mrs. Lippman is going to drive me.

                         CRAIG
               I'll drive you.

     She flounces out the door, holding her own cup of coffee and
     the English Muffin. Craig dries his hands, grabs his jacket
     and a set of keys from the counter.


19   EXT. DRIVEWAY.                                               19

     Outside their red-brick row house at the end of a block of
     red-brick row houses.

     Ally has her mug on the roof of the car and is searching
     through her bag.
                                                               25.


     Craig comes around the driver's side and slides Ally her keys
     across the roof. She drops them in her bag.

                         ALLY
               Mrs. Lippman said she'd do it.

     Craig is in the driver's seat, waiting. Ally grabs her coffee
     mug and gets into the passenger seat. She hands him his
     English muffin, which he holds in his mouth as he starts the
     car.

     She flips down the visor and checks her very light eye
     makeup.

                         ALLY
               You're exhausted. When you have a
               stroke I'm going to abandon you on
               a park bench.

     They start to back out.

                         ALLY
               This drive is too long.


20   INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- RECEPTION -- DAY                     20

     Tyler and his messed up face on his feet in the waiting area.
     English Club chairs, green baize on the walls. A RECEPTIONIST
     types away across the room. Tyler takes out a cigarette.
     Lights it. Draws the ire of...

                         THE RECEPTIONIST
               You know you can't smoke in here.

     Tyler looks down at a heavy crystal ash tray on the coffee
     table in front of him. It's clearly never been used.

                         TYLER
               So what's with the ash tray?

                         THE RECEPTIONIST
               It completes the room.

     Tyler takes a long drag, grinding out the ember on the
     pristine surface. He smiles a charming smile at the
     aggravated woman.

                          TYLER
               Tease.

                          JANINE O/S
               Tyler...
                                                                 26.


     JANINE, Charles' long time assistant, late forties, kind
     eyes, watches Tyler from the hallway.

                         JANINE
               He's ready for you.


21   INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- HALLWAY -- AFTER                     21

     Tyler follows Janine down the corridor. She looks him up and
     down, doesn't like what she sees.

                         JANINE
               You're too skinny. And you smell
               like french fries and cigarettes.

                         TYLER
               Nice to see you too.

                         JANINE
               You want me to lie?

     Tyler smiles, he likes that she doesn't lie. Janine scrolls
     through a Palm Pilot as she walks. They approach the double
     doors to Charles' office.

                         JANINE
               Try not to give him a heart attack.

                         TYLER
               Okay.

     Tyler bangs through the doors. Janine grimaces.


22   INT. CAVERNOUS EXECUTIVE OFFICE -- LATER                     22

     A row of floor-to-ceiling windows blocked by vertical blinds.
     Sunlight glows behind them. There's a lot of leather, brass
     and rich wood, breathing power. There's a flat screen
     computer, but no personal effects anywhere.

     Charles sits at his massive desk. As Tyler enters, Charles
     registers his injuries. A flicker of something over Charles'
     face. Tyler stands.

                         TYLER
               I came to see how much it costs,
               because I'm giving you the money
               back.

                         CHARLES
               How much what costs?
                                                              27.


                         TYLER
               That lawyer.

     Beat.

                         CHARLES
               Ah. That lawyer, Tyler, costs 450
               dollars an hour.

     In spite of himself...

                          TYLER
               Christ.

                         CHARLES
               Tell me about it.

                         TYLER
               I wanted to make sure you
               understood it wasn't me who called
               you.

                         CHARLES
               I understand. You could do worse
               than have a father who bails you
               out of jail

                         TYLER
               I don't want to be bailed out of
               anything.

     Charles looks at his son.

                         TYLER
               I'll get an invoice from Janine.

     Tyler leaves, slamming the door behind him.


23   INT. HALLWAY.                                             23

     Tyler stops, catching himself, realizing the emptiness of the
     gesture. He looks up and sees Janine looking at him.


24   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER.                    24

     Tyler in the same booth, surrounded by a commotion of
     businessmen and women. He's writing in his Journal, his foot
     tapping fast. We see the very act of writing eases him,
     loosening his strangled grip on the pen, slowing down the
     manic rhythm of his foot.
                                                              28.


25   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL. JUST AFTER.                            25

     It's just after three, Caroline emerges from school in a
     CLUSTER OF 6TH GRADE GIRLS. One of them dips her head towards
     Caroline's ear, as if to share a secret. Whatever she says
     makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls
     snicker.

     Tyler hops from his perch on a parked car. His bike leans on
     a fire hydrant.

                            TYLER
                      (to Caroline)
               Hey.

     He looks at the girls, sizing them up, and flicks his
     cigarette to the sidewalk, cool as hell. The girls have a
     group swoon.

     He takes Caroline by the elbow...

                         TYLER
               Excuse us, we're due in surgery.

     He gets his bike and leads her down the block, towards Fifth
     Avenue.

                         CAROLINE
               What happened to your face?

                         TYLER
               Horrible threshing accident.

                         CAROLINE
               You're so retarded.

                         TYLER
               Don't mock the afflicted. Here,
               I brought you something.

     He hands her the book of Myths.

                         TYLER
               This was my favorite book ever.
               Michael had it and he hit me over
               the head with it until I read it.
               Its about all these God and
               Goddesses who spend all of their
               time being jealous and petty and
               otherwise acting like human beings.
               The illustrations are amazing.

     Caroline opens the book carefully and has a peek. She smiles.
                                                              29.


                         CAROLINE
               Ooh. These are cool. Thanks! Where
               are we meeting mom?

                         TYLER
               Guggenheim. What's up with those
               girls?

                         CAROLINE
               I just...they think I'm weird.
               Sometimes I sort of space out.

                         TYLER
               When you're drawing?

                         CAROLINE
               Yeah. Other times too. Madamoiselle
               Fleischman had to snap her fingers
               at me a lot today. And everybody
               laughed and they all think I'm a
               freak of nature.

     Caroline takes a brief glance over her shoulder, towards the
     school.

                         TYLER
               Je m'appelle "Freak of Nature."

     Caroline smirks.

                         TYLER
               Mon dieu, mon soeurette! Je
               m'appelle "Freak of Nature". Sacre
               Bleu. French Toast.

                         CAROLINE
               What are you going to tell mom
               about your face?

                         TYLER
               I finally found something I'm good
               at?


26   EXT. NYU -- FRONT STEPS BELOW THE FLAGS -- DAY            26

     Aidan appears to have cornered a PROFESSOR on her way in or
     out of the building. The woman looks tired, annoyed, like she
     just wants to go. Aidan talks fast, even faster than usual.
                                                              30.


                         AIDAN
               ...I know by every numerical
               measurement I didn't pass but what
               I was hoping was that maybe you
               give me a grade on my trying to
               pass. My commitment to effort. My
               commitment to commitment...Since
               the semester is nearly at it's
               terminus.

     Craig's car rolls to a stop just in front of the flags. Ally
     gives him a kiss on the cheek. She gets out, and walks up the
     stairs, right past Aidan.

                         AIDAN
                   (distracted)
               I mean... uh... life's only about
               what we put into it. It's about
               people. And what they put into it.
               And I'm -- ah, screw it.

     Aidan runs off leaving the befuddled professor on the steps.


27   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LIVING ROOM -- DAY                   27

     Tyler, again with the guitar. Aidan enters, excited.

                         AIDAN
               He's got a daughter.

                         TYLER
               Who?

                         AIDAN
               The cop... The cop who busted your
               face all up. He's got a daughter.
               And she's hot! I smell revenge!

                         TYLER
               Revenge. What do you want me to do,
               kidnap her?

                         AIDAN
               You introduce yourself...go on a
               few dates...be your charming,
               gentlemanly self... And then, flip
               the script.

                         TYLER
               What does that mean?
                                                              31.


                         AIDAN
               Screw her brains out and make her
               call you daddy. Steal her underwear
               and sell it on ebay. Put her in
               Clown Shoes, take lewd photos and
               post them on her high school's home
               page. I don't know. Be creative.

                         TYLER
               You should be incarcerated on
               general principle.

                         AIDAN
               Hey. What happened to you was very
               emasculating. Tell me you don't
               want to get that asshole and I'll
               drop it.

                         TYLER
               I don't want to get that asshole.

                         AIDAN
               Just meet her.

                         TYLER
               I don't want to meet her.

                         AIDAN
               She's cute.

                         TYLER
               I don't care.

                         AIDAN
               You're meeting her.

                         TYLER
               I'm not meeting her.


28   INT. COFFEE SHOP. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.- DAY            28

     A Student Hangout. The place is bustling. Numerous NYU
     STUDENTS move, sit, eat, lounge. Aidan scans the crowd. Tyler
     stands beside him looking far less enthusiastic.

                         TYLER
               This is one of those moments I'm
               already regretting.

                         AIDAN
               She was here yesterday.
                                                           32.


                    TYLER
          What am I supposed to say to this
          girl? "Hey doll face, your dad
          trampled all over my civil
          liberties, wanna make out?"

                    AIDAN
          Well don't call her doll face.

Ally enters. She wears a big sweatshirt. Aidan spots her.

                    AIDAN
          There. The brunette.

Tyler watches her settle into a couch with a big cup of
coffee.

                    TYLER
          I know her. I mean, I don't know
          her, but, I've seen her. She's in
          my global politics class.

                    AIDAN
          There you go! Something to open
          with. Now get over there.

Tyler sighs, begins toward Ally.

                       AIDAN
          Shazam!

Tyler glares. Aidan gives a big thumbs up.

                       TYLER
          Excuse me?

Ally briefly looks up from her book.

                    TYLER
          My name's Tyler Roth. I was
          wondering if I could bother you for
          a minute?

He gives her a charming smile.

                    ALLY
          You're already bothering me.

Beat. The smile usually works.

                    TYLER
          Um, I'm doing kind of a
          sociological experiment...I was
          hoping you could help me out.
                                                         33.


Ally looks at him, a little wearily, holding her place in the
book.

                    ALLY
          What are you, kidding me?

Tyler is genuinely taken aback.

                    TYLER
          No, I... may I ask your name?

                    ALLY
          Anonymous. It's Greek. It means
          "you don't have a shot".

A surprised laugh escapes from Tyler.

                    TYLER
          Okay, Anonymous, do you see the guy
          across the room, pretending to read
          a text book, looking in this
          general direction?

Aidan holds a MATH TEXTBOOK at an awkward angle to mask his
obvious interest in Ally and Tyler's conversation.

                    ALLY
          Subtle.

                    TYLER
          I have this theory that an
          objective third-party, having no
          prior contact, would be able to
          determine how much of an asshole
          he is just by looking at him.

                    ALLY
          Ah.

                    TYLER
          He's my roommate. And I've
          witnessed so many glaring examples
          of assaholic behavior that I'm
          biased as a subject, but I'm
          convinced that he has an aura, that
          people can actually perceive. So,
          just take a good long look. And
          tell me what you think?

She looks at Aidan, briefly, who shifts to avoid her gaze.
Then she takes a peek at Tyler's profile.

                    ALLY
          Who else do you plan on asking?
                                                              34.


                         TYLER
               No one here. The parameters called
               only to sample attractive women in
               their early twenties.

                         ALLY
               I'm nineteen.

                          TYLER
               In their late teens.
                   (beat)
               Well, look, you typically get
               something for participating in
               these things and I've run out of
               those big foam fingers, so I was
               thinking maybe I could take you out
               some night?

     She looks at him.

                         TYLER
               Or you could just go out with me on
               the off chance we'd have an
               interesting conversation.

                         ALLY
               I don't date sociology majors...
               they're a rowdy bunch.

                          TYLER
               Indeed they are. Lucky for you, I'm
               undecided.

                         ALLY
               About what?

                         TYLER
               Everything.

     Tyler smiles. Ally tries to hide a smile. She closes her book
     and extends her hand.

                           ALLY
               I'm Ally.


29   INT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- ART STUDIO -- DAY                  29

     Caroline in art class amongst a sea of green plaid. The girls
     work in relative silence, drawing, painting.
                                                                 35.


     THE ART TEACHER walks amongst them looking over their
     shoulders, sees a lot of amateur art work, then she comes
     upon Caroline and stops. The teacher finds herself captivated
     by ...

     A COMIC PORTRAIT of Diane and Les kissing in the doorway of
     their brownstone. Diane has a bit of a manic smile and Les is
     half her size.

     Caroline notices her teacher staring. She doesn't like it and
     shifts to block her view. The teacher gently eases her back.
     Smiles softly.

     Caroline smiles back as her teacher moves across the room.
     Caroline has just put her pencil back to paper when...

     The BITCHY GIRLS we've seen before start whispering and
     smirking. One of them mouths...

                         CHUBBY GIRL
               Kiss ass freak.

     Caroline's smile shrinks away and she goes back to work.


30   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME ALLY'S BEDROOM-- NEXT EVENING         30

     Ally in sweat pants, an ancient tee-shirt, her hair in a
     Scrunchie, eating Mallomars from the bag and reading.

     Craig yells from the bottom of the stairs. He carries a bag
     from a video store.

                          CRAIG
               Don't be mad...

                         ALLY
               Dad, we've seen freaking Erin
               Brockovich twice already. You
               always cry.

                           CRAIG O/S
               I do not.

                         ALLY
               It's embarrassing.

     Her cell phone rings.

                           ALLY
               Hello?
                                                              36.


31   EXT. FIRE ESCAPE. RAILROAD FLAT.                            31

                           TYLER
                 Hey. It's Tyler.

     INTERCUT:

     Ally winces.

                           ALLY
                 Hi.

                           TYLER
                 You're going to stand me up. I can
                 feel it in my bones. I'll be
                 devastated.

                           ALLY
                 No... I...I was just...

                           TYLER
                 You were just sitting around in
                 your pajamas watching T.V.

                           ALLY
                 No. I'm not watching T.V. I'm
                 just...getting dressed.

     She wipes her hands on her sweats, smearing them with
     chocolate.

                           ALLY
                 And I'm going to meet you at the
                 place at..what time again?

                           TYLER
                 Eight.

                           ALLY
                 Right...yes. Eight...okay.

     She hangs up.

                           ALLY
                 Shit.

     She whips the Scrunchie out of her hair and heads for the
     bathroom.


32   INT.CRAIG HOUSE. KITCHEN.                                   32

     Ally comes down the stairs, putting on her earrings.
                                                              37.


     Craig looks at Ally, confused.

                         ALLY
               I'm going out.

                         CRAIG
               I can see that.

                         ALLY
               Well, you're a trained
               investigator.

     She is moving quickly, grabbing her bag, her wallet. Craig
     tosses her keys.

                         CRAIG
               Who are you going with?

                         ALLY
               A boy from school.

     Beat.

                         CRAIG
               Okay.

                         ALLY
               I wasn't asking for permission.

                         CRAIG
                   (sharply)
               I know.
                   (more gently)
               Have a good time. Here's cab fare.

     He peels off a couple of twenties.

                         ALLY
               Thanks.

                         CRAIG
               Should I wait up?

                         ALLY
               Dad.

     Craig puts his hands in the air in surrender.


33   INT. LEMONGRASS GRILL -- NIGHT                               33

     A hole in the wall Lower East Side Thai restaurant. Tyler and
     Ally sit together perusing menus. A WAITER approaches.
                                                 38.


                    ALLY
              (to the waiter)
          What desserts do you have?

                    WAITER
          Dessert special fried bananas a la
          mode.

                    ALLY
          Great, I'll have that. A glass of
          skim milk. Then the mussels,
          please.

Tyler and the Waiter share a look.

                    TYLER
          Pad Thai and a Sapporo. Thanks.

The Waiter takes the menus.

                    ALLY
          I have my dessert first.

                    TYLER
          Is this a political statement? A
          medical condition?

                    ALLY
          I just don't see the point in
          waiting for something I know I want
          and am going to have. What if I die
          eating my mussels?

                    TYLER
          Is that probable?

                    ALLY
          It's possible. If an embolism burst
          or an asteroid hit the restaurant,
          I'd die without having eaten the
          thing I wanted most.

                    TYLER
          But the odds are, I mean...

                    ALLY
          Fine. I'll tell you what, you
          guarantee me. Swear to me on your
          eternal soul that I'll make it
          through my entrée. And I'll wait.

Tyler goes to answer. Ally holds up a hand.
                                                               39.


                         ALLY
               Before you answer, keep in mind, if
               I die, you'll have to live the rest
               of your life knowing that you not
               only lied to me, but denied me my
               last indulgence. My last wish. Are
               you prepared to shoulder that kind
               of responsibility to prove a point?

     Tyler thinks about it. Smiles.

                         ALLY
               Don't worry. I'll share.


34   EXT. LEMONGRASS GRILL-- NIGHT                                34

     Tyler and Ally exit out onto the street. Tyler immediately
     takes out his cigarettes, his lighter, then he notices...
     Ally looking at him disappointed.

                         ALLY
               Really?

     Tyler takes the cue puts the packet and lighter away. A beat.

                         ALLY
               I had a nice time.

                         TYLER
               You had a nice time or you're
               having a nice time?

     Ally considers.

                         TYLER
               Because if you're having one, why
               rush to end it?


35   EXT. STREET FESTIVAL (A LA SAN GENNARO) -- GREENWICH VILLAGE --
                                                                 35
     AFTER

     They approach a CARNIVAL GAME, one those ubiquitous
     basketball tosses. THE ATTENDANT badgers passersby to test
     their luck. GIANT STUFFED ANIMALS hang all around it.

     Tyler pays the Attendant, gets the basketballs. Tosses one,
     two, the third, then nothing. Game over.

                         TYLER
               Did I tell you I'm Caucasian?
                                                                 40.


                         ALLY
               Apparently.

     Tyler pays again, wipes out again. Game over. Tyler pays
     again. Loses again. He's visibly frustrated now.

                         ALLY
               Can't we just stroll while I feed
               you ice cream with fireworks in the
               background?

                         TYLER
               No. If I stop, he wins.

                         ALLY
               Who, the attendant?

                         TYLER
               No, the frigging Giant Panda.

     Tyler hands the ATTENDANT another dollar.


36   EXT. SIDEWALK -- LATER                                       36

     Ally carries a GIANT PANDA under her arm. Tyler walking
     beside her with a self-satisfied smile.

                         ALLY
               I don't know what you're smiling
               about.

                         TYLER
               I won.

                         ALLY
               Paying off the attendant is not
               winning... It's cheating.

                         TYLER
               I just paid a premium to cut out
               the middle man. That's innovation.
               That's free market enterprising.
               That's what made America great.

                         ALLY
               Aha. By the way, what happened to
               your eye?

     Tyler touches the bandage.

                         TYLER
               Oh, it's nothing, just a bar fight.
                                                              41.


                            ALLY
               How butch.

                         TYLER
               I know. I'm practically a pirate.

                         ALLY
               Okay, Captain Morgan...

                         TYLER
                   (laughing)
               You've got some serious timing.

                         ALL
               It's getting late.

                         TYLER
               I'll walk you to the train.

                         ALLY
               I'll take a cab.


37   EXT. SIDEWALK -- JUST AFTER                               37

     Tyler is just hailing her a taxi. He stands there holding the
     door open.

                            ALLY
               Thanks.

     Beat.

     Tyler leans in to kiss her. Ally turns away.

                         ALLY
               Not tonight. Not never... just...
               not tonight.

                         CAB DRIVER
               We goin' or what?

                         ALLY
               Hey! Turn on the meter.

     Tyler respectfully leans back.

                         TYLER
               So dessert before dinner for fear
               of death by rogue asteroid... yes.
               Kissing guy you're obviously
               attracted to before driving off
               into the unknown New York night...
               no.
                                                               42.


     Ally considers.

     She gives him a quick but tender kiss.

                         ALLY
               You're really weird.

     She gets in the cab.

                         ALLY
                   (to the driver)
               I'm going to Queens and I don't
               wanna hear about it.

     Off she goes in the taxi. Tyler watches her go.


38   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL. THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL.               38

     Caroline exiting with the crowd. One of the Bitchy girls
     shoulder checks her from behind as she passes. Tyler, waiting
     on his perch, catches it, walks up to her.

                         TYLER
               Happy end of sixth grade!

                            CAROLINE
               Finally.


39   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- ALICE IN WONDERLAND STATUE -- AFTERNOON39

     CHILDREN climbing all over the bronze statue. Caroline among
     them. She sits on a mushroom cap, letting her legs dangle.
     Tyler watches her from their usual bench, his bike leaning
     next to him.

                         CAROLINE
               They have me in this art program
               summer thing at Pratt...

                            TYLER
               I heard.

                         CAROLINE
               It's very prestigious due to my
               artistic greatness.

                         TYLER
               Don't pretend. I know you're proud.
               You should be.

     Caroline allows herself a tiny grin.
                                                  43.


                    CAROLINE
          There's, like, a thing...

                     TYLER
          A thing?

                    CAROLINE
              (sheepish)
          A show where you show what you've
          done and stuff. Will you come?

                    TYLER
          Let me check my book. Abso-freaking-
          lutely. I'm camping out. I'm
          sleeping there the night before.

Caroline is secretly thrilled.

                    CAROLINE
          You're so retarded. Mom's been
          hyperventilating with joy.

                    TYLER
          Good. I'm sure Les was...

                    TYLER/CAROLINE
          "Really supportive"!

                    CAROLINE
          Your school's over, right?

                    TYLER
          Yes, it's over. Did Mom and Les
          get the beach house again?

                    CAROLINE
          Yup. What are we going to do for
          your birthday?

                     TYLER
          Nothing.

                    CAROLINE
          Can we have a party?

                     TYLER
          No.

                    CAROLINE
          A little one? At Mom's? With Aidan.
          I'll make Mom behave. No crying.

                    TYLER
          Like that's possible.
                                                              44.


     Caroline smiles.


40   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- NIGHT -- DEEPER INTO SUMMER             40

     Ally explores Tyler's living room with a tumbler of wine.
     It's in a state of medium disarray. He clocks her looking.

                         TYLER
               I know. But we have coasters.

                         ALLY
               I don't do coasters till the third
               date.

     She looks over his posters, pictures, etc. Tyler scans a
     stack of CDs, he selects Radiohead's KID A, puts it in. The
     hypnotic first track fills the room.

     Ally comes across a FRAMED PHOTO of a band on stage. The lead
     guitarist looks like Tyler with long hair.

                         ALLY
               Is that you?

                         TYLER
               That's Michael. My brother.

                         ALLY
               He looks like you... or you look
               like him. Does he play around here?

                         TYLER
               Not any more.

     Ally notices the old guitar in the corner.

                         ALLY
               Do you play?

                         TYLER
               It depends who you ask.

                         ALLY
               If I asked anybody?

                         TYLER
               They'd say no. I try but it turns
               out you need talent.

                         ALLY
               So what talents do you actually
               have?
                                                               45.


                         TYLER
               Falconry. I come from a long line
               of falconers.

                         ALLY
               There's a lot of money in that.

     Tyler smiles. He's actually a hair nervous.

                         TYLER
               Well there is one thing...

     Tyler walks to the kitchen counter where a cleaned and
     polished COVERED CAKE STAND sits.

                         ALLY
               What's that?

                         TYLER
               Our appetizer.

     Tyler lifts off the cover to reveal a GERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE.
     He's written a message in the icing: "In Case Of Ast-- and
     then a piece has been crudely cut out. Ally's surprised.

                         TYLER
               It used to say "In Case Of
               Asteroid" but I took a shower and
               Aidan got high.


41   INT. KITCHEN -- LATER THAT NIGHT                           41

     Ally and Tyler stand in front of a sink full of dirty dishes,
     up to their elbows in soapy water.

                         ALLY
               So what kind of grade did you end
               up with from Vogelstein?

                         TYLER
               I don't actually get grades.

     Beat.

                         TYLER
               I'm not technically enrolled. I
               worked out an auditing thing.

                         ALLY
               Oh. And The Strand is not a
               significant career choice.
                                                         46.


                    TYLER
          I like the books.

He indicates the dishes.

                    TYLER
          You don't have to help me, you
          know.

                    ALLY
          At the rate you're going, dish
          washing is going to be your life's
          vocation. I can say I knew you
          when.

He flicks a bit of water on her shirt. Ally takes a beat.

                    ALLY
          This is the playful, you get me all
          wet part? Right?

                    TYLER
              (horsing around)
          You make it sound so cheap.

Ally's not having it.

                    ALLY
          It is cheap. I've seen this scene a
          hundred times.

Tyler's a little confused.

                    TYLER
          I'm sorry. I didn't...

                    ALLY
          You know what never happens in this
          scene, Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go-
          to-school? Tyler-who-doesn't-really
          care-about-his-job?

Tyler blinks helplessly.

                    ALLY
          This.

An entire enormous pot of pasta water up ended on the host.
Bits of spaghetti cling to him, tiny tomatoes and zucchini on
his shoulders like little barnacles. He sputters and gasps
and blinks.

                    ALLY
          No, that usually never happens.
                                                              47.


     She calmly goes back to washing dishes.

     Beat.

     Spaghetti guy stares at her.

     She gives it right back to him, 100% New York City.

     Beat.

     In one move Tyler slings Ally over his shoulder. She grunts,
     unglamorously.


42   INT. BATHROOM -- SECONDS LATER                               42

     Tyler bursts through the bathroom door. Ally over his
     shoulder. Never one to waste a moment, she uses the
     opportunity to check out what's in his wallet. He turns on
     the shower. She has his drivers licence.

                            TYLER
               Apologize.

                         ALLY
               Never. Your middle name is Keats?
               Your parents are pretentious as
               hell.

     Tyler turns on the shower and tosses Ally into the water. She
     dances to avoid the stream. Ally grabs the portable shower
     head and turns it at him.

     Tyler jumps into the tub to avoid the spray. They wrestle for
     the shower head.

                            TYLER
               Apologize.

                         ALLY
               I'd rather eat monkeys.

     This cracks Tyler up. He stops struggling for the shower and
     gasps a little with laughter, putting up his hands in
     surrender. Ally stands there, holding the shower head,
     giggling.

     They lock eyes for a moment. The air is charged.

     Ally spritzes him in the face.

                         TYLER
               I surrender! Oh my God, you're
               relentless.
                                                                 48.


     He slides down the wall until he's sitting in the tub, Ally
     follows.

                         ALLY
               Victory at all costs.


43   INT. BATH TUB -- LATER                                       43

     Tyler and Ally lie side-by-side, drenched. Their feet hang
     over the edge of the tub. Tyler reaches into his pocket and
     removes a dripping cigarette packet. He squeezes out water.

                         TYLER
               Now... I'm furious.

     He tosses them in a waste basket.

                         ALLY
               You should quit anyway.

                         TYLER
               Really? Why? Are cigarettes like
               bad for you or something?

     Ally playfully slaps him. She notices the tip of Tyler's
     TATTOO peeking out of his undershirt.

                         ALLY
               Is that a tattoo? Let me see.

                         TYLER
               It's not really...

                         ALLY
               Please. It's very bad ass. All that
               ritualistic scarring.

     Tyler peels the soaked garment off his back as Ally offers
     polite applause. Michael's name becomes clear. Ally takes a
     long look. She sees Tyler's not smiling anymore. She gets it.

                         ALLY
               I'm sorry... I didn't... I didn't
               realize.

     She looks at him. Asking with out asking.

                         TYLER
               He killed himself.

     Beat.
                                                            49.


                      ALLY
          When?

                    TYLER
          When he was 21. He had just started
          working for my father.

Ally is gently picking spaghetti and tomatoes off Tyler.

                    ALLY
          I thought he was a musician.

                    TYLER
          He was. But he wasn't making a
          living doing music and my father's
          a very compelling guy.

                      ALLY
          Mine too.

Ally looks away for a moment. Tucks a curl behind her ear.

Then they look at each other. Ally opens her mouth to speak.

Aidan bursts in. He's drunk, loud, wearing an Irish Flag like
a cape. He carries a bottle of whiskey and a can of Guinness.

                    AIDAN
          Damn, you're not naked.

                    TYLER
          You're not Irish.

                    AIDAN
          T, What happened in the kitchen? It
          looks like somebody's water broke.
              (notices Ally)
          Hi.

                    TYLER
          Ally, Aidan... Aidan, Ally.

Aidan takes Ally's hand. Kisses it.

                    AIDAN
          Don't feel bad that you're more
          attracted to me than you are to him
          it happens to all of them.

Ally looks at Aidan closely, trying to figure out where she
knows him from, it dawns on her.

                    ALLY
          Oh! You're the assaholic!
                                                              50.


                         AIDAN
               Well, I--
                   (realizes what she said)
               Wait. What?

     Tyler and Ally laugh. Aidan's too drunk to care.

                         AIDAN
               Alright, you two. Up. Dressed.
               Let's go. "Around The World" party
               on the third floor... a lot of ugly
               but a lot more alcohol. Let's go.

                         ALLY
               I can't, I would, I'd love to, but
               I've gotta get home, my dad's
               waiting up.

                         AIDAN
               Ally. Ally. Listen to me, young
               lady. One drink. From any country.
               I'll even put France on the table.
               One drink. Your choice. And we're
               gone.

                          ALLY
                   (to Tyler)
               One drink?

                          TYLER
                   (to Aidan)
               One drink?

                          AIDAN
                   (innocent shrug)
               One drink.


44   INT. BATHROOM -- LATER                                    44

     Ally VOMITS in their toilet. Tyler holds her hair back. Aidan
     appears in the doorway still wearing that flag.

                         AIDAN
               Hey, how we doin'?

     Ally tries to speak, all we hear is a series of groans. Then
     she dry heaves again. Tyler shoots Aidan a look.

                          AIDAN
               What? What do you want me to say?
               That I'm sorry? You want me to say
               I"m sorry?
                          (MORE)
                                                               51.

                         AIDAN (cont'd)
               You want me to apologize for
               showing a nice girl a good time? Is
               that it?

     Tyler just looks at him. Aidan considers.

                            AIDAN
               I'm sorry.

                            ALLY
               Tyler...

     Tyler kneels down. Ally pushes her purse at him, she looks
     like she's about to pass out.

                         ALLY
               I, need, you... to call... my dad.

     Tyler and Aidan share a look. Aidan shrugs.

                         TYLER
               Oh. OK. Sure.

     Tyler pulls out her cellphone - the battery is dead.

                         TYLER
               Your phone's dead. Just tell me the
               number and I'll call him...

     Tyler turns around to find Ally passed out on the floor. He
     tries to gently nudge her awake.

                         TYLER
               Ally? Ally?

                         SERGEANT CRAIG (O.S.)
               I know Ally's a good kid, Leo.


45   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- ALLY'S BEDROOM -- LATE NIGHT       45

     The bedside clock reads 3:47. Craig is on the phone while
     searching through Ally's desk drawers. For anything. He finds
     a note book with a red cover and starts flipping through it.

                         CRAIG
               ...She was supposed to be back.
               She's not back ... call Ted
               Proferes ... and what's his face in
               the 9th...and call me back. Just do
               it, Leo!

     Craig hangs up the phone.
                                                                52.


     Beat.

     He picks it up again and starts dialing, still flipping
     through the notebook.


46   INT TYLER'S BEDROOM -- NEXT MORNING                          46

     Ally wakes up alone in Tyler's bed, hung over, confused,
     trying to put the pieces together, then she sees the clock.
     And a wave of panic washes over her as she jumps out of bed.

                         ALLY
               ...oh God oh God oh God oh God...


47   INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER                                    47

     Tyler sleeps on the couch using Aidan's Irish Flag as a
     blanket. Ally comes in pulling on her shoes. Tyler stirs in
     time to see her run out the door.


48   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- LATER                              48

     Craig sits at the table, dialing someone, anyone. Ally
     enters, drops her keys on the counter. Her father doesn't
     look at her as she pours herself a coffee.

                         ALLY
               ...I'm sorry. I fell asleep...

     Craig squeezes honey into his coffee, practically strangling
     the Bear. Not looking at her.

     Ally notices the red notebook on the kitchen table next to
     the phone.

                         CRAIG
               You turned your phone off.

                         ALLY
               I forgot to charge it.

     It dawns on her...

                         ALLY
               That's mine. From my desk.

     Craig says nothing. Just stirs his coffee. Ally is furious.

                         ALLY
               How could you?
                                                 53.


                    CRAIG
          You were gone all night. I was
          trying to get some information.

                    ALLY
          How could you go through my stuff
          like I'm a suspect?

                    CRAIG
          Then stop acting like one.

                    ALLY
          What is the matter with you, Dad?
          You have no respect for me and the
          way I'm feeling, my privacy. We
          talked about this! You're totally
          paranoid...

                    CRAIG
          You watch your mouth!

                    ALLY
          You don't do anything. You don't go
          anywhere except work. You have no
          life.

                    CRAIG
          My life is right here! In this
          house. The same place as yours. But
          you're spitting all over it.

                    ALLY
          Jesus Christ, Dad! I went on a
          date!

                    CRAIG
          I smell alcohol...

Right back at him.

                     ALLY
          So do I.

Beat.

                     ALLY
          Dad...

                    CRAIG
          THIS IS MY HOUSE!

                    ALLY
          YOU WANNA BURY ME IN IT?
                                                              54.


     CRACK! He hits her, hard, open hand, from across the width of
     his body. Ally is knocked off balance and hits her head on
     the cabinets.

                         CRAIG
               Ally!

     His face is contorted with panic and shame.

     Ally's disoriented. Her ears are ringing. Her lip is split. A
     knot is starting to form where she hit her head.

     She straightens herself up and stares at her dad like she has
     no idea who he is.

     Beat.

     Craig tries to envelop her. With a guttural snarl she pushes
     him away, getting a little bit of blood on his shirt. She
     scrambles up the stairs.


49   EXT. RAILROAD FLAT-- ROOFTOP -- DAY                         49

     Sunshine beats down on a little make-shift rooftop hideaway,
     a few old beach chairs, a stereo, a weight bench. Aidan works
     out with an old set of dumb bells. Tyler sits on a beach
     chair, trying again with the guitar.

                         AIDAN
               ...So? She just left? No good bye?

     Tyler nods, strumming like he's wearing boxing gloves. Aidan
     finishes up a set.

                         AIDAN
               Maybe she heard you play the
               guitar.

                         TYLER
               You were the one dumping Jello
               shots down her throat. You almost
               killed her.

     Aidan lies down to do the bench press... there's a lot of
     weight on the bar.

                         AIDAN
               There are sins of omission and sins
               of commission, my friend. I've
               dealt with mine and I've forgiven
               myself... you should do the same.
                                                              55.


     Aidan lifts. It's too heavy and falls to his chest. Tyler
     forgoes his spotting duty, lets him struggle. Aidan strains.

                         AIDAN
               ...little help, T... little help,
               little help, lotta help... TYLER?!

     Tyler blows three perfect smoke rings. Finally he puts down
     the guitar and helps get the bar up. Aidan panting, rubbing
     his chest.

                         AIDAN
               What the hell was that?

                         TYLER
               Penance. I have to get to work.


50   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LIVING ROOM -- DAY                   50

     Tyler and Aidan come into their apartment, Aidan still
     rubbing his chest. Ally is standing there in the middle of
     the living area. A packed bag at her feet, her face a mess.

                         ALLY
               I didn't know where else to go.


51   INT. LIVING ROOM -- SUNSET                                51

     Aidan sits on the couch still in his gym clothes drinking a
     protein shake out of a blender. Tyler comes out of his
     bedroom gently closing the door behind him.

                         AIDAN
               How's she doin'?

                         TYLER
               She's pretty shaken up.

     Tyler takes a seat beside him. Takes out a cigarette.

                         TYLER
               We've really got to fix that dead
               bolt.

                         AIDAN
               My bad. Sorry.

                         TYLER
               Don't be. You think she'll sleep?
                                                              56.


                           AIDAN
                 You realize if she had had the
                 S.L.U.T

     If looks could kill...

                             AIDAN
                 Too soon?

     A silent moment passes.

                           TYLER
                 I told her she could stay here...
                 Are you alright with that?

                           AIDAN
                 As long as she needs.


52   INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATER THAT NIGHT                      52

     Tyler has just finished making up the ratty sofa as a bed.
     Ally appears from the bedroom, framed by the open door. She
     has slept in one of Tyler's button down shirts.

                           TYLER
                 You're up.

     Beat.

                           TYLER
                 Can I get you anything?

     She nods.

                           TYLER
                 I'll be out here if you need me.

     Beat.

     Ally takes off the shirt and lets it fall.

     She stands there.


53   INT. TYLER'S BEDROOM -- LATER                             53

     We interrupt Ally and Tyler in the throes of passion. Tyler
     sits on the edge of the bed. Ally is on top. She kisses his
     neck. Suddenly, Tyler throws her to the bed. He takes
     control. Ally's momentarily taken aback, but doesn't stop
     him. There's noticeable aggression to their love-making.
                                                                 57.


     In the midst of everything, the pair slow almost to stopping,
     a caesura. They stare into each other in a moment of surprise
     and recognition.

     Then again. Young, hungry, aggressive.

     TIME LAPSE

     They lie, eyes closed, almost asleep, entwined with each
     other. Tyler gives a little sound of contentment. Ally, in
     her own haze, reaches for him, her hair all over the place.
     Eyes still closed they fumble for each other, starting, in
     this dream state, to make love all over again.


54   INT. BEDROOM -- BEFORE SUNRISE                               54

     The sheets have been torn loose from the mattress. Ally lies
     asleep, curled in the comforter. Tyler lies awake beside her,
     he smokes a cigarette and watches the sky just starting to
     brighten.

     Tyler gets out of bed. Grabs his journal.

     A NOTE propped up next to the bed: "Please don't leave. I'll
     be back."


55   EXT. SIDEWALK -- LATER                                       55

     Tyler locking his bike outside the coffee shop.


56   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- SUNRISE                      56

     The place is empty. A few early RISERS get coffee to go.
     He sits in the same booth, his journal held open by the
     binder clip. He writes, a bag of Bialys next to him.

     Janine enters. Orders two coffees. She sees Tyler, smiles.
     She picks up her coffees and approaches him.

                            JANINE
                  I can't believe you still come down
                  here.

     Tyler looks up, grins, nods to her coffees.

                            TYLER
                  It's not so far. I can't believe
                  you still get his coffee... three
                  sugars, no milk?
                                                              58.


                         JANINE
                   (shrugs)
               Old habits. You're not writing
               anything bad about me, are you?

                            TYLER
               Not today.

                         JANINE
               I gotta run. Early meetings.

     Janine turns to go, remembers something, turns back.

                         JANINE
               I probably won't see you before
               Saturday so...happy birthday.

     Tyler nods, tries to smile. Janine glances back as she goes.

                         JANINE
               I'll be sure to tell your father
               that you said hello.

     Tyler nods sheepishly.


57   INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- LIVING ROOM -- LATER                   57

     Tyler returns with breakfast. From Aidan's room, a pathetic
     croak...

                            AIDAN O/S
               Bialy.

     Tyler tosses him a Bialy like he's tossing fish to a seal.

     Ally lies on the couch. Curled in a blanket. A cup of hot tea
     in hand. She sips it. It stings her lip a little.

                            TYLER
               Hey...

                            ALLY
               Hey...

     Tyler sits. She shifts and curls next to him.

                         ALLY
               Where did you go?

                            TYLER
               Downtown.
                                                         59.


                     ALLY
           Why?

Tyler pulls his JOURNAL from his pocket. Hands it to her.

                     TYLER
           There's a coffee shop. I brought
           you a Bialy.

                     ALLY
           New York is full of coffee shops.

                     TYLER
           This one was our place... Michael's
           and mine. We had breakfast there
           all the time ... Maybe not as many
           times as I think we did. But enough
           times. Anyway we ate there that
           morning. It was the last place I
           saw him.

                     ALLY
           Oh. So you go there to write? To
           him?

                     TYLER
           Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But
           I guess I wanted to tell him about
           you.

Ally is moved, you can see it in her eyes, but she chooses
not to overdo it. She flips through the journal. She hands it
back to him. Then out of nowhere.

                     ALLY
           My mom was murdered eight years
           ago. The same year your brother
           died.

Tyler is stunned.

                     ALLY
           You don't need to say anything, I
           know you're sorry. Everyone's
           always sorry, you know?

He does.

                     ALLY
           It's just, I need you to know that,
           my dad, he's not an evil guy.
                     (MORE)
                                                                 60.

                         ALLY (cont'd)
               I don't want you to think that
               because I'm here he's some kind of
               belligerent psychotic, he's not...I
               don't know, it's just recently, he
               seems really...

     She looks at Tyler's face. His eyes are so patient.

     Ally tears up.

                         ALLY
               Wounded? Our house is like the
               recovery room, or the critical care
               unit or something.

     Tyler strokes her hair.

                         ALLY
               I don't feel like that, though. I
               feel like I'm getting stronger and
               like I'm leaving him behind to swim
               in it all by himself.

     She is weeping. Tyler pulls her to him doing the best he can.
     Holding her and kissing her hair.


58   INT. SIXTH PRECINCT -- 2 DAYS LATER.                         58

     Sergeant Craig standing with a ROOKIE OFFICER, berating.

                         CRAIG
               Tell me something, Matthews, do you
               like paperwork?

                          MATTHEWS
               No, sir.

     Craig is working up a head of steam.

                         CRAIG
               Me neither. Nobody likes paperwork.
               But paperwork keeps our ship
               afloat. Paperwork makes it possible
               for me to keep track of all the
               scumbags. But I can't do that if
               newbies like you are incapable of
               remembering standard filing...

     Leo interrupts.

                          LEO
               Jim...
                                                              61.


     Craig snaps his head around.

                          CRAIG
               ...What?

     Leo gestures to speak privately.

                         LEO
               Ally called Sharon.

                          CRAIG
               What?

                         LEO
               She said to tell you, she's with
               friends, and she's fine.

                         CRAIG
               What friends?

                         LES
               She didn't say.

                         CRAIG
               That's all?

     His partner nods. Craig looks away.

                         LEO
               I'm sorry, Jim. Listen, why don't
               you come over this weekend? We'll
               get the grill going. Sharon wants
               to see you. We can have some
               people, nice people...You can
               circulate a little...

                          CRAIG
               No.

                          LEO
               Jim...

                         CRAIG
               Leo, no. Stop.

     Craig goes back to his desk. Leo looks after him.


59   INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- LIVING ROOM -- DAY                  59

     Aidan sits in the living room, trying to assemble an IKEA
     television stand. A joint smolders in the ashtray. The BUZZER
     rings.
                                                           62.


Aidan goes to answer it.

                          AIDAN
             Hello?

                       DIANE
             Aidan, it's Diane.

He blinks.

                       AIDAN
             Oh, hey Diane.

He throws down the keys, then yells towards the roof...

                       AIDAN
             T! It's your mom.

With Diane's knock the door swings open.

                          AIDAN
             Hey Diane.

He gives her a kiss on the cheek.

                       DIANE
             You really have to fix that door.
             I'm so sorry to just show up. I
             called but your phone was busy.

Aidan looks and realizes that the phone is indeed off the
hook, as just the handset, wrapped in duct tape, is visible
on top of the sofa.

                       AIDAN
             No problem. Come on in.

Tyler and Ally enter the apartment through the fire escape

                          TYLER
             Hey mom.

                       DIANE
             Hey. I'm so sorry honey. I tried to
             call but...

                       TYLER.
             It's okay. Mom, this is Ally. Ally,
             this is my mom, Diane.

                       ALLY
             Hi. Nice to meet you.

Diane is thrilled. She has a huge mom grin.
                                                            63.


                    DIANE
          Ally. It's lovely to met you. Just
          lovely.

Diane is pumping Ally's hand like she's drilling for oil.

                     TYLER
          Sit down, Mom. Can I get you
          something?

She navigates the IKEA carnage and sits on the sofa, the
joint smoldering in the ashtray in front of her. Aidan ever
the gent, removes the ashtray to the window ledge.

                    DIANE
          Yes. Aidan, would you bring back
          that spliff, please?

Beat.

                       AIDAN
          Uh..okay.

Tyler looks completely befuddled. Aidan passes Diane the
joint. She takes a deep hit.

                       DIANE
          Thank you.

                    AIDAN
          How's work, Diane?

                    DIANE
          Well ...
              (BIG exhale)
          I just found housing for a family
          that had been in shelters for three
          weeks. So that's good. On the other
          hand, I have six other families.

The women measure each other.

                    DIANE
          But Tyler, I wanted to talk to you.

                    ALLY
          Come on, Aidan.

                       AIDAN
          What?

                    ALLY
          Nice to meet you, Diane.
                                                           64.


She starts to drag Aidan out the window, back up the fire
escape, but he makes a brief detour.

                    AIDAN
          Don't freaking bogart that joint,
          Diane.

                       DIANE
          Sorry.

She hands it back to him and Aidan and Ally climb away.
Tyler sits next to his mom and lights a cigarette.

                    DIANE
          Well, first, your sister is all
          excited about your birthday at the
          house. I wish you'd told me.

                    TYLER
          I wish she'd told me. It was a
          unilateral Caroline decision. Will
          you make sausage and peppers?

                     DIANE
          Of course. Tyler, Your father is
          driving me crazy. I shouldn't even
          be discussing this with you.
          I can't get him to say he'll come
          to your sister's exhibit. Her art
          exhibit. He says he's in the middle
          of an IPO.

Tyler rubs his eyes.

                    DIANE
          Les says I shouldn't broker. I
          should let them be on whatever road
          they're on.

Beat.

                    TYLER
          I'll get him there.

                    DIANE
          She cares about this, even though
          she's pretending she doesn't.

                    TYLER
          I'll get him there, mom.

                       DIANE
          You will?
                                                              65.


                           TYLER
               Yes.

     She looks relieved.

                         DIANE
               Thank you. Thank you.

     She kisses his cheek, and rises to go. He takes her to the
     door.

                         DIANE
               Why don't you bring that lovely
               girl to your birthday?

                         TYLER
                   (a warning)
               Diane...

                         DIANE
               Sorry. Sorry. I love you, darling,
               but this place reeks of marijuana.

     She goes, shutting the door behind her.


60   EXT. ROOFTOP -- AFTER.                                       60

     Aidan and Ally on the roof, they've arranged themselves in
     the deck chairs.

                          ALLY
               That was weird. I assume most moms
               don't smoke weed in front of their
               son's...um

                         AIDAN
               Piece of ass?

                         ALLY
               You know, you're a poet.

                         AIDAN
               Hey. I know one thing. I know that
               in the time I've lived with Tyler,
               he has never introduced a girl ...
               woman...female...to his mom before.

                         ALLY
               It's not like he had a choice. She
               ambushed us.
                                                               66.


                          AIDAN
                Yeah, but he would've shoved you in
                a closet or something. Or literally
                pretended you were a hallucination.

                            ALLY
                Ha ha.

                          AIDAN
                I mean it. It's the first time.
                Ever.

                          ALLY
                Did it ever occur to you that
                that's kind of weird?

                            AIDAN
                No.

     Ally throws up her hands.


61   INT.   BATHROOM. AFTER.                                     61

     Tyler, having pulled the decrepit house phone into the
     bathroom, is leaning against the sink, girding himself to
     call Charles. He looks in the mirror and makes a face.


62   INT. CHARLES' OFFICE . JUST AFTER                           62

     Janine pokes her head into Charles' office. Charles is
     swamped with work and surrounded by UNDERLINGS.

                          JANINE
                Charles, it's your son.

     Charles is surprised.

                            CHARLES
                What?

                          JANINE
                On the phone.

                            CHARLES
                Okay.

     He punches a button.

                          CHARLES
                Tyler, you're on speakerphone.
                                                               67.


63   IN. BATHROOM. AFTER.                                         63

                         TYLER
               It's about Caroline's show. Are you
               planning on attending?

                         CHARLES O/S
               What? There are people here. You'll
               have to speak up.

     Tyler holds the phone away from his face and screams at it,
     silently.

                         TYLER
               Caroline's show.

                         CHARLES O/S
               What about it?

                         TYLER
                   (ready to kill him)
               You are coming, right?

                         CHARLES O/S
               Fine. Yes. I'm coming. We'll go to
               dinner first. Alright?...
                   (to Janine)
               Janine?

                         TYLER
               Dinner? That's not...

                         CHARLES
               I'll make a reservation and have
               Janine call you.

     He hangs up. Tyler stares at the phone a sec, then hits his
     head, once, against the bathroom door.


64   INT. DIANE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM -- NIGHT -- A WEEK LATER   64

     Tyler is sitting at the table in the darkened room with Ally
     standing behind him with her hands over his eyes.

     Caroline enters from the kitchen carrying Tyler's BIRTHDAY
     CAKE. She has obviously decorated it herself. She has drawn
     (as best as she could, given the medium) the characters from
     the ALICE statue in frosting.

     It reads "A VERY MERRY UNBIRTHDAY TO YOU", and has "22" in
     numerical candles and "+ 1 TO UNGROW ON" written next to
     that.
                                                                68.


     She's singing. Aidan, Ally, Diane are all singing.

     There's a flash from a camera off screen. It's Les.

     Caroline puts the cake down in front of her brother and Ally
     takes her hands away just as they finish the song.

     Tyler's face in the candlelight as he sees Caroline's
     efforts. He takes a huge breath...

                         CAROLINE
               Make a wish.

     He looks at her and blows out the candles. Everybody
     applauds, Diane longer than anyone else. Her eyes are
     shining.

                                                          CUT TO:


65   INT. DINING ROOM --LATER                                       65

     The cake totally devoured. Les is obsessively eating
     frosting.

     Caroline is trying to teach Aidan how to waltz in the living
     room. He is...

                         CAROLINE
               Retarded. Tyler?

     Tyler rises from the sofa and takes over as Caroline's
     partner. She puts her feet on top of his feet and they waltz.

                         TYLER/CAROLINE
               "One, two. three. One, two, three"

     Ally and Diane are washing dishes in silence.

     Beat.

                         ALLY
               You're the second member of this
               family I've washed dishes with.

     Beat.

                         DIANE
               He was doing it to impress you.
               He's never washed a dish in his
               life.
                                                              69.


66   INT. CAROLINE'S ROOM.                                     66

     Caroline at her desk, sketching. Her door is ajar. Ally
     enters, mouth agape as she lays eyes on Caroline's collection
     of artwork on the walls.

                         ALLY
               Wow.

     Caroline's working on a PORTRAIT OF TYLER ON A PARK BENCH,
     cigarette dangling from his bottom lip. A perfect rendering
     of a fleeting moment.

                         ALLY
               May I?

     Caroline shrugs. Ally looks over Caroline's shoulder.

                         ALLY
               That's exactly him. It's like the
               cigarette is the last Coca Cola in
               the desert.

     Caroline smiles.

                         ALLY
               I can't believe he smokes in front
               of you.

                         CAROLINE
               Don't worry, I'm not that
               impressionable.

     Ally smiles. Caroline goes back to work. Ally looks around at
     all the portraits papering her walls. It stirs a memory.

                         ALLY
               You know when I was younger, we
               didn't have air conditioning in the
               house, so during the summer my mom
               and I would go to museums to cool
               down... she loved them all but The
               Met was always her favorite.

                         CAROLINE
               Mine too. The Met is one of my
               favorite places in the world.

                         ALLY
               So... I heard you've got an art
               exhibit coming up.
                                                               70.


                         CAROLINE
                   (skeptical)
               You wanna come?

                         ALLY
               Was it that obvious? But only if
               you're OK with it. I don't want to
               impose and I'll completely
               understand if you don't want some
               random girl there.

     Caroline considers this.

                         CAROLINE
               You're not random... you're Tyler's
               girlfriend.

     Ally has never heard anyone say it so plainly. She seems a
     bit perplexed, then grins. It's okay with her.


67   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT OF CAROLINE'S SHOW67

     Tyler wearing the suit we met him in, it's been dry-cleaned.

     Ally emerges from the bathroom, looking gorgeous in a vintage
     black cocktail dress and carrying a pink wrap.

                           ALLY
               You like?

                         TYLER
               Let's just skip dinner and I'll
               tell you how great you look in like
               eighteen different languages.

                          ALLY
               You just want to skip dinner. I got
               you a tie.

     She hands him a simple blue tie that matches his eyes.

     Beat.

                          TYLER
               I was going to make a joke about
               how I'm not prepared for the
               commitment of exchanging
               accessories and how neck wear
               especially is a slippery slope, but
               I should probably shut up and say
               thank you.
                                                              71.


                         ALLY
               You're learning.

     Tyler puts on his tie in the mirror. He scowls.


68   INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT -- AFTER.                       68

     Tyler and Ally sip cocktails at the nicest table in the
     place. There's an empty seat. Tyler's eyes flicker towards
     the door. Twice. He touches his tie.

                         TYLER
               Have you ever been here?

     Ally tries to lighten his mood.

                         ALLY
                   (joking)
               Yeah. Every Tuesday with my pop.

     This goes right past Tyler whose eyes flicker towards the
     door again.

                         TYLER
               He's allowed to stand me up. But
               he's not allowed to stand you up.
               Or my sister.

     Tyler finishes his drink, signals a WAITER who glides to the
     table.

                         TYLER
               I'll have a whiskey.

                         CHARLES
               Get me one too...

     Like a stealth bomber. At least this moment rescued the men
     from actually having to greet each other.

                         WAITER
               Yes. For the lady?

                         ALLY
               I'm fine, thank you.

     The waiter goes.

                         TYLER
               This is Alicia Craig. Ally, my
               father, Charles Roth.

     Charles gives a courtly nod and takes her hand.
                                                              72.


                         CHARLES
               A pleasure.


69   INT. RESTAURANT -- LATER                                  69

     An empty wine bottle. Charles cuts into a one-hundred dollar
     steak.

                         CHARLES
               You're going to be a social worker?

                         ALLY
               Yes. But with an area of focused
               responsibility. It's easier to find
               a job that way.

                         CHARLES
               What will your area be?

                         ALLY
               Criminal Justice.

                         CHARLES
               Tough area.

                         ALLY
               When I was little I wanted to play
               first base for the Mets. I don't
               think it's any harder than that.

                         CHARLES
               The Mets, huh.

                         ALLY
                   (arching an eyebrow)
               I'm from Rockaway.

                         TYLER
               Dad's a Yankee fan. It has
               something to do with the payroll.

                         CHARLES
               It has to do with significant ball
               playing. You were a Yankees fan
               when you were little. You were Lou
               Piniella for Halloween.

                         TYLER
               Blind familial allegiance. I didn't
               know what overpriced, overfed, fat
               bastards they were.
                                                         73.


                       CHARLES
             (serious as a heart attack)
             Who's fat? What Yankee is fat? Tell
             me.

                       TYLER
                 (right back at him)
             It's a metaphor...

Charles adjusts his tie and goes back to his steak.

                       TYLER
             Roger Clemens.

Charles looks at his son. Puts his fork down.

Silence at the table.

Back to the steak.

Beat.

                       ALLY
             Shane Spencer.

Charles looks up, taken aback.

                       ALLY
             Nick Johnson.

Tyler tries to get a word in.

                       CHARLES
                 (his mouth full of steak)
             He's big boned!

Charles and Ally burst out laughing. Tyler rolls his eyes

--TIME CUT

Dessert. Ally is working on an enormous profiterole. Tyler,
another whiskey.

                       CHARLES
             How long has your dad been a cop?

                       ALLY
             Twenty-two years.

His cell phone lights up. Charles gently puts his hand on
hers.
                                                                74.


                         CHARLES
               Would you excuse me please... I'm
               so sorry.

                          ALLY
               It's OK.

     Charles gets up from the table. Tyler, not able to help
     himself, shoots him a glance. Ally clocks it.

                         ALLY
               It's just a call. He held out 'til
               dessert.

     Charles returns.

                         CHARLES
               I'm sorry...And your mother?

                         ALLY
               She passed away when I was eleven.

                          CHARLES
               Ah.

                         ALLY
               She was murdered. I was there.

     Charles and Tyler are stunned to silence.

                         ALLY
                   (to Tyler)
               I never told you that part.

                         TYLER
               Why are you saying this now?

                         ALLY
               I don't know.

     The men look at her. She's a hero.

                         CHARLES
               And, here you are.

                         ALLY
               Yup. Here I am.


70   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME. KITCHEN.                            70

     There is an empty Lean Cuisine box, and two empty Beer Cans
     on the counter.
                                                              75.


     Craig stands by the microwave as it counts down...4,3,2,1.
     BEEP. He removes an Eggplant Parmigiana and slides it
     carefully on to a waiting plate.

     He takes it, along with a fresh beer, to the living room. He
     sits heavily on the sofa and hits a remote, unpausing ERIN
     BROCKOVICH.


71   EXT. IN FRONT OF THE FOUR SEASONS-- LATER                    71

     Tyler and Ally wait in front of the restaurant as Charles
     takes another call. A TOWN CAR and DRIVER wait as well.

                         ALLY
               I think he's lovely.

     Tyler puts his head in his hands.

                          TYLER
               God.

     Charles returns. His face blank.

                         TYLER
               Don't say it.

                         CHARLES
               I have to go to the office.

                         TYLER
               You have somewhere else to be, Dad.

     Charles adjusts his tie. Tyler loosens his.

     Ally is unsure where to look.

                         CHARLES
               The exhibit runs til nine. You guys
               take the car. I'll meet you.

                         TYLER
               I don't believe you.

                         CHARLES
               That's all there is, Tyler.

                         TYLER
               It's not good enough.

                         CHARLES
               I don't have to justify anything to
               you. Take the car. I'll get a cab.
               I'll meet you.
                                                                76.


     He steps into the street to hail a cab.

     Tyler watches his dad get into a taxi, then holds the car
     door for Ally.


72   INT. CAROLINE'S ART EXHIBIT-- PRATT AUDITORIUM -- LATER      72

     Amateur artwork and picked over catering. The rest of the
     exhibitors are high school age, even a college freshman or
     two. They mill with their friends and families. Animated.

     Ally and Aidan stand before a COLLECTION OF FAMILIAR
     PORTRAITS (Charles reading the paper at breakfast, Les and
     Diane kissing, Tyler on the park bench).

     Caroline sits on a catering table, Tyler next to her. She
     looks miserable, he looks furious. Diane bustles over with a
     plate of cupcakes and a big stupid grin.

                         DIANE
               I brought you every flavor.

     Caroline looks once at her mom then...

                         CAROLINE
                   (to Tyler)
               I'm ready to go home now.

     Tyler nods, takes her hand. Calls to...

                          TYLER
               Ally...?

     Les, eating a cupcake, and Ally, stand under a portrait of
     Charles. Ally picks up her purse. Diane standing there with
     her cupcakes.


73   INT. RAILROAD FLAT. RIGHT AFTER                              73

     Tyler, visibly agitated, is letting Ally in the front door to
     the apartment. He grabs his bike off the wall.

                         ALLY
               Where are you going?

                         TYLER
               I have something I've got to do.

                          ALLY
               Now?

     Ally reaches for his elbow. He yanks his arm away.
                                                              77.


                         TYLER
               Are you capable of taking care of
               yourself for an hour? Do you need
               me here every minute, or what?

     He slams out.

     Ally looks like she's been slapped.


74   INT. CHARLES'OFFICE -- RIGHT AFTER                        74

     Charles in a meeting with several SUBORDINATES. Everyone is
     in late night disarray. They are obviously on their way to
     pulling an all-nighter. The door to the office flies open.
     Tyler barges in. Janine trailing.

                         JANINE
               Tyler? Tyler? You can't just...

                         CHARLES
               It's fine Janine.

     There is space between the two men. Tyler extends a rolled up
     piece of paper to his father.

                         TYLER
               She drew you a picture.

                         CHARLES
               Put it on the table.

     Beat.

     Tyler holds on to the portrait.

                         TYLER
               You have a daughter who sincerely
               believes you don't like her.

                         CHARLES
               If I have any questions about what
               my daughter may believe, I'll let
               you know.

     Tyler gestures with the portrait

                         TYLER
               Don't you at least want to know
               her? She's telling you something,
               Dad. She's communicating. Why
               aren't you riveted? Why isn't this
               the most important thing? At least
               for one night of your life?
                                                   78.


                      CHARLES
            I've heard this song before, Tyler.

                      SUBORDINATE#1
            We can come back...

The subordinates rise.

                      CHARLES
            It's fine, Khaleel.

They sit.

There is still distance between the two men.

Beat.

                      CHARLES
            Who is this display for?

                      TYLER
            You, Mr. Roth.

Beat.

                      CHARLES
            She knows I will take care of her.

                      TYLER
            And...?

The subordinates rise again.

                      SUBORDINATE#1
            We really can come back another...

                      CHARLES
            Sit the fuck down.

They sit.

                      CHARLES
            And that I love her. I love her.
            Good God, you toss that word around
            like currency. You have no idea
            what it means.

                      TYLER
            Maybe not. Maybe Caroline doesn't
            either. Where would she have
            learned it?
                                                              79.


                         CHARLES
               I have provided her world. And
               yours.

                         TYLER
               That does not mean you're allowed
               to shatter it whenever there's
               something better to do.

                         CHARLES
               Who the hell do you think you're
               talking to? You pedaled down here
               on your bike for Christ's sake. You
               have to take care of nothing. You
               are responsible for no one. You're
               a kid. You think you're the first
               one to lose anything? Do you think
               that there is anything you feel
               that I haven't already felt?

                          TYLER
               You didn't find him. I found him.
               And you're so tragically blind, the
               rest of your children are going to
               hang themselves on your watch.

     Charles goes, snarling, for his son, and Tyler is more than
     willing.

     Janine and one of the Subordinates get between them.

                         JANINE
               Stop! Stop!

     The men are pulled apart. Tyler is white and trembling with
     rage. Charles' face is completely dark and closed.

                         JANINE
               Get out of here Tyler.

     Tyler runs for the door. Stumbling over furniture, Caroline's
     portrait crushed under his feet.


75   INT. RAILROAD FLAT -- RIGHT AFTER.                        75

     Ally, still in her dress, trying to excavate an ice tray
     frozen in the ancient freezer. There's got to be six inches
     of frost in there. She starts stabbing it with a wooden
     spoon. As she hears the door, she turns and puts on her most
     blistering attitude like an overcoat. As Tyler walks into the
     light-- his face white with anger, practically crying-- her
     eyes widen...
                                                                  80.


                            ALLY
               Oh my God.

     She runs to him, he falls into her. He's a mess. He won't let
     her see his face. She pushes at his hair, trying to see and
     understand. He kisses her, so she won't see. Tyler is
     completely lost in the storm and Alicia Santana Craig is
     going to get him through.

                            ALLY
               Okay.

     She yanks his head up.

                            ALLY
               It's okay.

     They kiss. She brings his hands up into her hair, around her
     face. They kiss. He kisses her like he's starved for her.

                                                        CUT TO:


76   TYLER'S BEDROOM -- LATER                                      76

     Tyler and Ally, wrapped around each other, both deeply
     asleep.


77   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- CRAIG'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON         77

     Craig, home from work. He hits the button on the answering
     machine. There's just one message.

                         ALLY O/S
                   (on the machine)
               Dad, it's me. I've been
               invited...I'm going away to the
               beach for Labor Day...They're nice
               people. If there's any problem I'll
               call. Or they will. Okay...Bye.

     As he takes off his jacket, Craig hits rewind and plays the
     message again...

                         ALLY O/S
                   (on the machine)
               Dad, it's me...


78   INT. DIANE'S MONTAUK BEACH HOUSE -- NIGHT -- SUMMER'S END     78

     Raucous laughter. Caroline, Tyler, Les, Ally and Aidan are in
     the living room playing charades.
                                                         81.


Everyone is a little sunburnt, the adults are a little drunk.
Ally is wrapped up in Tyler, Caroline is on her mom's lap on
the floor, Les next to them, lying on his stomach. Aidan is
up and God only knows what he's doing

                    LES
              (totally flabbergasted)
          I genuinely have no idea...are you
          having a seizure?

                      CAROLINE
          Time.

                    AIDAN
          Berlin Alexanderplatz!

More raucous laughter.

                    AIDAN
          You people are culturally bankrupt.

                    TYLER
          Whose was that anyway?

                      CAROLINE
          Mine.

Whoops of laughter heretofore unheard in Montauk.

                    DIANE
          Okay, you. Bed.

                    LES.
          Me? Yeah, baby.

                    CAROLINE
          Gross. Gross. Gross me out the
          door.

She rises and flees into the kitchen. Les rolls over and ends
up with his head in Diane's lap. He looks at her for a
moment.

                    LES
          You're just the prettiest girl.

Diane beams at him.

Tyler smiles at his mom and Les, then at Ally. Diane takes a
deep look at her son. Her eyes shining.

                    AIDAN
          Holy crap. What's with all the
          smiling?
                                                              82.


     Caroline travels through the living room with a popsicle. She
     is headed for her bedroom.

                         CAROLINE
               A child could do Berlin
               Alexanderplatz, you spaz.

     Les snorts with laughter. Diane rises, dumping him to the
     floor.

                            LES
               Hey!

                         DIANE
               I want five minutes with my child
               before she ceases to be a child and
               decides I'm ruining her life.

     On her way out, Diane pauses and gently pushes one of Ally's
     stray curls behind her ear. Smiles down at her.

                         DIANE
               Aren't you a treasure.

     Ally stares up at Diane for a beat, her eyes shining.


79   INT. AMTRACK -- PASSENGER CAR (MOVING) -- DAY               79

     Tanned and rejuvenated, Ally, Tyler, and Aidan sit together
     on the train back to the city.

     Ally and Tyler kiss. Aidan watches them.

                         AIDAN
               I want a girlfriend.

                            TYLER
               What?

                         AIDAN
               Dinners out, movies. Regular sex.
               That could be all right. For like,
               a summer.

                         ALLY
               You're such a romantic.

                         AIDAN
               And I've had all the races.

                            ALLY
               Excuse me?
                                                 83.


                    AIDAN
          I've had all the races. I've been
          with girls from every...race.

Ally laughs.

                    TYLER
          That is the stupidest thing you've
          ever said, including that time with
          the bong in the emergency room.

                    ALLY
          White girl.

                    AIDAN
          Please. Like falling off a log. As
          a matter of fact...

                    ALLY
          Shut up. Black girl.

                    AIDAN
          But of course.

                    ALLY
          Asian.

                    AIDAN
          Twice.

                    ALLY
          Latina.

                    AIDAN
          Oui!

                    ALLY
          A Latin girl actually slept with
          you? What's her name? She's out of
          the club.

Tyler is laughing. Ally thinks for a moment.

                    ALLY
          Eskimo.

Aidan gives a satisfied smile.

                    TYLER/ALLY
          No way!

                    AIDAN
          Monica Ipellie. She works at the
          Public Library on 96th street.
                                                           84.


                    ALLY
          You slept with an Eskimo?

                    TYLER
          You went to the library?

The car doors open and a MAN ushers his family through.   It's
Craig's partner Leo, in plain clothes.

                    AIDAN
          Inuit. In-u-it, Ally. Try not to
          show your ignorance.

                    ALLY
          I don't believe you.

                    AIDAN
          Fine. Nice girl. While we were
          doing it, I couldn't get this
          little, like, song out of my
          head...

He begins to bob his head to a rhythm.

                    AIDAN
          "Inuit, bum buh bum, I'm banging an
          Inuit, bum buh bum buh bum..."

Ally and Tyler collapse in laughter as Craig's Partner passes
He notices Ally immediately. She doesn't see him. He takes a
long look at Tyler as he follows his wife and kids into the
next car.

                    ALLY
          Prove it. Ten bucks.

The train makes a stop at Patchogue. Leo and family
disembark.

                    AIDAN
          You wanna go to the library?

                    ALLY
          The minute we get off this train.

                    AIDAN
          Fine.

                    ALLY
          Tyler, are you coming?

                    TYLER
          I'll skip this particular
          bloodbath, thank you.
                                                                 85.


80   INT. TYLER'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- HALLWAY -- LATER          80

     Tyler, his bag on his shoulder, returning home, fishing in
     his pocket for his keys.

     He sings the Inuit song to himself...

                         TYLER
               bum buh bum bum buh bum buh bum...

     His front door is unlocked.

     Tyler freezes. Takes a beat. Scans the room, silently
     dropping his bag. He reaches behind him for the aluminium bat
     against the door. Wielding it, he takes two steps into the
     apartment.

     Craig, in plain clothes, sitting on Tyler's bed, amidst the
     carnage of Tyler's stuff. He has been rifling through
     everything. The guitar is propped haphazardly against the
     wall.

     Craig looks up. The men lock eyes.

     Craig's eyes go to the bat.

     Tyler leans it slowly against the wall.

     Beat.

                         CRAIG
               Where is she?

                         TYLER
               What are you doing in my house?

     Craig's eyes flash.

                         CRAIG
               Where's my daughter?

                         TYLER
               She's not here now. She's at the
               library.

     Craig's face says it: "Bullshit".

                         CRAIG
               Does she know?

     Cops never ask a question they don't know the answer to.

                           TYLER
               No.
                                                            86.


                    CRAIG
          I didn't think so. I figured you'd
          probably leave that up to me when
          you're done with her.

Craig's face, like his wife's so many years ago, is pure
contempt. With his body at this angle, Tyler can now see his
gun.

                    TYLER
          I'm not going anywhere.

                    CRAIG
          That's true, Tyler Roth, son of
          Charles and Diane. Brother of
          Caroline and Michael, deceased,
          suicide by hanging. You're kinda
          lost, aren't you? Taking a little
          vacation in coach before finding
          your way back to first class?

                    TYLER
          I'm the one she came to when you
          used her face as a punching bag.

Craig closes the distance.

From Tyler's P.O.V he looks like a freight train.

In a flash, he gets Tyler in a choke hold, flips him on his
back on the bed and puts his hands around Tyler's throat.

Silence, except for exertion.

Tyler's hands are on Craig's wrists. He is holding Craig's
eye. His face is starting to turn colors.

Beat.

Beat.

                    TYLER
          She needs you.

It travels between the two men. Craig grappling with it,
although he still has his hands at Tyler's throat.

Craig drops his hands, pushes himself off Tyler

Tyler rolls to one side, coughing and gagging.

Craig leans against the wall for support.
                                                              87.


     He is trying, before our eyes, to pull the shards of himself
     together. His gun visible at his waistband.

     Tyler's coughing, his face still red, his eyes travel briefly
     to the bat, then to Craig.

     Craig closes his eyes, very briefly, then rises. Not looking
     at Tyler.

     Beat.

     Looking at Tyler.

     Beat.

     Craig goes to the front door.

                         CRAIG
               Get a fucking dead bolt.

     Slam. And then he's gone. The door bounces in its frame. And
     then it's just Tyler trying to remember how to breathe.


81   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LATER.                               81

     Tyler smoking, standing at the window, waiting for Ally. He
     sees her walking up to the front door. He grinds his
     cigarette out. Ally is running up the stairs

                         ALLY O/S
               Tyler Keats Roth!

     She arrives at the door.

                         ALLY
               He banged an Inuit!
               She's really nice. And smart. I
               don't get it.

     Beat.

                         ALLY
               What's going on?

                         TYLER
               Your dad was here.

                         ALLY
                   (panicking)
               What?

                         TYLER
               When I got home.
                                                         88.


Beat.

                    ALLY
          I hate him!

She lunges for the phone. Tyler stops her hand.

                    TYLER
          There's more.

She looks like she's starting to panic.

                    TYLER
          He knows me. Before I met you. He
          arrested me and Aidan. He gave me
          that gash over my eye.

                    ALLY
          I don't understand.

                    TYLER
          I mouthed off to him. He ...
          responded. Then Aidan saw you guys
          together at school.

She isn't quite getting it.

                    TYLER
          Aidan suggested...I...introduced
          myself to you.

She's got it.

Beat.

                    TYLER
          Ally...

                    ALLY
          I'm going to be sick.

She bolts from the chair to the sink and dry heaves. Tyler
reaches out to comfort her.

                    TYLER
          Hey.

She reels around and cracks him across the face. Not like a
chick. Like her dad.

The sound hangs in the air.

Ally goes to the bedroom and starts throwing her stuff in her
bag. Tyler follows her.
                                                              89.


                         TYLER
               Don't do that. What are you doing?

                         ALLY
               Do you realize what you've done?

                           TYLER
               Yeah.

     He doesn't.

                         ALLY
               Did you think I would never find
               out? I mean, think about it. I had
               to find out eventually. You set it
               up that way.

                         TYLER
               But it doesn't mean anything. I
               didn't mean to hurt you,

                         ALLY
               No. That's exactly what you meant
               to do.

     She pushes past him and out the door.


82   INT. TYLER'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- STAIRWELL --           82

     Ally heads down. Aidan heads up. He smiles wide.

                           AIDAN
               Hey.

     Ally pushes past him.

                           ALLY
               Prick.


83   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LATER THAT NIGHT                     83

     Tyler sitting on the ratty couch. Aidan eats old Chinese food
     from the container. He offers some to Tyler. They sit in
     silence. Tyler swelling. Aidan eating.

                         AIDAN
               You had to tell her eventually...

     This is no comfort.
                                                               90.


                         AIDAN
               Glass half full... you just saved
               yourself an awkward Thanksgiving.

     Sincere now.

                         AIDAN
               She'll be back, T.

     Tyler heads into his bedroom and shuts the door.


84   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT                  84

     Sergeant Craig working on a sink full of dirty dishes. He
     scrubs at a filthy pan with a piece of steel wool. He's manic
     but there's not a beer can in sight.

                         ALLY O/S
               You know you're not supposed to use
               that on non-stick pans...

     Craig turns, finds her there in the doorway, bag at her feet.

                         ALLY
               It takes off the teflon.

     They stare at each other for a moment.

                         ALLY
               You should let it soak.

                          SERGEANT CRAIG
               Okay.

     They look at each other. Craig tries a smile. Ally's cool
     with him. Moving towards him, past him.

                         ALLY
               I'm going upstairs.


85   EXT. EAST SIDE MANHATTAN APARTMENT BUILDING -- EVENING      85

     Caroline and Diane walk up to the DOORMAN. Caroline carries a
     gift, a sleeping bag. Diane smiles at her daughter.

                         CAROLINE
               Stop smiling. You look insane.

     Diane can't help it try as she might.
                                                                  91.


                         DIANE
               I'm sorry, honey. I just... it's
               nice. Like an end of the summer
               send off.

     Caroline rolls her eyes.

                            DIANE
               Have fun.

     Caroline goes into the lobby. Diane heads back to her car.


86   INT. EAST SIDE    APARTMENT--   FOYER                         86

     Caroline gives her gift to THE BIRTHDAY GIRL who smiles. She
     follows her into the next room where the other PARTY GUESTS
     watch a movie. They all turn and look at Caroline.

     Caroline smiles sheepishly. Some of the MEAN GIRLS are there,
     One of them gives her a perfunctory smile.


87   INT. LANDMARK SUNSHINE MOVIE THEATER -- HOUSTON STREET --     87
     NIGHT.

     Jackie Chan's foot slamming through a wall.

     Tyler and Aidan are watching RUSH HOUR 2.

     Aidan slurps from a super mega sized soda, laughing, enjoying
     himself. He turns to his friend. Tyler sits, completely
     drained, looking like the loneliest guy on the planet.

     Aidan gives him a nudge. Tyler looks at the screen for a sec
     and half smiles, then slips away again. Aidan is genuinely
     concerned.


88   INT. EAST SIDE APARTMNT-- KITCHEN -- NEXT MORNING             88

     The party girl's MOM is in a bathrobe. She looks horrified,
     she has one hand covering her mouth and is whispering into a
     cell phone. Caroline is on the kitchen phone. Her long hair
     has been CUT TO PIECES while she slept. She is crying.

                            CAROLINE
                      (into the phone)
               Mom?


89   INT. CRAIG FAMILY HOME -- LATER THAT MORNING                  89

     Ally and her father cook breakfast together. There's a knock.
                                                                92.


90   EXT. DOORSTEP.                                                 90

     Aidan paces nervously. Craig appears in an apron. Aidan
     smiles.

                            AIDAN
               Hi.

     Beat.

                         AIDAN
               Is this the, uh, that is, does, uh,
               Alicia Craig. Does she live here?

     Craig nods.

                         AIDAN
               Oh great. I'm...

                         CRAIG
               You think I don't remember you?

                            AIDAN
               No, sir.

                         ALLY
               Who is it Dad?

     Ally sees Aidan. She touches her father's forearm.

                            ALLY
               It's OK...

     Craig steps back into the house. Six inches.

                            ALLY
               Really.

     He backs into the hall. Aidan and Ally are alone.

                         ALLY
               What do you want?

                         AIDAN
               Look, I'm a prick.

                            ALLY
               And...

     Craig popping back like an eel from a wreck.    He's got the
     mangled Honey Bear.

                            ALLY
               Dad...
                                                                 93.


     He goes again. Pfft. Aidan's visibly relieved.

                         AIDAN
               Tyler's not.

     She starts to close the door.

                         AIDAN
               Wait. Shit. This isn't really my
               thing.

                         ALLY
               He lied to me.

                         AIDAN
               He's in love with you.

                         ALLY
               He'd like to think he is.

     Aidan doesn't get it.

                         AIDAN
               I don't know what that means...I've
               seen him look at one other girl the
               way he looks at you. She's a lot
               shorter and shares his DNA.

     Ally looks away.

                         AIDAN
               You don't have to forgive him
               today... just forgive him.

     Craig reappears from the deep.

                         CRAIG
               Thanks for stopping by.

     Father and daughter go back into the house.

     Aidan exhales.


91   INT. HOFFMAN FAMILY HOME -- CAROLINE'S BEDROOM -- LATER      91

     Diane is on the house phone, preparing a tray of tea and
     cinnamon toast for Caroline as she talks.
                                                                94.


                         DIANE
               Are you telling me, Ms. Spencer,
               that you intend to let those girls
               stay in your school?...Of course
               they're all sticking to the same
               story and that story is a load of
               crap!...

     She slams a cabinet closed as Les picks up the tray and WE
     TRACK HIM down the hall to CAROLINE'S ROOM. Les is speaking
     on his cell phone.

                          LES
                   (sotto, into the phone)
               She's pretty traumatized. I wanted
               to pull some names together in case
               we all decide she should talk to
               someone...


92   INT. CAROLINE'S BEDROOM.                                     92

     Caroline and Tyler are lying on Caroline's bed. Her head is
     nestled on his shoulder. She looks even tinier than usual.
     Tyler is reading to her, softly, from The Book of Greek
     Myths, his other hand stroking her butchered hair.

     She looks pale, wasted. Her eyes are sunken and she's
     fighting sleep. A losing battle, she's exhausted. Her lids
     finally shutter to the sound of her brother's voice.

     Les, at the door, places the tray on Caroline's desk...

                         LES
                   (on the phone)
               There's no witnesses and it didn't
               happen on school property. The
               school won't do anything. They'll
               probably get away with it...

     Tyler's eyes, registering anger and shock, jump from the page
     as he hears this.


93   INT. FOYER.                                                  93

     Diane opening the front door for Aidan and Ally. Aidan wraps
     his arms around Diane and gives her a hug. Ally hangs back a
     bit, unsure, then embraces Diane.

     Tyler emerges from the hallway.
                                                              95.


                         TYLER
                   (to Diane)
               She's asleep.

     He sees Aidan and Ally. Stops short.


94   EXT. FRONT STEPS -- LATER                                    94

     Tyler alone on the top stair, taking long pulls from a
     cigarette. Ally comes out the front door, softly closes it
     behind her.

                         TYLER
               Last one ever. I swear.

                         ALLY
               I don't care.

     Beat.

                         TYLER
               I know you're not here for me but,
               thank you for being here.

     A silent moment passes.

                         TYLER
               For what it's worth, I think you're
               amazing.

                         ALLY
               It's not worth much. You made
               everything between us a lie.

                            TYLER
               I'm sorry.

                         ALLY
               Okay. Now what? I'm supposed to
               just forgive you?

     A BMW 7 Series speeds around the corner. Stops in front of
     the house. Charles gets out of the car, sees his son.

                         CHARLES
               How is she?

                         TYLER
               She's sleeping.

     Diane emerges from the house. Charles strides quickly towards
     her.
                                                              96.


95   INT. BEDROOM -- LATER                                       95

     Caroline asleep in her bed. Charles stands in the doorway
     watching her sleep, we get the feeling he hasn't seen her
     asleep in some time. Diane appears at his side.

                         CHARLES
               How long do you think she'll sleep?

                         DIANE
               I think she'll be out for a while.
               Would you like to wait?

                         CHARLES
               Thank you. I can't. I'll call her
               later.

                         DIANE
               I'll tell her.

     Diane looks at Charles. He's still watching his daughter.


96   INT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- CLASSROOM -- MORNING                 96

     Caroline's TEACHER prepares her lesson plan. She starts to
     write the date on the board when The door opens. Caroline and
     Tyler enter. The entire class is watching. It's dead quiet.

     Caroline puts her trembling hands in her pockets.

     Tyler looks at a few of the girls. They look back,
     unconcerned, almost amused. Tyler walks his sister to her
     desk.

                         TYLER
                   (to Caroline, whispering)
               You okay?

     Caroline nods, although her eyes are brimming. As she slips
     out of her jacket, the contents of her pockets clatter
     noisily to the floor. Tyler immediately bends to help her.


                         MEAN GIRL
               Have you done something different
               with your hair? I love it!

     SNICKERING LAUGHTER. Caroline looks like a deer in
     headlights.

                         TEACHER
               Okay, okay. Enough.
                                                               97.


      Tyler moves towards an EMPTY DESK. Some girls keep
      snickering. Suddenly, Tyler grabs the desk. THROWS it through
      the air.


97    INT. HALLWAY -- SIMULTANEOUS                                 97

      A JANITOR pushes a flat broom down the empty corridor when
      the glass from one of the classroom doors explodes as the
      desk makes impact. He stops pushing the broom and stares.


98    INT. CLASSROOM -- LATER                                      98

      Pin-drop silence. The students sit paralyzed. Tyler stares at
      the Mean Girl. Her arrogance completely gone. Caroline stares
      up at her brother, awestruck.


99    INT. HOLDING CELL -- LATER                                   99

      TYLER locked up among CRACK HEADS and PETTY CROOKS on a dirty
      bench with his hands behind his head and a bemused smirk. A
      BAILIFF approaches the holding cell. Looks at Tyler.

                          BAILIFF
                You posted.


100   INT. NYPD PRECINCT -- LATER                              100

      Charles standing in the waiting area. Tyler is led out by the
      bailiff rubbing his wrists. He sees his father, his face
      registering surprise.

      Beat.

      The men walk together towards the exit in silence. Neither
      looking at the other.

                          CHARLES
                Destruction of private property and
                felony trespassing.

                          TYLER
                I didn't call you.

                          CHARLES
                I know you didn't.

      Charles stops.
                                                                 98.


                            CHARLES
                  I have unleashed a raging shitstorm
                  of epic proportions on the board of
                  trustees of that pissant school
                  that will not abate until those
                  girls seek enrollment elsewhere. I
                  give them a week.

      Beat.

                            CHARLES
                  I know you think I'm a prick, but I
                  have my uses.

      Guess so.

                            CHARLES
                  Can you come by the office to talk
                  to the lawyers?

      Beat. Tyler deciding.

      Tyler nods.

      Charles appraises his son.

                            CHARLES
                  Try not to vandalize any more
                  schools in the meantime.

      Charles walks ahead, pulling out his cell phone.

      Tyler calls after him.

                            TYLER
                  Thank you for bailing me out.

      Charles, without turning around,

                            CHARLES
                  No problem.


101   EXT. NYU -- FRONT STEPS -- BEAUTIFUL SEPTEMBER MORNING     101

      Tyler leaning against the bike rack, waiting. He sees Ally
      running up the steps and watches her as she blends into the
      crowd.


102   EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK -- JUST AFTER.                 102

      No mimes, just dealers. Ally with a girlfriend, walking
      towards the East Side. Tyler catches up to her.
                                                                 99.


      Shakes the friend's hand. After a beat, Ally agrees to walk
      with him. He reaches for her hand. She pulls it away, but
      walks next to him.


103   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- ALICE STATUE -- JUST AFTER.            103

      Tyler has convinced Ally to come uptown and meet Caroline
      with him.

      Tyler and Caroline climb all over the Alice, while Ally
      watches from a bench.

      As befitting a seventh grader, Caroline turns her face to the
      sun and arranges herself to take advantage of the early
      September tanning possibilities.

      Tyler walks over to Ally's bench, sits next to her.

      Beat.

                          ALLY
                Using the little sister is dirty
                pool.

                          TYLER
                    (carefully)
                Is it working?

      Beat.

                           ALLY
                Maybe.

      Tyler has a smile the size of New York City.

      Ally smiles back.

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:


104   INT. TYLER'S BEDROOM -- THE NEXT MORNING                    104

      Bright sun pouring through the window. Ally lying asleep.

      Tyler is up and dressed now, he grabs his journal off his
      desk, kneels beside Ally. He is bathed in the pool of light
      streaming in.

                           TYLER
                    (nuzzling)
                Hey...Hey.
                                                              100.


                           ALLY
                Hmmm.

                          TYLER
                I'll be back in an hour. I have to
                stop by my dad's office.

                          ALLY
                    (sleepily)
                Do you want french toast or
                pancakes for breakfast?

                          TYLER
                Whichever tastes better a la mode.

      Ally smiles.

                          ALLY
                Say hi to your dad for me.

      Tyler watches her lying there.

                          TYLER
                If I said I love you... what would
                you say?

                          ALLY
                    (laughing)
                I love you.

                          TYLER
                I love you too.

      Tyler kisses her. Then heads out into the...


105   INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER                        105

      Aidan passed out on the couch still wearing the clothes he
      went out in the night before. Tyler watches him sleep.

                          AIDAN
                    (without opening his eyes)
                French toast.

      Tyler smiles as he takes his journal and exits.


106   EXT. HOFFMAN FAMILY HOME -- PORCH -- MORNING             106

      Charles waiting on the doorstep, his Town Car waiting on the
      curb. Diane answers the door expecting to find Caroline's
      driver, she's confused to find...
                                                              101.


                             DIANE
                  Charles?

                            CHARLES
                  Good morning Diane.

                            DIANE
                  What are you doing here?

                            CHARLES
                  Tyler's coming by the office, but I
                  thought I'd ride to school with
                  Caroline first.

      Diane is speechless. This is a first.

                            DIANE
                  Um...OK...sure...yeah...great.
                  She's not ready though, she's going
                  to need at least twenty minutes.

      Charles hates waiting.

                             CHARLES
                      (adjusting his tie)
                  All right.


107   EXT. SIDEWALK -- LATER                                      107

      Tyler chaining up his bike. His cellphone rings. He checks
      it. Knows what it's regarding before he answers.

                            TYLER
                  Are you canceling all together or
                  are you just running late?


108   INT. CHARLES' TOWN CAR-- MORNING                            108

      Charles and Caroline in the back seat. She's on one side,
      with her pink back pack, he's on the other.

                            CHARLES
                      (on the phone)
                  Are you already on your way?

      INTERCUT:


109   EXT. OPEN PLAZA.                                            109

      Tyler rounding a corner.
                                                              102.


                          TYLER
                I'm already here.

                          CHARLES
                I'm taking Caroline to school.

      He looks at his daughter. She looks back at him, then looks
      out the window.

      Tyler considers.

                          TYLER
                Take your time. I'll just wait in
                your office.

                          CHARLES
                It may be a while.

                          TYLER
                That's okay.

      Tyler hangs up and joins the herds of suits heading down the
      street.


110   INT. ELEVATOR -- LATER                                      110

      Tyler riding in a handsome marble and oak elevator with a
      half-dozen EXECUTIVE types. Tyler steps on and presses the
      number 92. The doors close.


111   INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- RECEPTION -- LATER                  111

      Tyler walks, approaches the Receptionist from the ashtray
      incident. He smiles pleasantly. She doesn't.

                             TYLER
                Janine in?

                           THE RECEPTIONIST
                    (cold)
                She went for coffee.

                          TYLER
                She getting me any? Just kidding.

      Tyler heads down the hall. The Receptionist rolls her eyes.


112   INT. CHARLES ROTH'S OFFICE -- LATER                         112

      Tyler steps into his father's empty office. It's dark, quiet.
      He opens the blinds. Sunlight fills the room.
                                                                103.


      Tyler walks around the office. Picking things up, putting
      them back.

      Tyler sits at his father's desk in his executive chair. He
      leans back. Puts his feet up and his hands behind his head.

      Tyler notices the COMPUTER. He turns on the monitor and puts
      his hand on the mouse - but doesn't move it. His hand just
      stops and stays perfectly still. Tyler stares at the monitor
      where his dad's SCREEN SAVER is scrolling through PHOTOS...

      These photos are all of his FAMILY... "Michael's first
      Christmas, Tyler's eighth birthday, Diane in the hospital
      with Caroline in a pink blanket, Charles and his kids build a
      sand castle at the shore"... they just keep going.

      Tyler finds himself watching a slide show of his life.


113   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- LATER                                113

      That line of luxury cars dropping their daughters off.
      Charles' Town car rolls to a stop. Caroline gives him a kiss
      on the cheek. It registers, sort of. She gets out. Charles
      watches her all the way into the school.

      His DRIVER sees him watching Caroline in the rear view
      mirror.

      Charles gives the Driver a look "you're waiting for an
      invite?"

      The Driver peels out.


114   INT. TYLER'S APARTMENT -- KITCHEN -- LATER                  114

      Ally has made a mess making french toast. Aidan is yakking on
      his phone.


115   INT. TOWN CAR -- LATER                                      115

      Charles in traffic. All around him DRIVERS curse, honk, hate
      each other. Charles rides, not letting it bug him.


116   INT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- CLASSROOM -- LATER                   116

      Caroline drawing at her desk as her Teacher comes in and gets
      ready to start the day.
                                                              104.


117   INT. CHARLES ROTH'S OFFICE -- LATER                      117

      Tyler is still watching the screen saver when Janine enters.

                          JANINE
                Good Morning, Mister Roth.

                          TYLER
                Did you know about this?

      Janine walks around the desk in time to see a photo of Tyler
      and Michael naked in the tub pop up. She smiles.

                          JANINE
                Who do you think scanned all the
                pictures?

      Tyler smiles. Janine smiles, Then a photo of Michael comes
      up. Those smiles fade. Silence.

                          JANINE
                How old would he be?

                          TYLER
                Twenty-nine last May.

      Tyler stands and looks out one of the floor-to-ceiling
      windows separated by columns. He stares out at mid town and a
      perfect blue sky. Janine looks befuddled.

                          JANINE
                It's really been that long? I
                could've sworn it was...

                          TYLER
                May 18, 1993.

      A silent moment passes. Janine reflecting.

                           JANINE
                I should be able to remember that.
                I'm sorry.

      Tyler looks at her, his face easy...

                             TYLER
                It's okay.


118   INT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- CLASSROOM -- LATER                118

      Caroline's Teacher writes the date on the board as Caroline
      sits quietly doodling. The teacher looks her way.
                                                              105.


                          TEACHER
                Caroline? Hello?

      WIDE SHOT of the blackboard. It's unmistakable:

                    SEPTEMBER 11, 2001


119   EXT. CHARLES ROTH'S OFFICE -- LATER                         119

      We're now looking at Tyler from just outside Charles' office
      window and we're PULLING BACK...

      Until we see Tyler framed in the window surrounded by eerily
      familiar grey metal siding...

      Until we see can barely see Tyler and the base of a giant
      white antenna...

      Until we can no longer see Tyler as he's disappeared into the
      composite of the building and we've pulled back far enough to
      reveal that Tyler is standing in a window on the...

      92nd Floor of The North Tower of the World Trade Center.

      A moment of still perfect silence. The Towers. The blue sky.

      Then we hear the faint sound of AA Flight 11's ENGINES as it
      closes in on the North Tower.

                                                  CUT TO BLACK.
      Silence. Darkness. We wait in it.

                          TYLER V/O
                Whatever you do in life will be
                insignificant but it is very
                important that you do it because...


120   EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN -- THAT MORNING                        120

      Charles Roth steps out of his car. His gaze fixed skyward.
      All around him the other DRIVERS mimic his behavior.

                          TYLER V/O
                It's a good bet...


121   EXT. DIANE'S BROWNSTONE STOOP-- LATER                       121

      Diane sweeping cigarette butts off the stoop.

                          TYLER V/O
                Nobody else will...
                                                              106.


      Diane joins a group of ONLOOKERS staring up from a street
      corner in Brooklyn where the black smoke stains the blue sky.
      One of them has a radio to his ear.

                             TYLER V/O
                Michael...

      Diane staring at it.

                           TYLER V/O
                Someone's been trying to tell me
                something.


122   EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER /OR OUTSIDE THE PRECINCT?--      122

      Craig, through a LONG LENS standing by his car with the door
      open. He is, crystal clear, barking orders, while waves of
      blue and slashes of orange float around him.

                          TYLER V/O
                Maybe it's you...


123   EXT. TYLER'S APARTMENT-- ROOF --LATER                    123

      Aidan and Ally absolutely frantic on the roof. Holding hands.
      Craning to see. Ash begins to float down on them. It gets
      caught in Ally's hair.

                          TYLER V/O
                This girl! Ally! Her life, even the
                nightmare parts seeped into me and
                I swear to God I can hear you
                better.


124   INT. PRIVATE SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- LATER                  124

      A door flies open. Caroline runs out into the empty hall, to
      the exit.

                          TYLER V/O
                What's that about? I've always been
                the worst listener.


125   EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN -- STREETS                          125

      THE PAPER, so much of it, all of it singed, smoke-stained,
      falling like snow flakes coating the streets and the
      sidewalks. Amongst the memos and faxes that will now never be
      sent and never received we find...
                                                                107.

126   EXT. CEMETERY -- A GREY MORNING                             126

      A light rain falls. Two TOMBSTONES stand side-by-side.

                          MICHAEL ROTH
                May 20, 1969

                September 11, 2001

      Charles, Caroline, Diane and Les approach the tombstones. A
      family mourning. Diane slips her hand through Charles' elbow.
      The gesture seems quite natural, easy.

      DISSOLVE TO:


127   INT. NYU DORM-- DAY                                         127

      We find Ally, with a ROOMMATE, putting up lively, Indian
      Print curtains in their NYU dorm.


128   EXT. LINCOLN CENTER. WHERE:                                 128

      Caroline literally dragging Charles into the ROSE BUILDING AT
      LINCOLN CENTER, while he yells into his cell phone.

                          TYLER V/O
                And half of you says "Danger! Stay
                in your cave! You're nowhere near
                ready!"

      Caroline has come to the end of her rope with her dad. She
      grabs his phone and throws it into the fountain, spins on her
      heel and marches into the auditorium. Charles is completely
      thunderstruck.

                          TYLER V/O
                And the other half -- and this is
                the part I think is you --

      He is torn between his phone and his daughter for a sec,
      chooses Caroline and takes off after her...

      ...then comes running out by himself to rescue his phone.
                                                               108.


129   INT.   JAPANESE RESTAURANT -- DINNER                        129

      Craig is wearing a jacket and tie. He's on a date with a
      pretty WOMAN. In his confusion over the menu, he knocks over
      a glass of water.

                           TYLER V/O
                 Says "Go get her! Immediately! Make
                 her yours forever!"


130   INT. DIANE'S OFFICE-- DAY                                   130

      A chaotic place, filled with folk who need help. Diane at a
      desk, organizing families.

                           TYLER V/O
                 I'm working on the forever part.


131   INT. NYU --                                                 131

      Aidan actually awake in class. He has a tattoo on his
      forearm. "Tyler".

                           TYLER V/O
                 I'm going to have to step up my
                 game. But I'm glad I listened.


132   EXT. SMITH STREET STATION -- BROOKLYN -- NIGHT              132

      Ally, we find her as we first found her mother, silhouetted
      against the Lower Manhattan skyline where two beams of purple
      light reach up forever where the Towers once stood.

                           TYLER V/O
                 I love you.

      Her train pulls into the station. Ally boards with a few
      other commuters. She takes a seat by herself across from...

      A MOM and A TODDLER, a little girl. The baby is squirming
      impossibly, the mom looks exhausted.

      Ally watches them, remembers him, as the faintest hint of a
      smile crosses her lips the subway lights flicker and we...

                                                    CUT TO BLACK.

          City lights. The soaring bridges and glowing windows of New

          INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947. FLASHBACK.
          
          A party   of bohemian types in the village. Artist's canvases
          propped   up against the walls. A narrow hallway with couples
          talking   intimately. Two rooms crammed with young people
          smoking   and drinking.
          
          A man and a woman in their 20's stand alone in a corner...
          
          FRANK WHEELER, intelligent good-looks, and APRIL JOHNSON, a
          patrician beauty, a woman amongst girls. He's been making
          her laugh.
          
                                FRANK
                      So, what do you do?
          
                                APRIL
                      I'm studying to be an actress.
                      You?
          
                                FRANK
                      I'm a longshoreman.

                          (smiles)
                      No, I mean really.
          
                                FRANK
                      I mean really too. Starting
                      Monday, though, I'm doing something
                      a little more glamorous. Night
                      cashier at a cafeteria.

                          (smiles)
                      I don't mean how you make money.   I
                      mean what are you interested in?
          
                                FRANK
                      Honey - if I had the answer to that
                      one, I bet I'd bore us both to
                      death in half an hour.
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          She laughs.   He smiles, revelling in her attention.
          
          
          INT. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT - NIGHT, 1947, LATER.
          
          Later, Frank and April dance. They move well, in sync,
          looking into each other's eyes. He slides his hand down the
          silk of April's dress until it rests in the small of her
          back.
          
          Close on their hands. Their fingers slowly entwine as they
          lose themselves in each other...
          
                                                         SMASH CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, PRESENT.
          
          Close on Frank's face, seven years later, full of doubt and
          tension as he watches his wife, April, on stage and as we
          hear the hollow VOICES of a very bad amateur play...
          
          Finally, mercifully, the curtain falls.   Nothing.   Then
          vigorous, relieved applause.
          
          Frank hears a voice from behind, through the applause:
          
                              WOMAN
                    Thank God that's over...
          
          April takes the final bow. She's fighting not to cry. Frank
          applauds her loudly. Looks around to see who else is joining
          him. But there is no noticeable crescendo in the applause.
          
          Then Frank hears the voice again:
          
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)
                    ...And she was very disappointing.
          
          He can't argue.
          
          
          INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Frank now moves against the crowd of exiting audience members
          towards the stage. He keeps his head lowered, avoiding eye-
          contact, until he feels a hand on his sleeve.
          
                                                                      3.
          
          
          MR. AND MRS. GIVINGS, an older couple, are standing in his
          way.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Frank! Very nice Frank!
          
                              FRANK
                    Thanks, Mrs. Givings.
          
          Frank steps around her.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    I can't tell you how much we
                    enjoyed it. You have a very
                    talented wife.
          
          Frank forces a smile as he goes.
          
                              FRANK
                    I'll pass it along!
          
          
          INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          April sits alone at her dressing table crying.
          
          
          INT. BACK STAGE - NIGHT.
          
          The CAST mills backstage. The mood is subdued, but some have
          decided to make light of the disaster.
          
          Frank moves through the crowd.    Across the room, he sees -
          
          MILLY CAMPBELL, 30's, determinedly bright, up on her tip-
          toes. Her husband SHEP, 30's, heavy-set, is still in
          costume, shell-shocked and pebbled with sweat.
          
                              MILLY
                    Frank!
          
                              FRANK
                    Hi!
          
                              MILLY
                    She's through there...!
                        (points)
                    You `bout ready for that drink?
          
                                                                      4.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Couple of minutes!
          
          
          INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Frank enters. The chair in front of the mirror is empty. A
          cigarette burns in the ashtray. Frank glances at a standing
          screen in the corner. April's costume is draped over the
          top. He goes towards it, deciding what to say.
          
                               FRANK
                        (heartfelt)
                    April, sweetheart.   You were great.
                    I mean it.
          
          The door to the bathroom opens. April enters in street
          clothes. Frank's been talking to an empty room.
          
                              APRIL
                    Hi. You about ready to leave?
                    I've just got to get this makeup
                    off, then we can go.
          
          She sits in front of the mirror, too embarrassed to look at
          him. FRANK can see that her face is blotchy from crying. He
          puts his hand on her shoulder.
          
                              FRANK
                    Well... I guess it wasn't a triumph
                    or anything, was it?
          
          APRIL looks at him in the mirror. She holds his look just a
          second. And from her expression, he knows he said exactly
          the wrong thing.
          
                              APRIL
                    I guess not. I'll be ready in a
                    minute.
          
                              FRANK
                    Take your time.
          
          He removes his hands and lights a cigarette.     APRIL begins to
          take off her makeup.
          
                                                                        5.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    Will you do me a favor? Milly and
                    Shep wanted us to go out with them
                    afterwards. Will you say we can't?
                    Say it's because of the baby sitter
                    or something?
          
                              FRANK
                    Well, the thing is, I already said
                    that we could. I mean, I just saw
                    them out there and I said we would.
          
                              APRIL
                        (tense)
                    Oh. Then would you mind going out
                    again and saying you were mistaken?
                    That should be simple enough.
          
                              FRANK
                    Don't you think that's a little bit
                    rude, April?
          
                              APRIL
                    Well I'll tell them myself.
          
                               FRANK
                    Okay. Okay. Take it easy. I'll
                    tell them.
          
          He backs to the door.
          
          
          INT. HIGH-SCHOOL CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
          
          April and Frank walk down a long empty echoing corridor, past
          school lockers, booster club posters and silent classrooms.
          
          They don't touch.   They don't speak.   The tension between
          them is palpable.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT.
          
          Frank drives. April stares ahead.    Their faces are lit by
          the dashboard. After a while...
          
                                                               6.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    I mean it, baby. You were the only
                    person in that play.
          
                                 APRIL
                    Thank you.
          
          He looks over at her.
          
                              FRANK
                    We just never should've let you get
                    mixed up in the damned thing.
          
                                 APRIL
                    All right.
          
                              FRANK
                    You've studied for Christ's sake.
          
                              APRIL
                    Could we sort of stop talking about
                    it now?
          
                              FRANK
                    Sure. I just don't want you
                    feeling bad about it, that's all.
                    Because it's not worth it. I mean,
                    it's bad enough having to live out
                    here among these damn people -
                    what'd you say?
          
                              APRIL
                    I said yes. All right, Frank.
                    Could you just stop talking now,
                    before you drive me crazy, please?
          
          Frank clenches his jaw and flips on the indicator.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing? Why are we
                    stopping?
          
          
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT.
          
          The car comes to a stop at the side of the road.
          
                                                                   7.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER CAR - NIGHT.
          
          Frank turns off the ignition.   He slides towards her.
          
                              APRIL
                    No, Frank, please don't...
          
          He puts his arms around her.
          
                              FRANK
                    Baby, it's okay...
          
                              APRIL
                    Please don't touch me.
          
                               FRANK
                    April...
          
                              APRIL
                    Why can't you...just... LEAVE ME
                    ALONE!
          
          Frank slides back behind the wheel.    Beat.
          
                              FRANK
                    It strikes me, that there's a
                    considerable amount of bullshit
                    going on here.... And there's one
                    or two things I'd like to clear up.
                    Number one, it's not my fault the
                    play was lousy. Number two, it's
                    sure as hell not my fault you
                    didn't turn out to be an actress,
                    and the sooner you get over that
                    little piece of soap opera the
                    better off we'll both be. Number
                    three, I don't happen to fit the
                    role of dumb, insensitive suburban
                    husband; you've been trying to hang
                    that one on me ever since we moved
                    here. Number four -
          
          She opens the door and is out of the car, flashing across the
          headlights. Frank struggles with his door.
          
                                                                     8.
          
          
          EXT. HIGHWAY SHOULDER - NIGHT.
          
          April stands in the dark 30 yards from the road looking over
          an expansive countryside. There's only a few lights in the
          distance. This is still farmland.
          
          Frank comes up behind her, careful to keep his distance.
          
                              FRANK
                    What the hell are you doing?     Come
                    back to the car.
          
                             APRIL
                    No. Just let me stand here a
                    second.
          
          Frank raises his arms in exasperation. A car approaches.    He
          puts a hand in his pocket and tries to look casual. The
          car's headlights light up April's back, then pass.
          
                              FRANK
                    April?
          
          She doesn't move.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Look, can't we sit in the car and
                    talk about it, instead of running
                    all over Route Twelve?
          
                              APRIL
                    Haven't I made it clear I don't
                    particularly want to talk about it?
          
                              FRANK
                    Okay. Jesus, I'm trying to be nice
                    about this thing.
          
                              APRIL
                    How kind of you. How terribly,
                    terribly kind of you.
          
                              FRANK
                    Wait a minute. I don't deserve
                    this.
          
                                                                    9.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    You're always so wonderfully
                    definite, aren't you, on the
                    subject of what you do and don't
                    deserve?
          
          She turns and walks past him back towards the car.
          
                              FRANK
                    Wait a minute!
          
          He stumbles after her.   Other cars whizz by, but he's past
          caring.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Wait a minute, God damn it!
          
          She leans against the car and folds her arms.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    You listen to me. This is one time
                    you're not going to get away with
                    twisting everything I say.
          
                              APRIL
                    Christ, I wish you'd stayed home
                    tonight!
          
                              FRANK
                    You know what you are when you're
                    like this? You're sick. I really
                    mean that. You're sick!
          
                              APRIL
                    And you know what you are?
                        (eyes raking him)
                    You're disgusting.
          
                                FRANK
                    Oh, yeah?
          
                              APRIL
                    Just because you've got me safely
                    in this little trap, you think you
                    can bully me into feeling whatever
                    you want!
          
                                                                    10.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    You in a trap! You in a trap!
                    Jesus, don't make me laugh!
          
                              APRIL
                    Yes, me.
                        (clutching at her chest)
                    Me! Me! Me! Oh, you poor, pathetic
                    little boy ­­ Look at you! Look at
                    you, and tell me how by any stretch
                    of the imagination you can call
                    yourself a man!
          
          He raises his fist, she flinches away, and BONG! BONG! BONG!
          BONG! He punches the hood of the car. Then, silence. The
          look April gives him is probably the worst look he's ever
          received: a look of pitying boredom.
          
                              FRANK
                    Don't look at me like that, April.
          
                              APRIL
                    Could we please go home now?
          
          She calmly walks around and gets in the car.    After a moment,
          Frank follows...
          
          
          INT. CAR - NIGHT.
          
          They sit silently in the car in the darkness.
          
          TITLE CARD: REVOLUTIONARY ROAD
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - MORNING.
          
          A small, attractive suburban house in the morning sunshine.
          Frank walks out to the car, stops and looks back at the
          house.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - MORNING.
          
          April stands at the window.   The SOUND of the car pulling
          away.
          
                                                                   11.
          
          
          EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD TRAIN STATION - MORNING.
          
          Frank stands on a grey platform, amongst a crowd of
          commuters. The morning commuter train eases into the
          station.
          
          
          INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - MORNING.
          
          Frank sits against the train window holding a "New Yorker."
          Around him, the train is crowded with men reading newspapers.
          
          
          INT. GRAND CENTRAL PLATFORM - MORNING.
          
          In one swift movement, all the doors of the commuter train
          swing open as a hundred feet step down onto the platform.
          
          
          INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - MORNING.
          
          An empty stairwell in Grand Central: a tide of grim,
          determined commuters rise into view. A mass of suits and
          hats. Frank is amongst them.
          
          
          EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - MORNING.
          
          Knox Headquarters -- a squat, formidable structure.   Thick
          HONKING traffic. Crowded sidewalks.
          
          Frank walks with the crowd past a display window: bright
          cardboard images of fashionable women grin and point their
          pencils at a list of product benefits - "SPEED, ACCURACY,
          CONTROL."
          
          Pride of place at the center of the display is a new Knox 500
          Electronic Computer with a sign that reads: "Performs A Man's
          Lifetime of Work in Just 30 Minutes!"
          
          
          INT. KNOX BUILDING ELEVATOR - MORNING.
          
          Frank rides crushed against the wall in a crowded elevator.
          He glances over at -
          
          MAUREEN GRUBE, 23, ripe, a little obvious, but undeniably
          sexy.   She meets his look. And looks away.
          
                                                                    12.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - MORNING.
          
          Frank opens the bottom right drawer of his desk, props up his
          feet and lights a cigarette.
          
                              JACK (O.S.)
                    I'm going to need your help this
                    morning, Old Scout.
          
          Seated beside Frank, JACK ORDWAY, 40's, tall and effete with
          greying hair, appears to be hard at work, hunched over a
          file. He is, in fact, propping up his head with his hand
          while shielding his eyes.
          
                              JACK (CONT'D)
                    For the next few hours, you're to
                    warn me of Bandy's every approach
                    and you may have to screen me from
                    public view in the likely event I
                    that I throw up. It's that bad.
          
                              FRANK
                    Good morning, Jack.
          
                              JACK
                    Nothing good about it, I assure
                    you.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY.
          
          April drags two overflowing garbage cans to the curb. She
          stops and looks down the empty road. Not a single human
          being in sight.
          
          Close on April's face.
          
          
          INT. MRS. GIVINGS' CAR - DAY, 1948. FLASHBACK.
          
          Mrs. Givings sits behind the wheel, driving slowly along a
          suburban street talking at high speed.
          
          Frank sits beside her wearing sunglasses.    April sits in the
          back.
          
          We don't yet see what Mrs. Givings is describing, only as it
          plays on their faces.
          
                                                                   13.
          
          
                               MRS. GIVINGS
                    Of course, I knew the moment you
                    came off the train what you were
                    looking for... A small remodeled
                    barn, or a carriage house ­ And I
                    just hate to be the one to tell you
                    that sort of thing just isn't
                    available anymore... But I don't
                    want you to despair. There is one
                    place down here I want to show
                    you... Now of course it isn't very
                    desirable at this end.
                        (gestures)
                    As you see, Crawford Road is mostly
                    these little cinder-blocky, pick-up
                    trucky places ­ plumbers,
                    carpenters, little local people of
                    that sort.
          
          Frank turns around to April, lowers his glasses. April
          stifles a giggle.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    But eventually...
                        (she points, her arm fully
                         extended)
                    Eventually it leads up to
                    Revolutionary Road, which is much
                    nicer. Now, the place I want to
                    show you, is a sweet little house
                    and a sweet little setting.
                    Simple, clean lines, good lawns,
                    marvelous for children. It's right
                    around this next curve... Now,
                    you'll see it ­ there.
          
          They all look.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    See the little white one? Sweet
                    isn't it? The perky way it sits
                    there on its little slope?
                    Charming, isn't it?
          
          April smiles.    A smile full of promise.
          
                                                                    14.
          
          
                               APRIL
                    Oh, yes.
          
          
          INT. BANDY'S OFFICE - DAY. PRESENT.
          
          Frank's FIST raps against the door of an office...
          
          TED BANDY, 46, tight and precise, looks up from behind a well-
          organized desk.
          
                              FRANK
                    You wanted to see me?
          
          Bandy holds out an envelope from behind his desk.
          
                              BANDY
                    Came for you from Toledo this
                    morning.
          
          Frank reaches for it, but Bandy moves it out of reach.
          
                              BANDY (CONT'D)
                    This is the third one this month.
          
                              FRANK
                    Oh, right, sorry. I thought I'd
                    taken care of that...
          
          Frank reaches again, but Bandy moves it.   A little man
          enjoying his power.
          
                              BANDY
                    I'm not prepared to have this
                    conversation again, Frank. You
                    understand?
          
                              FRANK
                    ...Absolutely, yes.
          
                              BANDY
                    These folks in the provinces look
                    up to us, Frank.    We need to be
                    efficient. We can't have this kind
                    of back and forth, and so forth.
                    It's just not efficient. Am I
                    right?
          
                                                                    15.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    ...Absolutely, yes, yes...
          
          Bandy finally hands over the envelope.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - DAY.
          
          Frank sits at his desk.
          
                              JACK
                    What was that about?
          
                              FRANK
                    Toledo. Branch manager wants a
                    revised brochure for the conference
                    on "The Knox 500."
                        (impersonating Bandy)
                    "It's just not efficient."
          
                              JACK
                        (sharp inhale)
                    Sounds like a real goodie.
          
                              FRANK
                    I don't even know what the Knox 500
                    does... Do you?
          
                              JACK
                    Don't insult me.
          
          Frank drops it in his In Box. Then, looking up, he sees
          Maureen across the office. Thinks.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, MAUREEN'S DESK - DAY.
          
          Frank stands over Maureen at her desk.   The envelope from
          Toledo lies in front of her.
          
                              FRANK
                    Now, if you'll look in the inactive
                    file under SP-1109 you'll find
                    copies of all the stuff we sent to
                    the agency... and that way we can
                    trace the thing back to its
                    original sources.
          
                                                                    16.
          
          
          She nods, jotting down a note.
          
          For the first time, Frank allows himself to take in her
          profile, her cleavage, her lips.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I hope you weren't planning on an
                    early lunch.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    I'm not really hungry.
          
                              FRANK
                    Good. I'll check on you later.
          
          
          INT. ALGONQUIN HOTEL RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON.
          
          Maureen and Frank sit in a secluded corner.    Maureen sips a
          martini. She's already a little drunk.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    You know something? You're lucky
                    you met me.
          
                                MAUREEN
                    Oh?    How's that?
          
                              FRANK
                    I can show you the ropes. There's
                    an art to survival at Knox. Let me
                    show you what I mean.
          
          He waves over the waiter.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Bring me the telephone would you?
                    And two more martinis.
          
          Maureen looks daunted at her empty glass.
          
                                MAUREEN
                    Wow.
          
          The waiter brings over the phone. Frank dials. He holds his
          finger to his lips. He uses an authoritative tone.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Hello Mrs. Jorgensen. Frank
                    Wheeler here. Just wanted to let
                    you know that I've had to send
                    Maureen Grube down to Visual Aides
                    for me. I'll probably need her the
                    rest of the day... Okay? Fine.
                    You too.
          
          Frank hangs up and smiles at Maureen.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    I never even heard of Visual Aides.
          
                              FRANK
                    That's because it doesn't exist.
          
          Maureen smiles.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
          
          Now we're moving behind April as she moves through the silent
          house. She carries a basket of dirty laundry on her hip.
          She pulls the bedding off the couch. The distant SOUND of
          children playing.
          
                                MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.)
                    Yoo-hoo!
          
          She turns to see Mrs. Givings at the screen door.
          
          April manages a friendly smile.
          
                                APRIL
                    Hi Helen.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    I can't stay a minute... My, don't
                    you look comfy! I just wanted to
                    bring this sedum for that messy
                    patch in the front yard.
          
          She puts it on the table.
          
                                                                 18.
          
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    All it wants is just a tiny dollop
                    of water for the first few days,
                    and you'll find it absolutely
                    thrives.
          
                              APRIL
                    Well, thank you... You want some
                    coffee?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Only if you're having some.
          
          Helen sits down. With the end of her finger, she pushes a
          dirty dish out of her way.
          
                              APRIL
                    Is there something I can do for
                    you, Helen?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh... yes, I almost forgot. I do
                    have a small favor I'd like to
                    ask...
                        (quiver of anxiety )
                    It's about my son, John. He's been
                    in the hospital.
          
                              APRIL
                    I'm sorry to hear that.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Well, actually, just for the
                    present, he's in Pleasant Brook...
                    Psychiatric.
          
          April's face.   She knows what it means.
          
                              APRIL
                    ...I'm so sorry.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh... Nothing serious. He just
                    got a little run down. Things can
                    just get the better of us
                    sometimes. Don't you think?
          
                                                                  19.
          
          
                                APRIL
                    Yes.    Of course.
          
          Mrs. Givings smiles. Then, pretending to read the titles on
          a stack of books on the table...
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    It really is a marvellous facility
                    and the treatments seem to be doing
                    him wonders... Anyway, they said
                    getting out for an afternoon might
                    do him some good.
          
          She pauses on Sartre's `Nausea', looks at it vaguely.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    I think he finds my friends a
                    little conventional, frankly. I
                    mean, he's travelled. He has a PhD
                    in mathematics. I suppose you
                    could say he's an intellectual. It
                    would do him a world of good to
                    meet a young couple like you.
          
                              APRIL
                    We'd love to Helen.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    So, I thought perhaps if you had
                    some time...
          
                              APRIL
                    We'd love to.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                        (flushed with relief)
                    Thank you, dear... Thank you.
          
          April smiles generously.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    I remember when you first came off
                    the train. You weren't like most
                    of my clients. You were different,
                    somehow.
          
          April's face.    She's listening.
          
                                                                        20.
          
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    Well, you looked simply ravishing
                    and I just knew Frank did something
                    terribly brilliant in town. You
                    just seemed... special... Of
                    course you still are.
          
          April takes this in.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HOUSE - AFTERNOON.
          
          April watches from the picture window as Mrs. Givings walks
          down the drive towards her car. Her face is reflected in the
          glass. Something is taking shape in her mind.
          
          
          INT. ALGONQUIN RESTAURANT BAR - AFTERNOON, LATER.
          
          The dining room is now almost empty.     Waiters and busboys eat
          in the corner.
          
          Frank cuts a solitary figure.     He lights his last cigarette
          and crumples the pack.
          
                              MAUREEN (O.S.)
                    I guess you got me a little drunk.
          
          Maureen slides into the booth.     She stares at the table,
          trying to focus.
          
                              FRANK
                    You know what today is?
          
                                 MAUREEN
                    ...Monday?
          
                               FRANK
                    It's my birthday.      I'm thirty years
                    old today.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    Happy birthday!
          
          Maureen raises her glass, then sways drunkenly.
          
                                                              21.
          
          
                              MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                    What was the name of the department
                    you made up again?
          
                              FRANK
                    Visual Aides.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    ...What-a-joke.
          
          He sips his drink.
          
                              FRANK
                    Want to hear a real joke...?
          
          She looks up at him.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    My old man worked at Knox.
          
                                 MAUREEN
                    Yeah?
          
                              FRANK
                    He was a salesman in Yonkers. Once
                    a year he used to take me into the
                    city for lunch. It was supposed to
                    be a special, life-advice sort of
                    occasion.
          
                                 MAUREEN
                    Nice.
          
                              FRANK
                    Not really... I used to sit there
                    and think, `I hope to Christ I
                    don't end up like you.'
          
          Frank grins as if it's supposed to be very funny.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    And here I am, a thirty year old
                    Knox man. Can you beat that?
          
                              MAUREEN
                    I think I kind of lost you...   Your
                    father worked for Knox...?
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                     22.
          
                              MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry, but everything's kinda
                    going out of focus.
          
          Frank takes her arm to steady her.   She meets his eye.
          
                              FRANK
                    How `bout some air?
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - DAY.
          
          Close on a hand opening an old cigar box.
          
          April is sitting with the box at the kitchen table. It
          contains various sentimental knickknacks from her past,
          including photos of the kids, of her and Frank in New York
          with friends, and a photograph of Frank in uniform beneath
          the Eifel tower on liberation day... She studies it.
          
          
          INT. BETHUNE STREET APARTMENT - DAWN, 1947. FLASHBACK
          
          Frank fixes coffee in the tiny kitchen.
          
          April is sitting up in bed in the first blue light of day
          wearing Frank's T-shirt. She holds a curled collection of
          black and white photographs in her lap. She stops on the
          same picture of Frank and the Eifel Tower.
          
          Frank comes over with the coffee, and two cigarettes.     He
          lights them both, and gives her one.
          
                              FRANK
                    You ever been to Paris?
          
                              APRIL
                    I've never really been anywhere.
          
                              FRANK
                    Maybe I'll take you with me.
          
          He lies down with his cigarette between his teeth.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I'm going back first chance I get.
                    People are alive there.
          
          He stares up at the ceiling.    She studies him.   Appraising.
          
                                                                   23.
          
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    All I know now is that I want to
                    feel things. Really feel them.
                    How's that for an ambition...?
          
                              APRIL
                    Frank Wheeler?
          
                                 FRANK
                    Mm?
          
                              APRIL
                    I think you're the most interesting
                    person I've ever met.
          
          He looks at her, overwhelmed by her face in the light.
          
                                 APRIL (CONT'D)
                    I mean it.
          
          
          INT. MAUREEN'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
          
          Frank stands at the mantle tying his tie.
          
                              FRANK
                    Well, I guess this wasn't what you
                    had in mind when you went to work
                    this morning?
          
          Maureen covers herself with the sheets.
          
                               MAUREEN
                    No.   It certainly wasn't.
          
          Frank inspects the contents of the mantle: photos of Maureen
          at the prom; Maureen with her parents.
          
          Maureen tentatively fingers her hair that has now gone to
          frizz. The sheet slips down. She grabs at it. Then wills
          herself to calm down and act sophisticated.
          
                              MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                    Do you have a cigarette, Frank?
          
          He turns and smiles at her.
          
                                                                     24.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Sure, here.
          
          He comes over and gives her one. Lights it with his Zippo.
          She exhales, slowly gaining confidence.
          
          Frank gets up and pulls on his jacket.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    Can I get you a drink or anything?
          
                              FRANK
                    No thanks, Maureen. Actually, I
                    guess I'd better be cutting out,
                    it's getting kind of late.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    Gee, that's right.   Have you missed
                    your train?
          
                              FRANK
                    It's all right, I'll get the next
                    one.
          
          He comes over to her.   Bends down, kisses her gently on the
          lips.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Listen: you were swell. Take care
                    now.
          
          
          INT. FRANK'S STATION CAR/WHEELER HOUSE - NIGHT.
          
          Frank's station car turns into the driveway.     He sits there a
          moment in the darkness.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER FRONT DOOR - NIGHT.
          
          Frank approaches the door with his key. He takes a moment to
          gather himself, but before he can, the door opens.
          
          April is dressed in a black cocktail dress. She looks
          wonderful. She smiles. She steps forward and takes his face
          in her hands. She kisses him.
          
                                                                    25.
          
          
                                 APRIL
                    Frank...
          
                              FRANK
                    Why are you all dressed up?
          
          She hands him a glass of whiskey and closes his fingers
          around it.
          
                              APRIL
                    First of all, I missed you all day
                    and I want to say I'm sorry. I'm
                    sorry for the way I've been since
                    that stupid play. I'm sorry for
                    everything and... And I love
                    you... Now wait here till I call
                    you. Okay?
          
          She goes, leaving Frank in stunned silence.    He takes a large
          drink.
          
          From inside the house, the sound of the children's voices.
          Whispering, giggling. Then April's voice:
          
                              APRIL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Alright Frank! You can come in
                    now!
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING AND DINING ROOMS - NIGHT.
          
          Frank enters the house.    Walks through the darkened living
          room towards the light.    Enters the dining room.
          
          The room is lit by the candles burning on a birthday cake.
          
          JENNIFER, 7, MICHAEL, 5, and April sit around the table
          wearing paper birthday crowns.
          
          They sing Happy Birthday.
          
          
          INT. SHOWER - NIGHT.
          
          Frank scrubs his skin, his scalp, his face: trying to wash
          away Maureen.
          
                                                                      26.
          
          
          He turns off the water.   He stands there in the silence,
          regaining control.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Frank steps out of the bathroom. April turns from the mirror
          wearing the silk negligee and comes towards him with two
          glasses.
          
                              APRIL
                    Frank. I have had the most
                    wonderful idea. I've been thinking
                    about it all day.
          
                              FRANK
                    What's all this about?
          
                              APRIL
                    You know how much money we have
                    saved...?
          
          She hands Frank a glass of brandy.
          
                               APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Enough to live on for six months
                    without you earning another dime.
                    And with the money we could get
                    from the house and the car, longer
                    than that.
          
                              FRANK
                    What we get for the house...What
                    are you talking about? Where are
                    we going to live?
          
                                APRIL
                    ...Paris.
          
          Frank stares.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    You always said it was the only
                    place you'd ever been that was
                    worth living. So why don't we go
                    there?
          
                                                            27.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    You're serious?
          
                               APRIL
                    Yes.   What's stopping us?
          
                              FRANK
                    What's stopping us? Well, I can
                    think of a lot of things. For
                    instance, what kind of a job could
                    I possibly get?
          
                              APRIL
                    You won't be getting any kind of
                    job, because I will.
          
          Frank laughs.
          
                                 FRANK
                    Oh, right.
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't laugh -- listen a minute!
                    Have you any idea what they pay for
                    secretarial positions in the
                    government agencies in Europe?
                    Embassies and those things.
          
          Frank laughs again.
          
                              FRANK
                    No, I don't.
          
                              APRIL
                    I'm serious about this Frank. Do
                    you think I'm kidding or something?
          
                              FRANK
                    No, I know, I know. I just have a
                    couple of questions, is all. For
                    one thing, do you mind telling me
                    what exactly I'm supposed to be
                    doing while you're out earning all
                    this money?
          
          She draws back, shocked that he doesn't get it.
          
                                                                   28.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't you see that's the whole
                    idea? You'll be doing what you
                    should've been allowed to do seven
                    years ago. You'll have time,
                    Frank. You'll have time to find
                    out what it is that you actually
                    want to do, and when you figure it
                    out you'll have the time and the
                    freedom to start doing it.
          
                              FRANK
                    Sweetheart, it's just not very
                    realistic, is all.
          
                              APRIL
                    Well, I happen to think this is
                    unrealistic. I think it's
                    unrealistic for a man with a fine
                    mind to go on working like a dog
                    year after year at a job he can't
                    stand, coming home to a place he
                    can't stand, to a wife who's
                    equally unable to stand the same
                    things.
          
          Frank is silent.   How could anyone possibly argue with her?
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    You want to know the worst part?
                    Our whole existence here is based
                    on this great premise that we're
                    somehow very special and superior
                    to the whole thing, and you know
                    what I've realized...? We're not!
                    We're just like everyone else.
                    Look at us!   We've bought into the
                    same ridiculous delusion. This
                    idea that you have to resign from
                    life and settle down the moment you
                    have children. And we've been
                    punishing each other for it.
          
                              FRANK
                    Listen: we decided to move out
                    here. No one ever forced me to
                    take the job at Knox.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                          29.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I mean who ever said I was supposed
                    to be a big deal, anyway?
          
                              APRIL
                    When I first met you, there was
                    nothing in the world you couldn't
                    do or be.
          
                              FRANK
                    I was a little wise guy with a big
                    mouth, that's all.
          
                              APRIL
                    You were not! How can you even say
                    that?
          
                              FRANK
                    ...All right... So, I'll have
                    time. And God knows that's
                    appealing. It's very appealing.
                    And I mean, everything you say
                    might make a certain amount of
                    sense, if I had some definite
                    talent maybe. If I were an artist
                    or a writer.
          
                              APRIL
                    But Frank, listen to me: It's what
                    you are that's being stifled here.
                    It's what you are that's being
                    denied and denied and denied in
                    this kind of life.
          
                              FRANK
                    And what's that?
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't you know...?
          
          He looks at her.   She gazes back at him.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    You're the most valuable and
                    wonderful thing in the world...
                    You're a man.
          
                                                                   30.
          
          
          Frank looks at her. In that moment, he loves her more than
          ever before. He kisses her.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    This is our chance, Frank.   This is
                    our one chance.
          
          Beat.
          
                               FRANK
                    Okay.
          
                               APRIL
                    Okay?
          
                              FRANK
                    Why not...? Why the hell not?
          
          April throws her arms around him.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, ELEVATOR BAY - MORNING.
          
          DING. The elevator doors slide open.   Frank steps onto the
          fifteenth floor, full of energy.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, FRANK'S CUBICLE - MORNING.
          
          Frank arrives at his desk.   Casually tosses his briefcase
          down. Lights a cigarette.
          
          Jack stands nearby making idle chat with office co-workers,
          ED SMALL, 36 and VINCE LATHROP, 33 - a pair of overgrown
          children.
          
                              JACK
                    Ah, Franklin. Good to see your
                    shining face.  What's the news?
          
                              FRANK
                    I'm moving to Paris.
          
                               JACK
                    Right.   And I'm moving to Tangiers.
          
          Frank shrugs, smiles, picks up the Toledo file, scans it.
          
                                                                   31.
          
          
          He reaches for his Dictaphone and clears his throat.
          
                              FRANK
                    ...Intra-company letter to
                    Toledo... Attention B.F. Chalmers,
                    branch manager... With regard to
                    recent and repeated correspondence,
                    this is to advise that the matter
                    has been... very satisfactorily
                    taken in hand, period, paragraph.
          
          He takes out a cigarette.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    We wholly agree that the existing
                    brochure is unsuitable. To this
                    end we have developed...
          
          He lights the cigarette with a SNAP of his Zippo.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    "Speaking of Production Control..."
          
          Smiles. He's making it up as he goes, and enjoying it.   It's
          all meaningless now!
          
          
          INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE - DAY.
          
          April sits in the American Express office.
          
                              CLERK (O.S.)
                    Here you are Mrs. Wheeler:
          
          A handsome CLERK smilingly hands her a stack of documents.
          
                              CLERK (CONT'D)
                    Here's the travellers checks you
                    asked for... and your steamer
                    reservations... and these I'll pass
                    on to the embassy for you.
          
                                 APRIL
                    Thank you.
          
          She looks at them in her hands: it's real.
          
                                                                    32.
          
          
                                 CLERK
                    Good luck.
          
          April smiles.
          
          
          INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT - DAY.
          
          Jack, Frank, Ed and Vince sit crammed in a booth in a tiny,
          crowded Midtown Luncheonette.
          
          Frank looks pleased with himself.    The rest sit in stunned
          silence.
          
                              JACK
                    And when does this noble experiment
                    commence?
          
                                 FRANK
                    September.     October at the outside.
          
          Jack and Vince exchange a look.
          
          Frank's enjoying the effect.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I just happen to think people are
                    better off doing some kind of work
                    they actually like.
          
                              ED
                        (vague)
                    Right, yes.
          
                              VINCE
                        (mumbled)
                    Absolutely, absolutely.
          
                              JACK
                    But... I mean, assuming there is a
                    true vocation waiting for you.
                    Wouldn't you be just as likely to
                    discover it here as there?
          
          A waitress puts the check on the table.
          
                                                                    33.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    No... I don't think it's possible
                    to discover anything on the
                    fifteenth floor of the Knox
                    building, and I don't think any of
                    you do either.
          
          The men are silent.   Frank picks up the check.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    This one's on me.
          
          
          EXT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - AFTERNOON
          
          Frank is standing leaning against a coffee bar in Grand
          Central Station. He is finishing a beer.
          
          It is rush hour, and amidst the sea of people, he is the only
          one not moving.
          
          He is watching all the people walking by with an air of
          detached amusement. As if he were now above them all.
          
          
          EXT. SPACE BETWEEN TRAIN CARS - AFTERNOON.
          
          Frank rides between train cars. The wind whips his hair. He
          takes a deep pull from a pinched cigarette - then flicks it
          straight as a bullet into the passing countryside.
          
          He feels alive.
          
          
          EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD TRAIN STATION - AFTERNOON.
          
          The commuter train slows into the station. A door swings
          open. And Frank leaps from the still moving train onto the
          platform. He slows to a walk.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          The kids dance back and forth through the sprinkler,
          shrieking with pleasure.
          
          April sits on the steps in front of the house reading some
          material from the American Express office.
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
          She looks up as Frank's car pulls into the drive. He steps
          out of the car and comes towards her. She looks up and
          smiles. He drops his brief case on the ground and walks
          towards her. She meets him in the middle of the lawn, and
          they embrace.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - EVENING.
          
          CLOSE UP - two fingers walk the journey from New York to
          Paris across the page of an atlas.
          
          Michael and Jennifer, dressed for bed, sit sandwiched between
          April and Frank under the bedclothes.
          
                              APRIL
                    ...All the way to... here.
          
          A pause as the two kids stare at the Atlas.
          
                               JENNIFER
                    But why?
          
                              APRIL
                    Well, sweetheart. It's a big world
                    out there and we thought maybe we
                    should go see a little bit of it.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How far is it?
          
                              APRIL
                    A long way. We have to take a
                    boat ride over the sea to get
                    there.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I won't know anyone there.
          
                              APRIL
                    I know. And neither will I. But
                    remember when you started school?
                    And now look how many friends you
                    have...
          
          Frank senses that they are a little concerned.   April and
          Frank look to one another.
          
                                                                    35.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    You'll never guess what they eat in
                    Paris. You'll never guess...
          
                               JENNIFER
                    What?
          
                               FRANK
                    Snails.
          
                               JENNIFER/MICHAEL
                    Snails?!
          
                              APRIL
                    And frog's legs!
          
          The children dissolve into disgusted laughter.    April and
          Frank laugh with them.
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL FRONT HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          At the bottom of the stairs, Shep hums a big band number as
          he vigorously shines his shoes.
          
                              SHEP
                    Buddappa banh!     Banh!   Banh!
          
          He takes a swig of beer and lets out a satisfied belch.
          
          
          INT. MILLY AND SHEP'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          Milly sits at a vanity table doing her face. She wears a
          floral dress and her hair's been done. She looks at Shep in
          the mirror.
          
                               MILLY
                    You better get changed, they'll be
                    here soon.
          
                              SHEP
                    That what you're wearing?
          
                              MILLY
                        (panic)
                    Don't you like it?
          
                                                                     36.
          
          
                             SHEP
                    ...No... No. You look great,
                    doll. Guess I better haul ass.
          
          He walks into the bathroom.    Milly looks back at her
          reflection.
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          The small explosion of a beer can opening.
          
          Shep watches the golden liquid fill his glass.
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL FAMILY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          Shep walks through the living room with his glass of beer.
          He's halfway across the room, before he notices -
          
          His four SONS dressed in matching pajamas, propped up on
          their elbows chewing gum at the television screen.
          
                                 SHEP
                    Hiya gang.
          
          They don't even look up.
          
          
          EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - EVENING.
          
          Shep walks across the grass to the edge of his property. He
          drinks and looks down over Revolutionary Road. He can see
          the Wheeler house. He takes a drink of beer, his eyes
          focused on the house.
          
                                 MILLY (O.S.)
                    Shep?
          
          Shep wheels around. April and Frank are standing there with
          Milly. April wears a new indigo silk dress. Her hair moves
          in the warm breeze. She's never looked better.
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL LIVING ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Shep mixes drinks with his back to the room.
          
                                                                  37.
          
          
          Milly walks in and places two heaping trays of hors d'ouvres
          on the coffee table.
          
                              APRIL
                    Oh those look great.    I'm starving!
          
          April helps herself.
          
                              MILLY
                    April, I can't get over it - you
                    look like the cat who ate the
                    canary! Do you have something to
                    tell us? A little bit of news?
          
                              SHEP
                        (disapproving)
                    Not to pry or anything.
          
                              MILLY
                        (suddenly unsure)
                    I'm not prying. Am I prying?    I
                    didn't mean to.
          
                              FRANK
                    Actually, we have got some pretty
                    important news.
          
          Shep and Milly look up expectantly.
          
          He smiles conspiratorially at April.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    You want to tell `em?
          
          April smiles back at him.
          
                              APRIL
                    We're going to Europe.    To Paris...
                    To live.
          
          Milly's face drops.    Shep is frozen.
          
          Overlapping:
          
                                 MILLY
                    What?
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                                  SHEP
                     When?
          
                                  MILLY
                     Why?
          
                                  FRANK
                     September.
          
          Beat.   Then:
          
                               MILLY
                     But what for?
          
                               FRANK
                     What for? Because we've always
                     wanted to. Because the kids are
                     still young. Because it's
                     beautiful. Shep, you tell her.
          
                               SHEP
                     ...It's a great city.
          
          Milly glances nervously at Shep.
          
                               MILLY
                     When did you make this decision?
          
                               APRIL
                     Oh... about a week ago... its hard
                     to remember. We just suddenly
                     decided to go, that's all.
          
                               MILLY
                     About a week ago, and you tell us
                     now!
          
                               APRIL
                     We had to get used to the idea.
          
          Shep forces himself across the room and hands the Wheelers
          their drinks.
          
                               SHEP
                     So, what's the deal, Frank? You
                     get a job over there, or what?
          
                                                        39.
          
          
                            FRANK
                      (smiles)
                  No. Not exactly.
          
                            SHEP
                  What do you mean, `not exactly?'
          
                            APRIL
                  Frank won't be doing any kind of a
                  job, because I will.
          
                            SHEP
                      (to Frank)
                  And what are you going to do?
          
                            FRANK
                  I'm going to study... and I'm going
                  to read and... I suppose I'm going
                  to finally figure out what I want
                  to do with my life.
          
                            SHEP
                  ...While she supports you?
          
          Beat.
          
                            FRANK
                  Yes. While she supports me...   At
                  least in the beginning.
          
                            APRIL
                  You wouldn't believe what they pay
                  for secretarial work in government
                  agencies over there. NATO and
                  E.C.A. and those places.
          
                             FRANK
                  The cost of living is dirt cheap
                  compared to here, so we should be
                  all right.
          
          Beat.
          
                             APRIL
                  The truth is we just need something
                  different.

                               APRIL (CONT'D)
                     We're not getting any younger and
                     we don't want life to just pass us
                     by.
          
                               MILLY
                     Gee, it sounds wonderful, kids. I
                     mean it; it really sounds
                     wonderful. We'll certainly miss
                     you, though - won't we, sweetie?
                     Golly.
          
                                SHEP
                     Sure.
          
                                MILLY
                     Paris.   Wow.
          
          A   silence.   Shep's face.
          
          
          INT. MILLY AND SHEP'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Milly sits on the edge of the bed in her night gown.   She is
          brushing her hair.
          
          Shep stands in the open doorway to the bathroom, doing up his
          pyjamas. After a beat...
          
                               SHEP
                     You know what I think?
          
          Milly looks up.
          
                               SHEP (CONT'D)
                     I think this whole plan sounds a
                     little immature.
          
          Milly's face brightens.
          
                               MILLY
                     Oh God, I'm so relieved. Me too...
                     I was thinking that the whole time.
          
                               SHEP
                     What kind of man is going to sit
                     around in his bathrobe picking his
                     nose while his wife works all day?
          
                                                                     41.
          
          
                              MILLY
                    I don't know, Shep.   I just don't
                    know.
          
          Milly is crying.
          
                              SHEP
                    What is it?
          
                               MILLY
                    Nothing.   I'm just so relieved.
          
          He sits down beside her.   She falls into his arms.
          
                              SHEP
                    Come on. Don't cry. Please. It's
                    all right. It's going to be all
                    right.
          
          A kid's shout from somewhere in the house.     Milly sits up.
          
                               SHEP (CONT'D)
                    I'll go.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT.
          
          Frank and April burst into the kitchen, laughing.
          
          
                               FRANK
                    Jesus, their faces! You'd think
                    we'd told them that we were
                    swimming up the Yangtzee river or
                    something.
          
          Laughing, April hands Frank a drink.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    You know what this is like, April?
                    Talking like this? The whole idea
                    of taking off to Europe this way?
                    It's like the way I felt going up
                    to the line the first time, in the
                    war. I was probably just as scared
                    as everyone else, but inside I
                    never felt better. I felt alive. I
                    felt full of blood.

                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    And everything looked more real.
                    The guys in their uniforms. The
                    snow on the fields, the trees. And
                    all of us just... walking. I mean
                    I was scared of course. But I kept
                    thinking: this is it. This is the
                    truth.
          
                              APRIL
                    I felt that way once too.
          
          He looks at her.   And there's something in her eyes.
          
                                 FRANK
                    When?
          
                              APRIL
                    The first time you made love to me.
          
          He walks over to her and kisses her passionately.
          
          And they make love that way, face to face, with the lights
          on, looking into each other's eyes, fully clothed, until he
          comes inside her.
          
          As he comes, she makes a sound, almost inaudible, but it
          sounds like...
          
                                 APRIL (CONT'D)
                    ...No
          
          He holds her, breathing heavily.    She strokes his head.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR - DAY.
          
          Frank walks across the 15th floor, the atmosphere unusually
          abuzz.
          
          He arrives in his cubicle. Jack, Ed and Vance are talking in
          hushed tones.
          
                                 FRANK
                    What's up?
          
                              ED
                    Bart Pollock is here.
          
                                                                    43.
          
          
                              VINCE
                    He's in Bandy's office.
          
                              FRANK
                        (unimpressed)
                    Yeah?
          
          A small signal light illuminates on Frank's desk.
          
                              ED
                    Looks like he wants to talk to you.
          
          Frank looks around. They're all looking at him.     He looks
          over in the direction of Bandy's office.
          
                               JACK
                    Hey.   Keep my name out of it.
          
          
          INT. KNOX 15TH FLOOR, BANDY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Bandy looks up from his desk.   An uncharacteristic smile.
          
                               BANDY
                        (warm)
                    Frank. How are you? You know Bart
                    Pollock?
          
                              FRANK
                    Well, we've never met, but -
          
          A massive MAN in tan gaberdine rises up from a chair.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Glad to know you Frank.
          
          He holds a file in his enormous hand.
          
                              BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
                    Speaking of production control?
          
          Frank looks away, ready for a dressing down.
          
                              BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
                    Frank... This is a crackerjack.
                    They're just tickled to death in
                    Toledo.
          
                                                                      44.
          
          
          He slaps the file on the desk.    Frank can't believe it.

          Close of a book: "Brighter French."
          
          Frank sits on the couch, flipping absently.

                    You wouldn't have believed this
                    guy.
          
          April enters carrying a plate of sandwiches.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    He's perfect Presidential material
                    in the worst sense. A million
                    dollar smile and about three pounds
                    of muscle between his ears.
                        (mimicking Pollock's
                         booming voice)
                    "Frank, this is a crackerjack."
          
          April looks around to be sure everything's in place.
          
                              APRIL
                    Wish I saw his face when you told
                    him you were leaving.
          
          Frank looks away.
          
                              FRANK
                    ...Horse's ass.
          
          TOOT of a car horn.   April goes to the window.
          
                              APRIL
                    I think this is them.
          
          
          INT./EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - DAY.
          
          Through the picture window, we see the Givings' car is parked
          in the driveway.
          
          Mrs. Givings gets out of the car holding a tinfoil covered
          baking pan. Mr. Givings opens the backseat.
          
                                                                    45.
          
          
          Out steps JOHN, 30's, an institutional haircut and ill-
          fitting suit. He looks around the sunny neighborhood.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - DAY.
          
          The kitchen is suddenly crowded with the Givings, Frank and
          April.
          
          Overlapping:
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Sorry to be late.
          
                              APRIL
                    You're not late.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    The traffic was terrible.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Good to see you.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Wasn't it terrible, Howard?
          
                                MR. GIVINGS
                    Route 12.
          
          Hands are shook, the baking dish exchanged.
          
                              APRIL
                    You didn't have to do that.
          
                              FRANK
                    The time they finish that stretch
                    of road, they'll have to start all
                    over again.
          
          John stands by himself closest to the door.
          
                              APRIL
                    And you must be John?
          
          Silence settles over the room.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Say hello, John.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
                              JOHN
                    Nice to meetcha.   Heard a lot
                    aboutcha.
          
          John smiles, exposing a mouthful of deeply-stained yellow
          teeth and high, eroded gums.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY.
          
          Mrs. Givings leads the group into the living room.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Where are your darling children?
          
                              APRIL
                    They're at a birthday party.     Sorry
                    they couldn't be here.
          
          John walks around the room, stiff-legged, examining the book
          shelves, the paintings.
          
                              JOHN
                    Don't worry. If I had a certified
                    lunatic coming around the house,
                    I'd probably get the kids out of
                    the way too.
          
          April and Frank exchange a quick glance.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, look at all this food! You
                    didn't have to go to any trouble
                    for us.
          
                              APRIL
                    It's just some sandwiches.
          
          April lifts the plate and offers it to John.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    John, would you like a sandwich?
          
          He avoids her look, but he takes four.
          
                              JOHN
                    Helen's been talking it up about
                    you people for months.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                             47.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    The nice young Wheelers on
                    Revolutionary Road, the nice young
                    Revolutionaries on Wheeler road.
          
          Polite laughter.
          
                              FRANK
                    Who'd like some sherry?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Please, don't bother Frank.
          
                              JOHN
                    I'd like some sherry. And I'll
                    drink Helen's if she doesn't beat
                    me to it.
          
          April can't suppress a smile.
          
                               JOHN (CONT'D)
                        (suddenly serious)
                    But, hey... Listen, though. You
                    got a high-ball glass...? Put a
                    couple-three ice cubes in it, pour
                    it up to the brim. That's the way
                    I like it.
          
                              FRANK
                    I think I can do that.
          
          Mr. Givings eats his sandwich, watching his son.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, this is the most wonderful egg
                    salad, April. You must tell me how
                    you fix it.
          
          Frank hands John his high-ball glass.
          
                              JOHN
                    You a lawyer Frank?
          
                              FRANK
                    No, I'm not.
          
                              JOHN
                    I could use a lawyer.
          
                                                             48.
          
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    John, let's not get started again
                    about the lawyer.
          
                              JOHN
                    Pop, couldn't you just sit there
                    and eat your wonderful egg salad,
                    and quit horning in?
          
          Mr. Givings gives his son a level, warning look.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    See, I've got a good many questions
                    to ask and I'm willing to pay for
                    the answers... Now, I don't need
                    to be told that a man who goes
                    after his mother with a coffee
                    table is putting himself in a weak
                    position legally; that's obvious.
          
          Frank and April exchange a look.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    John, come and have a look out this
                    fabulous picture window.
          
          Mrs. Givings gets up and goes to the window.
          
                              JOHN
                    If he hits her with it and kills
                    her, that's a criminal case.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, look, the sun's coming out!
          
                              JOHN
                    If all he does is break the coffee
                    table and give her a certain amount
                    of aggravation and she decides to
                    go to court over it, that's a civil
                    case.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Maybe we'll see a rainbow!   John,
                    come have a look.
          
                                                                     49.
          
          
                              JOHN
                    Ma, how about doing everybody a
                    favor? How about shutting up!
          
          April's face.   She's not smiling now.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Steady down, now.
          
          With her back to the room, Mrs. Givings closes her eyes.
          
                              FRANK
                    I can look into it.   Maybe
                    recommend someone.
          
          John stares at Frank for any sign of condescension.
          
                              JOHN
                    So, what do you do, Frank?
          
                              FRANK
                    I work for Knox Business Machines.
          
                              JOHN
                    You design the machines?
          
                               FRANK
                    Nope.
          
                              JOHN
                    Make `em, sell `em, repair `em?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    All these questions.
          
                              FRANK
                    I sort of help sell them, I guess.
                    I work in the office. Actually,
                    it's sort of a stupid job. I mean
                    there's nothing ­ you know,
                    interesting about it or anything.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, Frank...
          
                              JOHN
                    Whaddya do it for then?
          
                                                                   50.
          
          

                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Maybe Frank doesn't want to be
                    questioned like this, son.
          
                              JOHN
                    Okay, okay, okay ­ I know it's none
                    of my business. And besides, I
                    know the answer. You want to play
                    house, you got to have a job. You
                    want to play very nice house, very
                    sweet house, then you got to have a
                    job you don't like. Anyone comes
                    along and asks "Whaddya do it for?'
                    he's probably on a four-hour pass
                    from the State funny farm. All
                    agreed...? Ma?
          
          Frank laughs.
          
          John smiles his yellow grin.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Sorry, Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    Don't be. I agree with everything
                    you said, John. We both do.
                    That's why I'm quitting the job in
                    the fall and we're taking off.
          
                              APRIL
                    We're moving to Paris.
          
          John looks over at his mother.
          
                              JOHN
                    Did you know about this, Ma...?
                    Wow. How do you feel about that,
                    Ma? The nice young Wheelers are
                    taking off!
          
          John bursts into a painful braying laugh.   It goes on and on.
          
          Mrs. Givings brings a hand to her brow - she's on the verge
          of tears.
          
                                                                      51.
          
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    ...John, please.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Steady down, son.
          
          April looks at Frank - the whole thing is in danger of going
          off the rails.
          
                              FRANK
                    How about some fresh air, John?
          
          John stops laughing abruptly.    He looks to his parents.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    If that's all right with you?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    I don't know if it's a good idea.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    ...If John wants to, I don't see
                    the harm.
          
          
          EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY.
          
          Frank, April and John walk through the woods.
          
          The ground is freshly rained on and damp.    The sun is bright.
          
          John buttons up his top button and pulls his sleeves down
          over his hands.
          
                              APRIL
                    I hear you're a mathematician.
          
                              JOHN
                    You hear wrong.     It's all gone now.
          
                                APRIL
                    All gone?
          
                              JOHN
                    You know what electrical shock
                    treatments are?
          
                                                                       52.
          
          
                               APRIL
                    Yes.   Yes I do.
          
                              JOHN
                    I've had thirty-seven.
          
          He pushes his hat back and turns his head at April.
          
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                    See?
          
          There are scars on his forehead.       April can see them.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Supposed to jolt out the `Emotional
                    Problems.' Just jolted out the
                    mathematics.

          
                                 APRIL
                    How awful.
          
                              JOHN
                        (mimicking)
                    `How awful...' Why, because
                    mathematics is so `interesting?'
          
                              APRIL
                    No. Because the shocks must be
                    awful and... well, because it's
                    awful not to be able to do what it
                    is you want to do. I think
                    mathematics are dull.
          
          John stares at April.    He smiles.
          
                              JOHN
                    I like your girl, Frank.
          
                                 FRANK
                    Me too.
          
                              JOHN
                    So, what do a couple of people like
                    you have to run away from?
          
                              FRANK
                    We're not running.
          
                                                                    53.
          
          
          John comes to a stop.
          
                              JOHN
                    And what's in Paris?
          
                              APRIL
                    A different way of life.
          
                              FRANK
                    So maybe we are running... We're
                    running from the hopeless emptiness
                    of the whole life here.
          
                              JOHN
                    The hopeless emptiness? Now,
                    you've said it. Plenty of people
                    are on to the emptiness, but it
                    takes real guts to see the
                    hopelessness... Wow.
          
          John continues walking.   Frank and April watch him go.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DUSK.
          
          Frank and April at the kitchen table.
          
                              APRIL
                    You know, he's the first person who
                    seemed to know what we were talking
                    about.
          
                              FRANK
                    That's true. Maybe we are just as
                    crazy as he is.
          
                               APRIL
                    If being crazy means living life as
                    if it matters then I don't care if
                    we are completely insane.
                        (beat)
                    Do you?
          
                              FRANK
                    No.
          
                              APRIL
                    I love you so much.
          
                                                                    54.

          The small, attractive house bathed in sunlight.
          
          
          INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON.
          
          Frank follows Bart Pollock as he cuts a swathe through an
          impressive midtown eatery. A small MAITRE D' scuttles in
          front of them. Bart nods, points at well-wishers, and makes
          a politician's show of knowing the staff.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Tell you something, Frank. I'm a
                    little sore at Bandy for the way
                    he's kept you under a bushel all
                    these years. This place okay, for
                    you?
          
          Frank smirks at the performance.
          
                              FRANK
                    This is just fine, sir.   Fine.
          
          
          INT. MIDTOWN HOTEL RESTAURANT - LATER.
          
          Bart Pollock sits across an expanse of white tablecloth
          gripping a martini glass in one of his enormous paws.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    One thing interests me, Frank, and
                    one thing only: selling the
                    electronic computer to the American
                    businessman...
          
                              BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
                    That's why I'm assembling a team.
                    Men like you, not your average
                    salesmen... It'll mean more money,
                    and I got to be honest, maybe more
                    of a time commitment. But you'll
                    be part of something exciting,
                    Wheeler... Computers.
          
                              FRANK
                    Well, sir, it sounds exciting.
          
                                                                    55.
          
          
                               BART POLLOCK
                    Bart!
          
                               FRANK
                    Bart...
          
          Frank looks down at his plate.   He can't help himself.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Do you happen to remember an Earl
                    Wheeler?
          
          Bart looks at him blankly.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Out of Yonkers?
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Can't say that I do. Relation of
                    yours?
          
                              FRANK
                    My father. He worked at Knox
                    almost twenty years.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                        (thinking)
                    Earl Wheeler... Earl Wheeler...
          
                              FRANK
                    No reason you would have heard of
                    him.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Well, I'm sure he was a good man.
          
          Frank smiles.   Looks down.
          
                              FRANK
                    There's something I should have
                    mentioned earlier... I'm leaving
                    the firm. In the fall.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Another outfit?
          
                              FRANK
                    No, it's not another outfit --
          
                                                          56.
          
          
          Bart holds up his hands.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    Now look, Frank. Is it a question
                    of money? Because if it is,
                    there's no reason we can't get
                    together on a satisfactory ­
          
                              FRANK
                    I appreciate that, but it's not
                    money. It's more of a personal
                    thing.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    A personal thing? I see.
                        (looks down, clearly
                         disapproving)
                    Frank... Let me tell you something
                    my father told me... A man only
                    gets a couple chances in life. If
                    he doesn't grab `em by the balls,
                    it won't be long before he finds
                    himself sitting around wondering
                    how he got to be second rate.
          
          Frank's face.
          
                              FRANK
                    I guess so.
          
          Bart lets it hang.
          
                              BART POLLOCK
                    So, do me a favor... Sleep on it.
                    Discuss it with your wife. Because
                    let's face it: where the hell would
                    any of us be without our wives,
                    anyway?
          
          On Frank's face.
          
                              BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
                    And Frank, in all sincerity, if you
                    do decide to join us, I believe
                    it'll be a thing you'll never
                    regret.

                              BART POLLOCK (CONT'D)
                    And I believe something else, too.
                    I believe it'd be a fine memorial
                    to your Dad.
          
          Frank finds himself surprised by his welling up of emotion.
          
          
          INT. KNOX BUILDING - EVENING.
          
          It's late. Frank is sitting in his cubicle over his
          Dictaphone. Jack is long gone.
          
                              FRANK
                    Knowing what you've got, comma,
                    knowing what you need, comma,
                    Knowing what you can do without,
                    dash. That's inventory control.
          
          He stubs out a cigarette in an overflowing ashtray.
          
          Close on his face.
          
          Maureen stops by Frank's cubicle.   She pretends to be
          surprised to see him.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    Oh, hi Frank. Working late?
          
                              FRANK
                    I got to dig myself out here.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    I heard you were getting promoted.
          
          Frank shrugs, no big deal.
          
                              MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                    Big shot. I guess your Dad would
                    have been real proud, huh?
          
                              FRANK
                        (surprised she remembered)
                    Huh. Yeah, I guess so...
          
                              MAUREEN
                        (smiles sweetly)
                    So...

                               MAUREEN (CONT'D)
                    maybe I should buy you a drink or
                    something? You know...?
                    Celebrate.
          
          Frank's face.   We don't know which way he'll go.   He smiles.
          
                               FRANK
                    Yeah.   Maybe.
          
          She smiles.   She can't quite believe it.
          
                              MAUREEN
                    I'll just get my coat.
          
          Frank sits there a moment longer, thinking.    Then he follows.

          the TV.
          
          April works a sewing machine with a cigarette burning beside
          her. Jennifer stands beside her holding a stuffed Giraffe
          and a list, which she reads.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I'm going to take my doll carriage
                    and my bear and my three Easter
                    rabbits and my giraffe and all my
                    dolls and my doll house.
          
                              APRIL
                    I thought maybe we'd give the doll
                    house to Madeline.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    No! I don't want to give it to
                    Madeline.
          
          April has to stop to re-thread and she's losing patience.
          
                                                                  59.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    I already explained to you, the big
                    things are going to be hard to
                    pack.
          
          Frank lowers the book.   He recognizes her tone.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    But Madeline can have my bear and
                    my Easter rabbits -
          
                              APRIL
                    No! Just the big things. Look.
                    Wouldn't you rather go outside and
                    play with Michael.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I don't feel like it.
          
                              APRIL
                    You've been inside all day.
          
                              JENNIFER
                    I don't feel like it!
          
                               APRIL
                    Well, I don't feel like explaining
                    everything fifteen times to
                    somebody who's too bored and silly
                    to listen!
          
          Jennifer turns and runs up the stairs, upset.
          
          April lets out a defeated sigh. She turns to the kitchen to
          see to the supper. Steam rises from the vegetables.
          
          Frank stands in the entrance silently watching for a moment.
          
                              FRANK
                    What's the matter?
          
                               APRIL
                    Nothing.
          
          She carries a pot of steaming, overcooked vegetables to the
          sink, slops them into a colander.
          
                                                                60.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    I don't believe you. Did something
                    happen today or what?
          
                              APRIL
                    Nothing happened today that I
                    haven't known about for days and
                    days.
          
                                 FRANK
                    What?
          
                              APRIL
                    Oh God, Frank, please don't look so
                    dense. Do you mean you haven't
                    guessed or anything?
          
                              FRANK
                    What are you talking about?
          
          She finally stops and looks at him.
          
                              APRIL
                    I'm pregnant, that's all.
          
          Beat as he absorbs it.    He's totally blind-sided.
          
                               FRANK
                    What...?   Jesus.
          
          She comes over to him.
          
                              APRIL
                    Oh, Frank, I meant to wait until
                    dinner to tell you, but I just -
                    well, I've been pretty sure all
                    week and today I went to the Doctor
                    and now I can't even pretend it's
                    not true.
          
                              FRANK
                        (still stunned)
                    Jesus... How long?
          
                                 APRIL
                    Ten weeks.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    You didn't say anything.
          
                               APRIL
                    I thought... Oh, I don't know what
                    I thought.
          
          He stares, still unsure how he feels.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry, Frank. I'm so sorry.
          
                              FRANK
                    I know you are.
          
          She looks at him, with slight desperation.
          
                              APRIL
                    We don't have to let this stop us.
                    There are things we can do.
                    Remember that girl at school I told
                    you about...? As long as you do it
                    before 12 weeks, it's fine.
          
          He just looks at her and his silence makes her desperate.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    We've got to be together in this,
                    Frank. Otherwise nothing's going
                    to make any sense.
          
                               FRANK
                    Okay.   We'll figure it out.
          
          He takes her in his arms.
          
                                FRANK (CONT'D)
                    12 weeks.    So we have time.
          
          On Frank's face... Slowly, he smiles.
          
                              APRIL
                    I love you Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    ...I love you too.
          
                                                                    62.
          
          
          EXT. LONG ISLAND SOUND BEACH - AFTERNOON.
          
          A baking hot day. The sky is electric blue. Radios PLAY,
          children CRY, dogs BARK. Sunbathers cover almost every inch
          of sand.
          
          We find Shep, Milly, Frank and April with beach chairs,
          coolers and umbrellas.
          
          A child wrapped in a towel sleeps on Milly's lap.
          
          April wears a pair of dark glasses, behind which she is
          thinking, thinking.
          
                              SHEP
                    So, Frank, how's work?   They gonna
                    survive without you?
          
                              FRANK
                    Actually... Something kinda funny
                    happened the other day. I did some
                    dumb little piece of work to get
                    myself off the hook with Bandy, and
                    suddenly I'm The Bright Young Man.
          
                              SHEP
                        (laughs)
                    That's always the way, isn't it?
          
                              FRANK
                    It's incredible. I knocked this
                    thing off in a couple of minutes
                    and now they want me to join their
                    team of `specialist' salesmen.
          
                              SHEP
                    Morons.
          
                              FRANK
                    It'd be funny, if they weren't
                    talking about so much damn money.
          
          April turns and looks at Frank. Long and hard.   If he can
          feel her look, he doesn't show it.
          
                                                                    63.
          
          
                              SHEP
                        (stealing a glance at
                         April)
                    So, you tempted?
          
                               FRANK
                        (shrugs)
                    Well, it's kind of ironic, don't
                    you think?
          
          April suddenly stands up.    Frank and Shep watch her walk down
          to the water's edge.
          
                                SHEP
                    She okay?
          
          Frank stares after her.
          
          
          EXT. LONG ISLAND SOUND BEACH, WATER'S EDGE - AFTERNOON.
          
          April stands in the water staring out over the sea. The
          waves break against her ankles. Whether it occurs to her or
          not, she's staring in the direction of Europe.
          
          Frank comes up beside her.
          
                              APRIL
                    I thought you turned the job down?
          
                              FRANK
                        (shrugs)
                    Not yet... It's just an option,
                    that's all. With the money they're
                    talking, things could be different
                    for us here. We could get a better
                    place. Travel.
          
          April shakes her head and drags on her cigarette.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Look, the point is - we could be
                    happy here. At least for a while.
          
          She stares out at the sea.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    It is possible that Parisians
                    aren't the only ones who know how
                    to lead interesting lives, April.
          
          She turns to him.
          
                              APRIL
                    So you've made up your mind?
          
                               FRANK
                    No.   Like I said, it's an option.
          
                              APRIL
                    ...And supposing you're right. You
                    make all this money and we have
                    this interesting life here. Won't
                    you still be wasting your life
                    toiling away at a job you find
                    ridiculous? Just like your father.
          
                              FRANK
                        (sharp)
                    Maybe we let that be my business.
          
                              APRIL
                        (incredulous)
                    Your business?
          
                              FRANK
                        (exhales)
                    It's too hot for this.    I'm going
                    to get wet.
          
          She just looks at him. He walks into the ocean.   She stands
          on the shore, watching him swim away from her.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          April paces the family room. Her hair is a defiant mess.
          She still wears her bathing suit under her clothes.
          
          Frank sits on the couch.
          
          The windows are open, and most of the lights are off. It's a
          very hot night.
          
                                                                  65.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    You don't want to go, do you?
          
                              FRANK
                    Come on, April.   Of course I do.
          
                              APRIL
                    You don't! Because you've never
                    tried at anything. And if you
                    don't try at anything you can't
                    fail.
          
                              FRANK
                    What the hell do you    mean I don't
                    try? I support you,     don't I? I
                    pay for this house.     I work ten
                    hours a day at a job    I can't stand.
          
                              APRIL
                    You don't have to!
          
                              FRANK
                    Bullshit! I'm not happy about it.
                    But I have the backbone not to run
                    away from my responsibilities!
          
                              APRIL
                    It takes backbone to lead the life
                    you want, Frank.
          
          He shakes his head and gets up.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Where are you going?
          
                              FRANK
                    Is it alright with you if I go to
                    the bathroom?
          
          She disgustedly twists out her cigarette, and immediately
          lights another.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Frank splashes water on his face like a boxer between rounds.
          He looks up at his reflection.
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
          He reaches for a towel, but there isn't one. He turns to the
          shelf behind him and pulls down a fresh towel. Something
          catches his eye.
          
          He reaches to the back and retrieves a small brown paper
          package.
          
          He opens it, his face slowly registering what it means...
          
          
          INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          April wheels around as -
          
          Frank storms in, a rubber syringe in his hand.
          
                               FRANK
                    What the hell are you going to do
                    with this?
          
                              APRIL
                    And what do you think you're going
                    to do? You're going to stop me?
          
                              FRANK
                    You're damn right!
          
                              APRIL
                    Go ahead and try!
          
          He comes at her across the room with the syringe in his hand.
          She moves away.
          
                              FRANK
                    Listen. Listen to me. You do this
                    - you do this and I swear to God
                    I'll -
          
                              APRIL
                    You'll what? You'll leave me?   Is
                    that a threat, or a promise?
          
          He shakes it in her face.
          
                              FRANK
                    When did you buy this, April?   I
                    want to know!
          
                                                          67.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    You know you really are being
                    melodramatic about the whole thing.
                    As long as it's done in the first
                    twelve weeks, it's perfectly safe.
          
                              FRANK
                    That's now April!   Don't I get a
                    say?
          
                              APRIL
                    Of course you do! It would be for
                    you, Frank, don't you see? So you
                    can have time. Like we talked
                    about.
          
                              FRANK
                    How can it be for me if the thought
                    makes my stomach turn over?
          
                              APRIL
                    Then it's for me... Tell me we can
                    have the baby in Paris, Frank. But
                    don't make me stay here. Please.
          
                              FRANK
                    We can't have the baby in Paris.
          
                              APRIL
                    Why not? I don't need everything
                    we have here. I don't care where
                    we live! I mean who made these
                    rules, anyway? The only reason we
                    moved out here was because I got
                    pregnant. Then we had another
                    child to prove the first one wasn't
                    a mistake. I mean how long does it
                    go on?
          
          He turns away.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Frank. Do you actually want
                    another child? Well, do you?
          
          He won't answer.
          
                                                            68.
          
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Come on, tell me. Tell me the
                    truth, Frank. Remember that? We
                    used to live by it. You know what's
                    so good about the truth? Everyone
                    knows what it is, however long
                    they've lived without it. No one
                    forgets the truth, Frank, they just
                    get better at lying. So tell me: do
                    you really want another child?
          
          Frank turns towards her.
          
                              FRANK
                    All I know is what I feel. And
                    anyone else in their right mind
                    would feel the same way.
          
                              APRIL
                        (quiet)
                    But I've had two children.    Doesn't
                    that count in my favor?
          
                              FRANK
                    Christ! The fact that you even put
                    it that way! You make it sound
                    like having children is a
                    punishment.
          
                              APRIL
                    I love my children.
          
                              FRANK
                    And you're sure about that?
          
                              APRIL
                    What the hell is that supposed to
                    mean?
          
                              FRANK
                    April, you just said our daughter
                    was mistake. How do I know you
                    didn't try to get rid of her, or
                    Michael for that matter? How do I
                    know you didn't try to flush our
                    entire fucking family down the
                    toilet?
          
                                                                69.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    No that's not true. Of course I
                    didn't.
          
                              FRANK
                    But how do I know April?
          
                               APRIL
                    Stop.   Please just stop, Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    April, a normal woman, a normal
                    sane mother doesn't buy herself a
                    piece of rubber tubing to give
                    herself an abortion so she can, go
                    live out some God damn fantasy.
          
          April's face.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                        (sober)
                    All I'm saying is you don't seem
                    entirely rational about this
                    thing... And maybe we should get
                    someone to help you think about it.
          
                              APRIL
                    ...And the new job's going to pay
                    for that too?
          
                              FRANK
                    April if you need a shrink, it'll
                    be paid for. Obviously.
          
          April turns to the book shelves.   Her back to him.
          
          Frank waits, his heart beating quickly.
          
                              APRIL
                    ...Okay. I guess there isn't much
                    more to say, then, is there?
          
          Her eyes are bright with tears.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    So I guess Paris was a pretty
                    childish idea, huh?
          
                                                                   70.
          
          
          Everything hangs on Frank's answer...
          
                              FRANK
                    I guess maybe it was.
          
          April closes her eyes. Tears run down her cheeks.   He walks
          over to her, but he doesn't touch her.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    We can be happy here April...   I
                    can make you happy here.
          
          She cries quietly.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    We've had a great few months.   It
                    doesn't have to end...
          
          She turns to face him.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    We're going to be okay.
          
                              APRIL
                    I hope so Frank.   I really hope so.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - MORNING.
          
          Frank stands at the picture window watching...
          
          April approach the children. She squats on the ground so she
          can be at their height and talks to them. Michael tries to
          get into her arms. Jennifer turns away and walks sulkily
          across the grass.
          
          Frank looks into his coffee cup.   He doesn't look like a man
          who won an argument.
          
          
          INT. KNOX WAITING ROOM - DAY.
          
          Frank sits smoking nervously in an oak-paneled waiting room.
          The door opens behind him. He gets to his feet.
          
                              RECEPTIONIST
                    Thank you for waiting.   Mr. Pollock
                    can see you now.
          
                                                                    71.
          
          
          He follows her through the door.    The door closes behind her.
          
          We see the scene in dumb-show through the glass door. Bart
          looks up as Frank enters. An "I knew it all along" smile
          spreads across Pollock's face. He offers his hand to Frank.
          Frank smiles thinly. They shake.
          
                              JACK (O.S)
                    Foiled by faulty contraception.
          
          
          INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT - DAY.
          
          Frank, Ed, Vince and Jack sit in the same booth in the same
          crowded luncheonette.
          
          Frank stares out the window.   The others can't contain
          themselves.
          
                              ED
                    I can't say I'm sorry.
          
                              VINCE
                    Wouldn't have been the same without
                    you.
          
                              JACK
                    You'd have been sorely missed in
                    the old cubicle, I can tell you
                    that.
          
          He raises his glass, drinks alone.
          
                              JACK (CONT'D)
                    Besides which...
          
          Frank looks away from the window.
          
                              FRANK
                    What?
          
                              JACK
                    ...Well, the plan always seemed a
                    touch unrealistic, don't you think?
          
          Frank glares with barely contained fury.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
                              JACK (CONT'D)
                    I suppose, it's none of my
                    business, really.
          
                               FRANK
                    No.   I suppose it isn't.
          
          A beat.
          
                              JACK
                    Well, we won't be the only ones
                    glad to hear the news. They'll be
                    celebrating in the secretarial
                    pool.
          
          Ed and Vince chuckle.   Frank's face.
          
          
          INT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT.
          
          Two drumsticks spinning in a spotlight.   They click out a
          rhythm, and crash into a number.
          
          Cut back to reveal a small, low-ceilinged joint. On-stage
          are the Steve Kovack quartet, four perspiring middle-aged men
          with day jobs.
          
          YOUNGISH COUPLES, and the odd middle-aged COUPLE navigate the
          dance floor.
          
          A smattering of lost SINGLES line the bar.
          
          The Wheelers and Campbells sit squashed into a booth on the
          side of the dance floor.
          
          Several empty glasses have accumulated. Milly is beating the
          edge of the table with red drink straws. She's a few drinks
          ahead.
          
          They have to SHOUT over the MUSIC.
          
                              MILLY
                    Hey! Remember the first time you
                    brought us here? You said, it
                    takes a special kind of taste to
                    enjoy Vito's Log Cabin!
          
                                                                     73.
          
          
                              SHEP
                    It's so awful it's kinda nice!
          
                              MILLY
                    That's right!
          
          They laugh at the old joke.   Then Milly begins to weep.
          
                              MILLY (CONT'D)
                        (dabs at her eyes)
                    Look at me...! I'm just so happy.
                    Our little gang's back together
                    again!
          
          She knocks her drink back.    The number finishes.
          
                              SHEP
                    At least Europe's not going
                    anywhere.
          
          April stares out at the dance floor.    Frank looks at her.   A
          new number starts.
          
                              FRANK
                    Wanna dance?
          
                              APRIL
                    I don't really feel like it.
          
                              MILLY
                    I'll dance!
          
          Milly takes him by the hand and pulls him away. Shep and
          April watch. Then Shep turns his attention to April.
          
                              MILLY (CONT'D)
                        (tipsy)
                    Guess April's pretty blue `bout
                    Paris, huh?
          
                              FRANK
                    Think she'll be okay?
          
                              MILLY
                    Oh, sure. Give us girls a couple
                    of days and we can get over
                    anything!
          
                                                                    74.
          
          
          Frank turns his attention to Milly. He's a good dancer. His
          movements are fast and aggressive, his mind on April.
          
          Milly is a little too drunk, and hurries to keep up,
          perspiring through her dress. He spins her around and
          around, back and forth into his arms. Milly begins to look
          slightly dizzy.
          
                                 MILLY (CONT'D)
                     ...Frank.
          
          He doesn't hear her over the music, or he doesn't care.
          
                               MILLY (CONT'D)
                     Frank... I...
          
                               FRANK
                         (sudden remorse)
                     You okay?
          
                               MILLY
                     Gee...I'm afraid I'm not very...
          
          Her body spasms with the need to be sick. She turns and
          rushes for the lady's room.
          
          
          EXT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT.
          
          Frank leads the way through the cars.
          
          Shep supports Milly who is now falling down drunk.
          
          April walks alone a few paces behind...
          
          They reach Shep's car, which is trapped behind several other
          cars.
          
                               SHEP
                     Of all the inconsiderate...
          
          A beat.   Frank looks to April.
          
                                                                     75.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    Look - why don't you take Milly
                    home, then go home yourself and
                    that would take care of both
                    sitters. Then Shep can take me
                    home later.
          
                              SHEP
                    All right with me.
          
                              FRANK
                        (to April)
                    You'll be alright?
          
                              APRIL
                    Sure.
          
          Frank holds April's look an instant, then walks away with car
          keys in hand.
          
          
          INT. VITO'S LOG CABIN - NIGHT.
          
          Steve Kovack performs an exhausting, sweat-drenched drum
          solo.
          
          April and Shep now sit alone in the booth.
          
                              SHEP
                    I'm sorry you're not going away
                    anymore. I know it was important to
                    you.
          
          April distantly nods her thanks.
          
                              SHEP (CONT'D)
                    Don't take this wrong; I've been
                    there and...they don't have so much
                    we don't have here.
          
                              APRIL
                    It didn't have to be Paris.
          
          Shep sips his beer, trying to figure out how to connect with
          her...
          
                              SHEP
                    You just wanted out, huh?
          
                                                              76.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    I wanted in. I just wanted us to
                    live again.
          
          Shep nods, not entirely sure what she means.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    For years I thought we shared a
                    secret...that we would be wonderful
                    in the world. I didn't exactly know
                    how, but just the
                    possibility...kept me hoping.
          
          She takes a long slug of her drink.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    How pathetic is that? To put all
                    your hopes in a promise that was
                    never made? See, Frank knows...he
                    knows what he wants. He's found his
                    place. He's just fine. Married, two
                    kids. It should be enough. It is
                    for him. He's right; we were never
                    special or destined or anything at
                    all.
          
                              SHEP
                    Sure you are. You're The Wheelers.
                    You're a terrific couple, everyone
                    says so.
          
          April doesn't hear, she's pursuing her thought...
          
                               APRIL
                    I saw a different life. I can't
                    stop seeing it.
                        (beat)
                    Can't leave, can't stay.
                        (beat)
                    No damn use to anyone.
          
          April turns and stares at him.
          
          The band strikes up a new number.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Come on, let's do it.
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          INT. VITO'S LOG CABIN, DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT.
          
          April and Shep dance.
          
          Shep can't dance well, but he's trying. April, on the other
          hand, is a wonderful dancer. She dances out as far as their
          joined hands allow and does a little twitching, hip-bobbing
          curtsies before twisting back, all seemingly effortless. It
          is joyous, released.
          
          
          INT. SHEP'S CAR - NIGHT.
          
          Shep slips behind the wheel and is immediately kissing her,
          groping.
          
                              SHEP
                    Let me take you somewhere.
          
                               APRIL
                    No. Please. Here.    Now.    In the
                    back seat.
          
          She climbs into the back seat. He pulls off his jacket and
          climbs in after her. He folds the jacket under her head for
          a pillow...
          
          She remains perfectly still, allowing him to kiss her, to
          search under her clothing, to kiss her skin and finally, to
          lift her skirt and pull her clothing aside and make love to
          her against the vinyl seat cover...
          
          As suddenly as it began, it's over. Shep collapses against
          her. April stares into the darkness.
          
                              SHEP (CONT'D)
                    April... This is what I've always
                    wanted... I love you.
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't say that.
          
                              SHEP
                    I mean it, I love you.
          
                              APRIL
                    Please, just be quiet for a minute,
                    then you can take me home.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
          They begin to quietly assemble themselves.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
          
          Frank stands at the mirror putting on a clean shirt.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN/DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON.
          
          April stands at the kitchen table chopping vegetables.    She
          wears an unflattering floral dress.
          
          Frank stands in the doorway watching.
          
                              FRANK
                    It's beautiful out.
          
                              APRIL
                    Yes; it's lovely.
          
          
          He glances at the calendar.
          
                              FRANK
                    You know what today is?
          
          She doesn't look at him.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    It's twelve weeks.
          
                              APRIL
                    That's right.
          
          He walks over to her.   He takes her in his arms.   She
          stiffens.
          
                              FRANK
                    Look, this has been kind of a crazy
                    summer. We've both been under a
                    strain. I mean I know you're
                    upset.
          
                              APRIL
                    You know I'm not sleeping with you
                    and you want to know why?
          
                                                                    79.
          
          
          She looks him straight in the eye.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Well, I'm sorry Frank, but I don't
                    really feel like talking about it.
          
          She pulls herself free of his grasp. He watches as she adds
          the vegetables in the pot on the stove.
          
                              FRANK
                    Okay. What do you feel like
                    talking about?
          
                              APRIL
                    Would it be all right if we didn't
                    talk about anything? Can't we just
                    take each day as it comes, and do
                    the best we can, and not feel we
                    have to talk about everything all
                    the time?
          
          He smiles patiently.
          
                               FRANK
                    I don't think I suggested we talk
                    about everything all the time. My
                    point was, we've both been under a
                    strain and we ought to be trying to
                    help each other as much as we can
                    right now.
          
          She's utterly uninterested and it's making him nervous.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I mean God knows my own behavior
                    has been pretty weird lately... I
                    mean, as it happens... there is
                    actually something I'd like to tell
                    you about...
          
          She continues folding the napkins.
          
                               FRANK (CONT'D)
                    I've been with a girl in the city a
                    few times.
          
          Finally, she stops moving.   She looks at him.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    A girl I hardly even know. It was
                    nothing to me, but she got a little
                    carried away. She's just a kid...
                    Anyway, it's over now. It's really
                    over. If I weren't sure of that I
                    guess I could never have told you
                    about it.
          
                              APRIL
                    Why did you?
          
                              FRANK
                        (relieved)
                    Baby, I don't know. I think it was
                    a simple case of wanting to be a
                    man again after all that abortion
                    business. Some kind of neurotic,
                    irrational need to prove something.
          
                              APRIL
                    No. I don't mean why did you have
                    the girl; I mean why did you tell
                    me about it?
          
          He is suddenly unsure.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    I mean what's the point? Is it
                    supposed to make me jealous, or
                    something? Is it supposed to make
                    me fall in love with you, or back
                    into bed with you, or what? I mean
                    what am I supposed to say?
          
          He tries that same patient smile, but it's not convincing.
          
                              FRANK
                    Why don't you say what you feel?
          
                              APRIL
                    I don't feel anything.
          
                              FRANK
                    In other words you don't care what
                    I do or who I fuck or anything?
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    No; I guess that's right; I don't.
          
          She is frighteningly calm.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Fuck who you like.
          
          His panic mounts.
          
                              FRANK
                    Don't you see...Don't you see, I
                    want you to care.
          
                              APRIL
                    Oh, I know you do. And I suppose I
                    would if I loved you. But you see
                    I don't think I do anymore. And I
                    only just figured that out. And
                    that's why I'd just as soon not do
                    any talking right now.
          
          She goes back into the kitchen. Frank follows her.
          
                              FRANK
                    Oh, now don't give me this shit!
                    You know God damn well you love me!
          
                              APRIL
                    You think so?!
          
                              FRANK
                    You know GOD DAMN WELL!
          
                               MRS. GIVINGS (O.S.)
                    Yoo-hoo!   Any one home?
          
          Frank and April stare at each other, breathless.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER DINING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON.
          
          Frank and the Givings' sit with cocktails. It's painfully
          awkward. Moving boxes are everywhere.
          
                              APRIL
                    I'm sorry dinner's late. Can I get
                    anyone a refill?
          
                                                                     82.
          
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, don't worry. It's nice just to
                    sit for a bit and socialize...You
                    really didn't need to go through
                    all the trouble of cooking. I can
                    see you have a lot to do with
                    packing and what not.
          
          Frank looks at April. She avoids his look.
          
                              FRANK
                    Actually, there's been a change of
                    plans.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh?
          
          John looks up.
          
          Frank looks at April.
          
                              FRANK
                    I thought maybe it was obvious...
                    April's pregnant.
          
          April manages a forced smile.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, April! I can't tell you how
                    pleased I am. Oh, but I expect
                    you'll be needing a bigger house,
                    now, won't you?
          
                              JOHN
                    Hold it a second, Ma.
          
          John gets to his feet.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    I don't get this.
          
          He fixes Frank with the stare of a prosecuting attorney.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    What's so obvious about it? I mean
                    okay, she's pregnant; so what?
                    Don't people have babies in Europe?
          
                                                                   83.
          
          
                               MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh John, really. I don't think we
                    need to --
          
          John holds up a hand.
          
                              JOHN
                    I'm asking the man a question. If
                    he doesn't want to give me the
                    answer, I'm assuming he'll have
                    sense enough to tell me so.
          
                              FRANK
                    Suppose we just say that people
                    anywhere aren't very well advised
                    to have babies unless they can
                    afford them.
          
                              JOHN
                        (nods slowly)
                    Okay. Okay; it's a question of
                    money. Money's always a good
                    reason...
          
          John paces the room, with his hands behind his back like a
          detective at a murder scene.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    But it's hardly ever the real
                    reason. What's the real reason?
                    Wife talk you out of it, or what?
          
          He turns the force of his smile on April.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Little woman decide she isn't quite
                    ready to quit playing house?
          
          She walks across the room and stabs out her cigarette.   Then
          immediately lights another.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Nah, nah, that's not it. I can
                    tell. She looks too tough. Tough
                    and female and adequate as hell.
          
          He swings around to face Frank.
          
                                                                    84.
          
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Okay, then; it must've been you.
          
          Frank stares back defiantly.   Rage bubbling.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    What happened?
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    John, please, you're being very --
          
          John holds up his hand.
          
                              JOHN
                    What happened, Frank? You get cold
                    feet, or what? You decide you're
                    better off here after all? You
                    figure it's more comfy here in the
                    old Hopeless Emptiness after all,
                    or --
          
          Frank's face.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Wow, that did it! Look at his
                    face! What's the matter, Wheeler?
                    Am I getting warm?
          
          Frank stares at John, his rage increasing.   Mr. Givings gets
          to his feet.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    All right, son. I think we'd
                    better be --
          
                              JOHN
                    Boy!
          
          He lets out his braying laugh.   April starts to laugh.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Boy! You know something? I
                    wouldn't be surprised if you
                    knocked her up on purpose just so
                    you could spend the rest of your
                    life hiding behind that maternity
                    dress. That way you never have to
                    find out what he's made of.
          
                                                                  85.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Now look, I think that's just about
                    enough out of you. I mean, who the
                    hell do you think you are? You
                    come in here and say whatever crazy
                    God damn thing comes into your head
                    and I think it's about time someone
                    told you to keep your God damn -
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    He's not well, Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    Not well, my ass! I don't give a
                    damn if he's sick or well or dead
                    or alive, he should keep his
                    fucking opinions in the fucking
                    insane asylum where they belong!
          
          April stares at Frank.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Let's go, son.
          
          Mr. Givings moves John towards the door. Mrs. Givings slowly
          stands. April is the only one left seated.
          
                              JOHN
                    Big man you got there, April.
          
          He winks at April and puts his hat on.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Big family man, solid citizen. I
                    feel sorry for you. Still, maybe
                    you deserve each other.
          
          April's face.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Matter of fact, the way you look
                    right now, I'm beginning to feel
                    sorry for him, too. I mean, you
                    must give him a pretty bad time, if
                    making babies is the only way he
                    can prove he's got a pair of balls.
          
                                                                  86.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    You... fucking..!
          
          Frank lunges at John. Mr. Givings tries to hold Frank back.
          Mrs. Givings leaps between them. She's crying.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    He's not well, Frank!
          
          Silence.   Mr. Givings slowly releases Frank.   He is
          breathing heavily.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    All right, John. Let's get on out
                    to the car now.
          
          He guides him from the room.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    I'm sorry April, I'm so sorry...
          
                              JOHN
                    Right... Sorry, sorry, sorry!
                    Okay Ma? Have I said `Sorry'
                    enough times? I am sorry, too.
                    Damn; I bet I'm just about the
                    sorriest bastard I know. Course,
                    get right down to it, I don't have
                    a whole hell of a lot to be glad
                    about, do I?
          
          He takes another step towards the door, then stops and turns
          back, laughing again.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    Hey, but I'm glad about one thing,
                    though.
          
          He points a yellow-stained finger at April's stomach.
          
                              JOHN (CONT'D)
                    You know what I'm glad about? I'm
                    glad I'm not gonna be that kid.
          
          They go out.
          
          Frank goes to the liquor cabinet, pours a whiskey and drinks
          it.
          
                                                             87.
          
          
          April watches him from across the room.
          
                              FRANK
                    Okay, okay, don't tell me. Don't
                    tell me; let me guess. I made a
                    Disgusting Spectacle of Myself.
                    Right?
          
                                APRIL
                    Right.
          
          He turns to April.
          
                              FRANK
                    And everything that man said is
                    True. Right? Isn't that what
                    you're going to say?
          
                              APRIL
                    Apparently I don't have to.     You're
                    saying it for me.
          
          He comes towards her.
          
                              FRANK
                    But you're wrong.
          
                              APRIL
                    Why am I wrong?
          
                              FRANK
                    Because the man is insane. He's
                    fucking insane! Do you know what
                    the definition of insanity is?
          
                              APRIL
                    What is it, Frank?
          
                              FRANK
                    The inability to relate to another
                    human being. It's the inability to
                    love.
          
          She looks at him.    Then she begins to laugh.
          
                              APRIL
                    The in -- the in; the inabil; the
                    inability to --
          
                                                                     88.
          
          
          She reels around the room, her laughter increasingly out of
          control.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Oh. -- Oh, Frank, you really are a
                    wonderful talker! If black could
                    be made into white by talking,
                    you'd be the man for the job. So
                    now I'm crazy because I don't love
                    you -- right? Is that the point?
          
                              FRANK
                    No. Wrong. You're not crazy and
                    you do love me; that's the point.
          
          He takes a step towards her.
          
          All the laughter goes out of her face.   She backs away.
          
                              APRIL
                    But I don't. In fact I loathe the
                    sight of you. You're just a boy who
                    made me laugh at a party once and
                    if you come any closer, if you
                    touch me or anything I think I'll
                    scream.
          
          He takes her by the arms.
          
                              FRANK
                    Oh baby listen --
          
          She SCREAMS. High and shrill.    Her eyes wide open, cold and
          perfectly calm.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Fuck you, April. And fuck all your
                    hateful, snotty little -
          
          She slips past him.
          
          He goes after her.
          
          She pulls a chair into his path.
          
          He SLINGS it against the wall.
          
                                                                 89.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    What're you going to do now? Are
                    you going to hit me? To show how
                    much you love me?
          
                              FRANK
                    Oh, no, don't worry, I can't be
                    bothered! You're not worth the
                    trouble it'd take to hit you.
                    You're not worth the powder it'd
                    take to blow you up. You're an
                    empty --
          
          He begins to shake with anger.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    You're an empty, hollow fucking
                    shell of a woman. What the hell
                    are you living in my house for if
                    you hate me so much? Huh? Will
                    you answer me that? Why the hell
                    do you fuck me? What the hell are
                    you carrying my child for?
          
          He points at her belly.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    Why the hell didn't you just get
                    rid of it, when you had the chance?
                    Because listen. Listen: I got news
                    for you. I wish to God you had.
          
          He strides out of the room.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - EVENING.
          
          Frank enters the bedroom and slams the door.
          
          He paces, slowly calming.
          
          He sits on the bed with his head in his hands... His mind
          racing. Then he's on his feet again. He rushes for the
          door.
          
                                                                   90.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - EVENING.
          
          Frank enters, running, but the kitchen is empty.   Frank runs
          out of the room into living room.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - EVENING
          
          The living room is empty.   He goes straight for the front
          door.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER HOUSE - EVENING.
          
          Frank bursts out the front and comes to a stop.
          
          She's across the street - climbing unsteadily into the
          woods...
          
          Frank breaks into a sprint.
          
          
          EXT. WOODS - EVENING.
          
          April walks through the woods.
          
          Frank runs up behind her, scrambling through the muddy
          bracken.
          
          April wheels around.
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't come any closer.
          
                              FRANK
                    April, listen, I --
          
                              APRIL
                    Don't come any closer. Can't I
                    even get away from you in the
                    fucking woods?
          
          He stops moving.
          
                              FRANK
                    April, listen, I didn't mean that.
                    Honestly; I didn't mean what I
                    said.
          
                                                                     91.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    Are you still talking? Isn't there
                    any way to stop your talking? I
                    NEED to think. Can't you see that?
          
          She backs up against a tree trunk, looking down at him.
          
                              FRANK
                    Please come back.     What're you
                    doing out here?
          
                              APRIL
                    Do you want me to scream again,
                    Frank? Because I will, if you say
                    another word! I mean it!
          
          Frank has no choice - they're outside. The neighbors would
          hear and call the police. He reluctantly backs away, then
          turns back the way he came, glancing over his shoulder as he
          goes.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT.
          
          Frank stands at the window watching the section of woods
          where he left April.
          
          Then, he sees her come back across the street. She walks
          around the side of the house. He turns and runs into the
          kitchen.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - NIGHT.
          
          Frank goes to the window. He watches April walk up into the
          yard and stop against a tree.
          
          Frank pours a drink and takes the bottle with him to the
          window. He looks out, drinking.
          
          In the darkness, he can make out the glow of April's
          cigarette deep in the woods.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT, LATER.
          
          Frank falls back on the bed.
          
                                                                      92.
          
          
          He's now very drunk.
          
          His eyes close as he slips into unconsciousness.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING.
          
          Frank wakes alone.     He looks around the room.   His head is
          throbbing.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
          
          Frank stands in the doorway dressed for work.      He stares...
          
          The kitchen has been tidied and is bathed in sunlight.     The
          table has been carefully set for two.
          
          April stands at the stove wearing a fresh maternity dress.
          She seems serene.
          
          April turns and looks at him.
          
                              APRIL
                    Good morning.
          
                              FRANK
                    Good morning.
          
          He stands there frozen.
          
                              APRIL
                    Would you like scrambled eggs or
                    fried?
          
                              FRANK
                    Oh. It doesn't really matter -
                    Uh... scrambled, I guess, if it's
                    easy.
          
                               APRIL
                    Fine.   I'll have scrambled too.
          
          Frank sits at the table.
          
                                                                   93.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING, MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Frank and April sit across the kitchen table, eating.   For
          several moments, only the sound of their cutlery.
          
                                 FRANK
                       It's kinda nice having breakfast
                       without the kids for a change.
          
          April reaches out to pour him some orange juice.   Her hands
          shake slightly.
          
                                 APRIL
                       Yes. I thought you'd probably want
                       a good breakfast today. I mean it's
                       kind of an important day for you,
                       isn't it? Isn't this the day you
                       have your conference with Pollock?
          
                                 FRANK
                           (surprised)
                       Yes. That's right, yes.
          
          He shrugs.
          
                                   FRANK (CONT'D)
                       Big deal.
          
                                 APRIL
                       I imagine it is a pretty big deal;
                       for them, anyway. What exactly do
                       you think you'll be doing? You
                       never have told me much about it.
          
                                 FRANK
                       Haven't I? Well... I think this
                       whole thing is about Knox getting
                       ready to buy up one of these really
                       big computers, bigger than the
                       `500'. Did I tell you about that?
          
                                 APRIL
                       No, I don't believe you did.
          
                                                                       94.
          
          
                                 FRANK
                       Well, you know -- Basically it's
                       just a...a big, fast adding
                       machine. Only...
          
          He takes a pencil from his inside pocket and delicately
          sketches the computer on the napkin.
          
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                       Instead of mechanical parts, you
                       see, it's got thousands of little
                       individual vacuum tubes.
          
          She picks up the drawing and looks at it.       It's surprisingly
          delicate.
          
                                 APRIL
                       Oh, I see. At least I think I see;
                       yes. It's really sort of --
                       interesting, isn't it?
          
                                 FRANK
                       Well, I don't know, it's -- yeah, I
                       guess it is sort of interesting, in
                       a way.
          
                                 APRIL
                       You should value what you do Frank.
                       You're obviously good at it.
          
          He smiles, flattered and surprised.    He slips the pencil into
          the inside pocket of his suit.
          
                                 FRANK
                       Guess I'd better be getting
                       started.
          
          He stands.    April stands up too, smoothing her skirt.
          
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                       Listen, though, April; this was
                       really nice... I mean it was a
                       swell breakfast. Really; I don't
                       know when I've ever had a -- a
                       nicer breakfast.
          
                                                                        95.
          
          
                              APRIL
                    Thank you... I'm glad; I enjoyed it
                    too.
          
          They stand there gazing at one another across the table.
          Suddenly, inexplicably, his eyes are filled with tears.
          
          He turns and walks to the door. He puts his hand on the
          handle and turns back once more.
          
                              FRANK
                    Then you don't -- You don't hate
                    me, or anything?
          
                              APRIL
                    No; of course I don't.
          
          She comes over to him.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Have a good day.
          
          He leans down and kisses her tenderly.   They look at one
          another a moment longer.
          
                              FRANK
                    Okay, then... So long.
          
          He steps through the door. She catches the door before it
          shuts and watches him through the screen.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING.
          
          April walks out onto the driveway as the car reverses away
          down the drive.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER CAR - MORNING.
          
          Frank backs the car onto the road. He slides the car into
          drive and then catches sight of April in the driveway.
          
          
          EXT. WHEELER DRIVEWAY - MORNING.
          
          April sees Frank looking back at her.    She waves.   Frank
          waves from the car and drives off...
          
                                                                    96.
          
          
          Then April is alone. She shivers from the morning chill.
          She turns and looks back at the house.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
          
          April enters through the screen door and goes to the table.
          She looks down at Frank's diagram and carefully places it
          aside.
          
          She carries the dishes to the sink and begins to wash them.
          
          Suddenly, her body convulses as she tries to hold back from
          crying. And then there is no stopping the tears...
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING.
          
          April is standing by the phone, with her hand on the
          receiver, rehearsing. She is smoking. She dials.
          
                             APRIL
                    Hello... Milly? Everything all
                    right? My voice sounds what...?
          
          April uses both hands to grip the receiver.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Well, no, I'm afraid I'm not
                    feeling any better... If it's not
                    an inconvenience for you... This
                    evening would be great. What...?
                    Oh, well- no, not if they're
                    outdoors playing. Don't call them
                    in.
          
          The cigarette shreds in April's hand.
          
                              APRIL (CONT'D)
                    Just give them - you know, give
                    them each a kiss for me, and give
                    them my love, and tell them - you
                    know... All right, Milly. Thanks.
          
          She hangs up and begins to cry again.   Takes a breath.
          
                                                                     97.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - MORNING.
          
          FOOTSTEPS...
          
          We move behind April as she walks through the silent house.
          
          The distant SOUND of children playing outside.
          
          Each room she passes is a pocket of silence.
          
          
          INT. FRANK AND APRIL'S BEDROOM - MORNING.
          
          April makes the bed.
          
          She arranges her shoes on the floor of the closet.
          
          April reaches onto a shelf behind some clothes.   Pulls out
          the brown paper package.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER KITCHEN - MORNING.
          
          April stands at the stove over a pot of rolling, boiling
          water.
          
          She removes the rubber syringe from its paper packaging and
          drops it into the pot. She checks her watch.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
          
          April carries the pot of boiling, sudsy water down the hall.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - DAY.
          
          April places the pot into the tub.   She lays towels across
          the floor. And closes the door...
          
          
          INT. WHEELER BATHROOM - DAY, MOMENTS LATER.
          
          The SOUND of running water. The empty mirror.     April's face
          rises up into the reflection with a gasp.
          
                                                                       98.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER HALLWAY - DAY.
          
          We move with April down the hallway, her face is pale.
          
          
          INT. WHEELER LIVING ROOM - DAY, LATER.
          
          Now April stands at the picture window.    She is shaking.
          
          A DROPLET of blood slides down her knee.   She looks down.
          
          On the floor, two droplets of blood appear between her bare
          feet...
          
          Now we see the bright maple leaf of blood seeping through her
          skirt. She is shaking more.
          
          She walks slowly out of the room, towards the kitchen.
          
                              APRIL (O.S.)
                    I think I need an ambulance....
                    Yes... One one five Revolutionary
                    Road.
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL KITCHEN - DAY.
          
          Milly folds laundry. She looks up to see -
          
          An ambulance turns into the Wheeler's driveway.   Her face
          clouds with instinctual foreboding.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON.
          
          Shep steps out into a hospital hallway.
          
          Frank paces, helpless in the waiting room, his face a mask of
          bewildered, childlike confusion. He looks up to see -
          
          Shep coming towards him.
          
                              SHEP
                    Frank? They tell you what
                    happened?
          
                                                                    99.
          
          
                              FRANK
                    Jesus, Shep. I couldn't even
                    understand half the things he told
                    me. He said the fetus was out
                    before they got her here. He said
                    they had to operate to take out the
                    whatdycallit, the placenta and now
                    she's still bleeding. He said
                    she'd lost a lot of blood before
                    the ambulance came, and now they're
                    trying to stop it, and he said a
                    whole lot of things I didn't get,
                    about capillaries, and he said
                    she's unconscious. Jesus.
          
                              SHEP
                    How about sitting down, Frank.
          
                              FRANK
                    What the hell do I want to sit down
                    for!
          
                               SHEP
                    Okay.   Take it easy.
          
                               FRANK
                    My God.
          
                              SHEP
                    Here, have a cigarette.
          
          Shep offers the pack.   Frank doesn't take one.
          
                              FRANK
                    She did it to herself, Shep.
          
          Shep's face as he realizes what he's saying.
          
                              FRANK (CONT'D)
                    She did it to herself.
          
          Shep takes a cigarette for himself.   He lights it with
          trembling fingers.
          
                              SHEP
                    I'll get some coffee.
          
          Frank looks over at Shep as if he'd forgotten him.   He nods.
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
          Shep stands and walks down the hall.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - COFFEE MACHINE - AFTERNOON.
          
          Shep stands at a coffee machine, gathering himself. He looks
          up. He begins to feed coins into the machine. His hands are
          trembling. He drops a coin. It rolls under the machine. He
          has to get down on his hands and knees to retrieve it...
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON.
          
          Shep walks tentatively, holding a cup in each hand, slopping
          coffee onto the floor...
          
          He rounds the corner and stops.
          
          Frank is no longer in his chair at the end of the long
          echoing hallway. Shep looks around...
          
          Then suddenly, the double doors are flung open and a number
          of nurses hurry out. Behind them, comes Frank, supported by
          two Doctors.
          
          Shep runs to them as they move Frank over to a chair.    He's
          in shock.
          
                                FRANK
                    No.   No.   No.
          
          They try to make him sit, but he stays stubbornly on his
          feet, the chair skidding behind him.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Try to sit down, Mr. Wheeler.
          
                              SHEP
                    Sit down Frank.
          
          Frank looks at Shep - his face is a terrifying blank.
          
          
          EXT. REVOLUTIONARY ROAD - MAGIC HOUR.
          
          A toyland of white and pastel houses along the road. The
          crisp green lawns. The blue televisions flickering behind
          the glass.
          
                                                                  101.
          
          
          We hear the WHISK of running footsteps on the asphalt, the
          rush of a man's breath...
          
          Frank is running down the middle of the street, tears
          streaming silently down his face...
          
          
          INT. CAMPBELL LIVING ROOM - EVENING, ONE YEAR LATER.
          
          Four high-ball glasses with glistening cubes of ice.
          
          Shep puts the finishing touches on four drinks.
          
          MR. and MRS. BRACE, a pleasant looking young couple fresh
          from the city sit on the couch.
          
                                 MILLY
                       ...It was the worst experience of
                       my life. Such wonderful people.
                       Weren't they Shep? Poor April.
          
          Shep picks up the drinks and carries them across the room.
          He stands there beside the three of them, but he can't bring
          himself to sit down and join in.
          
                                 MILLY (CONT'D)
                       Frank lives in the city now.       Where
                       is it he works?
          
                                 SHEP
                       Bart Pollock Associates.
          
                                    MR. BRACE
                       Computers.     Interesting firm.
          
          Mr. Brace removes his pipe and looks at it.
          
                                 MRS. BRACE
                       Have you seen him since?
          
                                 MILLY
                       No. Too many memories, I think.
                       Shep's seen him. In the city.
          
          Shep nods.
          
                                                                   102.
          
          
                              MILLY (CONT'D)
                    He's just dedicated to those kids.
                    Every spare moment he has, he
                    spends with them...
          
          Shep turns and walks out of the room.
          
          
          EXT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - EVENING.
          
          Shep walks across the lawn to the edge of the property. He
          looks out over the suburban houses. At what was once the
          Wheeler house.
          
          Shep's face, looking out. His eyes are filled with tears.
          Milly comes up behind him.
          
                                MILLY
                    You okay?
          
                                SHEP
                    Mm-hmm.
          
          She takes his arm and holds him close.
          
                              SHEP (CONT'D)
                    I don't want to talk about The
                    Wheelers any more.
          
                             MILLY
                    Okay. We don't have to.     We don't
                    have to.
          
          Shep and Milly look out over Revolutionary Road.
          
          
          EXT. CITY PARK - DAY.
          
          The same silence over a beautiful day in the city.    And
          from the silence, the faint sound of wind through the leafy
          branches of trees.
          
          Two children play in a playground in a small park.
          
          It's Jennifer and Michael.    They seem happy, engrossed. Other
          kids play around them.
          
                                                                  103.
          
          
          Watching them from a bench is Frank.   He is a little older, a
          little thinner.
          
          Close on Frank's face.   The SOUND of his children playing.
          
          
          INT. GIVINGS' LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          Mrs. Givings crouches on a cotton work sheet painting varnish
          onto a chair. Mr. Givings sits reading the paper.
          
          A new puppy sleeps curled up on the rug nearby.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    I can't tell you how pleased I am
                    about the little Revolutionary Road
                    place, Howard. Remember how dreary
                    it looked all winter? All cold and
                    dark and -- well, spooky. Creepy-
                    crawly. And now whenever I drive
                    past, it gives me such a lift to
                    see it all perked up and spanking
                    clean again, with lights in the
                    windows. And do you know, I was
                    just thinking, I've loved that
                    little house for years, and the
                    Braces are the first really
                    suitable people I've ever found for
                    it. Really nice, congenial people,
                    I mean.
          
          Mr. Givings fiddles with his hearing aid.
          
                              MR. GIVINGS
                    Well, except for the Wheelers, you
                    mean.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS
                    Oh, I was very fond of the Wheelers
                    but they always were a bit -- a bit
                    whimsical, for my taste. A bit
                    neurotic. I may not have stressed
                    it, but they were often very trying
                    people to deal with, in many ways.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                 104.
          
                              MRS. GIVINGS (CONT'D)
                    Actually, the main reason the
                    little house has been so hard to
                    sell is that they let it depreciate
                    so dreadfully. Warped window
                    frames, wet cellar, crayon marks on
                    the walls, filthy smudges around
                    all the--
          
          Mr. Givings reaches up to his ear and SUDDENLY... SILENCE...
          but for the faint sound of wind.
          
          He gazes out the window as behind him Mrs. Givings continues
          to talk, but we can't hear a thing.
          
          He has turned off his hearing aid.
          
                                                     FADE TO BLACK

				    "ROCKY"

					  by

			    Sylvester Stallone


























RING PRODUCTIONS, INC.

MASTER SCRIPT: INCLUDES ALL REVISIONS AS OF 1/7/76  REVISED:
 




INT. BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... "NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA"

... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can.
The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle.
The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is
fighting.

In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black.
The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old.
His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black
hair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a
plodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and
bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy.
But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins
at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead.

The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for
blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters.
In the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is
hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony.
A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.

The BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner...
Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring.

The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers
across the ring at Rocky.

				BLACK FIGHTER
			(to cornerman)
		... I'm gonna bust his head
		wide open!

In Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled,
balding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He
works on Rocky without any enthusiasm.

				CORNERMAN
			(lackluster)
		... Ya waltzin' -- Give the
		suckers some action.

				ROCKY
		Hey --

				CORNERMAN
			(overriding)
		Ya movin' like a bum -- Want
		some advice --

				ROCKY
		... Just gimme the water.
 

										2.


A FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with
yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.

				FAN
		Should I bet the fight don't
		go the distance -- Ya feel
		strong?

				ROCKY
		Absolutely.

				CORNERMAN
		... Ya want some good advice?

				ROCKY
		... I just want the mouthpiece.

The BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross.  The
fighters engage in battle.  The other fighter grabs Rocky in
a clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding
cut on the corner of Rocky's eye.

Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into
the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the
fighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into
the ring.  Rocky ignores it.

The fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does
not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under
the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new
fighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe.
Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion."

				ANNOUNCER
		Winner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a
		six rounder between local
		lightweights.

Without pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a
cigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher
passes behind him.  He watches for a moment and continues up
the aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the
BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky
fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.

THE TITLE CREDITS END:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his
locker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other
fighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.
 

										3.


				FIGHTER #1
		... Tomorrow me an' my woman
		are gonna tip on down to
		Atlantic City, man.

				FIGHTER #2
		... It's cold, Bro'.

				FIGHTER #1
		... That's right, I got the
		city to myself...

Another paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and
spit nervously on the floor.

A young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO
that is BLASTING MUSIC.

The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer
and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters
are smoking.  The room is cloudy.

A short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater
buttoned over a t-shirt.

				PROMOTER
		...Balboa!?

Rocky raises his head.  The promoter steps over.

				PROMOTER
			(continuing)
		... Twenty bucks for the
		locker an' cornerman -- Two
		bucks for the towel an'
		shower, seven for tax -- The
		house owes ya, sixty-one
		dollars.

The man peels off the money and departs... Rocky closes his
locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.

INT. TROLLEY - NIGHT

Rocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly... The
trolley is empty except for a thin old black WOMAN... The
black Woman studies Rocky's bruised face... Rocky becomes
self-conscious.

				ROCKY
			(almost apologetic)
		I'm a fighter.
 

										4.


				WOMAN
			(tired)
		... Yo' iz an accident.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... He waves
at a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back.

Rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty
bookstore.  Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway.

Further down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the
"ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP"... He peers into the dark store and
sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window.  He mumbles to
the dog and continues to the corner.

EXT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located
in the most deprived section of South Philly.  He kicks away
the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and
enters.

INT. ROCKY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

The narrow hallway is painted olive brown.  A single light
bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky enters.  The one-room apartment is drab, with a
curling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall...
Nailed against the far wall is a mattress.  The mattress is
used as a punching bag.  Stuffing spills out of the center.

Rocky drops his coat on the floor.  He puts on a pair of
glasses.  He crosses to a small turtle bowl... He lifts the
creatures.

				ROCKY
		...Look who's home.

Rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then
places an old 45 RPM record on a battered phonograph.  The
record is a tune, "ALL IN THE GAME."

... As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his
hairbrush.  Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the
record.  He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning
to thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a
bullish fighting stance and throws several punches.

The water boils.  Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.
 

										5.


EXT. SUNRISE OF PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAWN

We SEE the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering
figure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it
sits majestically above City Hall...

EXT. DOCKS - EARLY MORNING

Rocky is walking along the waterfront... He has a bandaid
over one eye.  He looks at the rugged stevedores going about
their business... He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool
jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded.

Rocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked
car.  These men look like blood drinkers.

				MAFIA #1
		Yo, Rock -- How's your Boss?

				ROCKY
		Real good.

				MAFIA #2
		Fightin' again?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, here an' there.

				MAFIA #1
		Mebbe we make sum money
		togather soon... Give ya boss
		my best.

Rocky shrugs and moves away... He nears a heavy man working
the crane.  The heavy man looks frightened... He stops the
crane and hurries into the ship's hole.  Rocky dashes up the
gangplank.

INT. SHIP - DAY

The man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked
crates and coffee beans.

Rocky sprints after him... He lunges and flings the man by
the neck against the wall of stacked cargo.

				FATS
			(terror-filled)
		Don't hit the face!  Not the
		face!!

				ROCKY
		Mr. Gazzo wants the two
		hundred now!
 

										6.


				FATS
		Honest to God I'm broke --
		Gimme a break.

				ROCKY
		Mr. Gazzo says I should get
		two hundred or break the thumb.

				FATS
		Please, I need my hands to
		work -- Christ, don't bust my
		thumbs.

At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by
stevedores.  Rocky remains cool.

				ROCKY
		Goin' fishin'?

The man drops the hook.

				ROCKY
		What's ya name again?

				FATS
		Bob.

				ROCKY
		Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance,
		ya gotta pay the band -- If ya
		borrow, ya gotta pay the man...
		Me, I ain't emotionally
		involved.

Rocky's determined expression strikes home.  The fat man
quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small
wad of bills.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; counting)
		A hundred an' thirty.

				FATS
		That's it, I'm broke.

				ROCKY
		That's it? -- Completely?

				FATS
		That's it.

				ROCKY
		What about for food an' stuff?
 

										7.


				FATS
		You have my food in ya hand.

Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's
flushed expression.

				ROCKY
		... The juice is climbin'
		every week.

				FATS
		I know the juice is climbin' --
		I been workin' six months just
		to pay the damn interest.

				ROCKY
		Ya still light seventy.

				FATS
		Waits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't
		have to break nothin' -- Here,
		take my coat, it's worth
		fifty-sixty dollars.  It's
		yours.

The man quickly removes his coat and extends it...

				FATS
			(continuing)
		See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's
		don't have to know nuthin'.
		I'll go tape up the hand like
		ya broke my thumb.  Gazzo
		won't be wise to nothin' -- Be
		a smart guy, keep the coat,
		we'll fake like ya broke the
		hand.

The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the
man's thumb and bends him to his knees.

				FATS
			(almost a whisper)
		No - no - no - Please -
		Please - Please don't...

Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock.  The
thumb is fine.

				ROCKY
		...That's what coulda happened.
			(walks off.)
 

										8.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Later that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in
South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In
the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed
Kittens -- $1.50"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning.
He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the
window and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and
presses his face against the window and does his impression
of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks
away.

The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not
very attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old.
Brown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses.

Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so
painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters.

INT. PET SHOP - DAY

				ADRIAN
		... Could you take the puppy
		out --

				CUSTOMER
		It can breathe.

				ADRIAN
		Please -

				CUSTOMER
		Please, nothin' - I paid for
		this dog and can do whatever I
		want with it - I can throw it
		through the window if I want -
		Now give me my two dollars
		back before I do throw it
		through the window.

Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches
the bag out of her hand.  He removes the puppy and hands it
to Adrian.

				CUSTOMER
		Get away from me - Give me that!

Rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it
to the lady... She nervously exits.

				ROCKY
		... How's the turtle food this
		week?
 

										9.


				ADRIAN
		... Fine.

				ROCKY
		Me, I'm kinda aggravated.

				ADRIAN
		... I'm sorry.

				ROCKY
		Ain't your fault - Here's the
		problem.

Adrian nods... Though charmed, she is slightly intimidated.

				ROCKY
		The last food I got here had
		more moths than flies -- An'
		the moths get caught in my
		turtle's throat -- That makes
		them cough --

The OWNER, a squat woman of forty, steps out of the back and
waves at Rocky.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Yo, Gloria -- I was talkin'
		about the turtle food -- Like
		I was sayin', the moths get
		caught in the turtle's throat
		an' makes 'em cough...
			(coughs)
		A little cough an' I gotta
		smack 'em on the shell -- An'
		whatta think they get?

Adrian shrugs.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I smack 'em hard on the shell
		an' they get... What?

				ADRIAN
		... I don't know.

				ROCKY
		Shell-shocked!

Both the Owner and Adrian smile.
 

									10.


				OWNER
		Startin' with the bad jokes
		early today, huh.

				ROCKY
		Inventin' jokes ain't easy.

Rocky steps over to a large cage at the rear of the shop...
Inside is a huge dog.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		How's Butkus this mornin'?

				OWNER
		Ain't had time to check 'em.

Rocky opens the cage and the large dog jumps out and looks
very happy.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Butkus -- Dead.  Play dead.

The dog plays dead.

				ROCKY
		...What kinda dog is this again?

				OWNER
		Bullmastiff.

				ROCKY
		The owner was suppose to pick
		him up three weeks ago.

				OWNER
		We're not responsible for
		animals left over thirty
		days - We board it ain't a
		animal shelter, Y'know.
		...Adrian, I want you to clean
		all those cat cages downstairs,
		they're a mess.
			(Adrian nods.)


Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop.

EXT. LEHIGH ST. TRAIN TRESTLE - DAY

Gazzo picks up Rocky.
 

									11.


INT. GAZZO'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

MR. GAZZO and his YOUNG BODY GUARD sit in the front seat...
Rocky is in the back seat.

				ROCKY
		He only had a hundred an'
		thirty. -- I think he's good
		for the rest next week, Mr.
		Gazzo.

				GAZZO
			(patiently)
		Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for
		it...

Gazzo hands Rocky a twenty.

				GAZZO
		Tomorrow collect from Del
		Rio -- He's late three weeks.
		How'd you do last night?

				ROCKY
		... Fine.

Gazzo's Bodyguard looks at Rocky's bruised face in the
mirror and smiles.

				BODYGUARD
		Did ya get the license number?

				ROCKY
		Of wa?

				BODYGUARD
		... Of the truck that run over
		your face.

Gazzo steps out of the car and beckons to Rocky.

				GAZZO
		Yo Rock.  Did I give you a job
		this mornin?  How come ya
		didn't break this guy's thumb
		like I asked ya?  When ya
		don't do what ya are told, it
		makes me look bad, kid.

				ROCKY
		I figure if I break the thumb
		this guy gets thrown outta his
		job and can't pay nothin no
		more.
 

									12.


				GAZZO
		It don't matter.  It's my
		reputation.  These guys think
		they can get off light.  It's
		bad for my reputation -- It's
		bad for business.  See ya
		killer.

Gazzo gets into his car.

				GAZZO
			(to Bodyguard)
		... The Rock's a good kid.

				BODYGUARD
			(emotionless)
		... A meatbag.

They pull away.

EXT. GYM - DAY

Gazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to
Goldmill's Gym.  On the way he passes several familiar
people and exchanges waves... Out front is a young Irishman
who runs a soft pretzel stand... His name is RUDY.  It is
apparent from his face he was a prize fighter... He is blind
and mentally defective.

				RUDY
		...See the fight last night?

				RUDY
		Nah, I was fightin' myself.

				RUDY
		Apollo Creed beat the bum to
		pieces.

EXT./INT. GYM - DAY

Mickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy
spoons.  Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive
among themselves.  Two winos lean against the entrance.

Rocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full.  The
MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes
the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of
machinery.  Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers
BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of
the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the
THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS.
 

									13.


The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five
percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other.

As Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to
wave and yell greetings.

				FIGHTER #1
		Hey, hear ya knocked Spider
		Rice out in the sixth?

				ROCKY
		The third -- Shoulda seen it.

Rocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag.

				FIGHTER #2
			(removes glove)
		Hey, Rock, touch my hand.

				ROCKY
		How come?

				FIGHTER #2
		C'mon, it's important.

Rocky touches the Fighter's bare hand.

				FIGHTER #2
			(continuing)
		Can ya tell I just whacked-off?

Rocky smiles and moves away.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

The dressing room is lined with dented lockers.  Wooden
benches stretch across the room.  On the wall is a sign that
reads, "NO KISSING."

Rocky goes to his locker.  He tries to open it but fails.
He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers.
Still it does not open.  He shakes the lock forcefully, no
luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the
situation.

After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the
bench and smashes open the lock.  Opening the door Rocky is
taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes.

				ROCKY
			(mumbling)
		... These ain't my clothes.
 

									14.


He sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside
of the door.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... These ain't my pictures.

A short powerful man of thirty-five enters.  His hair looks
like it has been shaped with hedge clippers.  His name is
MIKE.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Mike -- What's happenin'
		here?

				MIKE
		It ain't your locker no more.

				ROCKY
		Whatta ya talkin' about it
		ain't my locker no more?

				MIKE
		Listen, I'm with you -- But ya
		gotta talk to Mickey -- I put
		ya stuff in the bag over there.

Rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping
bag and follows Mike across the room... Mike leans his head
into the shower room.  Two Latin fighters are lathering up.

				FIGHTER
		...Hey, Peanut, gimme some
		soap, Man.

				MIKE
			(irate)
		Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you,
		Nobody -- You don't call me
		Peanut.

				FIGHTER
		Peanut, gimme some soap.

The fighters laugh.  Inflamed, Mike removes a bar of soap
from his pocket and hurls it at the insulting fighter.  It
hits just above the man's head.  The fighters are shocked
into silence.

Mike turns and exits with Rocky... The fighters curse them
loudly in Spanish.
 

									15.


INT. GYM - DAY

Rocky and Mike move past fighters going through their
training routines.

				ROCKY
		You were ready to bite that
		guy's face.

				MIKE
		Yeah -- See the fight last
		night?  Apollo Creed beat that
		English guy bad.

				ROCKY
		Creed's great.

Mike fakes a friendly punch at Rocky and hurries off to
another chore...

INT. GYM - DAY

The Owner, MICKEY, sits on a stool near the entrance.  He
wears a baggy suit... He is in his late seventies.

Rocky approaches... Mickey is conversing with another fighter.

				MICKEY
		I don't care what nobody says,
		this bum Creed woulda never
		made it in the Thirties --

				ROCKY
		Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?

				MICKEY
			(monotoned)
		... What?

				ROCKY
		I said, how ya feelin'?

				MICKEY
			(dryly)
		Do you see me talkin'?  Huh?

				ROCKY
			(low)
		Yeah.
 

									16.


				MICKEY
			(spitting)
		Then stand there an' wait till
		I'm done -- Creed's good,
		yeah, he's real fine but I
		gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper,
		who's got the stuff it takes
		to be a champ -- He's mean,
		quick, an' big -- What more
		d'ya need?  Okay, go to work...
			(to Rocky)
		Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?

				ROCKY
		I was talkin' with ya man,
		Mike. -- Hey, how come I been
		put outta my locker?

				MICKEY
		Dipper needed it.

Rocky turns and looks at DIPPER sparring... Dipper is a
young, muscular heavyweight with a mean expression.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Dipper's a climber -- You're a
		tomato.

				ROCKY
		... Tomato?

				MICKEY
		Facts is facts.  I run a
		business here -- I'm cleanin'
		house --

Mickey pauses to watch a young middleweight time-skip as his
trainer sings "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM."

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		How old are ya?

				ROCKY
		...What?

				MICKEY
		How old?

				ROCKY
		Come July, twenty-five.
 

									17.


				MICKEY
		More like thirty.

				ROCKY
		Twenty-five, thirty -- What's
		the difference? -- It took me
		two months to learn the
		combination of that locker.

				MICKEY
		The legs must be goin'.

				ROCKY
		Yeah, they're goin', -- that's
		nature... That was my locker
		for six years.

				MICKEY
		... Did ya fight last night?

				ROCKY
		Yeah --

				MICKEY
		Did ya win?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, Kayo.

				MICKEY
		... Who'd ya fight?

				ROCKY
		Spider Rice.

				MICKEY
		Rice is a bum.

				ROCKY
		You think everybody I fight is
		a bum.

				MICKEY
		Ain't they?

Mickey shoots Rocky a quick, indifferent look and removes a
rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers.
 

									18.


				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Ya want the truth -- Ya got
		heart, but ya fight like an
		ape -- The only thing special
		about you is ya never got ya
		nose broke -- keep ya nose
		pretty -- what's left of ya
		brain an' retire.

				ROCKY
		Listen, I'm gonna take a
		steam -- Did good last night --
		Shoulda seen it.

				MICKEY
		Hey, ever think about retirin'?

				ROCKY
		...No.

				MICKEY
		Think about it.

				ROCKY
		Yeah, sure.

Shrugging, Rocky moves away.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		...I think I'm gonna take a
		steam -- Shoulda seen me
		fight -- Did good, y'know.

Mickey leans over to Mike who approaches with a mop and pail.

				MICKEY
			(gesturing
			towards Rocky)
		Known him since he was
		fifteen -- A waste of life.

Dejected, Rocky travels to the locker room.  He passes Big
Dipper sparring in a ring... Dipper spits a mouthful of
water in a bucket and looks smugly at Rocky.

				DIPPER
			(to Rocky)
		... I dig yo' locker, Man.

				TRAINER
		Time, Dipper.
 

									19.


Dipper smiles cruelly and begins sparring... Scene FADES on
Rocky's crestfallen expression.  He moves off.

EXT. PET SHOP - DUSK

At sunset Rocky comes down the street and pauses at the pet
shop... He is eating Colonel Sanders' fried chicken out of a
bag... He taps on the window with a chicken bone.

INT. PET SHOP - DUSK

Inside Adrian is arranging pet toys on the counter... She
hears the tapping, sees Rocky, and tenses.  Rocky enters.

				ROCKY
		... Wow -- cold!  Good night
		to catch pneumonia.

Adrian smiles slightly and moves behind the counter.  Rocky
fumbles idly among the pet toys.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Ah -- I came in here for
		somethin'... Oh, yeah, would
		ya like somebody to walk ya
		home?

The girl wants to say yes but a tremendous inferiority
complex will not permit it... Rocky understands.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Hey, how's my buddy doin'?
			(looks into
			Butkus' cage)
		-- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see
		ya later.

				ADRIAN
		... Goodnight, Rocky.

Rocky exits.  Adrian watches his departure with mixed
emotions.

EXT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

A short while later Rocky arrives at Andy's Bar... He throws
the Colonel Sanders bag and bones in a large public litter
can.  The trash can has a bicentennial picture of George
Washington pointing at a pile of garbage.  The caption
reads, "There was no litter at Valley Forge!"
 

									20.


INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

Rocky enters the bar.  He sits the Drunk in a booth...
Several drinkers wave at him.  OLD ANDY sets a mug of beer
in front of him... Rocky seems to be looking for someone.

				ROCKY
		Catch pneumonia out there --
		Seen Paulie?

Andy casually nods towards the men's room.

Rocky traverses the room and passes TWO DRUNKS leaning on
the bar.

INT. ANDY'S RESTROOM - NIGHT

Rocky enters the restroom... It is a vile stench hole with
years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall.

PAULIE is presently trying to comb his hair in the only
remaining piece of mirror in the room... Paulie is in his
early thirties.  He is medium height.  Brown hair.  Square
shouldered.  He has a foul personality... A classic
misanthrope.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Paulie.

				PAULIE
			(very drunk)
		Yo, Rocky -- Look at this
		mirror.  I'd like to kill the
		friggin' moron who broke this
		mirror.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Paulie.

				PAULIE
		What?

				ROCKY
		Your sister's givin' me the
		shoulder.

				PAULIE
		Forget her.  You could do
		better than my sister.

				ROCKY
		Every mornin', every night I
		pass by -- I smile.
				(MORE)
 

									21.


				ROCKY (CONT'D)
		I say jokes.  Nothin'.  She
		looks at me.

				PAULIE
			(annoyed)
		Looks, huh?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, like I was a plate of
		leftovers -- Somethin' wrong
		with my face -- Whatta I need,
		a Caddy to connect with ya
		sister?

				PAULIE
		My sister's a friggin' loser.

				ROCKY
		Hey --

				PAULIE
		Sometimes she gets me so
		crazy, I'd like to split her
		head with a razor.

				ROCKY
		Don't get mental, man.

				PAULIE
		Ya caught me in a bad mood.

				ROCKY
		Ya always in a bad mood --

				PAULIE
		... Adrian ain't sharp.

The restroom stench is overwhelming... Rocky covers his nose
with the neckline of his t-shirt.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		She's a loser -- She don't
		enjoy life -- She reads --
		Brainy -- Pushin' thirty
		friggin' years old!  She's
		gonna die alone if she don't
		wise up.

				ROCKY
		I'm thirty myself.
 

									22.


				PAULIE
		An' you're dyin' alone, too.

				ROCKY
		I don't see no crowd around
		you, neither.

				PAULIE
			(pointing at
			the wall)
		I wanna kill the friggin'
		moron who broke the mirror.

				ROCKY
		Let's get outta this stink.

INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

The restroom door opens.  Rocky guides Paulie out.  Though
stumbling, Paulie talks as he walks.

				PAULIE
		The girl's dryin' up!  She's
		gotta live a little before her
		body dries up!!  You're a pal,
		Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to
		her?  Y'know, it's Thanksgivin'
		tomorrow.

				ROCKY
		... Sure.

				PAULIE
		Tomorrow you come for some
		bird, right?

				ROCKY
		Absolutely...

Paulie smiles and Rocky guides him to a booth... Rocky steps
to the bar.  Andy leans over to him.

				ANDY
		That was alotta crap to go
		through for a dinner invite.

Rocky shakes his head no and raises his eyes towards a
suspended television... the nightly sports broadcast is on.
The SPORTS COMMENTATOR is at the airport and about to
interview the heavyweight champion of the world, APOLLO
CREED.  Creed is twenty-eight years old.  He is a tall,
smooth-muscled Black with barely a scar on his light coffee-
colored face...
 

									23.


He is followed by an entourage of mixed trainers and
cornermen.  Also tagging alone is a small group of hangers-on.

The Commentator interviews Creed as he and his followers
disembark a private jet.

				COMMENTATOR
		How was the flight, Champ?

				APOLLO
		Very high an' very fast.

Apollo's crowd smiles almost automatically at everything he
says.

				COMMENTATOR
		Apollo, how would you rate
		this last British challenger,
		Henry Wilcoxson?

				APOLLO
		He was big, an' very nasty so
		I destroyed him in a hurry --
		Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac
		Lee Green next month.

				COMMENTATOR
		You're referring to the much
		publicized bicentennial fight?

				APOLLO
		That's right -- It's gonna be
		the greatest sportin' event in
		this country's history -- A
		gala occurrence!

				COMMENTATOR
		Still to be held in
		Philadelphia?

				APOLLO
		The Bicentennial Heavyweight
		Championship of the World is
		gonna be held in the only
		place it can be held --
		Philadelphia! -- the nation's
		cradle -- January First -- the
		first major event of our two
		hundredth year.

				COMMENTATOR
		Where're you off to now?

Apollo draws his wife close.
 

									24.


				APOLLO
		Me an' my wife are goin' home
		'cause we miss our children
		an' can't go no more time
		without seein' them.

				COMMENTATOR
		Any quick advice for young
		boxing hopefuls?

				APOLLO
			(looks straight
			into the camera)
		... Stay in school an' use
		your brains, dig -- Be a
		lawyer, be a doctor, carry a
		leather briefcase an' forget
		about sports!!  Sports can
		only make ya grunt an' smell --
		Be a thinker not a stinker!!

Apollo's entourage laughs and they move on... The Commentator
faces the camera.

				COMMENTATOR
		Jerry Simpson at Kennedy
		Airport with the Champion,
		Apollo Creed.

The sports show cuts away, but Rocky continues to look at
the television with a pensive stare... Andy has been speaking
the following dialogue over Apollo's broadcast.

				ANDY
		Nobody cares what's happenin'
		in the world of sports
		nomore -- Downhill.  Baseball,
		downhill -- Basketball,
		downhill.  Football's goin',
		too.  Bank on it.  Baseball
		use to be America's best
		sport... Sure -- Nuttin' like
		squattin' through a great
		double header, but now
		baseball's all business.

The news report with Apollo ends.  Andy drinks.

				ANDY
			(continuing)
		Where are the real fighters?
		The pros.  Today we jig clowns.
 

									25.


				ROCKY
		Clown.

				ANDY
		Yeah.

				ROCKY
		He took his best shot an'
		became champ -- What shot did
		you ever take?

				ANDY
		Yo, Rock, you ain't happy with
		yourself?  Fine.  But me, I
		gotta business here -- I don't
		need to take no shot.

Becoming despondent, Rocky rises and crosses to Paulie
slumped unconscious in the booth.

Rocky exits the bar... Andy turns to his customers.

				ANDY
			(continuing; boldly)
		Take a shot, he says! -- Sure,
		I'll take a shot!

Laughing, Andy pours himself a shot.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT

Rocky passes an all-night sandwich shop... In the window
hangs the sign "ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP, INC." Out front are
several YOUNG MEN and WOMEN.  They are much too young to be
out so late... A boy with a badly-chipped tooth beckons to
Rocky.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(aggressively)
		Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.

				ROCKY
		... No wine -- Bad for ya'
		brain.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		C'mon, man, it's cold, man.

				ROCKY
		No wine.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
 

									26.


				ROCKY
		Why?

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(sarcastically)
		'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme
		a dollar.

				ROCKY
		No dollar.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Hey, give Rocky a dime.

				YOUNG MAN #2
		... How come?

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		So he can call all his friends.

				ROCKY
			(mildly embarrassed)
		... That's an old one.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Buy us some Thunderbird, man.

Rocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who
is smoking and leaning whore-like against the wall.

				ROCKY
		Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya
		brother know you're hangin'
		out so late?

The girl, MARIE, assumes an indifferent attitude, attempting
to impress her friends.

				MARIE
		... Screw you.

				ROCKY
			(awed)
		What'd you say?

				MARIE
		... Screw you, yoyo.

The gang laughs.  Angered and shocked, Rocky grabs her arm.

				ROCKY
		Did these guys teach you to
		talk dirty?  Huh?
 

									27.


				MARIE
		Hey --

				ROCKY
		What?

				MARIE
		Stuff it, man!

				ROCKY
			(shakes her)
		Don't you never say that --
			(to the gang)
		-- You guys talk like that in
		front of a little girl -- You
		guys are scum.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		This is our place, dig!

The gang reluctantly backs up a step.

				ROCKY
		Don't ya never come round this
		girl -- Go home.

				YOUNG MAN #2
		This is our corner, man!  You
		go, chump!

Rocky moves forward and they scatter... They quickly move off.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(backpedaling)
		We'll kill you, man -- We
		gotta gun.

				ROCKY
		Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent
		ya face!

Rocky leads the girl away.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rocky is walking the young girl home... They are presently
cutting through a dark public school yard.  They pass
through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights
located at the top of the school building.  The atmosphere
is somewhat eerie.
 

									28.


				ROCKY
		How come ya wanna hang out
		with those guys?  They teach
		ya bad things.

				MARIE
		I like 'em.  If you don't you
		can f--

				ROCKY
		Hey!  When I was your age,
		there was only one girl who
		talked like that in the whole
		neighborhood.

				MARIE
			(bored)
		... Yeah.

She attempts to light a cigarette... Rocky nonchalantly
tosses it to the ground.

				ROCKY
		Make your teeth yella --

				MARIE
		I like yella teeth.

				ROCKY
		Makes your breath like garbage.

				MARIE
		Maybe I like garbage.

Rocky and Marie take a shortcut through a dark school yard.

				ROCKY
		Nobody likes garbage --
		Anyway, this girl with the
		dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin',
		but the guys wouldn't take her
		out for any serious datin'.

				MARIE
		Why?

				ROCKY
		'Cause that's the way guys
		are -- They laugh when ya talk
		dirty.  They think ya cute for
		a while, but then ya getta
		reputation an' watch out.
				(MORE)
 

									29.


				ROCKY (CONT'D)
		Nobody's ever gonna take ya
		serious.  Ya get no respect...
		I gotta use a bad word --
		Whore.  You'll end up maybe
		becomin' a whore.

				MARIE
		C'mon, Rocky.  I'm twelve.

				ROCKY
		That doesn't matter -- You
		don't really have to be a
		whore, just act like one an'
		that's it.

				MARIE
		What?

				ROCKY
		Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty
		years from now people will say
		'D'you remember Marie?' 'No,
		who was she?' 'She was that
		little whore who hung out at
		the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh,
		now I remember!'... See, they
		don't remember you, they
		remember the rep.

Rocky and Marie exit the dark school yard... Standing in the
shadows of the building are three young muggers.  The light
from their cigarettes flares red in their faces.

The muggers pace Rocky across the street and follow them
down the block... Rocky sees them and stops and faces the
three.  The muggers pause and study Rocky from a distance of
twenty yards.  Rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his
nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders...
The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander
away.

Rocky turns to Marie who has been standing behind him.

				ROCKY
			(points down
			the block)
		... That's your house, ain't it?

Marie nods.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Listen, I hope ya don't --
 

									30.


				MARIE
		I won't.

				ROCKY
		What was I gonna say?

				MARIE
		Ya hope I don't keep acting
		like a whore or I'll turn into
		one, right?

				ROCKY
		Ya, somethin' like that.

They exchange smiles and Marie moves away.  Rocky has made
an impact on her life.

				MARIE
		Goodnight, Rocky.

				ROCKY
		'Night, Marie.

She takes a few more steps and pauses again.

				MARIE
		... Fuck you, Creepo!!!

The girl runs to her house as Rocky looks on in dismay.

				ROCKY
			(walks off)
		... Yeah, who're you to give
		advice, Creepo.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

APOLLO CREED and his LAWYER and TRAINER are seated in the
offices of MILES JERGENS.  Jergens, a successful promoter
looks unhappy as he looks into the scowling face of Apollo
Creed.

				LAWYER
		Are the doctor's reports
		confirmed?

				JERGENS
		Definitely --
			(reading)
		-- It says here, Mac Lee Green
		has suffered a seriously
		cracked third metacarpal in
		his left hand.
 

									31.


				APOLLO
		Damn.

				JERGENS
		I suppose we could cancel the
		fight indefinitely if you are
		set on fighting Green.

				TRAINER
		It ain't just Green, what
		about the time Apollo's
		invested --

				JERGENS
		I believe we can find a
		solution.

				APOLLO
		Solution, nothin' -- What
		about the Bicentennial fight.

				LAWYER
		Jergens, don't play games with
		my client!  Apollo has already
		done nearly a million dollars
		worth of publicity --

				TRAINER
		Ten million's worth!

				LAWYER
		-- And has made contractual
		obligations with over twenty
		different organizations -- He
		doesn't want to be embarrassed.

				APOLLO
		You best find me another
		ranked contender an' I mean in
		a flash, man!

				JERGENS
			(holding up
			some notes)
		I contacted Ernie Roman's
		manager, he's fighting in
		France the same week.

				APOLLO
		Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's
		ranked fifth.
 

									32.


				JERGENS
		Shaw's fighting in South
		America -- Why not postpone
		the bout until July Fourth?

				LAWYER
		Hell with Fourth of July, man!
		Ten thousand things'll be
		goin' down on the Fourth of
		July! -- Apollo wants to be
		first!

				JERGENS
		That may not be possible, Jimmy.

				TRAINER
		This man here is the Star,
		dig -- Don't cause him to
		breathe heavy -- Now what
		'bout that sucker, Billy Dukes?

				JERGENS
		Went to California and gained
		fifty pounds -- and I called
		every worthwhile contender,
		but they say five weeks isn't
		enough time to get in shape.

Apollo stands beneath a new fight poster and points to it.

				APOLLO
		Shape, nothin' -- They're
		afraid.  They know everybody
		in the world's gonna see this
		fight an' none of them gotta
		prayer of beating me so
		they're makin' excuses so they
		don't have to be the chump
		that's gonna be whipped in
		front of the whole civilized
		world!!

				JERGENS
		Apollo, I'm sure there's a way
		to salvage this.

				TRAINER
		Nobody wants to be dissected
		on the country's birthday.
 

									33.


				JERGENS
		All I can counter with is that
		I'm a goddamn good promoter --
		I've promoted in every country
		in the world -- and I've tried
		to the best of my abilities.
		Perhaps you're right, and no
		one wants to be beat on the
		country's birthday... I don't
		know what else to say --

				APOLLO
		I do -- Maybe what this fight
		needs is something new -- a
		novelty.

				TRAINER
		You's the novelty, Champ!

				APOLLO
		Give my main man a raise!!

Everyone laughs.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		Now here's what's goin' down.
		Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say
		this but one time.  On January
		first, the first day of the
		Bicentennial I'm gonna fight
		me a local poor underdog, dig?
		A snow-white underdog.  An'
		I'm gonna put his face on this
		poster with me, hear?  An'
		I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm
		sentimental -- An' all the
		people in the country all
		sentimental, man, an' they'd
		like nothin' better than me,
		Apollo Creed, to let some
		unknown get a shot at the
		greatest title in the world on
		this country's biggest birthday.
		Now that's the way I see it
		an' that's the way I want it!!

				JERGENS
		... It's very American.

				APOLLO
		No, man, it's very smart.
 

									34.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Late that afternoon Mr. Gazzo's white 1970 Cadillac pulls up
to Rocky's apartment... Rocky is in the back seat with the
loan shark.  Gazzo's bodyguard is driving.

Gazzo flips through a small black notepad.

				ROCKY
		Next Wednesday I grab a grand
		from Snyder.  An' Thursday two
		yards from Cappoli, okay?

				GAZZO
		No, two yards from Snyder, an'
		a grand from Cappoli.

				ROCKY
		Ya sure?

				GAZZO
		Hey, screw ya brain on right.
		Now, who's this girl you're
		going out with tonight?

				ROCKY
		How'd you know?

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		You think I don't hear things?

				ROCKY
		Paulie's sister.

				BODYGUARD
			(abrasively)
		Hear she's retarded.

				ROCKY
			(dryly)
		She ain't retarded, she's shy.

				BODYGUARD
		Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards
		like the zoo.

				ROCKY
		Does that bum have to say that?

The Bodyguard reddens... Gazzo motions to his Bodyguard to
relax.
 

									35.


				GAZZO
		Buddy's in a bad mood --
		prostate problems.

				ROCKY
		He's always in a bad mood.
			(laughs)
		Count ya blessin's.  Ya a
		healthy person -- ya legs
		work -- ya hands work --

The Bodyguard has been looking at Rocky with murderous eyes.

				BODYGUARD
		I don't like ya face.

				ROCKY
		Don't like yours neither.

				BODYGUARD
		Kiss my ass.

				ROCKY
		Move your shoulders down.

Mr. Gazzo is amused.  He steps out of the car, followed by
Rocky.

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		Buddy's got a thing against
		ya, Rock.  Some people just
		hate for no reason, y'know.

				ROCKY
		Yeah.

				GAZZO
		Here's fifty bucks -- You an'
		the girl have a nice time.

				ROCKY
		Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.

Rocky enters his apartment and Gazzo drives off.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

The SCENE REVERTS BACK TO Miles Jergens' office.  Apollo
pores over a large record book.

				APOLLO
		How 'bout this Billy Snow?
 

									36.


				JERGENS
		Fouls.

				APOLLO
		How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?

				TRAINER
		Too old, dull fighter.
			(points at a name)
		Bobby Judge is a good boy.

				APOLLO
		... I don't feel heat from the
		name.

				JERGENS
		Joe Zack is a good prospect --
		Exciting boy.

				APOLLO
		... Still don't feel no heat.

				JERGENS
			(sighs)
		Exactly what are you looking
		for, Apollo?

				APOLLO
		... This man.

Everybody leans forward.

				APOLLO
			(continuing;
			much amused)
		'The Italian Stallion' -- He's
		my man.

				JERGENS
		Rocky Balboa -- His record's
		poor --

				APOLLO
		Don't matter -- That name.
		'The Italian Stallion,' it's
		right on.
			(laughs)
		Who discovered America?  An
		Italian, right?  So, man, what
		could be better than to get it
		on with one of his ancestors --

				TRAINER
		He won't last one round.
 

									37.


				APOLLO
		Listen, I gonna carry this boy
		three rounds, then drop 'im
		like a bad habit.

				TRAINER
		I don't like you messin' with
		southpaws -- They do everything
		wrong.

				APOLLO
		Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop
		'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed
		meets the Italian Stallion.'
		Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn
		monster movie!!

Everyone laughs.

						FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - DUSK

Rocky and Paulie walk towards his house... Even though it is
cold and dark, a group of kids conduct an energetic game of
half-ball. (Half-ball is a variation of stick-ball.)

				ROCKY
			(mimes throwing)
		I usta be deadly at half-ball.

				PAULIE
		I hate the friggin' game...
		I'd like to talk some business.

				ROCKY
		What kinda business?

				PAULIE
		Look at my hands -- See how
		the joints are swollen.

Paulie extends his thick hands and tries to make a fist.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in
		an' out of a freezer carryin'
		meat plays hell on the joints.

				ROCKY
		Maybe ya should see a doctor.
 

									38.


				PAULIE
		I don't need a doctor, I need
		a different job.

				ROCKY
		Maybe another job is the best
		thing.

				PAULIE
		Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo.
		Tell him I'm a friend an'
		would do a good job... Tell
		him I ain't bothered by
		nothin' an' would be a great
		collector... Bustin' bones
		don't bother me -- Tell him
		I'm a good worker.

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's gotta come to you.

				PAULIE
		I'm askin' ya to go to him --
		As a favor.

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's gotta come to you --
		Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job --
		Do what you do now.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - DUSK

They continue past the Atomic Hoagie Shoppe, Inc... A group
of young men pitch quarters on the sidewalk out front.

Rocky pauses... He sees Marie, the little girl from the
night before, hanging around with the guys.  She sees Rocky.

Marie takes a deep drag on her cigarette and faces the
opposite direction... The gang smiles and continues to pitch
quarters.

Anger and disappointment register across Rocky's face.

				PAULIE
		You know her?

Rocky shrugs and the two men move off... Filling the night
air is the METALLIC SOUND of pitching QUARTERS.

EXT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The men arrive at Paulie's home.  It is at the top of a
dimly-lit four story walk-up.
 

									39.


				ROCKY
		Ya sister knows I'm comin'?

				PAULIE
		Yeah, sure -- She's very
		excited.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paulie unlocks the apartment door and enters... Rocky
stiffly follows.  Paulie's sister steps out of the kitchen.
A large serving spoon is in her hand... The TV is on.

She stops short and eyes Rocky... She is visibly unsettled
by Rocky's unexpected presence.

				ADRIAN
			(weakly)
		Paulie, you're late.

She looks at Rocky again.

				PAULIE
		Did you call the hospital?
			(to Rocky)
		If I'm ten minutes late, she
		calls the hospital.

Adrian enters the bedroom and slams the door... Paulie
follows.  An argument ensues and Rocky overhears.

OVER the argument is HEARD a SPORTS BROADCAST rising from
the TELEVISION.

				COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
		... Unfortunate luck for
		fifth-ranked heavyweight, Mac
		Lee Green.  The slugging
		fighter acquired a serious
		fracture in his left hand
		after an aggressive day of
		sparring -- Champion Apollo
		Creed says he'll be 'shopping
		for another victim,' to fill
		Green's vacancy for the
		Bicentennial Championship
		Fight to be held in Philly
		next month... By the way,
		rumor has it that this will be
		the most widely-viewed sporting
		event in the entire world --
		and that includes the Super
		Bowl, folks... Today U.S.
		swimmers set a new...
 

									40.


Meanwhile, the argument between brother and sister continues
in the bedroom.

				ADRIAN
		... Paulie, why didn't you
		tell me you were bringing him
		home?!  Look at me, I'm not
		ready for this.

				PAULIE
		Like it would make a difference
		if you were, right?  This
		guy's a friend and now he's
		takin' ya out.

				ADRIAN
		No... I can't!

				PAULIE
		Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom
		an' I don't wanna know from
		nothin'.

				ADRIAN
		Paulie, please --

				PAULIE
		Hey, I want ya out
		instamaticly. -- I'm sicka
		lookin' at ya hangin' around
		like a friggin' spider -- Go
		out -- Live!  Do, enjoy life.

				ADRIAN
		... Like you?

				PAULIE
		Don't get wise with me.  I
		want ya to stop bein' a loser.

				ADRIAN
		I can't go out.

				PAULIE
		Why?

				ADRIAN
		Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
		I've gotta turkey in the oven.

Paulie turns and leaves the bedroom... He enters the kitchen.
Grabbing a large fork, he opens the oven and spears the
turkey... With the turkey suspended on the end of the fork,
Paulie heaves the dripping bird out the window.
 

									41.


Adrian has seen this and is shattered.  She runs back into
the bedroom and locks the door.

				PAULIE
		!! Ya want the bird, go out in
		the alley an' eat the bird --
		I want ya outta the house --
		Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya
		hungry, Rock?

				ROCKY
		Maybe ya better forget it.

				PAULIE
		Forget nothin' -- Here, talk
		to my sister, tell 'er
		somethin' nice.

Rocky walks over to Adrian's bedroom door and begins speaking
to the enclosed girl.

				ROCKY
		... Yo, Adrian, it's me,
		Rocky... Ah, ah -- Ah, it's
		kinda hard for me to think of
		somethin' to say, y'know --
		'Cause I never talked to a
		door before, I mean whatta ya
		say to a door.

Rocky turns away and begins to walk off.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... Maybe I better forget it.

				PAULIE
		Try again, c'mon, try again.

Rocky goes over to the door and begins speaking again.

				ROCKY
		Ah, Adrian, I know ya ain't
		too happy at this moment, but
		would ya do me a favor -- I
		ain't got nobody to spend
		Thanksgivin' with -- How 'bout
		you an' me goin' out -- Get
		somethin' to eat, maybe laugh
		a little, who knows... Would
		ya like, I dunno, go out
		together?

Adrian opens the door... She already has her winter coat on.
 

									42.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		We'll have a good time.

Paulie opens the front door and gives Rocky an encouraging
smile...

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's ya sister like to do?

				PAULIE
		Ice skate.

				ROCKY
		I didn't want no turkey anyway.

				ADRIAN
		It's Thanksgiving.

				ROCKY
		To you, to me it's Thursday.

INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian enter a deserted skating rink.

				ROCKY
		Looks quiet, y'know.

				ADRIAN
		I think it's closed.

				ROCKY
		I think mebbe we're early or
		somethin' --

From across the rink a CLEANING MAN yells at them.

				CLEANER
		Hey, whatta ya doin' here --
		we're closed... Yo, we're
		closed!

				ROCKY
			(yells back)
		Are ya closed to the General
		Public or to just everybody.
 

									43.


				CLEANER
			(starts to walk over)
		Hey, the rink is empty 'cause
		we're closed -- ya ain't
		allowed in here so do me a
		favor an' not stay here.

				ROCKY
		Wait here, gotta smooth this
		guy out.

				ADRIAN
			(softly)
		We could go somewhere else
		an' --

Rocky approaches the Cleaner.

				CLEANER
		Yo, pal, what's with you --
		The place ain't operatin'.

				ROCKY
		Listen, I gotta problem.  This
		girl ain't feelin' well,
		y'know -- The doctor says she
		should exercise, y'know once
		in awhile an' ice skatin' is
		the best thing --

				CLEANER
		This a con?

				ROCKY
		Look at her, ya can see she
		ain't feelin' good -- needs a
		few minutes exercise --

				CLEANER
		Few minutes?

				ROCKY
		... Ten minutes.

				CLEANER
		Ten minutes for ten dollars.

				ROCKY
		... Yeah, give 'er the Blades.

INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

Adrian has on skates.  Rocky follows her onto the ice.  He
wears street shoes.
 

									44.


				ADRIAN
		... Aren't you skating?

				ROCKY
		Ain't skated since I was
		fifteen -- That's when I
		started fightin' -- gotta
		watch the ankles.  Yeah,
		fightin' use to be tops with
		me, but no more.  All I wanted
		to prove was I weren't no
		bum -- That I had the stuff to
		make a good pro.

				ADRIAN
		And you never got the chance?

The Cleaner yells from the sideline.

				CLEANER
		Nine minutes!

				ROCKY
		Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still
		fight.  Kinda do it like a
		hobby.  See I'm a natural
		southpaw an' most pugs won't
		fight a southpaw 'cause we
		mess up their timin' an' look
		awkward -- Southpaw means
		lefthanded... But I guess in
		the long run things probably
		worked out for the best, right?

				ADRIAN
		But you never had a chance to
		prove yourself.

				ROCKY
		Absolutely.

				CLEANER
		Eight minutes!

Adrian slips and Rocky breaks her fall.

				ROCKY
		I just dislocated my finger.

				ADRIAN
		Ohh!

				CLEANER
		Seven minutes!
 

									45.


				ROCKY
		It ain't your fault -- I
		originally done it in the Baby
		Crenshaw fight.
			(opens his wallet)
		That's me fightin' Big Baby
		Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the
		size of an airplane an' I
		broke my hands on his head --
		I lost, but it's a nice
		picture, don't ya think?

				CLEANER
		Six!

				ROCKY
		How 'bout some Cokes?

				CLEANER
		Cost ya a buck.

				ROCKY
		This guy is beautiful -- get
		the Cokes.

Adrian does a slight turn and Rocky has to speed up and
nearly falls.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		See, I ain't graceful,
		y'know -- I don't move good --
		Stink as a dancer too -- But I
		can really swat, I hit hard,		real hard, but I'm a southpaw
		an' nobody wants to fight a
		southpaw! -- Havin' a good time?

Adrian nods and is very nervous... The Cleaner moves
carefully across the ice.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Y'know how I got started in
		the fight racket?

				ADRIAN
		By accident?

				CLEANER
		Here -- Three minutes.
 

									46.


				ROCKY
		Yeah -- My ol' man who was
		never the sharpest told me --
		I weren't born with much brain
		so I better use my body.

For the first time, Adrian laughs.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's funny?

				ADRIAN
		My mother told me just the
		opposite.  She said, 'You
		weren't born with much of a
		body so you'd better develop
		your brain.'

				CLEANER
		Time!

The Cleaner walks over as Rocky and Adrian get off the ice.

				CLEANER
			(continuing)
		That's ten bucks.

				ROCKY
		I must be goin' deaf 'cause I
		thought ya said, 'ten cents.'

Rocky hands him a dime.

				CLEANER
			(weakly)
		... How 'bout for the Cokes?

				ROCKY
		Charge it.

Rocky and Adrian start to leave.  Rocky pauses at the door
and fishes into his pocket and hands over eleven dollars.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Had ya goin', didn't I, huh?

He grins and leaves.
 

									47.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

				ROCKY
		Some people are very shy by
		nature.

				ADRIAN
		... I suppose.

				ROCKY
		I would say you're very shy bu
		nature.

				ADRIAN
		... I suppose.

				ROCKY
		Some people think bein' shy is
		a disease, but it don't bother
		me.

				ADRIAN
		It doesn't bother me either.

				ROCKY
		Then why did I bother bringin'
		it up?  'Cause I'm dumb,
		that's why... Y'know, I think
		we make a real sharp coupla
		coconuts -- I'm dumb an'
		you're shy.

				ADRIAN
		... It is just hard for me to
		understand why anybody wants
		to be a fighter.

				ROCKY
		Ya gotta be a little soft to
		wanna be a pug... It's a
		racket where ya' almost
		guaranteed to end up a bum.

				ADRIAN
		I don't think you're a bum.

				ROCKY
		... I'm at least half a bum.
		Yeah, fightin' is a crazy
		racket.  The roughest part is
		the mornin' after.

				ADRIAN
		Morning after?
 

									48.


				ROCKY
		After a rough fight, ya'
		nothin' but a large wound.
		Sometimes I feel like callin'
		a taxi to drive me from my bed
		to the bathroom... Ya' eyes
		hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair
		even hurts... But the thing
		I'm proud of is I been in over
		sixty fights an' never had a
		busted nose -- Bent an'
		twisted an' bitten but never
		broke... That's rare.

				ADRIAN
		Why do you do it if it hurts
		so bad?

				ROCKY
		... Guess.

				ADRIAN
			(pause)
		'Cause you can't sing or dance?

Rocky smiles.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian enter his one-room apartment... She is
nervous and taken aback by the bleakness of the room...
Rocky goes to the icebox.

				ROCKY
		Would ya like a glass of water?

				ADRIAN
		... No thanks.

Adrian looks at the mirror above Rocky's dresser.  She sees
a high school photo of Rocky.  He once was handsome and
smooth-faced... Rocky steps up behind her and his face is
reflected in the mirror.

He turns on his cheap RECORD PLAYER... He reaches into the
turtle bowl.

				ROCKY
		Here's the guys I was tellin'
		ya about -- This is Cuff an'
		Link.

				ADRIAN
		I sold them to you.
 

									49.


				ROCKY
			(very embarrassed)
		... Oh, yeah, I bought the
		whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me
		the turtles, the bowl, an' the
		mountain -- I had to get rid
		of the mountain 'cause they
		kept fallin' off.

				ADRIAN
		Do you have a phone?

				ROCKY
		I had it pulled.  People
		callin' all the time.  Who
		needs it -- Who'd you wanna
		call?

				ADRIAN
		I wanna let my brother know
		where I am.

				ROCKY
		D'you really wanna call?

				ADRIAN
		Yes, I do.

				ROCKY
		You sure?

				ADRIAN
		Yes.

				ROCKY
		Why?

				ADRIAN
		I think he might be worried.

				ROCKY
		I'll call your brother.

Rocky flings open the window and bellows like a foghorn.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		!!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's
		with me!  I'll call ya later.

Rocky closes the window and faces the woman... She is not
smiling.  She looks frightened.
 

									50.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's the matter?  Ya don't
		like the room?

				ADRIAN
		It's fine.

				ROCKY
		It's only temporary.

				ADRIAN
		It's not that --

				ROCKY
		What's the problem?  You don't
		like me -- Don't like the
		turtles -- What is it?

				ADRIAN
		I don't think I belong here.

				ROCKY
		It's okay.

				ADRIAN
		No, I don't belong here.

				ROCKY
		It's all right -- You're my
		guest.

				ADRIAN
		... I've never been in a man's
		apartment before.

				ROCKY
			(gesturing)
		They're all the same.

				ADRIAN
		I'm not sure I know you well
		enough -- I don't think I'm
		comfortable.

				ROCKY
		Yo, I'm not comfortable either.

				ADRIAN
			(standing)
		I should leave.
 

									51.


				ROCKY
		But I'm willin' to make the
		best of this uncomfortable
		situation.

Adrian moves to the door... Rocky intercepts her.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; softly)
		Would ya take off your glasses?

				ADRIAN
			(dumbstruck)
		What?

				ROCKY
		The glasses... Please.

Rocky removes her glasses and looks deeply into her eyes.

				ADRIAN
			(timidly)
		... T-thank you.

				ROCKY
		Do me another favor?

				ADRIAN
		... What?

				ROCKY
		Could ya take off that hat.

After a moment, Adrian removes the hat... She is becoming
rather pretty.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I always knew you was pretty.

				ADRIAN
		Don't tease me.

The woman melts into the corner and begins lightly sobbing...
Rocky steps forward and fences her with his arms and body.

				ROCKY
		I wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't
		have to kiss me back if ya
		don't feel like it.

Rocky softly kisses the woman... Her arms hang limp.  He
puts more passion into the kiss and she starts to respond.
Her hand glides like smoke up his back.
 

									52.


She embraces his neck.  The dam of passion erupts.  She
gives herself freely for the first time in thirty years.

EXT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

The following day, Rocky strolls down the street to
Goldmill's Gym... Out front a group of young blacks stop
talking and study Rocky as he passes.  Rocky's eyebrows knit
in confusion.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

Rocky climbs the stairs and enters the gym...

... In a matter of seconds, his presence is known and the
athletes stare in wonderment... The big black heavyweight
contender, Dipper, throws down his towel in disgust and
turns away.

Mike quietly approaches Rocky.

				MIKE
		Hey, Rock -- What happened?

				ROCKY
		'Bout what?

Mickey Goldmill steps out of his office...

				MICKEY
		Did ya get the message, kid?

				ROCKY
		Message -- What message?

Mickey pulls out a card from his breast pocket... He hands
it to Rocky.

				MICKEY
		A Rep from Miles Jergens'
		Promotions was lookin' for
		ya -- They need sparrin'
		partners for Creed.

				ROCKY
		Ya puttin' me on?

				MICKEY
		Here's the card?

				ROCKY
		When was they here?
 

									53.


				MICKEY
		'Bout an hour ago.

				ROCKY
		Probably lookin' for sparrin'
		partners.

				MICKEY
		... I said that before.

Rocky turns from Mickey and jogs out of the gym.  Mickey
fumbles with his rosary beads.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		... Waste of life.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY

Rocky steps off a bus in mid-town Philadelphia.  He hurries
down Broad Street.  Every few steps he breaks into a trot...
He enters a skyscraper.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - HALL - DAY

Rocky exits the elevator and enters the office of Miles
Jergens' Productions.

INT. JERGENS' PRODUCTIONS - DAY

The SECRETARY is slightly startled by Rocky's excited
expression.

				SECRETARY
		May I help you?

Rocky hands her the business card.

				SECRETARY
			(continuing)
		Your name, please?

				ROCKY
		Balboa, Rocky Balboa.

The Secretary rises and enters Jergens' office... Rocky eyes
the multitude of sporting pictures hanging on all four walls.

The Secretary returns.

				SECRETARY
		You may go in.

Rocky collects himself and enters...
 

									54.


INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

Miles Jergens warmly greets him.

				JERGENS
		Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles
		Jergens -- Please, have a seat.

				ROCKY
		... Thanks.

				JERGENS
		Mr. Balboa --

				ROCKY
			(overriding)
		Rocky.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, do you have any
		representation?  A manager?

				ROCKY
		No -- Just me.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, would you be interested
		in --

				ROCKY
		Sparrin'?

				JERGENS
		Excuse me.

				ROCKY
		I know ya need sparrin'
		partners -- I'm very available.

				JERGENS
		I'm sure you are.

				ROCKY
		Absolutely -- Sparrin' with
		the Champ would be an honor --
		y'know what?

				JERGENS
		What?

				ROCKY
		I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
		I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
 

									55.


Jergens seems very amused.  He lights a cigar.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, would you be interested
		in fighting Apollo Creed for
		the Championship?

				ROCKY
		... Like I said, I'd make a
		boss sparrin' mate.

				JERGENS
		Did you hear what I said?

				ROCKY
		Sure, an' I'm smart enough to
		know that no sparrin' partner
		should take cheap shots at the
		Champ.  He's just there to
		help condition the man.

				JERGENS
		Not spar, I'm asking whether
		you would be interested in
		fighting Creed for the
		championship.

The weight of the statement comes crashing down in Rocky.
For a long moment he becomes nothing more than a basket case
as he ponders the statement... He half regains his senses.

				ROCKY
		... Ah... Absolutely.

The SCENE FADES and becomes a black and white television.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian are at her home watching an old black and
white television... Rocky smiles... The film now cuts to
Apollo being interviewed.

				REPORTER #1
		How'd you like the 'City of
		Brotherly Love?'

				APOLLO
		I like my Philadelphia Brothers.
		An' I'm patriotic!

Apollo has to move to the side to avoid a thrusting
microphone.
 

									56.


				APOLLO
			(continuing;
			mock seriousness)
		If yo' don't back up I'm gonna
		send yo' home with a microphone
		in yo' nose!

The Reporters laugh.

				REPORTER #2
		Why did you agree to fight a
		man who has virtually no
		chance of winning?

				APOLLO
		If history proves one thing,
		everybody gotta chance --
		Didn't yo' all ever hear of
		David an' Goliath? -- 'Course
		I woulda knocked out Goliath.

				REPORTER #3
		It is a coincidence that
		you're fighting a white man on
		the most celebrated day in the
		country's history?

				APOLLO
		The same coincidence that he's
		fightin' a black man.

				REPORTER #1
		What're your feelings about
		the challenger?

				APOLLO
		He's Italian.

				REPORTER #1
		What does that mean?

				APOLLO
		It means if he can't fight, I
		bet he can cook!

Rocky and Adrian laugh at the interview... Paulie, her
brother, takes offense.

				PAULIE
		Do me a favor -- His lungs,
		punch 'em out.

				ADRIAN
		Paul.
 

									57.


Rocky's interview now fills the screen.  Rocky squints and
looks nervous under the hot lights.

				REPORTER #2
		This is your largest payday
		ever -- How do you feel about
		it?

				ROCKY
		Feel?  I dunno... Happy.

				REPORTER #2
		How will you fight Apollo Creed?

				ROCKY
			(mind elsewhere)
		Creed's great, ain't he...
		I'll do what I can.

				REPORTER #1
		Where did you get the name,
		'Italian Stallion?'

				ROCKY
		I thought of it 'bout eight
		years ago, when I was eatin'
		dinner.

				REPORTER #2
		Is it true the most you've
		ever made in a prizefight is
		five hundred dollars?

				ROCKY
		Four hundred -- But that was a
		long time ago.

				REPORTER #2
		And now your payday will be
		one hundred and fifty thousand
		dollars.  Any comment?

				ROCKY
		Listen, I wanna say hi to my
		girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!

Adrian blushes and laughs.

				ADRIAN
		Oh, Rocky!

				PAULIE
			(dry)
		Christ.
 

									58.


				ADRIAN
		You didn't!

				ROCKY
		Sure I did.  You heard.

They continue to watch the remainder of the interview... The
head COMMENTATOR is looking directly into the camera.

				COMMENTATOR
		A Bicentennial Fight --
		January first.  It will be the
		first sporting event on our
		two hundredth birthday and is
		already being called by many
		the greatest farce in sports
		history.  If this man lasts
		more than a minute I would say
		he's on borrowed time.
			(sarcastically)
		It's matches like this with
		their exorbitant prices that
		give sports a bad name -- Not
		only is this match bad,
		people, it's sad!  Why a Rocky
		Balboa?  At the State Athletic
		Commission, Larry Duggan
		reporting.

				PAULIE
			(irate)
		The guy's a friggin' moron.

				ROCKY
		Why?

				PAULIE
		Don't it matter none he's
		makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd
		break his lips.

				ROCKY
		It don't matter.

				PAULIE
		He's takin' cheap shots.

				ROCKY
		It don't bother me none.

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be
		lookin' for people to help,
		right?
 

									59.


				ROCKY
		Help what?

				PAULIE
		Y'know, to help keep ya livin'
		clean.

				ROCKY
		I'll do okay.

				PAULIE
		Ya gotta have a guy help ya
		exercise, mebbe somebody to be
		standin' by with a towel or
		run errands, y'know.

				ROCKY
		Hey, who cared about me
		yesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I
		think I'm gonna train myself.

				PAULIE
		Without havin' good people
		around, ya won't have such a
		good chance.

Adrian is not happy with her brother's overbearing attitude.
She faces him.

				ADRIAN
		Einstein flunked out of
		school... twice.

				PAULIE
		That so.

				ADRIAN
		Roosevelt finished last in his
		class -- Beethoven was deaf,
		an' Helen Keller was blind --
		I think Rocky has a good chance.

INT. HALLWAY OF PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky stands in Adrian's doorway.  He kisses her.

				ROCKY
		See ya tomorrow.

Rocky moves down the stairway and continues to do so as he
converses with Adrian who remains upstairs.  His VOICE
ECHOES up the stairwell.
 

									60.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		How'd ya like hearin' ya name
		on TV?

				ADRIAN
		I don't know -- I was shocked.
		Why did you do that?

				ROCKY
		Ya puttin' me on, right?

				ADRIAN
			(smiles)
		Absolutely -- What time should
		I expect you?

				ROCKY
		'Bout seven.

				ADRIAN
		I'll be waiting.

Rocky is now on the ground floor yelling up to Adrian on the
top floor landing.

				ROCKY
		Y'know how I said that stuff
		on television didn't bother me?

				ADRIAN
		Yes.

				ROCKY
		It did.

As Rocky completes the last word, he exits the building and
slams the door which RESOUNDS throughout the apartment house.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT

Gazzo, the bodyguard, and Rocky are standing out front.
They are eating hot sandwiches.

				ROCKY
		Y'know I won't be able to work
		for ya no more.

				GAZZO
		Hey -- if a good man can make
		a better life, let him make it.

				ROCKY
		I feel bad about walkin'.
 

									61.


				GAZZO
		Take your shot, kid -- You got
		money for trainin' expenses?

				ROCKY
		A few bucks.

Gazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills.

				GAZZO
		Here's five hundred -- Put it
		in your glove.

				ROCKY
		Do I have to pay juice?

Gazzo looks at the Bodyguard and shakes his head as if to
imply, "Why's this guy asking such a foolish question?"

Gazzo and the bodyguard step to the white Caddy parked at
the curb.  They enter the cab.  Rocky watches.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		Does Santa Claus charge juice?
		Merry Christmas -- Now, how's
		about my present, ya gonna win?

				ROCKY
		Gonna try.

				GAZZO
		Listen, kid, I'm with ya.  Ya
		know, I'm with ya -- Italian,
		we're blood.  You kill this
		rug -- We Guinneas gotta show
		these Afro-Americans where
		it's at.  Give it your best
		shot cause I want ya to prove
		to these bums on the corner
		that my man can't be beat by
		this rug... Ya got any action
		on the side.

				ROCKY
		No action.

				GAZZO
		Ya gettin 150 grand killer.
		Ya got any plans for it?
		Whatta ya think?
				(MORE)
 

									62.


				GAZZO (CONT'D)
		Ya like to put it on the
		street, make it work for ya?

				ROCKY
		I'm gonna do somethin with it.

				GAZZO
		Sure, you do what ya want.
		Stay away from the stock market.

				ROCKY
		Black market?

				GAZZO
		Same thing.  Ya know, Rock,
		remember when we was kids, we
		fought together.  An' I wasn't
		well an' ya had to beat up
		that Irish kid -- what's his
		name? -- Gallager -- I bought
		a suit and became a businessman.
		You put on gloves.  An' I
		remember Mama almost cried,
		may she rest in peace -- an'
		our ol' man who said ya had no
		brains -- I'd like to lay
		hands on that bastard.  You
		ain't never had any luck.
		Even when I owned you in '66
		you never had luck.  But now I
		think you might be gettin'
		some luck kid.  Whatta you
		think?

Rocky smiles and Gazzo gets into his car.  Rocky follows him
across the street.

				ROCKY
		Yo, you gonna show, Tony?

				GAZZO
		Where else am I gonna go.
			(to Bodyguard)
		Bet three grand on Rocky.

				BODYGUARD
		He's a bum -- are you kiddin?

				GAZZO
			(slaps Bodyguard)
		No!  I'm not kiddin!

Rocky walks away.
 

									63.


INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky returns home and enters his apartment.  After turning
on the light, he flips on his RECORD PLAYER.  He now feeds
the turtles.

				ROCKY
		Look who's home!

Rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold.  He
approaches them with a sense of awe.  He opens and reads one.
Settling on the bed, he reads the other.

A KNOCK is HEARD.  Rocky opens the door.  Mickey Goldmill,
the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway.

				MICKEY
			(stiffly)
		I seen the light.  I figure
		somebody was home.

				ROCKY
		Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin'
		here?  Here, sit down.

Rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Best seat in the house -- Hey,
		Mick, this is too much.

				MICKEY
		How do you mean?

				ROCKY
		I'm usta seein' ya at the gym,
		but seein' ya here, in my
		house, it's kinda outta joint.

By the manner in which Goldmill listens, it is obvious
something important is preying on his mind.

Rocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at
having outsiders see how he lives.

				MICKEY
		Listen, Rock, you're a very
		lucky guy.

				ROCKY
		Yeah.
 

									64.


				MICKEY
		What's happened is freak luck.

				ROCKY
		Freak luck for sure.

				MICKEY
		Look at all them other fighters.
		Real good boys.  Good records.
		Colorful.  Fight their hearts
		out for peanuts -- But who
		cared?  Nobody.  They got it
		shoved in their back door.
		Nobody ever give them a shot
		at the title...

				ROCKY
			(uneasy)
		Freak luck is a strange thing.

Mickey does not hear.  His attention is drawn to the turtles.

				MICKEY
		Whatta' those?

				ROCKY
		Turtles -- domestic turtles.

				MICKEY
			(businesslike)
		I'm here tellin' ya to be very
		smart with this shot.  Like
		the Bible sez, ya don't get no
		second chance.

Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Ya need a manager.  An advisor.
		I been in the racket fifty
		years.  I done it all, there
		ain't nothin' about the world
		of pugilism that ain't livin'
		up here.

He lights a half-smoked cigar.

				ROCKY
			(at a loss)
		Fifty years, huh.
 

									65.


				MICKEY
			(stronger)
		Fifty years.  The rep is known
		around Philly, an' a good rep
		can't be bought, but I don't
		have to tell you that.

				ROCKY
		How 'bout a glass of water?

				MICKEY
		Rocky, d'ya know what I done?

				ROCKY
			(uneasy)
		... What?

				MICKEY
			(driving each
			word hard)
		I done it all.  I've done an'
		seen everything'.  Believe
		what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya
		shoulda seen the night in
		Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny'
		Russo outta the ring, September
		14, 1923 -- same night Firpo
		knocked Dempsey outta the ring.
		But who got the Press?  He did.
		He had a manager -- September
		14, 1923.

				ROCKY
			(softly)
		Ya got a good mind for dates.

Mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second.

				MICKEY
		Look at this face -- twenty-
		one stitches over the left
		eye, thirty-four over the
		right -- my nose was busted
		seventeen times, the last
		being the Sailor Mike fight
		New Year's Eve, 1940, in
		Camden, New Jersey -- What a
		professional pastin' I give
		him.  Here, read about it.
				(MORE)
 

									66.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
			(shows a tiny
			press clipping;
			points to
			cauliflower ear)
		An' he give me the vegetable
		on the ear.  I got pain an'
		experience... an' you got
		heart -- kinda remind me of
		Marciano, ya do.

Rocky points to his most prized possession.

				ROCKY
		Nobody ever said that --
		There's his picture.

				MICKEY
		Yeah, ya kinda remind me of
		the Rock.  Ya move like 'im.

Mickey has rung the bell.  Nothing could please Rocky more
than being compared to his idol.

				ROCKY
		Really think so?

				MICKEY
		Ya got heart.

				ROCKY
		Heart, but I ain't got no
		Tocker.

Rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a
crouch.

				MICKEY
		Christ, I know this business.
		Rocky, when I was fightin' it
		was the dirtiest racket goin',
		see.  Pugs like me was treated
		like fightin' dogs -- throw ya
		in the pit an' for ten bucks
		ya try to kill each other.  We
		had no management...
				(MORE)
 

									67.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
		fought in boxcars, in
		whorehouse basements, any
		joint with a floor -- October
		1931 I fought a bum who put a
		tack in the thumb of his glove
		an' punched so many holes in
		my face I had spit shootin'
		outta my cheeks -- I never had
		no manager watchin' out for
		me -- See that picture outside
		the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,'
		that's me in my prime.  I had
		all the tools.  I coulda
		starched any lightweight husky
		on the East Coast -- But I had
		no management.  Nobody ever
		got to know how slick I was,
		but I had a head for business
		an' stashed a few bucks an'
		opened the gym -- It's a dirt
		hole, I know it, but that an'
		a lotta scars is what I got to
		show for fifty years in the
		business, kid -- now you come
		along with this shot an' I
		feel like it's me gettin' the
		shot I never got... Yeah, we
		was treated like dogs -- like
		them Dago's, no offense, in
		the Colosseum in Rome there --
		An' now I got all this
		knowledge, I wanna give it to
		ya so I can protect ya an'
		make sure ya get the best deal
		ya can!

Rocky rises and opens a window.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Respect, I always dished ya
		respect.

				ROCKY
		... Ya gave Dipper my locker.

				MICKEY
			(almost begging)
		I'm sorry, I -- I made a
		mistake.  Kid, I'm askin' man
		to man.  I wanna be ya manager.
 

									68.


				ROCKY
		The fight's set -- I don't
		need a manager.

				MICKEY
		Look, you can't buy what I
		know.  Ya can't.  I've seen it
		all!  I got pain an' I got
		experience.

				ROCKY
		I got pain an' experience too.

				MICKEY
		Please, kid.

				ROCKY
			(tightly)
		Whatever I got, I always got
		on the slide.  This shot's no
		different.  I didn't earn
		nothin' -- I got it on the
		slide... I needed ya help
		about ten years ago when I was
		startin', but ya never helped
		me none.

Mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up... He
remains on one knee.

				MICKEY
		If ya was wantin' my help, why
		didn't ya ask?  Just ask.

				ROCKY
		I asked, but ya never helped
		nothin'! -- Like the Bible
		sez, ya don't get no second
		chance.

				MICKEY
			(yells)
		Rocky, I'm seventy-six years
		old.  Maybe you can be the
		winner I never was -- your
		shot is my last shot!

Rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the
door.

Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves.

Several moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself
into bed.  Springing up a second later, he runs outside.
 

									69.


EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form
of Mickey.  Way in the distance, we SEE Rocky stop the old
man beneath a street lamp.  He places an arm around his
shoulder.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

The following morning, Rocky's ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF at
exactly four A.M.  Not accustomed to rising this early, with
great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to
the bathroom.  He turns the light on and roaches scatter.

At the top of the mirror hang the telegrams.  Rocky fills
the basin and submerges his face in cold water.

Rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs.  He
cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one
swill... his body quivers.

EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

Rocky steps outside.  He is dressed in a well-worn sweat
suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers.  It is pitch dark and
his steaming breath attests to the cold.

He begins running down the center of the deserted street.
He can only be clearly SEEN as his form passes beneath the
street lamps.

Two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass.

EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAWN

Rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight
of stairs.  He stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear
into the morning gray.  Taking a deep breath, he starts up.
From the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his
legs give way.  Standing, he brushes off and descends the
stairs.

EXT. CITY HALL - DAWN

Rocky passes City Hall and veers to the river.  He pauses,
heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths.  He throws several
lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his
aching sides.  Men delivering the morning papers observe
with amusement.

Rocky forces himself to begin running again.
 

									70.


EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN STATION - DAWN

Heading along Spring Garden Street, Rocky passes beneath an
elevated train station.  The ROARING TRAIN overhead seems to
blend perfectly with his muscular running style.

EXT. DOCKS - DAWN

The sky is beginning to lighten.  The fighter now runs along
the piers and past anchored freighters.

EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

It is five-thirty and Rocky approaches the loading platform
belonging to Eastern Packing Company.  Alongside the loading
platform come several boxcars.

Rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door.  It soon
opens and Paulie guides him inside.  Paulie is drunk.

INT. SHIPPING OFFICE - DAY

				PAULIE
		How ya feelin'?

				ROCKY
			(panting)
		... Tight.

				PAULIE
		I got whiskey here.

				ROCKY
		... No.

Rocky notices TWO PUERTO RICANS lounging alongside theshipping office.

				PAULIE
		This is the guy who's fightin'
		Apollo Creed.

				JOSE
			(heavy accent)
		Good luck -- Kill him, man.

				PAULIE
			(as though
			rehearsed badly)
		Hip -- Hip -- Hooray!  C'mon --
		Hip -- Hip --
 

									71.


				JOSE
			(walks away)
		Hooray, man.

				PAULIE
		Rock'll be comin' by every
		mornin' to pick up some
		Prime -- can't train on that
		store crap.

Rocky smiles and Paulie leads him out of the office and to
the large metal door of a walk-in refrigerator.

INT. FREEZER - DAY

They enter.  The freezer resembles a modern torture chamber...
row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the
darkness to the far end of the refrigerator.  The blower
overhead causes the men to speak loudly.

				PAULIE
			(teasing)
		If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end
		up hangin' on the hook, right?

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's a good man.

				PAULIE
		How 'bout you talk to 'em
		about me?
			(tightly)
		Please do me that favor.

				ROCKY
		Keep this job, ya eat better.

Paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat.  He
swills whiskey from a pint bottle.

				PAULIE
		Y'know, d'ya think you an' my
		sister -- Ah, doin' good
		together?

				ROCKY
		Whatta you think?

				PAULIE
		Ain't sure, what's the story?

				ROCKY
		What?
 

									72.


				PAULIE
		The story -- what's happenin'?

Paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for
quite a while.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Ya really like her?

				ROCKY
		Sure I like her.

				PAULIE
			(nervous laughter)
		What's the attraction?  I
		don't see it?

				ROCKY
		I dunno -- she fills gaps.

				PAULIE
		What gaps?

				ROCKY
			(shrugs and
			takes meat)
		She got gaps.  I got gaps --
		together we fill the gaps.

				PAULIE
			(sharply)
		You ballin' her?

				ROCKY
			(turns around)
		Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
		sister.

				PAULIE
			(tersely)
		C'mon, ya screwin' her?

From across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes.

				ROCKY
		That's why I can't put ya
		together with Gazzo, cause ya
		talk too much -- big mouth.

Paulie reddens.  He steps forward and slams his fists in a
hanging beef.
 

									73.


The punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky
responds.

Rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs.

The grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging
corpse.  Rocky moves to the next one and hooks.

Rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as
though he were locked in total battle.

				PAULIE
		Hit the rump.  The rump!
		Ya'll break the ribs!

Rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of
beef.  Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every
punch, like he were receiving it.  Rocky moves into the dark
recess of the refrigerator.  Only the dull SOUNDS of his
POUNDING FISTS can be HEARD.

Rocky works his way to Paulie again.  Every hanging beef
swings and appears surrealistically alive.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		We do that to Creed an'
		they'll take us to jail for
		murder.

Rocky looks at his hands.  They are drenched in red up to
the elbows with beef blood.

Paulie hands him a package of beef.

				ROCKY
		Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
		sister.

Rocky takes the package and runs out.  Paulie's bleary eyes
reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

The gym is filled to capacity.  The NOISE is DEAFENING.
Rocky pounds a heavy bag.

Mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his
pocket.
 

									74.


				MICKEY
			(passionate)
		Stop!  Stop!  I can't stand it!
		It's clumsy.  You're off
		balance.

He motions to his bullish helper, Mike.  He hands him the
string.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Tie it to both ankles -- Leave
		two feet slack.

				ROCKY
		I never had good footwork.

Mike completes the task.

				MICKEY
		Forget the footwork -- You're
		off balance.  The legs are
		sticking everywhere.  Marciano
		had the same problem, an' the
		string cured it.  When you can
		hit and move without breakin'
		the string you'll have balance.

				MIKE
		You'll be a very dangerous
		person.

Two young boys in street clothes interrupt Mickey.

				BOY
		Rocky, could we have your
		autograph?

				ROCKY
		... Sure.

				MICKEY
			(irate)
		Don't you boys ever interrupt
		when I'm conductin' business,
		or I'll kill you both -- Go
		away.

The boys depart.
 

									75.


				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Autographs!  Ya wanna be a
		writer or a fighter?  Let's
		work.

Mike looks off across the gym.

				MIKE
		... we got visitors.

Mickey strains his eyes to see a group of REPORTERS and NEWS
CAMERAMEN entering his gym.

				MICKEY
			(approaching)
		Can I help you guys?

				REPORTER
			(to Cameraman)
		Set the camera up over there.
			(to Mickey)
		We're from Channel Seven --
		Covering the pre-fight training.

				MICKEY
		I own the place.

The Reporter has a hundred things on his mind... he turns
from Mickey and nods to his crew... the other television
crews rush to set up.

				CAMERAMAN
		Rolling here.

				SOUND MAN
		Speed here.

				REPORTER
			(to the camera)
		We're here at Goldmill's
		Gym -- A Philadelphia landmark
		of sorts since 1929 -- The
		stench of toil permeates every
		corner.  The sweat a trademark
		of a unique profession... Yet,
		the most unique fixture is an
		unprecedented 50 to 1 underdog
		heavyweight named, Rocky Balboa.

The camera turns to Rocky.
 

									76.


				ROCKY
			(to Mickey)
		Should I do this?

Mickey nods and Rocky faces the glaring lights.

				REPORTER
		So much has happened lately --
		Has it changed your life style
		much?

				ROCKY
		... People talk to me more.

				REPORTER
		How're you preparing for this
		Bicentennial bout?

A young punchy fighter yells out:

				FIGHTER
		Readin' fuckin' history books,
		man!

The gym explodes with laughter.

				REPORTER
			(flushed)
		We can cut that out later.
		Apollo Creed says he'll let
		you stay three rounds before
		he puts you away.

				ROCKY
			(honestly)
		Apollo's a great fighter.

				REPORTER
		Do you feel you have a chance?

				ROCKY
		Maybe --

He faces Mickey.  Mickey whispers in his ear.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I'll tear his head off.

				REPORTER
		Do you have anything derogatory
		to say about the Champion?
 

									77.


				ROCKY
		Derogatory?  Yeah, he's great.

Apollo Creed and his entourage enter the gym.

				APOLLO
			(bellowing)
		I am the Champion of the whole
		world!!!

The gym freezes... everyone turns and stares in wonderment...
Mickey Goldmill shakes his head in disbelief.  He now
realizes it is a publicity stunt.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
			(approaching Rocky)
		Italian Stallion, I come over
		to tell you to be very smart
		an' after this fight donate
		what's gonna be left of your
		body to science, cause after
		this fight what's left won't
		fill a tuna fish can!... So
		beware, Mon Cher!!!

Apollo turns to the cameras... Rocky is speechless.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		This classic fight -- Tha's
		right, this bicentennial
		fight's goin' down in the
		history books 'cause January
		first I'm gonna be the first
		man to bounce another man offa
		the planet Pluto!

Dipper stands in the far ring... the attention Rocky is
receiving makes him a killer.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		Now I gots a special
		announcement, y'hear.  For the
		first time in alotta years
		this championship fight is
		gonna be on your home T.V.!
		Free -- 'Course that's just
		for Philly -- My present to
		the city...

									78.


				APOLLO (CONT'D)
		Now some ya'll ain't much on
		likin' me, but ya gotta admit
		Apollo Creed is one DAMN
		generous, 100% pure, government
		inspected, Afro-American Folk
		Hero!!!

Everyone laughs... Dipper moves across the room like a large
snake.  He brushes people aside and steps behind Rocky.  He
nudges him... Rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it.

Dipper pushes harder and Rocky looks questioningly at him.

				DIPPER
			(loud)
		Ya nothin', Boy!

Apollo stops his sales pitch in mid-sentence... The
television crew faces Dipper.

				DIPPER
			(continuing)
		I say ya nothin'!

				MICKEY
		What's happenin' here?

				DIPPER
		I'm happenin'!  This pig is
		takin' my shot -- I iz a
		contender.  He's nothin'.

				ROCKY
			(dumbstruck)
		Yo', Dipper, why're ya --

				DIPPER
			(shaking his fist)
		Spar me in front of these here
		TV dudes -- I knock ya ass to
		Jersey!

Dipper's fat black trainer holds out his hands and Dipper
slaps them soul style.

				MICKEY
			(to Dipper)
		You can forget about sparring,
		kid.

				DIPPER
		Yo' know I iz the best man
		here!  Yo' said so yoself!
 

									79.


				MICKEY
			(almost
			apologetically
			to the crew)
		Why let Rocky here take a
		chance on cuttin' or breakin'
		a hand? -- Take a shower,
		Dipper.

				DIPPER
		Don't mouth me, old man, I'll
		knock yo' out too.  C'mon,
		wop, spar me, let everybody
		see who's got the heat around
		here.

Silence looms over the gym... Apollo is apprehensive.  The
scene is becoming too real.  The frightened television crew
slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment.

				DIPPER
			(continuing; insanely)
		Man, yo' best keep them
		cameras out!  Fight me, boy!
		Let Creed here see the kind of
		punk he's fightin'!

Mike forces his way through the crowd and stands behind Rocky.

				MIKE
		Don't chance it, man -- He's
		sick.

				MICKEY
		This is gettin' outta hand --
		Rocky will fight in the ring
		January first, not here!

				DIPPER
		Yo' yellow, old man.

				MICKEY
		Not yellow, cautious.
			(to the crew)
		See, it's very easy for a
		fighter to accidentally hurt --

Dipper suddenly steps forward and slaps Rocky very hard
across the side of the head... The gym becomes stone cold.
Dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it.
 

									80.


				DIPPER
		If yo're afraid to fight me,
		then get down an' kiss my
		feet, boy.

Mickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds
before the blood will run... Rocky stands motionless.

				MICKEY
			(softly)
		Let's take a walk, Rock.
		Please, don't take a chance.
		He wants to hurt you so you
		can't fight.

Rocky swallows his pride.  He still has the string around
his ankles.  He starts to shuffle away with Mickey... Dipper
steps forward and viciously slaps Rocky again.

Mike jumps forward.

				MIKE
		Why you tryin' to cut 'im, man!
		Back off, scumbag, or I'll
		bite your face!

Dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks Mike flat.  The
room reeks of fear... Apollo's eyes flick back and forth
between Rocky and Dipper.  Apollo taps his bodyguards and
they begin to ease away.

				DIPPER
		... Now, boy, kiss my feet.

Rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor.  He shuffles
forward and stands before Dipper.

				DIPPER
			(continuing;
			almost in a whisper)
		... Kiss 'em.

Rocky looks at Mickey, then lowers his eyes to Dipper's
feet... Dipper smiles.  Rocky starts to bend towards the
shoes.  Without warning, he explodes with a pair of
combinations into Dipper's exposed ribs.  A CRACK is HEARD
and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... The room
is silent except for Dipper's moaning.

Apollo is stunned by the scene.  The gym has become a very
gloomy place.  He eyes Rocky with admiration and a hint of
apprehension... He leaves.
 

									81.


Mickey is the first one to shake off the chill... He shakes
his fists at the Reporters, and puts his arm around Rocky.

				MICKEY
		The kid's got cannons -- Print
		that.

The crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken
figure lying on a dirty gym floor.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

They enter the dismal apartment... On the floor are at least
ten telegrams.  Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside.
Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams.
				ADRIAN
		Don't you open them anymore?

				ROCKY
		They either say, 'Kill the
		nigger' or 'Hope you die,
		Honky.' -- What ya got in the
		bag?

Adrian steps to the window.  She pulls a pair of short but
lovely curtains from a shopping bag... The colorful curtains
glare in the dark room.

				ADRIAN
		Like?

				ROCKY
		Sharp -- Real nice.

				ADRIAN
		Really -- You don't think
		they're overly feminine?

				ROCKY
		No... Sharp -- You look great.

Adrian smiles and pulls out a small Christmas wreath...
Rocky smiles.  His eyes show what he feels for this woman.

				ROCKY
		Adrian, you really look great,
		y'know -- But I can't fool
		around durin' trainin' --
		makes the legs weak.

				ADRIAN
		Don't want weak legs.
 

									82.


				ROCKY
		Can't fool around -- You look
		very great.

				ADRIAN
		-- The legs.

				ROCKY
		Yeah... But I think weak legs
		ain't bad sometimes, y'know.

Rocky approaches in a seductive manner.  Adrian
uncharacteristically removes her sweater.  Underneath is a
T-shirt that reads "Win, Rocky, Win."

				ADRIAN
		I thought it might be cute.

				ROCKY
		Ya right --
			(laughs)
		Mebbe we best just hold
		hands -- the shirt made me
		feel guilty, y'know.

SCENE FADES.

EXT. STREET - PRE-DAWN

Rocky is running... for extra weight he carries his huge
dog, Butkus.  After a half a block he sags under the weight,
and laughing, begins to wrestle with the dog on the
pavement... Rocky tries to sneak away from the dog, but
after a few steps the beast sees him and chases him down the
street.

EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

It is early morning and as usual Rocky jogs to the meathouse.
He is followed by his new dog, Butkus.  He is stopped short
when he notices several television news vans parked out front.

INT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

He and the dog enter the freezer area and see several
reporters and men with mini-cameras milling around... Paulie
is waiting for him -- Rocky is upset and goes outside.
Paulie follows.
 

									83.


EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock.  I made a few phone
		calls an' thanks to me ya
		goin' to be a big man --
		Thatta dog?

				ROCKY
		Whatta these guys want?

				PAULIE
		To see ya train.

				ROCKY
		Yo, what's with you? -- It was
		suppose to be private.

				PAULIE
		I thought I was doin' ya a
		favor -- C'mon inside --
		Y'know, my sister really likes
		ya.

Rocky follows Paulie inside.

INT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAY

A REPORTER points in Rocky's direction and suddenly he is
surrounded and led into the freezer area and positioned
beside a slab of hanging beef.  The camera lights go on.

				COMMENTATOR
		Just relax, Mr. Balboa --
			(to the camera)
		Today we're here with
		heavyweight challenger, Rocky
		Balboa.  The reason we are
		standing in a refrigerated box
		is that Mr. Balboa has an
		unusual method of training and
		in a moment he is going to
		demonstrate it for our viewing
		audience -- But first, Rocky,
		how did you ever come to train
		in an icebox?

				ROCKY
		Ah -- My buddy Paulie let me
		in one day an' I hit the beef
		here an' liked it -- An' since
		I become a challenger, the
		owner don't mind neither.
 

									84.


				COMMENTATOR
		Is this a common training
		method -- I mean do other
		fighters pound raw meat?

				ROCKY
		I think me and Paulie invented
		it.

				COMMENTATOR
		Would you give us a
		demonstration?

Rocky steps over to a hanging beef and begins pounding with
incredible intensity... Everyone present is taken aback.
Rocky completes hitting the meat and stands there with his
hands dripping beef blood.

The Commentator is unnerved and Rocky looks straight into
the camera lens and holds up his bloody fists.

				COMMENTATOR
		... Diane Lewis in the
		meathouse with the Southpaw,
		Rocky Balboa.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

Apollo sits behind Jergens' desk.  Jergens is not present.
Four middle-aged and younger types and Creed's lawyer sit
around the desk.  The desk is flowing with forms and charts.

				APOLLO
		How much is being channeled
		into West Coast closed-circuit
		advertising?

				LAWYER
		Three hundred thousand.

				APOLLO
		Make it four hundred an' fifty.
			(to younger man)
		Send two hundred roses to the
		mayor's wife from me, get a
		picture an' make sure it gets
		all the papers.

				BUSINESSMAN #3
		Do ya want to run the fifteen
		radio spots in the mid-west?
		I think you could spend the
		money better in Canadian
		publicity.
 

									85.


				APOLLO
		Yeah, I'd like to get Canada --
		see, if we can get a tax
		break -- Gimme the figures on
		the Program Concession.

Meanwhile, the trainer sits across the room in a darkened
corner looking at a small television.  He is watching
Rocky's bloody exhibition on the news...

He waves at Apollo.

				TRAINER
			(worried)
		Apollo, you oughta come see
		this boy you're gonna fight on
		TV -- looks like he means
		business.

Apollo is still engrossed in his paperwork.

				APOLLO
		I mean business, too --
			(to men)
		The gross rental of the arena
		is gonna include the four
		hundred ushers, right? --
		Gimme some coffee.

EXT. PAULIE'S STREET - NIGHT

It is a moonless night and Paulie staggers across the street
and enters his building... He staggers up the stairs.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paulie removes his coat and tosses it listlessly in a
chair... He rubs his red eyes and sways into the kitchen.

He takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox.  As he swills
the wine he hears the SOUND of Rocky's and Adrian's VOICES
traveling from his sister's room.  Paulie's face tightens
and he staggers towards the bedroom.

He stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a
crack... Rocky, Adrian, and the dog are watching TV in the
otherwise darkened room.

				ADRIAN
		... And he called the
		reporters --

				ROCKY
		Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
 

									86.


				ADRIAN
		Don't be mad at him -- He just
		wants to help.

				ROCKY
		Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just
		outta joint when reporters are
		around -- They take cheap
		shots an' Paulie knows it.

				ADRIAN
		... Are you going to say
		anything to him?

				ROCKY
		... What's to say?  I dunno
		what he wants from me --

Filled with uncontrollable anger, Paulie smashes into the
room.

				PAULIE
		Nothin'!  I want nothin' from
		you!!!

				ADRIAN
		Paulie!

				PAULIE
		Shutup!  I want nothin' -- I
		ain't no charity case!  Get
		outta my house!

				ADRIAN
		It's not your house --

				PAULIE
		You ain't no friend no more --
		Go home!  Outta my house I
		want ya!

				ADRIAN
		Don't talk like that to him!

				PAULIE
		Get outta my life both of ya's.

Paulie kicks the door out of frustration and appears to be
bordering on a nervous breakdown.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Outta my house I want ya!!
 

									87.


				ROCKY
		... It's cold outside, Paulie.

Paulie goes to the living room closet and removes a baseball
bat... Rocky and Adrian quickly follow.

				PAULIE
		I don't want ya messin' up my
		sister no more -- He's scum
		from the corner, I don't raise
		ya to hang with no bum!

Adrian is speechless... Rocky moves towards Paulie.

				PAULIE
			(continuing;
			raising the bat)
		... Wanna hit on me?  C'mon --
		C'mon, I'll break both ya arms
		so's they never work...

Rocky freezes...

				ADRIAN
		... Paulie.  Stop now!

				PAULIE
		I want 'im outta here --
			(to Rocky)
		Don't think I'm good enough to
		work for Gazzo?
			(spits)
		That's what I think of bums
		like you an' Gazzo!
			(spits again)
		You're goin' up an' don't care
		enough to throw Paulie some
		crumbs!
			(spits)
		I give ya meat, an' I give ya
		my sister, too!

				ADRIAN
		Only a pig would say that!

Paulie smashes a small table with the bat.

				PAULIE
			(to Adrian)
		You forget what I went through
		to give ya the best.
 

									88.


				ADRIAN
		You gave me what?!  Knots!
		You gave me knots in here
		every day -- you made me
		scared of everything!

				PAULIE
		I always seen ya had the best,
		but did ya ever think of
		puttin' in a good word for me
		with this scumbag!

Paulie smashes a large lamp with the bat.

				ADRIAN
		Don't do that again!

				PAULIE
		Get away from me -- I could
		never even get married 'cause
		you couldn't live by yaself --
		ya'd die by yaself!  So
		instead I put you two
		together -- Did ya think of
		puttin' in a good word for
		me? -- You owe me!

				ADRIAN
		Owe you what?

				PAULIE
		You owe me an' are supposed to
		treat me good!

				ADRIAN
		Good?  Good, Paulie?!  I've
		been treatin' you like a baby.
		Since I can't remember it's so
		long -- I'm the only one who
		feeds you an' puts you in bed
		when ya can't stand up -- and
		it's you that made me feel
		like a loser -- That's what ya
		use to call me 'Loser' -- What
		kind of name is that?  So can
		ya blame me for not remembering
		to talk about you when I'm
		with Rocky -- I don't owe you,
		Paulie, you owe me.

The brother flares up and threatens Adrian with the bat.

				PAULIE
		You busted?!
 

									89.


				ADRIAN
		What?!

				PAULIE
		You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in
		ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya
		pulled down ya pants an' let
		him have it, didn't ya!!

Mortified, Adrian runs to her room... Rocky steps to Paulie.

				ROCKY
			(fuming)
		Hey --

Paulie cocks the bat back and tenses... Rocky remains still.

				PAULIE
			(softly)
		... I can't haul meat no more.

				ROCKY
		What can I do about it?

				PAULIE
		Christ, I been beggin' ya for
		a break until I'm sick inside.

				ROCKY
		What break?  Huh?  What break!
		Who am I to give breaks!  I'm
		a fighter, you haul meat.  You
		do what you do an' I do what I
		do best -- that's it -- that's
		life, man!

Paulie looks ashamed... Rocky walks, then returns.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... An' what ya said to my
		girlfriend ain't right -- Do
		it again, I'll kill ya.

Rocky goes into the bedroom... Adrian has buried her face in
a pillow... She is rocking slightly.  Rocky cradles her and
kisses her cheek.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Wanna hear a dirty joke?
 

									90.


				ADRIAN
			(smiles)
		... Yes --

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Mickey is in his cluttered office above the gym... the room
is dark.  Blankets are tacked over the windows.  Rocky is
watching 8 mm movies of Apollo Creed in action... Rocky
watches with intense concentration as the fighter moves like
a huge dancer around the ring.

				MICKEY
		His defense is great, can't
		lie 'bout that -- You have a
		rollin' style.  Can't retreat
		as fast -- But your style
		ain't retreatin'.

They both watch the flickering images.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		See how he plays sometimes --
		Drives his cornermen nuts.
		Nobody knows his next move --
		Him included.

They watch more action... Creed has a fighter helpless
against the ropes.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Killer instinct -- Ya both got
		the killer touch.  Interestin'.
		See that! -- Right-cross
		combination.  Beautiful.  But
		you got the power to rip the
		body.

They watch more action.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Rocky, when ya climb into the
		square, an' know ya' meetin'
		the best fighter in the world,
		ya' gonna be ready, ya' gonna
		be ready 'cause I been waitin'
		for fifty years -- Fifty years.
		When I'm done with you, you'll
		gonna be able to spit nails.
				(MORE)
 

									91.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
		You'll gonna be able to eat
		lightin' and crap thunder --
		You'll be a very, very
		dangerous person...

The SCENE FADES on Mickey's voice and Rocky staring
transfixed at the images projecting on the wall...

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

Rocky is pounding the heavy bag with intense concentration.
As he strikes from all angles, Mickey instructs.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - LATER

Rocky now works on the incline situp board... While doing
situps, he pounds himself in the stomach with a dumbbell.
The pain is evident on his face.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Pushups between two chairs as Mike sits on his shoulders...
Mickey coaching drives him on.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Mike has on a pair of target gloves and Rocky moves around
the ring swinging at them.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Drenched in sweat, Rocky hums the speed bag.  His expression
is hard and flushed.  Mickey clicks a stopwatch and pats
Rocky's shoulder... He is very happy.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Rocky has just completed exercising with the medicine ball...
Dino hands him a towel... Paulie crosses the gym as Rocky
heads to the steam room... A thin man crosses the gym and
Mickey nods.

				MICKEY
		What cha say, Benny -- Meet
		'The Rock.' This is our
		cutman, Benny Stein.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Benny.

				MICKEY
		Check the eyes, Ben.
 

									92.


Benny checks the skin around Rocky's eyes.

				BENNY
		Ain't bad.  Seen worse --
		Cover up an' things should be
		okay.

				MICKEY
		Take a shower.

Heading towards the shower, Rocky is intercepted by Paulie
who traverses the gym.  He stops Rocky at the shower room
entrance.

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock, I think I found an
		angle to make some bread usin'
		ya name, ya mind?

Exhausted, Rocky studies Paulie's face a moment and nods
'yes.'... Rocky sways into the shower room and Paulie
strides off.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Running... Rocky's crowd of trailing boys has tripled.
Dashing through the streets, he resembles the Pied Piper.

EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAY

It is twilight and Rocky is alone at the very bottom of a
huge flight of steps that seem to stretch into the heavens...
Rocky takes a deep breath and sprints up the never-ending
stairs... Halfway up, his body shows the strain.  Nearing
the top, Rocky pumps with all his strength and arrives at
the very top... He looks down the steep stairs and swells
with pride... He is ready.

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Rocky is led into Mayor Rizzo's office by an aide... Rocky
is very nervous as he approaches the mayor, who is seated
behind his wide desk.

				MAYOR
		Sit down, Rocky.

Flips open a thick file that lays in front of him.
 

									93.


				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		I've been going over your
		record -- You've been the busy
		type --
			(reading)
		Nineteen arrests -- probation
		three times -- expelled from
		seven public schools in 1964
		and '65.

Rocky tries to sink into the chair.

				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		I'm a very busy man, but I
		just wanted to remind you that
		you'll be setting an example
		for thousands of guys like
		yourself and maybe start them
		off in a new direction and
		give our police force a
		break -- I also hope you try
		your very best and bring pride
		to Philadelphia.

				ROCKY
		... I'll try.

The mayor presses a button and a photographer enters.

				MAYOR
		Would you stand up, please.

Rocky rises and the mayor shakes his hand... Their picture
is taken three times... The photographer exits.

				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		Thank you for coming by,
		Rocky -- good luck.

				ROCKY
			(turns)
		Any time.

				MAYOR
			(sitting)
		Wait... After the fight you'll
		have nearly a hundred and
		fifty thousand dollars -- What
		do you plan to do with it?
 

									94.


				ROCKY
			(smiles)
		... Run for mayor.

The mayor is shocked at first but then breaks into a big,
friendly laugh, and Rocky exits.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Adrian and Rocky are at his apartment.  They are looking at
new scrapbooks.  Newsweek Magazine: Headline: "The Italian
Stallion or Donkey?" -- Philadelphia Magazine -- Rocky
stands with the mayor.

				ADRIAN
		Rocky, do you realize everybody
		in this country knows your
		face, and after the fight
		everybody in the world is
		going to.

				ROCKY
		Yeah...

She flips through Sports Illustrated, The American Sportsman,
Ring Magazine, World Boxing, True, and a multitude of other
clippings.

The TELEPHONE RINGS... Rocky rises and walks to the new
white object hanging on the wall.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		My first call... Hello?  Yeah,
		speakin' -- Who is this?
		Bruce?  Bruce who? -- Yo,
		Bruce!  How ya been?  I ain't
		seen ya for nine or eight
		years -- Yeah, things is
		great, how's things with you
		upstate -- Ya sellin' real
		estate, hey, that's a good
		job... Yeah, I gotta advance,
		but I bought ringside seats
		for the guys at the gym.  I
		get the hundred an' fifty
		grand after the fight...

Adrian overhears the statement.
 

									95.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... Yeah, I know it's a lotta
		money -- Condominiums?  Nobody
		uses them anybody.  Listen, I
		think a pet shop is a good
		investment, y'know -- I don't
		care 'bout long hours --
		there's no depreciation --
		that don't matter none to
		me -- Yeah, I like animals.
		Why don't ya give me ya number
		an' I'll call ya back?  Lemme
		getta pencil --

Rocky makes no motion to get a pencil.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Okay, what is it -- four-
		twelve 659-2424.  Yeah, yeah,
		thanks for callin' -- Sure
		I'll get back to ya, Bruce --
		see ya.

Rocky hangs up.

				ADRIAN
		What was that you said about a
		pet shop?

				ROCKY
			(distant)
		... What?

				ADRIAN
		What did you say about a pet
		shop?

				ROCKY
		I don't want ya cleanin'
		nobody else's cages no more.

				ADRIAN
		Is everything all right?

				ROCKY
		I gotta go out for a while.

Rocky grabs his coat and moves to the front door.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; to dog)
		... Come.
 

									96.


INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - NIGHT

Rocky arrives at Goldmill's Gym... He unlocks the gym's door.
Rocky and the dog move through the eerie shadows of the gym.

Rocky moves across the gym with his dog and moves up the
steps to Mickey's office... At the top of the stairs he
looks down at the ring, reflects for a moment, then enters
the office.

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

After turning on the lights, he quickly cleans the cluttered
desk and sets up the projector... He goes to the cabinet and
removes a stack of 16 mm films.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

The office clock indicates it is several hours later.  Rocky
is engrossed in watching another Apollo Creed film.  He sits
motionless.

Rocky sits upright.  Something catches his eyes... He
springs at the projector.  He reruns the scene several times.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

Several hours later Rocky is engrossed in watching another
Apollo Creed film... He sits motionless.  Something catches
his eye.  Rocky stops the projector as Apollo is delivering
a knockout blow to an unfortunate opponent.

Rocky moves right up to freeze frame and inspects it like it
was a priceless painting... He backs off and begins writing
on a note pad.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAWN

The first light of dawn streams through Mickey's filthy
windows... Rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he
has lost interest in watching the movies.

The film has completed its run through the projector and
lazily flops around on the top reel... Listlessly Rocky rubs
his reddened eyes.
 

									97.


The door opens and Mickey flips on the light... The two men
stare at each other for a long moment.  Mickey studies
Rocky's despondent expression and knows what is on the
fighter's mind.

				MICKEY
		... I know what you're
		thinkin'm kid -- At least ya
		gotta shot -- All ya can do is
		try ya' best.

Rocky stands and, with his dog, inches past Mickey and exits
the room.  Mickey walks over and turns off the projector.
He idly pushes the machine with a lazy motion until it
slides off the desk and crashes to the floor.

EXT. STREET - DAWN

After leaving Mickey's gym, Rocky and his dog listlessly
move down the street and head for home.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Rocky arrives at his apartment... Adrian is asleep on the
couch.  He lowers himself beside her.  Her eyes open.

				ROCKY
		... Can't do it.

				ADRIAN
		... What?

				ROCKY
		... I can't beat him.

				ADRIAN
		Apollo?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, I can't beat him.

Adrian touches his face.

				ROCKY
		I been watchin' the movies --
		studyin' -- He ain't weak
		nowhere.

				ADRIAN
		What're we going to do?

				ROCKY
		... I dunno.
 

									98.


				ADRIAN
		Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.

				ROCKY
		It ain't so bad, 'cause I was
		a nothin' before --

				ADRIAN
		Don't say that.

				ROCKY
		C'mon, it's true -- But that
		don't bother me -- I just
		wanna prove somethin' -- I
		ain't no bum... It don't
		matter if I lose... Don't
		matter if he opens my head...
		The only thing I wanna do is
		go the distance -- That's all.
		Nobody's ever gone fifteen
		rounds with Creed.  If I go
		them fifteen rounds, an' that
		bell rings an' I'm still
		standin', I'm gonna know then
		I weren't just another bum
		from the neighborhood...

Adrian touches Rocky's face... The fighter gently lowers
himself beside his woman.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... No foolin' around.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

It is the night of the Bicentennial fight... The location is
the Philadelphia Spectrum.

The Spectrum is filling to capacity... Grandly dressed
celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into
their ringside seat.  Nearly everyone is holding a red,
white, and blue sweater...

The arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red, white and
blue.  High above the ring are huge posters of GEORGE
WASHINGTON - ABE LINCOLN - DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - BEN
FRANKLIN - and APOLLO CREED.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo Creed sits in his dressing room... It is dead silent
except for some NOISE that filters under the door from the
arena.
 

									99.


It is a CLOSE-UP of Apollo's hand being taped... The RASPING
SOUND of the adhesive tape is very pronounced.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The atmosphere is identical to Apollo's dressing room.
Adrian watches in silence as Mike wraps Rocky's hand.

Again, the most pronounced SOUND is the RASPING of the
adhesive tape.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo's other hand is being wrapped.  Dead silence except
for the TAPE and APOLLO'S BREATHING.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Rocky's other hand is being wrapped in a CLOSE-UP.  The only
SOUND is the TAPE and ROCKY'S mounting BREATHING PATTERN.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of drops being placed in his nose to help increase
his intake of oxygen.  The tremendously magnified SOUND of
APOLLO TAKING IN AIR.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of the drops being placed in Rocky's nose.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

A heavy coating of vaseline is applied around the Champion's
eyes... In an EXTREME CLOSE-UP, the eyes shine brightly with
the grease.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Grease is smeared around Rocky's eyes... In the EXTREME
CLOSE-UP several deep scars are SEEN.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of Apollo's trainer digging his fingers deeply into
the thick neck muscles of Apollo's upper back and neck.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP OF Mike's arms wrapped around Rocky's waist and
lifting his diaphragm up... Magnified BREATHING ROARS from
the screen.
 

									100.


INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo's trainer slips a mouthpiece into Apollo's mouth.
Apollo shakes his head and the trainer removes it and places
another one in the champ's mouth... Creed nods yes.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone present is motionless as Rocky is in the bathroom.
Alone, Rocky is on his knee praying.  Completing his silent
prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror.
Suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that
in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge
of his life.

Out in the dressing room, the door opens and a guard leans
in and nods that it is time.  He leaves... Rocky steps out.

				MICKEY
		... It's time, kid.

Rocky nods and moves toward Adrian.

				ADRIAN
		... I'll wait for you here.

Rocky nods and she kisses him.  The fighter leaves with his
trainers... Adrian is on the verge of tears.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Rocky, Mickey and Mike start down the long hallway... Up
ahead are three security guards... Rocky rubs his bare
shoulders.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Mick, can I have my rob?

Rocky puts on the robe... Embroidered across the back in
flaming letters is:

		"THE ITALIAN STALLION"

				*Pennzoil*

Mike helps him into the robe... Mickey is not amused.

				MICKEY
		Don't you care what the people
		will say?

				ROCKY
		... I'm doin' it for a friend.
 

									101.


				MICKEY
		Whatta you get outta this?

				ROCKY
		I get the robe an' Paulie gets
		three grand.

				MICKEY
		... Shrewd.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

TWO RINGSIDE COMMENTATORS sit in front of a panel of closed
circuit televisions.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		We would like to welcome our
		viewing audience to the Grand
		World Championship Bicentennial
		Heavyweight Fight -- the first
		major event of the Bicentennial
		Year... A point of interest is
		that the fight is being beamed
		to more than seven hundred and
		fifty million fans in theatres
		in nearly every corner of the
		world.  I would like to
		welcome an old friend, and co-
		commentator for this evening's
		event -- Jimmy Michaels.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		Thank you, Bob.  The
		electricity is everywhere
		tonight.  Rocky Balboa, a
		fifty-to-one underdog, is
		living a Cinderella story
		which has captured peoples'
		imaginations all over the
		world -- to quote a popular
		sports magazine, 'The fighting
		style should be 'The Caveman
		Against the Cavalier.' From
		the increase in sound it
		appears the challenger is now
		approaching the ring... His
		record is forty-four wins,
		twenty losses and thirty-eight
		knockouts.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		I only wonder if this man has
		the skill to go past three
		rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
 

									102.


ANOTHER ANGLE

A wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring.
Many people wish Rocky well as he passes... people also hurl
insults.  From the expression on Mickey's face it is also
the greatest night of his life.  In the audience are familiar
faces from the gym.  From the back of the arena a ROAR goes
up... Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George
Washington.  He throws silver dollars.  The NOISE builds to
DEAFENING proportions.  Creed's trainer holds the rope and
Creed bounds into the ring.  He tears off the Washington
outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in
an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red,
white and blue sequined top hat.  The robe is sequined red,
white and blue.  His boxing trunks are red, white and blue
silk with stars around the waistband.  The boxing shoes
match the trunks.  On his chin is a pointed white Uncle Sam
beard.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		You could go deaf with the
		noise -- it undoubtedly means
		Champion Apollo Creed is
		heading towards the ring --

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Am I seeing right?  Creed is
		approaching the ring in a boat.
		Is he supposed to be George
		Washington?  Obviously so.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		It's been confirmed that it is
		definitely an impersonation of
		George Washington -- a great
		way to start 1976 off.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		I agree.

Immediately Creed begins gracefully dancing in a wide circle.
He passes within inches of Rocky in his Uncle Sam outfit.

				APOLLO
		I want you!  I want you!

The crowd loves the taunting.  Apollo Creed floats back to
his corner.

				MICKEY
		Don't let 'im get you tight.
 

									103.


				ROCKY
		Whatta ya think that outfit
		cost?

ANOTHER ANGLE

The ANNOUNCER steps to the center of the ring... Several men
in suits stand against the ropes... Paulie is dressed nicely
and sits at ringside with a pretty blonde escort.  Rocky
waves at him.  Paulie waves back and secretly gestures at
his date... Rocky smiles and gestures back.

				ANNOUNCER
		Ladies and gentlemen --
		Welcome to the Bicentennial
		Heavyweight Championship
		Fight... We are very proud to
		have with us four former Great
		Champions... Ladies an' gents,
		'The one and only 'Manassa
		Mauler' -- Jack Dempsey!'

The CROWD ROARS and JACK DEMPSEY waves and goes to Creed's
corner, then Rocky's.

				DEMPSEY
		Good luck, kid.

He moves off.

				ROCKY
			(to Mickey)
		Christ, Jack Dempsey.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Announcer points and the timekeeper RINGS the BELL.

				ANNOUNCER
		Former Middleweight Champion --
		'The Bronx Bull' -- Jake
		LaMotta!

JAKE LA MOTTA raises his fist and gives best wishes to both
contenders... Timekeeper RINGS the BELL.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing)
		The man with the big punch --
		Everybody's favorite, 'The
		Brown Bomber ' -- Joe Louis!
 

									104.


JOE LOUIS bows and steps to Creed's corner.  Creed strikes a
boxing pose and Louis tosses a playful punch.
				ROCKY
		They must be friends.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Now, last but certainly not
		least -- the former Heavyweight
		Champion, a son of Philly,
		Smoking Joe Frazier!

FRAZIER rumbles to the center of the ring.  The CROWD CHEERS.
Apollo puts on a show... He grimaces and gestures like he's
going to attack Frazier.  His cornermen hold him back.  They
laugh.  Frazier goes to Rocky's corner.

				FRAZIER
		Save some of him for me.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators beckon to Frazier as he exits the ring.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The former champ looks great --
		Can we get Joe over here --
		here he comes.

Joe Frazier stands in front of the Commentators.

				COMMENTATOR #1
			(continuing)
		Joe, what are your feelings
		about tonight's fight?

				FRAZIER
		Well, I think any man who
		works an' trains hard always
		gotta chance.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		You look in great shape, Joe.

				FRAZIER
		I'm always in shape.

Joe laughs and exits.  The timekeeper RINGS the BELL.
 

									105.


ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		... Now for the evening's main
		event -- In the corner to my
		right, The Challenger, wearing
		white trunks -- At one hundred
		an' ninety-one pounds, one of
		Philly's own sons -- 'The
		Italian Stallion,' Rocky Balboa!

A good CROWD RESPONSE.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		In the far corner, wearing
		red, white an' blue -- Weighing
		in at two hundred and ten
		pounds -- Undefeated in forty-
		six fights -- the Heavyweight
		Champion of the World -- 'The
		Master of Disaster' -- Apollo
		Creed!

The arena EXPLODES and Creed puts on a display of hand speed.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The REFEREE motions to both fighters... They step to the
center of the ring.  As the Referee explains the rules
Apollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes... The
Referee's voice fades and the fighters' expressions fill the
screen... Something soulful and frightening is being
communicated.

				REFEREE
		... Now come out fighting.

The fighters return to their corners.

				MICKEY
		God bless ya, Rock.

				ROCKY
		Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... Creed dances forward and boxes Rocky as
though he considers the man an amateur.
 

									106.


ANOTHER ANGLE

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The Champ stings the slower
		challenger with jabs at
		will -- Balboa blocks eighty
		percent of the blows with his
		face -- Creed doesn't look the
		best he's ever been but is
		moving smoothly -- Creed snaps
		out a triple combination that
		backs Balboa into a corner --
		oh, a solid hook by Creed, a
		master of fist-men.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		The Champion is smiling and
		toying with the man -- trying
		to give the fans their money's
		worth and make a show of it
		with the badly out-classes
		challenger -- Another left to
		right combination.  I feel
		sorry for --

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Creed is down!!!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky suddenly explodes with an upswing hook to the jaw.
Creed is dropped.  The arena EXPLODES.  Creed's eyes show
disbelief.  So do Rocky's.

Rocky backs into his corner... Mickey and Mike yell at him.

				MICKEY
		You can do it!  Goddamnit, you
		got the power!  The body, get
		the body!!!  Ya got him goin'!

				REFEREE
		Six!... Seven!... Eight!...

Creed is up... His playful attitude is gone... he is now all
business.  His lightning jab stings Rocky's face repeatedly.

				APOLLO
		... Come at me, sucker!

Rocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's
chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed
to cringe...
 

									107.


Apollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations
to the body.

The BELL RINGS.

ROCKY'S CORNER

				ROCKY
		How am I doin'?

				MICKEY
		Real good.

				ROCKY
		See how fast he is -- damn!

				MICKEY
		Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin
		down!!  Use the legs and drive
		through 'im.  Attack --
		Attack -- Attack!

APOLLO'S CORNER

Apollo does not sit.  He stands and clowns with the
spectators to prove he is not hurt.

				APOLLO
			(to Trainer)
		... That boy damn near broke
		my arm.

				TRAINER
		Sure -- He can hit -- Don't
		play no more -- Stick an'
		move, hear?

				APOLLO
		I'll carry him 'till the third.

				TRAINER
		Don't play with this man, he's
		fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel
		some real heat!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL for the second round RINGS... Rocky rushes out fast
and furious.  Apollo melts out a left hook that raises a
goose egg over Rocky's eye... Apollo employs footwork that
dazzles Rocky.  He has class.  He studies Rocky and employs
his lightning jab with cutting accuracy. Still Rocky shuffles
ahead, bombarding Creed's midsection with hooks.
 

									108.


ANOTHER ANGLE

The round ends with Apollo assaulting Rocky with blinding
combinations and delivering a stupendous right cross that
flings Rocky into the ropes and shatters his nose... The
round ends.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo stands in his corner and jokes with the fans, but he
is beginning to show the strain from the body punches.

				APOLLO
		Man, I rearranged his face
		with that right -- The people
		love what's happenin' tonight.

				TRAINER
		People nothin', you in a
		fight, my man, -- ya best
		believe what you hear... Knock
		that boy out soon an' let's go
		home.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky sits as Mickey and Benny try to reduce the swelling
around his eyes... The nose is shattered.

				MICKEY
		Ya nose is broke.

				ROCKY
		Damn!  How's it look?

				MICKEY
		Can't hardly tell.  Don't
		swallow the blood -- Go for
		his ribs.  Don't let 'im
		breathe.

				ROCKY
		... The guy's great.

				MICKEY
		Why don't ya tell 'im you're a
		fan!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators are caught up in the action.  They speak
rapidly into their microphones.
 

									109.


				COMMENTATOR #2
		If you had asked anyone who
		knows boxing, they never
		would've predicted a first
		round knockdown and the second
		round punishment to the body
		of the Champion... Most
		fighters will tell you,
		receiving a good body punch is
		the next worst thing to dying.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Round three ready to start and
		should be interesting to see
		if Creed can put the challenger
		away -- there goes the bell.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Round three... Apollo comes out dancing.  He skips and side-
steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks.  An expert ring general,
Apollo uses the ring fully.  Rocky keeps tearing in and
Creed meets the bombing attack that cause thick swelling...
Near the end of the round Rocky fires a penetrating punch to
the heart.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Apollo almost sprints out of
		his corner -- feints and
		throws a pair of left-right
		combinations.  Balboa drops
		beneath a left upper cut and
		lands a very solid shot on
		Creed's temple -- not much
		movement from Balboa, duck a
		left, a right, another left
		and explodes with a right hook
		to the temple -- I mean
		explodes.  The Champ backs off.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		There's no way Apollo expected
		this kind of hitting power.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		No way -- but the brilliant
		ability of the Champion to
		master situations like this is
		one of his most outstanding
		traits -- Creed tosses a
		perfect right hand that rocks
		Rocky.
				(MORE)
 

									110.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		Creed on the offensive --
		Balboa takes the punishment
		and counters with a left flush
		over the heart... that hurt.

The wallop knocks Apollo off balance... The CAMERA GOES TO A
STEEP ANGLE SHOT from the floor, VERTICALLY UP Apollo's body.
The SCENE GOES INTO SLOW MOTION... Rocky releases a
terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under Creed's eye.
Creed's face contorts with excruciation.

				TRAINER
			(yelling)
		Cover your face!  Cover up!
			(to Assistant)
		My man's cut, my man's
		bleedin' -- Get ready!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL SOUNDS.  Apollo's corner works frantically to close
the wound... The ring DOCTOR inspects the cut.

				TRAINER
		Bad?  Talk to me, man!

				DOCTOR
		Deep, but passable.

				APOLLO
			(staring at Rocky)
		... That man's takin' his job
		too serious.

				TRAINER
		He's movin' to your left --
		don't let him no more -- dance
		and stick, hear?  Don't
		play -- I know what ya feelin',
		but don't play.

				APOLLO
		He got lucky.

				TRAINER
		Luck!  You fightin' a crazy
		man -- but you got him hurt
		bad.
			(to Assistant)
		More ice, now!
 

									111.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's face is in very bad shape, not cut, but wretchedly
swollen around the eyes.

				MICKEY
		How you holdin' up, kid?

				ROCKY
		Fine... That guy's great.

				MICKEY
		Gimme the water!  Ya getttin'
		tagged with his right.  I
		think you should feint left
		and high hook 'im -- Benny,
		check the eyes!  Can ya see?

				ROCKY
			(standing)
		See what?

				MIKE
		Ya sappin' his strength --
		He's losin' steam.

				ROCKY
		He ain't losin' nothin'.

				MICKEY
		Keep on him -- You're doin'
		great.

SERIES OF SHOTS

In the next ten rounds, Apollo cuts and slashes Rocky to
ribbons, but pays dearly... Both his eyes and lips are cut.
Welts across his midsection attest to Rocky's body-battering.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Adrian is unable to remain alone... She is lured by the
GROWING ROAR OF THE FANS... She exits the dressing room.

INT. ARENA HALL - NIGHT

Stepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor.
The MOUNTING CHEERS make her speed up.  She opens the door
at the end of the corridor and is hit by a THUNDEROUS WAVE
OF SOUND.  The guard at the door inspects her and goes back
to watching the fight.
 

									112.


INT. ARENA - NIGHT

Adrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the
battle.  She is entranced by the power of it all.

Back in the ring, Rocky keeps grinding ahead.  He plants a
thumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces...
Rocky is game but losing.

At ringside Paulie is frantic... He is living the fight from
his seat.

Mr. Gazzo and his Bodyguard watch from the second row.
Gazzo looks proud.  The Bodyguard, impassive.

INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

A huge and lively crowd look up at the television over the
bar... They see Rocky driving Creed against the ropes and
cheer loudly.

				ANDY
		... The Rock's got real stones.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

The men are fighting with appalling tenacity.  Rocky rips
and tears into the body... Apollo counters with a ceaseless
stream of rapier-like lefts... The Challenger is seriously
outclassed.

				APOLLO
		C'mon -- Lemme cut yo'!

Rocky wades in and Creed employs incredible footwork.  He
sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross
to Rocky's already broken nose.  Blood sprays from the wound
and red droplets drip from his chin...

Rocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a
torrent of combinations.  Rocky's eyes are closed.  But
Creed cannot drop him... The BELL RINGS.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators shift in their seats.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Without a doubt this is the
		most punishing brawl I have
		ever seen -- The ringside
		audience is spotted with blood.
				(MORE)
 

									113.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		This fight should have been
		stopped rounds ago but Rocky
		Balboa refuses to fall --

				COMMENTATOR #2
		Not only has he refused to
		fall, but he has beaten the
		Champion's body without mercy
		and the bout has become a
		vicious slugfest.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo's corner is in turmoil... The Champion is definitely
hurt.

				APOLLO
		My side.

				TRAINER
			(to Assistant)
		Get that doctor.

				APOLLO
		No doctor!

				TRAINER
		You're hurtin', man!

				APOLLO
		No doctor!... I'm feelin'
		good, bro!

ANOTHER ANGLE

In Rocky's corner, things are frantic.  His eyes are swollen
shut.

				MICKEY
		Wanna keep goin'?

				ROCKY
		Would you keep goin'?

				MICKEY
		... Yeah.

				MIKE
		No more, ya wanna lose an eye?
		No more.
 

									114.


				ROCKY
		Open my eyes -- Please, open
		my eyes!

Mickey nods to Benny.  He secretly places a small ring knife
between his index and middle finger.  In one smooth movement
he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers
the draining wounds with gauze... It is done so quickly no
one is ever aware of the operation.

ANOTHER ANGLE

At the rear of the arena Adrian looks transfixed at the ring.
She is caught up in the heat of the battle.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS for round fourteen.  Rocky bores in close,
but Apollo still has spring in his legs.  He seems determined
to end it this round... Apollo catches Rocky flush on the
jaw.  Rocky is staggered.  Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose
with pure savagery.  Rocky is driven against the ropes and
receives a devastating beating from the Champion... Rocky is
dropped.

Rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring... Everything
is a distortion.  He looks for familiar faces as though to
ask for help... Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him
to stay down.

				REFEREE
		Six -- Seven -- Eight --

Rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy.  He
is like a wounded wild animal.  The tide suddenly turns.
Rocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific
body punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his
throat... A CRACK is HEARD.  A glaze of pain covers Apollo's
eyes.  It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion
upright... Apollo is badly hurt.  He is bent over.

Rocky moves towards Apollo.  Apollo flicks dread jabs into
Rocky's eyes... The Italian wades in with punches that seem
to bulge out Apollo's back.  Creed takes the punishment like
a stoic.

Blood is running from Apollo's mouth.  In the clinch he
leans over Rocky and it drips down the Italian's neck and
shoulders.  Apollo shields his wound from the ringside
judges and continues to fight.
 

									115.


ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS.  Apollo's men rush out and guide him to his
corner.

				APOLLO
		... Ribs broke --

Blood trickles from the corner of Apollo's mouth.  The
Trainer feels the ribs.

				TRAINER
		Yo' bleedin' inside, man --
		Get that doctor.

				APOLLO
		One more round.

				TRAINER
		Don't kill yourself, man --
		Let the doctor stop the fight.

				APOLLO
		... Stop jivin'!

				TRAINER
		Cover the ribs -- Look here,
		elbow down, tight -- Tight --
		stand straight -- you're the
		best, you're the best!

				APOLLO
		... Thanks.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky no longer resembles himself... His face has completely
been beaten to jelly, but his mood is buoyant.

				ROCKY
		How I look out there, Mick?

				MICKEY
			(truly worried)
		Great, kid, great.

The ring Doctor leans over Rocky and checks the eyes.

				DOCTOR
		One more round -- How do you
		feel?

Rocky is approaching the supreme moment of his life.  He
cannot be bothered with pain or doctors.
 

									116.


				ROCKY
		Fine -- Go away, I'm gonna
		make it -- I'm gonna make it!

Everyone is distraught over Rocky's dangerous condition.

				MICKEY
		We gotta stop it, kid.

				MIKE
		Ya gave it ya best shot!

				MICKEY
		Nobody's gonna say ya didn't
		give ya all.  I can't let ya
		go out.

Rocky stands and eyes them all.

				ROCKY
			(impassioned
			and quietly)
		I'll kill ya all... Don't stop
		nothin' --

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... Apollo moves cautiously out of his corner
and circles to Rocky's right.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators stare unansweringly at the fighters.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The fight has slowed down to a
		near stand-still -- Creed
		circles to Rocky's right...
		The spectrum is nearly
		silent -- Neither fighter has
		made a motion to throw... I've
		never seen anything like it in
		the last round of a
		championship fight... Apollo
		spits blood on the canvas.  It
		appears he is protecting his
		right side.  His ribs were
		probably injured at the end of
		round fourteen.
				(MORE)
 

									117.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		It's confirmed, unofficially,
		Creed's ribs may be broken --
		Apollo fakes a left and throws
		a big tired right -- Balboa's
		mouthpiece is out!  Creed
		attacks with one hand!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo feints and Rocky falls for it.  The Champion unleashes
a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's
mouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the
ropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to
their feet.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to
come ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a
weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O.
written on every punch.  Rocky counters the assault blow for
blow.

				ROCKY
		Gimme ya best!!!!

Mickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Gimme ya best!!!

Blood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside
photographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood.

The fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit
of strength from their souls and beat each other without
mercy.  They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension
far beyond blood and pain.

				SIX
				FIVE
				FOUR
				THREE
				TWO
				ONE!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... The arena EXPLODES with thunderous approval.
 

									118.


Their cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters... In the
midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other
with unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched
gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives.

As though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step
towards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's
ear.

				APOLLO
		... Ain't gonna be no rematch.

				ROCKY
		... Don't want one.

Mickey comes over and separates them and leads him back to
his corner... Mickey embraces him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Announcer enters the ring with a microphone.

				ANNOUNCER
		Attention, please!!  Attention!!
		Ladies and gentlemen, tonight
		we have had the rare privilege
		to have witnessed the greatest
		exhibitions of stamina and
		guts ever in the history of
		sports.

The CROWD ROARS.

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing)
		Ladies and gentlemen -- We
		have a split decision!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo did not expect this and tenses.  His corner nervously
tries to reassure him.  It does no good.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky did not expect this either and looks in confusion at
Mickey, but Mickey is frozen with anticipation.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Judge Walker scores it eight-
		seven Creed... Judge Roseman
		scores it eight-seven Balboa.
 

									119.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo is rigid.  Fear radiates from his eyes.  To lose the
crown on this night after the fight he fought would kill
him... A silence has blanketed the arena.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Judge Conners scores it nine-
		six Creed... Winner and still
		Heavyweight Champion of the
		World, Apollo Creed!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky sorely smiles and looks at the waves of CHEERING fans
that circle the ring and reach out towards him... Mickey
grabs Rocky's hand and raises it.  The CROWD ROARS.

				MICKEY
		I don't care what they say,
		you're a winner.

				ROCKY
		Yo, can I have my locker back?

Mickey and Rocky look at each other and grin.  Mickey hugs
Rocky like a son.  Mickey raises Rocky's hand again.  Rocky
turns away from Mickey and pats Benny the cut-man's
shoulder... Benny smiles wearily.  Rocky stares across the
ring at Apollo Creed, who stands victorious, but his face
and body are badly distorted... The two men lock stares that
reflect admiration.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward
screaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well-
wishing fans rumble forward... Mickey's eyes show mounting
apprehension as the fans become abnormally active.

ANOTHER ANGLE

They shove the police aside and clutch wildly at Creed.
Creed's army of bodyguards swing angrily at the crowd but
they are soon engulfed by screaming waves of humanity.
Apollo is suddenly hoisted into the air and is being carried
along by a legion of fans.
 

									120.


ANOTHER ANGLE

On the opposite aisle Rocky is experiencing the same
overwhelming adulation by his fans but does not seem to be
frightened by it, like Apollo.  Mickey tries his best to
control things but his voice is drowned out in the growing
clamor.  The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to
their shoulders.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against
each other... chanting, 'Creed, Creed, Creed.'

Rocky's fans counter by bellowing, 'Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.'

ANOTHER ANGLE

Paulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he
starts swinging.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Both Rocky and Apollo are completely at the mercy of the
crowd.  They are being passed overhead and remain helpless
as their bodies float up the aisle on the sea of hands...
The CHANTING IS DEAFENING.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Fearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move
forward.  Running headlong into the crowd, she angles
through the mass to get to Rocky.

ANOTHER ANGLE

She is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions,
but she keeps her feet... She sees him.  In the distance,
Rocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall
and waits for the procession to pass.

The procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's
unbelievably battered but smiling face.  He appears to be
king of the world.

The procession approaches and passes Adrian.  She jumps on
her toes and waves frantically but is not seen.  She screams
Rocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through
the racket and reaches Rocky.

Rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages
to see Adrian jumping up and down waving.  The crowd is
carrying him away.  He attempts to lower himself but the
crowd won't permit it.
 

									121.


Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's
heads and shoulders.  He resembles a man trying to go up a
down escalator.  People are jammed so tightly together Rocky
manages to crawl across them to Adrian.

Still suspended in air, Rocky leans down and Adrian jumps up
and they lock in an embrace.

				ADRIAN
		I love you -- I love you -- I
		love you...

The two are swept along into the greatest night anyone can
remember...

RING PRODUCTIONS, INC.

MASTER SCRIPT: INCLUDES ALL REVISIONS AS OF 1/7/76  REVISED:
 




INT. BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... "NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA"

... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can.
The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle.
The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is
fighting.

In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black.
The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old.
His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black
hair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a
plodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and
bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy.
But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins
at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead.

The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for
blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters.
In the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is
hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony.
A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.

The BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner...
Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring.

The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers
across the ring at Rocky.

				BLACK FIGHTER
			(to cornerman)
		... I'm gonna bust his head
		wide open!

In Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled,
balding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He
works on Rocky without any enthusiasm.

				CORNERMAN
			(lackluster)
		... Ya waltzin' -- Give the
		suckers some action.

				ROCKY
		Hey --

				CORNERMAN
			(overriding)
		Ya movin' like a bum -- Want
		some advice --

				ROCKY
		... Just gimme the water.
 

										2.


A FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with
yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.

				FAN
		Should I bet the fight don't
		go the distance -- Ya feel
		strong?

				ROCKY
		Absolutely.

				CORNERMAN
		... Ya want some good advice?

				ROCKY
		... I just want the mouthpiece.

The BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross.  The
fighters engage in battle.  The other fighter grabs Rocky in
a clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding
cut on the corner of Rocky's eye.

Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into
the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the
fighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into
the ring.  Rocky ignores it.

The fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does
not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under
the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new
fighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe.
Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion."

				ANNOUNCER
		Winner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a
		six rounder between local
		lightweights.

Without pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a
cigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher
passes behind him.  He watches for a moment and continues up
the aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the
BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky
fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.

THE TITLE CREDITS END:

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his
locker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other
fighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.
 

										3.


				FIGHTER #1
		... Tomorrow me an' my woman
		are gonna tip on down to
		Atlantic City, man.

				FIGHTER #2
		... It's cold, Bro'.

				FIGHTER #1
		... That's right, I got the
		city to myself...

Another paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and
spit nervously on the floor.

A young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO
that is BLASTING MUSIC.

The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer
and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters
are smoking.  The room is cloudy.

A short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater
buttoned over a t-shirt.

				PROMOTER
		...Balboa!?

Rocky raises his head.  The promoter steps over.

				PROMOTER
			(continuing)
		... Twenty bucks for the
		locker an' cornerman -- Two
		bucks for the towel an'
		shower, seven for tax -- The
		house owes ya, sixty-one
		dollars.

The man peels off the money and departs... Rocky closes his
locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.

INT. TROLLEY - NIGHT

Rocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly... The
trolley is empty except for a thin old black WOMAN... The
black Woman studies Rocky's bruised face... Rocky becomes
self-conscious.

				ROCKY
			(almost apologetic)
		I'm a fighter.
 

										4.


				WOMAN
			(tired)
		... Yo' iz an accident.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... He waves
at a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back.

Rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty
bookstore.  Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway.

Further down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the
"ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP"... He peers into the dark store and
sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window.  He mumbles to
the dog and continues to the corner.

EXT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

A short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located
in the most deprived section of South Philly.  He kicks away
the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and
enters.

INT. ROCKY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

The narrow hallway is painted olive brown.  A single light
bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky enters.  The one-room apartment is drab, with a
curling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall...
Nailed against the far wall is a mattress.  The mattress is
used as a punching bag.  Stuffing spills out of the center.

Rocky drops his coat on the floor.  He puts on a pair of
glasses.  He crosses to a small turtle bowl... He lifts the
creatures.

				ROCKY
		...Look who's home.

Rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then
places an old 45 RPM record on a battered phonograph.  The
record is a tune, "ALL IN THE GAME."

... As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his
hairbrush.  Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the
record.  He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning
to thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a
bullish fighting stance and throws several punches.

The water boils.  Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.
 

										5.


EXT. SUNRISE OF PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAWN

We SEE the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering
figure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it
sits majestically above City Hall...

EXT. DOCKS - EARLY MORNING

Rocky is walking along the waterfront... He has a bandaid
over one eye.  He looks at the rugged stevedores going about
their business... He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool
jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded.

Rocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked
car.  These men look like blood drinkers.

				MAFIA #1
		Yo, Rock -- How's your Boss?

				ROCKY
		Real good.

				MAFIA #2
		Fightin' again?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, here an' there.

				MAFIA #1
		Mebbe we make sum money
		togather soon... Give ya boss
		my best.

Rocky shrugs and moves away... He nears a heavy man working
the crane.  The heavy man looks frightened... He stops the
crane and hurries into the ship's hole.  Rocky dashes up the
gangplank.

INT. SHIP - DAY

The man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked
crates and coffee beans.

Rocky sprints after him... He lunges and flings the man by
the neck against the wall of stacked cargo.

				FATS
			(terror-filled)
		Don't hit the face!  Not the
		face!!

				ROCKY
		Mr. Gazzo wants the two
		hundred now!
 

										6.


				FATS
		Honest to God I'm broke --
		Gimme a break.

				ROCKY
		Mr. Gazzo says I should get
		two hundred or break the thumb.

				FATS
		Please, I need my hands to
		work -- Christ, don't bust my
		thumbs.

At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by
stevedores.  Rocky remains cool.

				ROCKY
		Goin' fishin'?

The man drops the hook.

				ROCKY
		What's ya name again?

				FATS
		Bob.

				ROCKY
		Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance,
		ya gotta pay the band -- If ya
		borrow, ya gotta pay the man...
		Me, I ain't emotionally
		involved.

Rocky's determined expression strikes home.  The fat man
quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small
wad of bills.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; counting)
		A hundred an' thirty.

				FATS
		That's it, I'm broke.

				ROCKY
		That's it? -- Completely?

				FATS
		That's it.

				ROCKY
		What about for food an' stuff?
 

										7.


				FATS
		You have my food in ya hand.

Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's
flushed expression.

				ROCKY
		... The juice is climbin'
		every week.

				FATS
		I know the juice is climbin' --
		I been workin' six months just
		to pay the damn interest.

				ROCKY
		Ya still light seventy.

				FATS
		Waits! -- Be smart.  Ya don't
		have to break nothin' -- Here,
		take my coat, it's worth
		fifty-sixty dollars.  It's
		yours.

The man quickly removes his coat and extends it...

				FATS
			(continuing)
		See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's
		don't have to know nuthin'.
		I'll go tape up the hand like
		ya broke my thumb.  Gazzo
		won't be wise to nothin' -- Be
		a smart guy, keep the coat,
		we'll fake like ya broke the
		hand.

The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the
man's thumb and bends him to his knees.

				FATS
			(almost a whisper)
		No - no - no - Please -
		Please - Please don't...

Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock.  The
thumb is fine.

				ROCKY
		...That's what coulda happened.
			(walks off.)
 

										8.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Later that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in
South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking.  In
the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed
Kittens -- $1.50"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning.
He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies.  He taps the
window and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and
presses his face against the window and does his impression
of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks
away.

The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not
very attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old.
Brown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses.

Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so
painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters.

INT. PET SHOP - DAY

				ADRIAN
		... Could you take the puppy
		out --

				CUSTOMER
		It can breathe.

				ADRIAN
		Please -

				CUSTOMER
		Please, nothin' - I paid for
		this dog and can do whatever I
		want with it - I can throw it
		through the window if I want -
		Now give me my two dollars
		back before I do throw it
		through the window.

Rocky walks over to her, stares hard in her face and snatches
the bag out of her hand.  He removes the puppy and hands it
to Adrian.

				CUSTOMER
		Get away from me - Give me that!

Rocky takes a couple dollars out of his pocket and hands it
to the lady... She nervously exits.

				ROCKY
		... How's the turtle food this
		week?
 

										9.


				ADRIAN
		... Fine.

				ROCKY
		Me, I'm kinda aggravated.

				ADRIAN
		... I'm sorry.

				ROCKY
		Ain't your fault - Here's the
		problem.

Adrian nods... Though charmed, she is slightly intimidated.

				ROCKY
		The last food I got here had
		more moths than flies -- An'
		the moths get caught in my
		turtle's throat -- That makes
		them cough --

The OWNER, a squat woman of forty, steps out of the back and
waves at Rocky.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Yo, Gloria -- I was talkin'
		about the turtle food -- Like
		I was sayin', the moths get
		caught in the turtle's throat
		an' makes 'em cough...
			(coughs)
		A little cough an' I gotta
		smack 'em on the shell -- An'
		whatta think they get?

Adrian shrugs.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I smack 'em hard on the shell
		an' they get... What?

				ADRIAN
		... I don't know.

				ROCKY
		Shell-shocked!

Both the Owner and Adrian smile.
 

									10.


				OWNER
		Startin' with the bad jokes
		early today, huh.

				ROCKY
		Inventin' jokes ain't easy.

Rocky steps over to a large cage at the rear of the shop...
Inside is a huge dog.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		How's Butkus this mornin'?

				OWNER
		Ain't had time to check 'em.

Rocky opens the cage and the large dog jumps out and looks
very happy.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Butkus -- Dead.  Play dead.

The dog plays dead.

				ROCKY
		...What kinda dog is this again?

				OWNER
		Bullmastiff.

				ROCKY
		The owner was suppose to pick
		him up three weeks ago.

				OWNER
		We're not responsible for
		animals left over thirty
		days - We board it ain't a
		animal shelter, Y'know.
		...Adrian, I want you to clean
		all those cat cages downstairs,
		they're a mess.
			(Adrian nods.)


Rocky waves goodbye to Adrian and exits the shop.

EXT. LEHIGH ST. TRAIN TRESTLE - DAY

Gazzo picks up Rocky.
 

									11.


INT. GAZZO'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

MR. GAZZO and his YOUNG BODY GUARD sit in the front seat...
Rocky is in the back seat.

				ROCKY
		He only had a hundred an'
		thirty. -- I think he's good
		for the rest next week, Mr.
		Gazzo.

				GAZZO
			(patiently)
		Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for
		it...

Gazzo hands Rocky a twenty.

				GAZZO
		Tomorrow collect from Del
		Rio -- He's late three weeks.
		How'd you do last night?

				ROCKY
		... Fine.

Gazzo's Bodyguard looks at Rocky's bruised face in the
mirror and smiles.

				BODYGUARD
		Did ya get the license number?

				ROCKY
		Of wa?

				BODYGUARD
		... Of the truck that run over
		your face.

Gazzo steps out of the car and beckons to Rocky.

				GAZZO
		Yo Rock.  Did I give you a job
		this mornin?  How come ya
		didn't break this guy's thumb
		like I asked ya?  When ya
		don't do what ya are told, it
		makes me look bad, kid.

				ROCKY
		I figure if I break the thumb
		this guy gets thrown outta his
		job and can't pay nothin no
		more.
 

									12.


				GAZZO
		It don't matter.  It's my
		reputation.  These guys think
		they can get off light.  It's
		bad for my reputation -- It's
		bad for business.  See ya
		killer.

Gazzo gets into his car.

				GAZZO
			(to Bodyguard)
		... The Rock's a good kid.

				BODYGUARD
			(emotionless)
		... A meatbag.

They pull away.

EXT. GYM - DAY

Gazzo drives off and Rocky strolls across the street to
Goldmill's Gym.  On the way he passes several familiar
people and exchanges waves... Out front is a young Irishman
who runs a soft pretzel stand... His name is RUDY.  It is
apparent from his face he was a prize fighter... He is blind
and mentally defective.

				RUDY
		...See the fight last night?

				RUDY
		Nah, I was fightin' myself.

				RUDY
		Apollo Creed beat the bum to
		pieces.

EXT./INT. GYM - DAY

Mickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy
spoons.  Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive
among themselves.  Two winos lean against the entrance.

Rocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full.  The
MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes
the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of
machinery.  Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers
BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of
the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the
THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS.
 

									13.


The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five
percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other.

As Rocky walks through the gym many of the FIGHTERS pause to
wave and yell greetings.

				FIGHTER #1
		Hey, hear ya knocked Spider
		Rice out in the sixth?

				ROCKY
		The third -- Shoulda seen it.

Rocky passes another FIGHTER punching the heavy bag.

				FIGHTER #2
			(removes glove)
		Hey, Rock, touch my hand.

				ROCKY
		How come?

				FIGHTER #2
		C'mon, it's important.

Rocky touches the Fighter's bare hand.

				FIGHTER #2
			(continuing)
		Can ya tell I just whacked-off?

Rocky smiles and moves away.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY

The dressing room is lined with dented lockers.  Wooden
benches stretch across the room.  On the wall is a sign that
reads, "NO KISSING."

Rocky goes to his locker.  He tries to open it but fails.
He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers.
Still it does not open.  He shakes the lock forcefully, no
luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the
situation.

After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the
bench and smashes open the lock.  Opening the door Rocky is
taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes.

				ROCKY
			(mumbling)
		... These ain't my clothes.
 

									14.


He sees a picture of several black girls taped on the inside
of the door.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... These ain't my pictures.

A short powerful man of thirty-five enters.  His hair looks
like it has been shaped with hedge clippers.  His name is
MIKE.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Mike -- What's happenin'
		here?

				MIKE
		It ain't your locker no more.

				ROCKY
		Whatta ya talkin' about it
		ain't my locker no more?

				MIKE
		Listen, I'm with you -- But ya
		gotta talk to Mickey -- I put
		ya stuff in the bag over there.

Rocky looks at his belongings crammed in a wilted shopping
bag and follows Mike across the room... Mike leans his head
into the shower room.  Two Latin fighters are lathering up.

				FIGHTER
		...Hey, Peanut, gimme some
		soap, Man.

				MIKE
			(irate)
		Hey, Nobody -- Yeah, you,
		Nobody -- You don't call me
		Peanut.

				FIGHTER
		Peanut, gimme some soap.

The fighters laugh.  Inflamed, Mike removes a bar of soap
from his pocket and hurls it at the insulting fighter.  It
hits just above the man's head.  The fighters are shocked
into silence.

Mike turns and exits with Rocky... The fighters curse them
loudly in Spanish.
 

									15.


INT. GYM - DAY

Rocky and Mike move past fighters going through their
training routines.

				ROCKY
		You were ready to bite that
		guy's face.

				MIKE
		Yeah -- See the fight last
		night?  Apollo Creed beat that
		English guy bad.

				ROCKY
		Creed's great.

Mike fakes a friendly punch at Rocky and hurries off to
another chore...

INT. GYM - DAY

The Owner, MICKEY, sits on a stool near the entrance.  He
wears a baggy suit... He is in his late seventies.

Rocky approaches... Mickey is conversing with another fighter.

				MICKEY
		I don't care what nobody says,
		this bum Creed woulda never
		made it in the Thirties --

				ROCKY
		Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?

				MICKEY
			(monotoned)
		... What?

				ROCKY
		I said, how ya feelin'?

				MICKEY
			(dryly)
		Do you see me talkin'?  Huh?

				ROCKY
			(low)
		Yeah.
 

									16.


				MICKEY
			(spitting)
		Then stand there an' wait till
		I'm done -- Creed's good,
		yeah, he's real fine but I
		gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper,
		who's got the stuff it takes
		to be a champ -- He's mean,
		quick, an' big -- What more
		d'ya need?  Okay, go to work...
			(to Rocky)
		Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?

				ROCKY
		I was talkin' with ya man,
		Mike. -- Hey, how come I been
		put outta my locker?

				MICKEY
		Dipper needed it.

Rocky turns and looks at DIPPER sparring... Dipper is a
young, muscular heavyweight with a mean expression.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Dipper's a climber -- You're a
		tomato.

				ROCKY
		... Tomato?

				MICKEY
		Facts is facts.  I run a
		business here -- I'm cleanin'
		house --

Mickey pauses to watch a young middleweight time-skip as his
trainer sings "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM."

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		How old are ya?

				ROCKY
		...What?

				MICKEY
		How old?

				ROCKY
		Come July, twenty-five.
 

									17.


				MICKEY
		More like thirty.

				ROCKY
		Twenty-five, thirty -- What's
		the difference? -- It took me
		two months to learn the
		combination of that locker.

				MICKEY
		The legs must be goin'.

				ROCKY
		Yeah, they're goin', -- that's
		nature... That was my locker
		for six years.

				MICKEY
		... Did ya fight last night?

				ROCKY
		Yeah --

				MICKEY
		Did ya win?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, Kayo.

				MICKEY
		... Who'd ya fight?

				ROCKY
		Spider Rice.

				MICKEY
		Rice is a bum.

				ROCKY
		You think everybody I fight is
		a bum.

				MICKEY
		Ain't they?

Mickey shoots Rocky a quick, indifferent look and removes a
rosary from his pocket and idly rolls it around his fingers.
 

									18.


				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Ya want the truth -- Ya got
		heart, but ya fight like an
		ape -- The only thing special
		about you is ya never got ya
		nose broke -- keep ya nose
		pretty -- what's left of ya
		brain an' retire.

				ROCKY
		Listen, I'm gonna take a
		steam -- Did good last night --
		Shoulda seen it.

				MICKEY
		Hey, ever think about retirin'?

				ROCKY
		...No.

				MICKEY
		Think about it.

				ROCKY
		Yeah, sure.

Shrugging, Rocky moves away.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		...I think I'm gonna take a
		steam -- Shoulda seen me
		fight -- Did good, y'know.

Mickey leans over to Mike who approaches with a mop and pail.

				MICKEY
			(gesturing
			towards Rocky)
		Known him since he was
		fifteen -- A waste of life.

Dejected, Rocky travels to the locker room.  He passes Big
Dipper sparring in a ring... Dipper spits a mouthful of
water in a bucket and looks smugly at Rocky.

				DIPPER
			(to Rocky)
		... I dig yo' locker, Man.

				TRAINER
		Time, Dipper.
 

									19.


Dipper smiles cruelly and begins sparring... Scene FADES on
Rocky's crestfallen expression.  He moves off.

EXT. PET SHOP - DUSK

At sunset Rocky comes down the street and pauses at the pet
shop... He is eating Colonel Sanders' fried chicken out of a
bag... He taps on the window with a chicken bone.

INT. PET SHOP - DUSK

Inside Adrian is arranging pet toys on the counter... She
hears the tapping, sees Rocky, and tenses.  Rocky enters.

				ROCKY
		... Wow -- cold!  Good night
		to catch pneumonia.

Adrian smiles slightly and moves behind the counter.  Rocky
fumbles idly among the pet toys.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Ah -- I came in here for
		somethin'... Oh, yeah, would
		ya like somebody to walk ya
		home?

The girl wants to say yes but a tremendous inferiority
complex will not permit it... Rocky understands.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Hey, how's my buddy doin'?
			(looks into
			Butkus' cage)
		-- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see
		ya later.

				ADRIAN
		... Goodnight, Rocky.

Rocky exits.  Adrian watches his departure with mixed
emotions.

EXT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

A short while later Rocky arrives at Andy's Bar... He throws
the Colonel Sanders bag and bones in a large public litter
can.  The trash can has a bicentennial picture of George
Washington pointing at a pile of garbage.  The caption
reads, "There was no litter at Valley Forge!"
 

									20.


INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

Rocky enters the bar.  He sits the Drunk in a booth...
Several drinkers wave at him.  OLD ANDY sets a mug of beer
in front of him... Rocky seems to be looking for someone.

				ROCKY
		Catch pneumonia out there --
		Seen Paulie?

Andy casually nods towards the men's room.

Rocky traverses the room and passes TWO DRUNKS leaning on
the bar.

INT. ANDY'S RESTROOM - NIGHT

Rocky enters the restroom... It is a vile stench hole with
years of the remnants of many sick drunks caked on the wall.

PAULIE is presently trying to comb his hair in the only
remaining piece of mirror in the room... Paulie is in his
early thirties.  He is medium height.  Brown hair.  Square
shouldered.  He has a foul personality... A classic
misanthrope.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Paulie.

				PAULIE
			(very drunk)
		Yo, Rocky -- Look at this
		mirror.  I'd like to kill the
		friggin' moron who broke this
		mirror.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Paulie.

				PAULIE
		What?

				ROCKY
		Your sister's givin' me the
		shoulder.

				PAULIE
		Forget her.  You could do
		better than my sister.

				ROCKY
		Every mornin', every night I
		pass by -- I smile.
				(MORE)
 

									21.


				ROCKY (CONT'D)
		I say jokes.  Nothin'.  She
		looks at me.

				PAULIE
			(annoyed)
		Looks, huh?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, like I was a plate of
		leftovers -- Somethin' wrong
		with my face -- Whatta I need,
		a Caddy to connect with ya
		sister?

				PAULIE
		My sister's a friggin' loser.

				ROCKY
		Hey --

				PAULIE
		Sometimes she gets me so
		crazy, I'd like to split her
		head with a razor.

				ROCKY
		Don't get mental, man.

				PAULIE
		Ya caught me in a bad mood.

				ROCKY
		Ya always in a bad mood --

				PAULIE
		... Adrian ain't sharp.

The restroom stench is overwhelming... Rocky covers his nose
with the neckline of his t-shirt.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		She's a loser -- She don't
		enjoy life -- She reads --
		Brainy -- Pushin' thirty
		friggin' years old!  She's
		gonna die alone if she don't
		wise up.

				ROCKY
		I'm thirty myself.
 

									22.


				PAULIE
		An' you're dyin' alone, too.

				ROCKY
		I don't see no crowd around
		you, neither.

				PAULIE
			(pointing at
			the wall)
		I wanna kill the friggin'
		moron who broke the mirror.

				ROCKY
		Let's get outta this stink.

INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

The restroom door opens.  Rocky guides Paulie out.  Though
stumbling, Paulie talks as he walks.

				PAULIE
		The girl's dryin' up!  She's
		gotta live a little before her
		body dries up!!  You're a pal,
		Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to
		her?  Y'know, it's Thanksgivin'
		tomorrow.

				ROCKY
		... Sure.

				PAULIE
		Tomorrow you come for some
		bird, right?

				ROCKY
		Absolutely...

Paulie smiles and Rocky guides him to a booth... Rocky steps
to the bar.  Andy leans over to him.

				ANDY
		That was alotta crap to go
		through for a dinner invite.

Rocky shakes his head no and raises his eyes towards a
suspended television... the nightly sports broadcast is on.
The SPORTS COMMENTATOR is at the airport and about to
interview the heavyweight champion of the world, APOLLO
CREED.  Creed is twenty-eight years old.  He is a tall,
smooth-muscled Black with barely a scar on his light coffee-
colored face...
 

									23.


He is followed by an entourage of mixed trainers and
cornermen.  Also tagging alone is a small group of hangers-on.

The Commentator interviews Creed as he and his followers
disembark a private jet.

				COMMENTATOR
		How was the flight, Champ?

				APOLLO
		Very high an' very fast.

Apollo's crowd smiles almost automatically at everything he
says.

				COMMENTATOR
		Apollo, how would you rate
		this last British challenger,
		Henry Wilcoxson?

				APOLLO
		He was big, an' very nasty so
		I destroyed him in a hurry --
		Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac
		Lee Green next month.

				COMMENTATOR
		You're referring to the much
		publicized bicentennial fight?

				APOLLO
		That's right -- It's gonna be
		the greatest sportin' event in
		this country's history -- A
		gala occurrence!

				COMMENTATOR
		Still to be held in
		Philadelphia?

				APOLLO
		The Bicentennial Heavyweight
		Championship of the World is
		gonna be held in the only
		place it can be held --
		Philadelphia! -- the nation's
		cradle -- January First -- the
		first major event of our two
		hundredth year.

				COMMENTATOR
		Where're you off to now?

Apollo draws his wife close.
 

									24.


				APOLLO
		Me an' my wife are goin' home
		'cause we miss our children
		an' can't go no more time
		without seein' them.

				COMMENTATOR
		Any quick advice for young
		boxing hopefuls?

				APOLLO
			(looks straight
			into the camera)
		... Stay in school an' use
		your brains, dig -- Be a
		lawyer, be a doctor, carry a
		leather briefcase an' forget
		about sports!!  Sports can
		only make ya grunt an' smell --
		Be a thinker not a stinker!!

Apollo's entourage laughs and they move on... The Commentator
faces the camera.

				COMMENTATOR
		Jerry Simpson at Kennedy
		Airport with the Champion,
		Apollo Creed.

The sports show cuts away, but Rocky continues to look at
the television with a pensive stare... Andy has been speaking
the following dialogue over Apollo's broadcast.

				ANDY
		Nobody cares what's happenin'
		in the world of sports
		nomore -- Downhill.  Baseball,
		downhill -- Basketball,
		downhill.  Football's goin',
		too.  Bank on it.  Baseball
		use to be America's best
		sport... Sure -- Nuttin' like
		squattin' through a great
		double header, but now
		baseball's all business.

The news report with Apollo ends.  Andy drinks.

				ANDY
			(continuing)
		Where are the real fighters?
		The pros.  Today we jig clowns.
 

									25.


				ROCKY
		Clown.

				ANDY
		Yeah.

				ROCKY
		He took his best shot an'
		became champ -- What shot did
		you ever take?

				ANDY
		Yo, Rock, you ain't happy with
		yourself?  Fine.  But me, I
		gotta business here -- I don't
		need to take no shot.

Becoming despondent, Rocky rises and crosses to Paulie
slumped unconscious in the booth.

Rocky exits the bar... Andy turns to his customers.

				ANDY
			(continuing; boldly)
		Take a shot, he says! -- Sure,
		I'll take a shot!

Laughing, Andy pours himself a shot.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT

Rocky passes an all-night sandwich shop... In the window
hangs the sign "ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP, INC." Out front are
several YOUNG MEN and WOMEN.  They are much too young to be
out so late... A boy with a badly-chipped tooth beckons to
Rocky.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(aggressively)
		Yo, Rocks, buy us sum wine, man.

				ROCKY
		... No wine -- Bad for ya'
		brain.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		C'mon, man, it's cold, man.

				ROCKY
		No wine.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Yo, Rock, gimme a dollar.
 

									26.


				ROCKY
		Why?

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(sarcastically)
		'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme
		a dollar.

				ROCKY
		No dollar.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Hey, give Rocky a dime.

				YOUNG MAN #2
		... How come?

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		So he can call all his friends.

				ROCKY
			(mildly embarrassed)
		... That's an old one.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		Buy us some Thunderbird, man.

Rocky ignores the statement and faces a very young girl who
is smoking and leaning whore-like against the wall.

				ROCKY
		Is that Marie? -- Marie, ya
		brother know you're hangin'
		out so late?

The girl, MARIE, assumes an indifferent attitude, attempting
to impress her friends.

				MARIE
		... Screw you.

				ROCKY
			(awed)
		What'd you say?

				MARIE
		... Screw you, yoyo.

The gang laughs.  Angered and shocked, Rocky grabs her arm.

				ROCKY
		Did these guys teach you to
		talk dirty?  Huh?
 

									27.


				MARIE
		Hey --

				ROCKY
		What?

				MARIE
		Stuff it, man!

				ROCKY
			(shakes her)
		Don't you never say that --
			(to the gang)
		-- You guys talk like that in
		front of a little girl -- You
		guys are scum.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
		This is our place, dig!

The gang reluctantly backs up a step.

				ROCKY
		Don't ya never come round this
		girl -- Go home.

				YOUNG MAN #2
		This is our corner, man!  You
		go, chump!

Rocky moves forward and they scatter... They quickly move off.

				CHIPPED TOOTH
			(backpedaling)
		We'll kill you, man -- We
		gotta gun.

				ROCKY
		Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent
		ya face!

Rocky leads the girl away.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rocky is walking the young girl home... They are presently
cutting through a dark public school yard.  They pass
through the beams of light cast off by weak flood lights
located at the top of the school building.  The atmosphere
is somewhat eerie.
 

									28.


				ROCKY
		How come ya wanna hang out
		with those guys?  They teach
		ya bad things.

				MARIE
		I like 'em.  If you don't you
		can f--

				ROCKY
		Hey!  When I was your age,
		there was only one girl who
		talked like that in the whole
		neighborhood.

				MARIE
			(bored)
		... Yeah.

She attempts to light a cigarette... Rocky nonchalantly
tosses it to the ground.

				ROCKY
		Make your teeth yella --

				MARIE
		I like yella teeth.

				ROCKY
		Makes your breath like garbage.

				MARIE
		Maybe I like garbage.

Rocky and Marie take a shortcut through a dark school yard.

				ROCKY
		Nobody likes garbage --
		Anyway, this girl with the
		dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin',
		but the guys wouldn't take her
		out for any serious datin'.

				MARIE
		Why?

				ROCKY
		'Cause that's the way guys
		are -- They laugh when ya talk
		dirty.  They think ya cute for
		a while, but then ya getta
		reputation an' watch out.
				(MORE)
 

									29.


				ROCKY (CONT'D)
		Nobody's ever gonna take ya
		serious.  Ya get no respect...
		I gotta use a bad word --
		Whore.  You'll end up maybe
		becomin' a whore.

				MARIE
		C'mon, Rocky.  I'm twelve.

				ROCKY
		That doesn't matter -- You
		don't really have to be a
		whore, just act like one an'
		that's it.

				MARIE
		What?

				ROCKY
		Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty
		years from now people will say
		'D'you remember Marie?' 'No,
		who was she?' 'She was that
		little whore who hung out at
		the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh,
		now I remember!'... See, they
		don't remember you, they
		remember the rep.

Rocky and Marie exit the dark school yard... Standing in the
shadows of the building are three young muggers.  The light
from their cigarettes flares red in their faces.

The muggers pace Rocky across the street and follow them
down the block... Rocky sees them and stops and faces the
three.  The muggers pause and study Rocky from a distance of
twenty yards.  Rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his
nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders...
The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander
away.

Rocky turns to Marie who has been standing behind him.

				ROCKY
			(points down
			the block)
		... That's your house, ain't it?

Marie nods.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Listen, I hope ya don't --
 

									30.


				MARIE
		I won't.

				ROCKY
		What was I gonna say?

				MARIE
		Ya hope I don't keep acting
		like a whore or I'll turn into
		one, right?

				ROCKY
		Ya, somethin' like that.

They exchange smiles and Marie moves away.  Rocky has made
an impact on her life.

				MARIE
		Goodnight, Rocky.

				ROCKY
		'Night, Marie.

She takes a few more steps and pauses again.

				MARIE
		... Fuck you, Creepo!!!

The girl runs to her house as Rocky looks on in dismay.

				ROCKY
			(walks off)
		... Yeah, who're you to give
		advice, Creepo.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

APOLLO CREED and his LAWYER and TRAINER are seated in the
offices of MILES JERGENS.  Jergens, a successful promoter
looks unhappy as he looks into the scowling face of Apollo
Creed.

				LAWYER
		Are the doctor's reports
		confirmed?

				JERGENS
		Definitely --
			(reading)
		-- It says here, Mac Lee Green
		has suffered a seriously
		cracked third metacarpal in
		his left hand.
 

									31.


				APOLLO
		Damn.

				JERGENS
		I suppose we could cancel the
		fight indefinitely if you are
		set on fighting Green.

				TRAINER
		It ain't just Green, what
		about the time Apollo's
		invested --

				JERGENS
		I believe we can find a
		solution.

				APOLLO
		Solution, nothin' -- What
		about the Bicentennial fight.

				LAWYER
		Jergens, don't play games with
		my client!  Apollo has already
		done nearly a million dollars
		worth of publicity --

				TRAINER
		Ten million's worth!

				LAWYER
		-- And has made contractual
		obligations with over twenty
		different organizations -- He
		doesn't want to be embarrassed.

				APOLLO
		You best find me another
		ranked contender an' I mean in
		a flash, man!

				JERGENS
			(holding up
			some notes)
		I contacted Ernie Roman's
		manager, he's fighting in
		France the same week.

				APOLLO
		Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's
		ranked fifth.
 

									32.


				JERGENS
		Shaw's fighting in South
		America -- Why not postpone
		the bout until July Fourth?

				LAWYER
		Hell with Fourth of July, man!
		Ten thousand things'll be
		goin' down on the Fourth of
		July! -- Apollo wants to be
		first!

				JERGENS
		That may not be possible, Jimmy.

				TRAINER
		This man here is the Star,
		dig -- Don't cause him to
		breathe heavy -- Now what
		'bout that sucker, Billy Dukes?

				JERGENS
		Went to California and gained
		fifty pounds -- and I called
		every worthwhile contender,
		but they say five weeks isn't
		enough time to get in shape.

Apollo stands beneath a new fight poster and points to it.

				APOLLO
		Shape, nothin' -- They're
		afraid.  They know everybody
		in the world's gonna see this
		fight an' none of them gotta
		prayer of beating me so
		they're makin' excuses so they
		don't have to be the chump
		that's gonna be whipped in
		front of the whole civilized
		world!!

				JERGENS
		Apollo, I'm sure there's a way
		to salvage this.

				TRAINER
		Nobody wants to be dissected
		on the country's birthday.
 

									33.


				JERGENS
		All I can counter with is that
		I'm a goddamn good promoter --
		I've promoted in every country
		in the world -- and I've tried
		to the best of my abilities.
		Perhaps you're right, and no
		one wants to be beat on the
		country's birthday... I don't
		know what else to say --

				APOLLO
		I do -- Maybe what this fight
		needs is something new -- a
		novelty.

				TRAINER
		You's the novelty, Champ!

				APOLLO
		Give my main man a raise!!

Everyone laughs.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		Now here's what's goin' down.
		Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say
		this but one time.  On January
		first, the first day of the
		Bicentennial I'm gonna fight
		me a local poor underdog, dig?
		A snow-white underdog.  An'
		I'm gonna put his face on this
		poster with me, hear?  An'
		I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm
		sentimental -- An' all the
		people in the country all
		sentimental, man, an' they'd
		like nothin' better than me,
		Apollo Creed, to let some
		unknown get a shot at the
		greatest title in the world on
		this country's biggest birthday.
		Now that's the way I see it
		an' that's the way I want it!!

				JERGENS
		... It's very American.

				APOLLO
		No, man, it's very smart.
 

									34.


EXT. STREET - DAY

Late that afternoon Mr. Gazzo's white 1970 Cadillac pulls up
to Rocky's apartment... Rocky is in the back seat with the
loan shark.  Gazzo's bodyguard is driving.

Gazzo flips through a small black notepad.

				ROCKY
		Next Wednesday I grab a grand
		from Snyder.  An' Thursday two
		yards from Cappoli, okay?

				GAZZO
		No, two yards from Snyder, an'
		a grand from Cappoli.

				ROCKY
		Ya sure?

				GAZZO
		Hey, screw ya brain on right.
		Now, who's this girl you're
		going out with tonight?

				ROCKY
		How'd you know?

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		You think I don't hear things?

				ROCKY
		Paulie's sister.

				BODYGUARD
			(abrasively)
		Hear she's retarded.

				ROCKY
			(dryly)
		She ain't retarded, she's shy.

				BODYGUARD
		Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards
		like the zoo.

				ROCKY
		Does that bum have to say that?

The Bodyguard reddens... Gazzo motions to his Bodyguard to
relax.
 

									35.


				GAZZO
		Buddy's in a bad mood --
		prostate problems.

				ROCKY
		He's always in a bad mood.
			(laughs)
		Count ya blessin's.  Ya a
		healthy person -- ya legs
		work -- ya hands work --

The Bodyguard has been looking at Rocky with murderous eyes.

				BODYGUARD
		I don't like ya face.

				ROCKY
		Don't like yours neither.

				BODYGUARD
		Kiss my ass.

				ROCKY
		Move your shoulders down.

Mr. Gazzo is amused.  He steps out of the car, followed by
Rocky.

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		Buddy's got a thing against
		ya, Rock.  Some people just
		hate for no reason, y'know.

				ROCKY
		Yeah.

				GAZZO
		Here's fifty bucks -- You an'
		the girl have a nice time.

				ROCKY
		Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.

Rocky enters his apartment and Gazzo drives off.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

The SCENE REVERTS BACK TO Miles Jergens' office.  Apollo
pores over a large record book.

				APOLLO
		How 'bout this Billy Snow?
 

									36.


				JERGENS
		Fouls.

				APOLLO
		How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?

				TRAINER
		Too old, dull fighter.
			(points at a name)
		Bobby Judge is a good boy.

				APOLLO
		... I don't feel heat from the
		name.

				JERGENS
		Joe Zack is a good prospect --
		Exciting boy.

				APOLLO
		... Still don't feel no heat.

				JERGENS
			(sighs)
		Exactly what are you looking
		for, Apollo?

				APOLLO
		... This man.

Everybody leans forward.

				APOLLO
			(continuing;
			much amused)
		'The Italian Stallion' -- He's
		my man.

				JERGENS
		Rocky Balboa -- His record's
		poor --

				APOLLO
		Don't matter -- That name.
		'The Italian Stallion,' it's
		right on.
			(laughs)
		Who discovered America?  An
		Italian, right?  So, man, what
		could be better than to get it
		on with one of his ancestors --

				TRAINER
		He won't last one round.
 

									37.


				APOLLO
		Listen, I gonna carry this boy
		three rounds, then drop 'im
		like a bad habit.

				TRAINER
		I don't like you messin' with
		southpaws -- They do everything
		wrong.

				APOLLO
		Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop
		'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed
		meets the Italian Stallion.'
		Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn
		monster movie!!

Everyone laughs.

						FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - DUSK

Rocky and Paulie walk towards his house... Even though it is
cold and dark, a group of kids conduct an energetic game of
half-ball. (Half-ball is a variation of stick-ball.)

				ROCKY
			(mimes throwing)
		I usta be deadly at half-ball.

				PAULIE
		I hate the friggin' game...
		I'd like to talk some business.

				ROCKY
		What kinda business?

				PAULIE
		Look at my hands -- See how
		the joints are swollen.

Paulie extends his thick hands and tries to make a fist.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in
		an' out of a freezer carryin'
		meat plays hell on the joints.

				ROCKY
		Maybe ya should see a doctor.
 

									38.


				PAULIE
		I don't need a doctor, I need
		a different job.

				ROCKY
		Maybe another job is the best
		thing.

				PAULIE
		Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo.
		Tell him I'm a friend an'
		would do a good job... Tell
		him I ain't bothered by
		nothin' an' would be a great
		collector... Bustin' bones
		don't bother me -- Tell him
		I'm a good worker.

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's gotta come to you.

				PAULIE
		I'm askin' ya to go to him --
		As a favor.

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's gotta come to you --
		Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job --
		Do what you do now.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - DUSK

They continue past the Atomic Hoagie Shoppe, Inc... A group
of young men pitch quarters on the sidewalk out front.

Rocky pauses... He sees Marie, the little girl from the
night before, hanging around with the guys.  She sees Rocky.

Marie takes a deep drag on her cigarette and faces the
opposite direction... The gang smiles and continues to pitch
quarters.

Anger and disappointment register across Rocky's face.

				PAULIE
		You know her?

Rocky shrugs and the two men move off... Filling the night
air is the METALLIC SOUND of pitching QUARTERS.

EXT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The men arrive at Paulie's home.  It is at the top of a
dimly-lit four story walk-up.
 

									39.


				ROCKY
		Ya sister knows I'm comin'?

				PAULIE
		Yeah, sure -- She's very
		excited.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paulie unlocks the apartment door and enters... Rocky
stiffly follows.  Paulie's sister steps out of the kitchen.
A large serving spoon is in her hand... The TV is on.

She stops short and eyes Rocky... She is visibly unsettled
by Rocky's unexpected presence.

				ADRIAN
			(weakly)
		Paulie, you're late.

She looks at Rocky again.

				PAULIE
		Did you call the hospital?
			(to Rocky)
		If I'm ten minutes late, she
		calls the hospital.

Adrian enters the bedroom and slams the door... Paulie
follows.  An argument ensues and Rocky overhears.

OVER the argument is HEARD a SPORTS BROADCAST rising from
the TELEVISION.

				COMMENTATOR (V.O.)
		... Unfortunate luck for
		fifth-ranked heavyweight, Mac
		Lee Green.  The slugging
		fighter acquired a serious
		fracture in his left hand
		after an aggressive day of
		sparring -- Champion Apollo
		Creed says he'll be 'shopping
		for another victim,' to fill
		Green's vacancy for the
		Bicentennial Championship
		Fight to be held in Philly
		next month... By the way,
		rumor has it that this will be
		the most widely-viewed sporting
		event in the entire world --
		and that includes the Super
		Bowl, folks... Today U.S.
		swimmers set a new...
 

									40.


Meanwhile, the argument between brother and sister continues
in the bedroom.

				ADRIAN
		... Paulie, why didn't you
		tell me you were bringing him
		home?!  Look at me, I'm not
		ready for this.

				PAULIE
		Like it would make a difference
		if you were, right?  This
		guy's a friend and now he's
		takin' ya out.

				ADRIAN
		No... I can't!

				PAULIE
		Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom
		an' I don't wanna know from
		nothin'.

				ADRIAN
		Paulie, please --

				PAULIE
		Hey, I want ya out
		instamaticly. -- I'm sicka
		lookin' at ya hangin' around
		like a friggin' spider -- Go
		out -- Live!  Do, enjoy life.

				ADRIAN
		... Like you?

				PAULIE
		Don't get wise with me.  I
		want ya to stop bein' a loser.

				ADRIAN
		I can't go out.

				PAULIE
		Why?

				ADRIAN
		Paulie, it's Thanksgiving.
		I've gotta turkey in the oven.

Paulie turns and leaves the bedroom... He enters the kitchen.
Grabbing a large fork, he opens the oven and spears the
turkey... With the turkey suspended on the end of the fork,
Paulie heaves the dripping bird out the window.
 

									41.


Adrian has seen this and is shattered.  She runs back into
the bedroom and locks the door.

				PAULIE
		!! Ya want the bird, go out in
		the alley an' eat the bird --
		I want ya outta the house --
		Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya
		hungry, Rock?

				ROCKY
		Maybe ya better forget it.

				PAULIE
		Forget nothin' -- Here, talk
		to my sister, tell 'er
		somethin' nice.

Rocky walks over to Adrian's bedroom door and begins speaking
to the enclosed girl.

				ROCKY
		... Yo, Adrian, it's me,
		Rocky... Ah, ah -- Ah, it's
		kinda hard for me to think of
		somethin' to say, y'know --
		'Cause I never talked to a
		door before, I mean whatta ya
		say to a door.

Rocky turns away and begins to walk off.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... Maybe I better forget it.

				PAULIE
		Try again, c'mon, try again.

Rocky goes over to the door and begins speaking again.

				ROCKY
		Ah, Adrian, I know ya ain't
		too happy at this moment, but
		would ya do me a favor -- I
		ain't got nobody to spend
		Thanksgivin' with -- How 'bout
		you an' me goin' out -- Get
		somethin' to eat, maybe laugh
		a little, who knows... Would
		ya like, I dunno, go out
		together?

Adrian opens the door... She already has her winter coat on.
 

									42.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		We'll have a good time.

Paulie opens the front door and gives Rocky an encouraging
smile...

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's ya sister like to do?

				PAULIE
		Ice skate.

				ROCKY
		I didn't want no turkey anyway.

				ADRIAN
		It's Thanksgiving.

				ROCKY
		To you, to me it's Thursday.

INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian enter a deserted skating rink.

				ROCKY
		Looks quiet, y'know.

				ADRIAN
		I think it's closed.

				ROCKY
		I think mebbe we're early or
		somethin' --

From across the rink a CLEANING MAN yells at them.

				CLEANER
		Hey, whatta ya doin' here --
		we're closed... Yo, we're
		closed!

				ROCKY
			(yells back)
		Are ya closed to the General
		Public or to just everybody.
 

									43.


				CLEANER
			(starts to walk over)
		Hey, the rink is empty 'cause
		we're closed -- ya ain't
		allowed in here so do me a
		favor an' not stay here.

				ROCKY
		Wait here, gotta smooth this
		guy out.

				ADRIAN
			(softly)
		We could go somewhere else
		an' --

Rocky approaches the Cleaner.

				CLEANER
		Yo, pal, what's with you --
		The place ain't operatin'.

				ROCKY
		Listen, I gotta problem.  This
		girl ain't feelin' well,
		y'know -- The doctor says she
		should exercise, y'know once
		in awhile an' ice skatin' is
		the best thing --

				CLEANER
		This a con?

				ROCKY
		Look at her, ya can see she
		ain't feelin' good -- needs a
		few minutes exercise --

				CLEANER
		Few minutes?

				ROCKY
		... Ten minutes.

				CLEANER
		Ten minutes for ten dollars.

				ROCKY
		... Yeah, give 'er the Blades.

INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

Adrian has on skates.  Rocky follows her onto the ice.  He
wears street shoes.
 

									44.


				ADRIAN
		... Aren't you skating?

				ROCKY
		Ain't skated since I was
		fifteen -- That's when I
		started fightin' -- gotta
		watch the ankles.  Yeah,
		fightin' use to be tops with
		me, but no more.  All I wanted
		to prove was I weren't no
		bum -- That I had the stuff to
		make a good pro.

				ADRIAN
		And you never got the chance?

The Cleaner yells from the sideline.

				CLEANER
		Nine minutes!

				ROCKY
		Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still
		fight.  Kinda do it like a
		hobby.  See I'm a natural
		southpaw an' most pugs won't
		fight a southpaw 'cause we
		mess up their timin' an' look
		awkward -- Southpaw means
		lefthanded... But I guess in
		the long run things probably
		worked out for the best, right?

				ADRIAN
		But you never had a chance to
		prove yourself.

				ROCKY
		Absolutely.

				CLEANER
		Eight minutes!

Adrian slips and Rocky breaks her fall.

				ROCKY
		I just dislocated my finger.

				ADRIAN
		Ohh!

				CLEANER
		Seven minutes!
 

									45.


				ROCKY
		It ain't your fault -- I
		originally done it in the Baby
		Crenshaw fight.
			(opens his wallet)
		That's me fightin' Big Baby
		Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the
		size of an airplane an' I
		broke my hands on his head --
		I lost, but it's a nice
		picture, don't ya think?

				CLEANER
		Six!

				ROCKY
		How 'bout some Cokes?

				CLEANER
		Cost ya a buck.

				ROCKY
		This guy is beautiful -- get
		the Cokes.

Adrian does a slight turn and Rocky has to speed up and
nearly falls.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		See, I ain't graceful,
		y'know -- I don't move good --
		Stink as a dancer too -- But I
		can really swat, I hit hard,		real hard, but I'm a southpaw
		an' nobody wants to fight a
		southpaw! -- Havin' a good time?

Adrian nods and is very nervous... The Cleaner moves
carefully across the ice.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Y'know how I got started in
		the fight racket?

				ADRIAN
		By accident?

				CLEANER
		Here -- Three minutes.
 

									46.


				ROCKY
		Yeah -- My ol' man who was
		never the sharpest told me --
		I weren't born with much brain
		so I better use my body.

For the first time, Adrian laughs.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's funny?

				ADRIAN
		My mother told me just the
		opposite.  She said, 'You
		weren't born with much of a
		body so you'd better develop
		your brain.'

				CLEANER
		Time!

The Cleaner walks over as Rocky and Adrian get off the ice.

				CLEANER
			(continuing)
		That's ten bucks.

				ROCKY
		I must be goin' deaf 'cause I
		thought ya said, 'ten cents.'

Rocky hands him a dime.

				CLEANER
			(weakly)
		... How 'bout for the Cokes?

				ROCKY
		Charge it.

Rocky and Adrian start to leave.  Rocky pauses at the door
and fishes into his pocket and hands over eleven dollars.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Had ya goin', didn't I, huh?

He grins and leaves.
 

									47.


EXT. STREET - NIGHT

				ROCKY
		Some people are very shy by
		nature.

				ADRIAN
		... I suppose.

				ROCKY
		I would say you're very shy bu
		nature.

				ADRIAN
		... I suppose.

				ROCKY
		Some people think bein' shy is
		a disease, but it don't bother
		me.

				ADRIAN
		It doesn't bother me either.

				ROCKY
		Then why did I bother bringin'
		it up?  'Cause I'm dumb,
		that's why... Y'know, I think
		we make a real sharp coupla
		coconuts -- I'm dumb an'
		you're shy.

				ADRIAN
		... It is just hard for me to
		understand why anybody wants
		to be a fighter.

				ROCKY
		Ya gotta be a little soft to
		wanna be a pug... It's a
		racket where ya' almost
		guaranteed to end up a bum.

				ADRIAN
		I don't think you're a bum.

				ROCKY
		... I'm at least half a bum.
		Yeah, fightin' is a crazy
		racket.  The roughest part is
		the mornin' after.

				ADRIAN
		Morning after?
 

									48.


				ROCKY
		After a rough fight, ya'
		nothin' but a large wound.
		Sometimes I feel like callin'
		a taxi to drive me from my bed
		to the bathroom... Ya' eyes
		hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair
		even hurts... But the thing
		I'm proud of is I been in over
		sixty fights an' never had a
		busted nose -- Bent an'
		twisted an' bitten but never
		broke... That's rare.

				ADRIAN
		Why do you do it if it hurts
		so bad?

				ROCKY
		... Guess.

				ADRIAN
			(pause)
		'Cause you can't sing or dance?

Rocky smiles.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian enter his one-room apartment... She is
nervous and taken aback by the bleakness of the room...
Rocky goes to the icebox.

				ROCKY
		Would ya like a glass of water?

				ADRIAN
		... No thanks.

Adrian looks at the mirror above Rocky's dresser.  She sees
a high school photo of Rocky.  He once was handsome and
smooth-faced... Rocky steps up behind her and his face is
reflected in the mirror.

He turns on his cheap RECORD PLAYER... He reaches into the
turtle bowl.

				ROCKY
		Here's the guys I was tellin'
		ya about -- This is Cuff an'
		Link.

				ADRIAN
		I sold them to you.
 

									49.


				ROCKY
			(very embarrassed)
		... Oh, yeah, I bought the
		whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me
		the turtles, the bowl, an' the
		mountain -- I had to get rid
		of the mountain 'cause they
		kept fallin' off.

				ADRIAN
		Do you have a phone?

				ROCKY
		I had it pulled.  People
		callin' all the time.  Who
		needs it -- Who'd you wanna
		call?

				ADRIAN
		I wanna let my brother know
		where I am.

				ROCKY
		D'you really wanna call?

				ADRIAN
		Yes, I do.

				ROCKY
		You sure?

				ADRIAN
		Yes.

				ROCKY
		Why?

				ADRIAN
		I think he might be worried.

				ROCKY
		I'll call your brother.

Rocky flings open the window and bellows like a foghorn.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		!!Yo, Paulie -- Ya sister's
		with me!  I'll call ya later.

Rocky closes the window and faces the woman... She is not
smiling.  She looks frightened.
 

									50.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		What's the matter?  Ya don't
		like the room?

				ADRIAN
		It's fine.

				ROCKY
		It's only temporary.

				ADRIAN
		It's not that --

				ROCKY
		What's the problem?  You don't
		like me -- Don't like the
		turtles -- What is it?

				ADRIAN
		I don't think I belong here.

				ROCKY
		It's okay.

				ADRIAN
		No, I don't belong here.

				ROCKY
		It's all right -- You're my
		guest.

				ADRIAN
		... I've never been in a man's
		apartment before.

				ROCKY
			(gesturing)
		They're all the same.

				ADRIAN
		I'm not sure I know you well
		enough -- I don't think I'm
		comfortable.

				ROCKY
		Yo, I'm not comfortable either.

				ADRIAN
			(standing)
		I should leave.
 

									51.


				ROCKY
		But I'm willin' to make the
		best of this uncomfortable
		situation.

Adrian moves to the door... Rocky intercepts her.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; softly)
		Would ya take off your glasses?

				ADRIAN
			(dumbstruck)
		What?

				ROCKY
		The glasses... Please.

Rocky removes her glasses and looks deeply into her eyes.

				ADRIAN
			(timidly)
		... T-thank you.

				ROCKY
		Do me another favor?

				ADRIAN
		... What?

				ROCKY
		Could ya take off that hat.

After a moment, Adrian removes the hat... She is becoming
rather pretty.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I always knew you was pretty.

				ADRIAN
		Don't tease me.

The woman melts into the corner and begins lightly sobbing...
Rocky steps forward and fences her with his arms and body.

				ROCKY
		I wanna kiss ya -- Ya don't
		have to kiss me back if ya
		don't feel like it.

Rocky softly kisses the woman... Her arms hang limp.  He
puts more passion into the kiss and she starts to respond.
Her hand glides like smoke up his back.
 

									52.


She embraces his neck.  The dam of passion erupts.  She
gives herself freely for the first time in thirty years.

EXT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

The following day, Rocky strolls down the street to
Goldmill's Gym... Out front a group of young blacks stop
talking and study Rocky as he passes.  Rocky's eyebrows knit
in confusion.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

Rocky climbs the stairs and enters the gym...

... In a matter of seconds, his presence is known and the
athletes stare in wonderment... The big black heavyweight
contender, Dipper, throws down his towel in disgust and
turns away.

Mike quietly approaches Rocky.

				MIKE
		Hey, Rock -- What happened?

				ROCKY
		'Bout what?

Mickey Goldmill steps out of his office...

				MICKEY
		Did ya get the message, kid?

				ROCKY
		Message -- What message?

Mickey pulls out a card from his breast pocket... He hands
it to Rocky.

				MICKEY
		A Rep from Miles Jergens'
		Promotions was lookin' for
		ya -- They need sparrin'
		partners for Creed.

				ROCKY
		Ya puttin' me on?

				MICKEY
		Here's the card?

				ROCKY
		When was they here?
 

									53.


				MICKEY
		'Bout an hour ago.

				ROCKY
		Probably lookin' for sparrin'
		partners.

				MICKEY
		... I said that before.

Rocky turns from Mickey and jogs out of the gym.  Mickey
fumbles with his rosary beads.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		... Waste of life.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY

Rocky steps off a bus in mid-town Philadelphia.  He hurries
down Broad Street.  Every few steps he breaks into a trot...
He enters a skyscraper.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - HALL - DAY

Rocky exits the elevator and enters the office of Miles
Jergens' Productions.

INT. JERGENS' PRODUCTIONS - DAY

The SECRETARY is slightly startled by Rocky's excited
expression.

				SECRETARY
		May I help you?

Rocky hands her the business card.

				SECRETARY
			(continuing)
		Your name, please?

				ROCKY
		Balboa, Rocky Balboa.

The Secretary rises and enters Jergens' office... Rocky eyes
the multitude of sporting pictures hanging on all four walls.

The Secretary returns.

				SECRETARY
		You may go in.

Rocky collects himself and enters...
 

									54.


INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

Miles Jergens warmly greets him.

				JERGENS
		Hello, Mr. Balboa -- I'm Miles
		Jergens -- Please, have a seat.

				ROCKY
		... Thanks.

				JERGENS
		Mr. Balboa --

				ROCKY
			(overriding)
		Rocky.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, do you have any
		representation?  A manager?

				ROCKY
		No -- Just me.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, would you be interested
		in --

				ROCKY
		Sparrin'?

				JERGENS
		Excuse me.

				ROCKY
		I know ya need sparrin'
		partners -- I'm very available.

				JERGENS
		I'm sure you are.

				ROCKY
		Absolutely -- Sparrin' with
		the Champ would be an honor --
		y'know what?

				JERGENS
		What?

				ROCKY
		I wouldn't take no cheap shots.
		I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
 

									55.


Jergens seems very amused.  He lights a cigar.

				JERGENS
		Rocky, would you be interested
		in fighting Apollo Creed for
		the Championship?

				ROCKY
		... Like I said, I'd make a
		boss sparrin' mate.

				JERGENS
		Did you hear what I said?

				ROCKY
		Sure, an' I'm smart enough to
		know that no sparrin' partner
		should take cheap shots at the
		Champ.  He's just there to
		help condition the man.

				JERGENS
		Not spar, I'm asking whether
		you would be interested in
		fighting Creed for the
		championship.

The weight of the statement comes crashing down in Rocky.
For a long moment he becomes nothing more than a basket case
as he ponders the statement... He half regains his senses.

				ROCKY
		... Ah... Absolutely.

The SCENE FADES and becomes a black and white television.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky and Adrian are at her home watching an old black and
white television... Rocky smiles... The film now cuts to
Apollo being interviewed.

				REPORTER #1
		How'd you like the 'City of
		Brotherly Love?'

				APOLLO
		I like my Philadelphia Brothers.
		An' I'm patriotic!

Apollo has to move to the side to avoid a thrusting
microphone.
 

									56.


				APOLLO
			(continuing;
			mock seriousness)
		If yo' don't back up I'm gonna
		send yo' home with a microphone
		in yo' nose!

The Reporters laugh.

				REPORTER #2
		Why did you agree to fight a
		man who has virtually no
		chance of winning?

				APOLLO
		If history proves one thing,
		everybody gotta chance --
		Didn't yo' all ever hear of
		David an' Goliath? -- 'Course
		I woulda knocked out Goliath.

				REPORTER #3
		It is a coincidence that
		you're fighting a white man on
		the most celebrated day in the
		country's history?

				APOLLO
		The same coincidence that he's
		fightin' a black man.

				REPORTER #1
		What're your feelings about
		the challenger?

				APOLLO
		He's Italian.

				REPORTER #1
		What does that mean?

				APOLLO
		It means if he can't fight, I
		bet he can cook!

Rocky and Adrian laugh at the interview... Paulie, her
brother, takes offense.

				PAULIE
		Do me a favor -- His lungs,
		punch 'em out.

				ADRIAN
		Paul.
 

									57.


Rocky's interview now fills the screen.  Rocky squints and
looks nervous under the hot lights.

				REPORTER #2
		This is your largest payday
		ever -- How do you feel about
		it?

				ROCKY
		Feel?  I dunno... Happy.

				REPORTER #2
		How will you fight Apollo Creed?

				ROCKY
			(mind elsewhere)
		Creed's great, ain't he...
		I'll do what I can.

				REPORTER #1
		Where did you get the name,
		'Italian Stallion?'

				ROCKY
		I thought of it 'bout eight
		years ago, when I was eatin'
		dinner.

				REPORTER #2
		Is it true the most you've
		ever made in a prizefight is
		five hundred dollars?

				ROCKY
		Four hundred -- But that was a
		long time ago.

				REPORTER #2
		And now your payday will be
		one hundred and fifty thousand
		dollars.  Any comment?

				ROCKY
		Listen, I wanna say hi to my
		girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!

Adrian blushes and laughs.

				ADRIAN
		Oh, Rocky!

				PAULIE
			(dry)
		Christ.
 

									58.


				ADRIAN
		You didn't!

				ROCKY
		Sure I did.  You heard.

They continue to watch the remainder of the interview... The
head COMMENTATOR is looking directly into the camera.

				COMMENTATOR
		A Bicentennial Fight --
		January first.  It will be the
		first sporting event on our
		two hundredth birthday and is
		already being called by many
		the greatest farce in sports
		history.  If this man lasts
		more than a minute I would say
		he's on borrowed time.
			(sarcastically)
		It's matches like this with
		their exorbitant prices that
		give sports a bad name -- Not
		only is this match bad,
		people, it's sad!  Why a Rocky
		Balboa?  At the State Athletic
		Commission, Larry Duggan
		reporting.

				PAULIE
			(irate)
		The guy's a friggin' moron.

				ROCKY
		Why?

				PAULIE
		Don't it matter none he's
		makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd
		break his lips.

				ROCKY
		It don't matter.

				PAULIE
		He's takin' cheap shots.

				ROCKY
		It don't bother me none.

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be
		lookin' for people to help,
		right?
 

									59.


				ROCKY
		Help what?

				PAULIE
		Y'know, to help keep ya livin'
		clean.

				ROCKY
		I'll do okay.

				PAULIE
		Ya gotta have a guy help ya
		exercise, mebbe somebody to be
		standin' by with a towel or
		run errands, y'know.

				ROCKY
		Hey, who cared about me
		yesterday, huh?  Nobody -- I
		think I'm gonna train myself.

				PAULIE
		Without havin' good people
		around, ya won't have such a
		good chance.

Adrian is not happy with her brother's overbearing attitude.
She faces him.

				ADRIAN
		Einstein flunked out of
		school... twice.

				PAULIE
		That so.

				ADRIAN
		Roosevelt finished last in his
		class -- Beethoven was deaf,
		an' Helen Keller was blind --
		I think Rocky has a good chance.

INT. HALLWAY OF PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky stands in Adrian's doorway.  He kisses her.

				ROCKY
		See ya tomorrow.

Rocky moves down the stairway and continues to do so as he
converses with Adrian who remains upstairs.  His VOICE
ECHOES up the stairwell.
 

									60.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		How'd ya like hearin' ya name
		on TV?

				ADRIAN
		I don't know -- I was shocked.
		Why did you do that?

				ROCKY
		Ya puttin' me on, right?

				ADRIAN
			(smiles)
		Absolutely -- What time should
		I expect you?

				ROCKY
		'Bout seven.

				ADRIAN
		I'll be waiting.

Rocky is now on the ground floor yelling up to Adrian on the
top floor landing.

				ROCKY
		Y'know how I said that stuff
		on television didn't bother me?

				ADRIAN
		Yes.

				ROCKY
		It did.

As Rocky completes the last word, he exits the building and
slams the door which RESOUNDS throughout the apartment house.

EXT. ATOMIC HOAGIE SHOP - NIGHT

Gazzo, the bodyguard, and Rocky are standing out front.
They are eating hot sandwiches.

				ROCKY
		Y'know I won't be able to work
		for ya no more.

				GAZZO
		Hey -- if a good man can make
		a better life, let him make it.

				ROCKY
		I feel bad about walkin'.
 

									61.


				GAZZO
		Take your shot, kid -- You got
		money for trainin' expenses?

				ROCKY
		A few bucks.

Gazzo takes out a wad and peels off several bills.

				GAZZO
		Here's five hundred -- Put it
		in your glove.

				ROCKY
		Do I have to pay juice?

Gazzo looks at the Bodyguard and shakes his head as if to
imply, "Why's this guy asking such a foolish question?"

Gazzo and the bodyguard step to the white Caddy parked at
the curb.  They enter the cab.  Rocky watches.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

				GAZZO
			(smiles)
		Does Santa Claus charge juice?
		Merry Christmas -- Now, how's
		about my present, ya gonna win?

				ROCKY
		Gonna try.

				GAZZO
		Listen, kid, I'm with ya.  Ya
		know, I'm with ya -- Italian,
		we're blood.  You kill this
		rug -- We Guinneas gotta show
		these Afro-Americans where
		it's at.  Give it your best
		shot cause I want ya to prove
		to these bums on the corner
		that my man can't be beat by
		this rug... Ya got any action
		on the side.

				ROCKY
		No action.

				GAZZO
		Ya gettin 150 grand killer.
		Ya got any plans for it?
		Whatta ya think?
				(MORE)
 

									62.


				GAZZO (CONT'D)
		Ya like to put it on the
		street, make it work for ya?

				ROCKY
		I'm gonna do somethin with it.

				GAZZO
		Sure, you do what ya want.
		Stay away from the stock market.

				ROCKY
		Black market?

				GAZZO
		Same thing.  Ya know, Rock,
		remember when we was kids, we
		fought together.  An' I wasn't
		well an' ya had to beat up
		that Irish kid -- what's his
		name? -- Gallager -- I bought
		a suit and became a businessman.
		You put on gloves.  An' I
		remember Mama almost cried,
		may she rest in peace -- an'
		our ol' man who said ya had no
		brains -- I'd like to lay
		hands on that bastard.  You
		ain't never had any luck.
		Even when I owned you in '66
		you never had luck.  But now I
		think you might be gettin'
		some luck kid.  Whatta you
		think?

Rocky smiles and Gazzo gets into his car.  Rocky follows him
across the street.

				ROCKY
		Yo, you gonna show, Tony?

				GAZZO
		Where else am I gonna go.
			(to Bodyguard)
		Bet three grand on Rocky.

				BODYGUARD
		He's a bum -- are you kiddin?

				GAZZO
			(slaps Bodyguard)
		No!  I'm not kiddin!

Rocky walks away.
 

									63.


INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky returns home and enters his apartment.  After turning
on the light, he flips on his RECORD PLAYER.  He now feeds
the turtles.

				ROCKY
		Look who's home!

Rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold.  He
approaches them with a sense of awe.  He opens and reads one.
Settling on the bed, he reads the other.

A KNOCK is HEARD.  Rocky opens the door.  Mickey Goldmill,
the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway.

				MICKEY
			(stiffly)
		I seen the light.  I figure
		somebody was home.

				ROCKY
		Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin'
		here?  Here, sit down.

Rocky tosses soiled clothing off a mangled armchair.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Best seat in the house -- Hey,
		Mick, this is too much.

				MICKEY
		How do you mean?

				ROCKY
		I'm usta seein' ya at the gym,
		but seein' ya here, in my
		house, it's kinda outta joint.

By the manner in which Goldmill listens, it is obvious
something important is preying on his mind.

Rocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at
having outsiders see how he lives.

				MICKEY
		Listen, Rock, you're a very
		lucky guy.

				ROCKY
		Yeah.
 

									64.


				MICKEY
		What's happened is freak luck.

				ROCKY
		Freak luck for sure.

				MICKEY
		Look at all them other fighters.
		Real good boys.  Good records.
		Colorful.  Fight their hearts
		out for peanuts -- But who
		cared?  Nobody.  They got it
		shoved in their back door.
		Nobody ever give them a shot
		at the title...

				ROCKY
			(uneasy)
		Freak luck is a strange thing.

Mickey does not hear.  His attention is drawn to the turtles.

				MICKEY
		Whatta' those?

				ROCKY
		Turtles -- domestic turtles.

				MICKEY
			(businesslike)
		I'm here tellin' ya to be very
		smart with this shot.  Like
		the Bible sez, ya don't get no
		second chance.

Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Ya need a manager.  An advisor.
		I been in the racket fifty
		years.  I done it all, there
		ain't nothin' about the world
		of pugilism that ain't livin'
		up here.

He lights a half-smoked cigar.

				ROCKY
			(at a loss)
		Fifty years, huh.
 

									65.


				MICKEY
			(stronger)
		Fifty years.  The rep is known
		around Philly, an' a good rep
		can't be bought, but I don't
		have to tell you that.

				ROCKY
		How 'bout a glass of water?

				MICKEY
		Rocky, d'ya know what I done?

				ROCKY
			(uneasy)
		... What?

				MICKEY
			(driving each
			word hard)
		I done it all.  I've done an'
		seen everything'.  Believe
		what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya
		shoulda seen the night in
		Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny'
		Russo outta the ring, September
		14, 1923 -- same night Firpo
		knocked Dempsey outta the ring.
		But who got the Press?  He did.
		He had a manager -- September
		14, 1923.

				ROCKY
			(softly)
		Ya got a good mind for dates.

Mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second.

				MICKEY
		Look at this face -- twenty-
		one stitches over the left
		eye, thirty-four over the
		right -- my nose was busted
		seventeen times, the last
		being the Sailor Mike fight
		New Year's Eve, 1940, in
		Camden, New Jersey -- What a
		professional pastin' I give
		him.  Here, read about it.

				MICKEY (CONT'D)
			(shows a tiny
			press clipping;
			points to
			cauliflower ear)
		An' he give me the vegetable
		on the ear.  I got pain an'
		experience... an' you got
		heart -- kinda remind me of
		Marciano, ya do.

Rocky points to his most prized possession.

				ROCKY
		Nobody ever said that --
		There's his picture.

				MICKEY
		Yeah, ya kinda remind me of
		the Rock.  Ya move like 'im.

Mickey has rung the bell.  Nothing could please Rocky more
than being compared to his idol.

				ROCKY
		Really think so?

				MICKEY
		Ya got heart.

				ROCKY
		Heart, but I ain't got no
		Tocker.

Rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a
crouch.

				MICKEY
		Christ, I know this business.
		Rocky, when I was fightin' it
		was the dirtiest racket goin',
		see.  Pugs like me was treated
		like fightin' dogs -- throw ya
		in the pit an' for ten bucks
		ya try to kill each other.  We
		had no management...
				(MORE)
 

									67.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
		fought in boxcars, in
		whorehouse basements, any
		joint with a floor -- October
		1931 I fought a bum who put a
		tack in the thumb of his glove
		an' punched so many holes in
		my face I had spit shootin'
		outta my cheeks -- I never had
		no manager watchin' out for
		me -- See that picture outside
		the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,'
		that's me in my prime.  I had
		all the tools.  I coulda
		starched any lightweight husky
		on the East Coast -- But I had
		no management.  Nobody ever
		got to know how slick I was,
		but I had a head for business
		an' stashed a few bucks an'
		opened the gym -- It's a dirt
		hole, I know it, but that an'
		a lotta scars is what I got to
		show for fifty years in the
		business, kid -- now you come
		along with this shot an' I
		feel like it's me gettin' the
		shot I never got... Yeah, we
		was treated like dogs -- like
		them Dago's, no offense, in
		the Colosseum in Rome there --
		An' now I got all this
		knowledge, I wanna give it to
		ya so I can protect ya an'
		make sure ya get the best deal
		ya can!

Rocky rises and opens a window.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Respect, I always dished ya
		respect.

				ROCKY
		... Ya gave Dipper my locker.

				MICKEY
			(almost begging)
		I'm sorry, I -- I made a
		mistake.  Kid, I'm askin' man
		to man.  I wanna be ya manager.
 

									68.


				ROCKY
		The fight's set -- I don't
		need a manager.

				MICKEY
		Look, you can't buy what I
		know.  Ya can't.  I've seen it
		all!  I got pain an' I got
		experience.

				ROCKY
		I got pain an' experience too.

				MICKEY
		Please, kid.

				ROCKY
			(tightly)
		Whatever I got, I always got
		on the slide.  This shot's no
		different.  I didn't earn
		nothin' -- I got it on the
		slide... I needed ya help
		about ten years ago when I was
		startin', but ya never helped
		me none.

Mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up... He
remains on one knee.

				MICKEY
		If ya was wantin' my help, why
		didn't ya ask?  Just ask.

				ROCKY
		I asked, but ya never helped
		nothin'! -- Like the Bible
		sez, ya don't get no second
		chance.

				MICKEY
			(yells)
		Rocky, I'm seventy-six years
		old.  Maybe you can be the
		winner I never was -- your
		shot is my last shot!

Rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the
door.

Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves.

Several moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself
into bed.  Springing up a second later, he runs outside.
 

									69.


EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form
of Mickey.  Way in the distance, we SEE Rocky stop the old
man beneath a street lamp.  He places an arm around his
shoulder.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

The following morning, Rocky's ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF at
exactly four A.M.  Not accustomed to rising this early, with
great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to
the bathroom.  He turns the light on and roaches scatter.

At the top of the mirror hang the telegrams.  Rocky fills
the basin and submerges his face in cold water.

Rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs.  He
cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one
swill... his body quivers.

EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN

Rocky steps outside.  He is dressed in a well-worn sweat
suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers.  It is pitch dark and
his steaming breath attests to the cold.

He begins running down the center of the deserted street.
He can only be clearly SEEN as his form passes beneath the
street lamps.

Two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass.

EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAWN

Rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight
of stairs.  He stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear
into the morning gray.  Taking a deep breath, he starts up.
From the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his
legs give way.  Standing, he brushes off and descends the
stairs.

EXT. CITY HALL - DAWN

Rocky passes City Hall and veers to the river.  He pauses,
heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths.  He throws several
lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his
aching sides.  Men delivering the morning papers observe
with amusement.

Rocky forces himself to begin running again.
 

									70.


EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN STATION - DAWN

Heading along Spring Garden Street, Rocky passes beneath an
elevated train station.  The ROARING TRAIN overhead seems to
blend perfectly with his muscular running style.

EXT. DOCKS - DAWN

The sky is beginning to lighten.  The fighter now runs along
the piers and past anchored freighters.

EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

It is five-thirty and Rocky approaches the loading platform
belonging to Eastern Packing Company.  Alongside the loading
platform come several boxcars.

Rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door.  It soon
opens and Paulie guides him inside.  Paulie is drunk.

INT. SHIPPING OFFICE - DAY

				PAULIE
		How ya feelin'?

				ROCKY
			(panting)
		... Tight.

				PAULIE
		I got whiskey here.

				ROCKY
		... No.

Rocky notices TWO PUERTO RICANS lounging alongside theshipping office.

				PAULIE
		This is the guy who's fightin'
		Apollo Creed.

				JOSE
			(heavy accent)
		Good luck -- Kill him, man.

				PAULIE
			(as though
			rehearsed badly)
		Hip -- Hip -- Hooray!  C'mon --
		Hip -- Hip --
 

									71.


				JOSE
			(walks away)
		Hooray, man.

				PAULIE
		Rock'll be comin' by every
		mornin' to pick up some
		Prime -- can't train on that
		store crap.

Rocky smiles and Paulie leads him out of the office and to
the large metal door of a walk-in refrigerator.

INT. FREEZER - DAY

They enter.  The freezer resembles a modern torture chamber...
row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the
darkness to the far end of the refrigerator.  The blower
overhead causes the men to speak loudly.

				PAULIE
			(teasing)
		If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end
		up hangin' on the hook, right?

				ROCKY
		Gazzo's a good man.

				PAULIE
		How 'bout you talk to 'em
		about me?
			(tightly)
		Please do me that favor.

				ROCKY
		Keep this job, ya eat better.

Paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat.  He
swills whiskey from a pint bottle.

				PAULIE
		Y'know, d'ya think you an' my
		sister -- Ah, doin' good
		together?

				ROCKY
		Whatta you think?

				PAULIE
		Ain't sure, what's the story?

				ROCKY
		What?
 

									72.


				PAULIE
		The story -- what's happenin'?

Paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for
quite a while.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Ya really like her?

				ROCKY
		Sure I like her.

				PAULIE
			(nervous laughter)
		What's the attraction?  I
		don't see it?

				ROCKY
		I dunno -- she fills gaps.

				PAULIE
		What gaps?

				ROCKY
			(shrugs and
			takes meat)
		She got gaps.  I got gaps --
		together we fill the gaps.

				PAULIE
			(sharply)
		You ballin' her?

				ROCKY
			(turns around)
		Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
		sister.

				PAULIE
			(tersely)
		C'mon, ya screwin' her?

From across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes.

				ROCKY
		That's why I can't put ya
		together with Gazzo, cause ya
		talk too much -- big mouth.

Paulie reddens.  He steps forward and slams his fists in a
hanging beef.
 

									73.


The punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky
responds.

Rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs.

The grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging
corpse.  Rocky moves to the next one and hooks.

Rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as
though he were locked in total battle.

				PAULIE
		Hit the rump.  The rump!
		Ya'll break the ribs!

Rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of
beef.  Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every
punch, like he were receiving it.  Rocky moves into the dark
recess of the refrigerator.  Only the dull SOUNDS of his
POUNDING FISTS can be HEARD.

Rocky works his way to Paulie again.  Every hanging beef
swings and appears surrealistically alive.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		We do that to Creed an'
		they'll take us to jail for
		murder.

Rocky looks at his hands.  They are drenched in red up to
the elbows with beef blood.

Paulie hands him a package of beef.

				ROCKY
		Don't talk dirty 'bout ya
		sister.

Rocky takes the package and runs out.  Paulie's bleary eyes
reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

The gym is filled to capacity.  The NOISE is DEAFENING.
Rocky pounds a heavy bag.

Mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his
pocket.
 

									74.


				MICKEY
			(passionate)
		Stop!  Stop!  I can't stand it!
		It's clumsy.  You're off
		balance.

He motions to his bullish helper, Mike.  He hands him the
string.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Tie it to both ankles -- Leave
		two feet slack.

				ROCKY
		I never had good footwork.

Mike completes the task.

				MICKEY
		Forget the footwork -- You're
		off balance.  The legs are
		sticking everywhere.  Marciano
		had the same problem, an' the
		string cured it.  When you can
		hit and move without breakin'
		the string you'll have balance.

				MIKE
		You'll be a very dangerous
		person.

Two young boys in street clothes interrupt Mickey.

				BOY
		Rocky, could we have your
		autograph?

				ROCKY
		... Sure.

				MICKEY
			(irate)
		Don't you boys ever interrupt
		when I'm conductin' business,
		or I'll kill you both -- Go
		away.

The boys depart.
 

									75.


				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Autographs!  Ya wanna be a
		writer or a fighter?  Let's
		work.

Mike looks off across the gym.

				MIKE
		... we got visitors.

Mickey strains his eyes to see a group of REPORTERS and NEWS
CAMERAMEN entering his gym.

				MICKEY
			(approaching)
		Can I help you guys?

				REPORTER
			(to Cameraman)
		Set the camera up over there.
			(to Mickey)
		We're from Channel Seven --
		Covering the pre-fight training.

				MICKEY
		I own the place.

The Reporter has a hundred things on his mind... he turns
from Mickey and nods to his crew... the other television
crews rush to set up.

				CAMERAMAN
		Rolling here.

				SOUND MAN
		Speed here.

				REPORTER
			(to the camera)
		We're here at Goldmill's
		Gym -- A Philadelphia landmark
		of sorts since 1929 -- The
		stench of toil permeates every
		corner.  The sweat a trademark
		of a unique profession... Yet,
		the most unique fixture is an
		unprecedented 50 to 1 underdog
		heavyweight named, Rocky Balboa.

The camera turns to Rocky.
 

									76.


				ROCKY
			(to Mickey)
		Should I do this?

Mickey nods and Rocky faces the glaring lights.

				REPORTER
		So much has happened lately --
		Has it changed your life style
		much?

				ROCKY
		... People talk to me more.

				REPORTER
		How're you preparing for this
		Bicentennial bout?

A young punchy fighter yells out:

				FIGHTER
		Readin' fuckin' history books,
		man!

The gym explodes with laughter.

				REPORTER
			(flushed)
		We can cut that out later.
		Apollo Creed says he'll let
		you stay three rounds before
		he puts you away.

				ROCKY
			(honestly)
		Apollo's a great fighter.

				REPORTER
		Do you feel you have a chance?

				ROCKY
		Maybe --

He faces Mickey.  Mickey whispers in his ear.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		I'll tear his head off.

				REPORTER
		Do you have anything derogatory
		to say about the Champion?
 

									77.


				ROCKY
		Derogatory?  Yeah, he's great.

Apollo Creed and his entourage enter the gym.

				APOLLO
			(bellowing)
		I am the Champion of the whole
		world!!!

The gym freezes... everyone turns and stares in wonderment...
Mickey Goldmill shakes his head in disbelief.  He now
realizes it is a publicity stunt.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
			(approaching Rocky)
		Italian Stallion, I come over
		to tell you to be very smart
		an' after this fight donate
		what's gonna be left of your
		body to science, cause after
		this fight what's left won't
		fill a tuna fish can!... So
		beware, Mon Cher!!!

Apollo turns to the cameras... Rocky is speechless.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		This classic fight -- Tha's
		right, this bicentennial
		fight's goin' down in the
		history books 'cause January
		first I'm gonna be the first
		man to bounce another man offa
		the planet Pluto!

Dipper stands in the far ring... the attention Rocky is
receiving makes him a killer.

				APOLLO
			(continuing)
		Now I gots a special
		announcement, y'hear.  For the
		first time in alotta years
		this championship fight is
		gonna be on your home T.V.!
		Free -- 'Course that's just
		for Philly -- My present to
		the city...
				(MORE)
 

									78.


				APOLLO (CONT'D)
		Now some ya'll ain't much on
		likin' me, but ya gotta admit
		Apollo Creed is one DAMN
		generous, 100% pure, government
		inspected, Afro-American Folk
		Hero!!!

Everyone laughs... Dipper moves across the room like a large
snake.  He brushes people aside and steps behind Rocky.  He
nudges him... Rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it.

Dipper pushes harder and Rocky looks questioningly at him.

				DIPPER
			(loud)
		Ya nothin', Boy!

Apollo stops his sales pitch in mid-sentence... The
television crew faces Dipper.

				DIPPER
			(continuing)
		I say ya nothin'!

				MICKEY
		What's happenin' here?

				DIPPER
		I'm happenin'!  This pig is
		takin' my shot -- I iz a
		contender.  He's nothin'.

				ROCKY
			(dumbstruck)
		Yo', Dipper, why're ya --

				DIPPER
			(shaking his fist)
		Spar me in front of these here
		TV dudes -- I knock ya ass to
		Jersey!

Dipper's fat black trainer holds out his hands and Dipper
slaps them soul style.

				MICKEY
			(to Dipper)
		You can forget about sparring,
		kid.

				DIPPER
		Yo' know I iz the best man
		here!  Yo' said so yoself!
 

									79.


				MICKEY
			(almost
			apologetically
			to the crew)
		Why let Rocky here take a
		chance on cuttin' or breakin'
		a hand? -- Take a shower,
		Dipper.

				DIPPER
		Don't mouth me, old man, I'll
		knock yo' out too.  C'mon,
		wop, spar me, let everybody
		see who's got the heat around
		here.

Silence looms over the gym... Apollo is apprehensive.  The
scene is becoming too real.  The frightened television crew
slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment.

				DIPPER
			(continuing; insanely)
		Man, yo' best keep them
		cameras out!  Fight me, boy!
		Let Creed here see the kind of
		punk he's fightin'!

Mike forces his way through the crowd and stands behind Rocky.

				MIKE
		Don't chance it, man -- He's
		sick.

				MICKEY
		This is gettin' outta hand --
		Rocky will fight in the ring
		January first, not here!

				DIPPER
		Yo' yellow, old man.

				MICKEY
		Not yellow, cautious.
			(to the crew)
		See, it's very easy for a
		fighter to accidentally hurt --

Dipper suddenly steps forward and slaps Rocky very hard
across the side of the head... The gym becomes stone cold.
Dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it.
 

									80.


				DIPPER
		If yo're afraid to fight me,
		then get down an' kiss my
		feet, boy.

Mickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds
before the blood will run... Rocky stands motionless.

				MICKEY
			(softly)
		Let's take a walk, Rock.
		Please, don't take a chance.
		He wants to hurt you so you
		can't fight.

Rocky swallows his pride.  He still has the string around
his ankles.  He starts to shuffle away with Mickey... Dipper
steps forward and viciously slaps Rocky again.

Mike jumps forward.

				MIKE
		Why you tryin' to cut 'im, man!
		Back off, scumbag, or I'll
		bite your face!

Dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks Mike flat.  The
room reeks of fear... Apollo's eyes flick back and forth
between Rocky and Dipper.  Apollo taps his bodyguards and
they begin to ease away.

				DIPPER
		... Now, boy, kiss my feet.

Rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor.  He shuffles
forward and stands before Dipper.

				DIPPER
			(continuing;
			almost in a whisper)
		... Kiss 'em.

Rocky looks at Mickey, then lowers his eyes to Dipper's
feet... Dipper smiles.  Rocky starts to bend towards the
shoes.  Without warning, he explodes with a pair of
combinations into Dipper's exposed ribs.  A CRACK is HEARD
and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... The room
is silent except for Dipper's moaning.

Apollo is stunned by the scene.  The gym has become a very
gloomy place.  He eyes Rocky with admiration and a hint of
apprehension... He leaves.
 

									81.


Mickey is the first one to shake off the chill... He shakes
his fists at the Reporters, and puts his arm around Rocky.

				MICKEY
		The kid's got cannons -- Print
		that.

The crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken
figure lying on a dirty gym floor.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

They enter the dismal apartment... On the floor are at least
ten telegrams.  Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside.
Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams.
				ADRIAN
		Don't you open them anymore?

				ROCKY
		They either say, 'Kill the
		nigger' or 'Hope you die,
		Honky.' -- What ya got in the
		bag?

Adrian steps to the window.  She pulls a pair of short but
lovely curtains from a shopping bag... The colorful curtains
glare in the dark room.

				ADRIAN
		Like?

				ROCKY
		Sharp -- Real nice.

				ADRIAN
		Really -- You don't think
		they're overly feminine?

				ROCKY
		No... Sharp -- You look great.

Adrian smiles and pulls out a small Christmas wreath...
Rocky smiles.  His eyes show what he feels for this woman.

				ROCKY
		Adrian, you really look great,
		y'know -- But I can't fool
		around durin' trainin' --
		makes the legs weak.

				ADRIAN
		Don't want weak legs.
 

									82.


				ROCKY
		Can't fool around -- You look
		very great.

				ADRIAN
		-- The legs.

				ROCKY
		Yeah... But I think weak legs
		ain't bad sometimes, y'know.

Rocky approaches in a seductive manner.  Adrian
uncharacteristically removes her sweater.  Underneath is a
T-shirt that reads "Win, Rocky, Win."

				ADRIAN
		I thought it might be cute.

				ROCKY
		Ya right --
			(laughs)
		Mebbe we best just hold
		hands -- the shirt made me
		feel guilty, y'know.

SCENE FADES.

EXT. STREET - PRE-DAWN

Rocky is running... for extra weight he carries his huge
dog, Butkus.  After a half a block he sags under the weight,
and laughing, begins to wrestle with the dog on the
pavement... Rocky tries to sneak away from the dog, but
after a few steps the beast sees him and chases him down the
street.

EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

It is early morning and as usual Rocky jogs to the meathouse.
He is followed by his new dog, Butkus.  He is stopped short
when he notices several television news vans parked out front.

INT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

He and the dog enter the freezer area and see several
reporters and men with mini-cameras milling around... Paulie
is waiting for him -- Rocky is upset and goes outside.
Paulie follows.
 

									83.


EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock.  I made a few phone
		calls an' thanks to me ya
		goin' to be a big man --
		Thatta dog?

				ROCKY
		Whatta these guys want?

				PAULIE
		To see ya train.

				ROCKY
		Yo, what's with you? -- It was
		suppose to be private.

				PAULIE
		I thought I was doin' ya a
		favor -- C'mon inside --
		Y'know, my sister really likes
		ya.

Rocky follows Paulie inside.

INT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAY

A REPORTER points in Rocky's direction and suddenly he is
surrounded and led into the freezer area and positioned
beside a slab of hanging beef.  The camera lights go on.

				COMMENTATOR
		Just relax, Mr. Balboa --
			(to the camera)
		Today we're here with
		heavyweight challenger, Rocky
		Balboa.  The reason we are
		standing in a refrigerated box
		is that Mr. Balboa has an
		unusual method of training and
		in a moment he is going to
		demonstrate it for our viewing
		audience -- But first, Rocky,
		how did you ever come to train
		in an icebox?

				ROCKY
		Ah -- My buddy Paulie let me
		in one day an' I hit the beef
		here an' liked it -- An' since
		I become a challenger, the
		owner don't mind neither.
 

									84.


				COMMENTATOR
		Is this a common training
		method -- I mean do other
		fighters pound raw meat?

				ROCKY
		I think me and Paulie invented
		it.

				COMMENTATOR
		Would you give us a
		demonstration?

Rocky steps over to a hanging beef and begins pounding with
incredible intensity... Everyone present is taken aback.
Rocky completes hitting the meat and stands there with his
hands dripping beef blood.

The Commentator is unnerved and Rocky looks straight into
the camera lens and holds up his bloody fists.

				COMMENTATOR
		... Diane Lewis in the
		meathouse with the Southpaw,
		Rocky Balboa.

INT. JERGENS' OFFICE - DAY

Apollo sits behind Jergens' desk.  Jergens is not present.
Four middle-aged and younger types and Creed's lawyer sit
around the desk.  The desk is flowing with forms and charts.

				APOLLO
		How much is being channeled
		into West Coast closed-circuit
		advertising?

				LAWYER
		Three hundred thousand.

				APOLLO
		Make it four hundred an' fifty.
			(to younger man)
		Send two hundred roses to the
		mayor's wife from me, get a
		picture an' make sure it gets
		all the papers.

				BUSINESSMAN #3
		Do ya want to run the fifteen
		radio spots in the mid-west?
		I think you could spend the
		money better in Canadian
		publicity.
 

									85.


				APOLLO
		Yeah, I'd like to get Canada --
		see, if we can get a tax
		break -- Gimme the figures on
		the Program Concession.

Meanwhile, the trainer sits across the room in a darkened
corner looking at a small television.  He is watching
Rocky's bloody exhibition on the news...

He waves at Apollo.

				TRAINER
			(worried)
		Apollo, you oughta come see
		this boy you're gonna fight on
		TV -- looks like he means
		business.

Apollo is still engrossed in his paperwork.

				APOLLO
		I mean business, too --
			(to men)
		The gross rental of the arena
		is gonna include the four
		hundred ushers, right? --
		Gimme some coffee.

EXT. PAULIE'S STREET - NIGHT

It is a moonless night and Paulie staggers across the street
and enters his building... He staggers up the stairs.

INT. PAULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paulie removes his coat and tosses it listlessly in a
chair... He rubs his red eyes and sways into the kitchen.

He takes a bottle of wine out of the icebox.  As he swills
the wine he hears the SOUND of Rocky's and Adrian's VOICES
traveling from his sister's room.  Paulie's face tightens
and he staggers towards the bedroom.

He stands outside the bedroom door and peers through a
crack... Rocky, Adrian, and the dog are watching TV in the
otherwise darkened room.

				ADRIAN
		... And he called the
		reporters --

				ROCKY
		Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
 

									86.


				ADRIAN
		Don't be mad at him -- He just
		wants to help.

				ROCKY
		Yo -- I ain't mad.  I'm just
		outta joint when reporters are
		around -- They take cheap
		shots an' Paulie knows it.

				ADRIAN
		... Are you going to say
		anything to him?

				ROCKY
		... What's to say?  I dunno
		what he wants from me --

Filled with uncontrollable anger, Paulie smashes into the
room.

				PAULIE
		Nothin'!  I want nothin' from
		you!!!

				ADRIAN
		Paulie!

				PAULIE
		Shutup!  I want nothin' -- I
		ain't no charity case!  Get
		outta my house!

				ADRIAN
		It's not your house --

				PAULIE
		You ain't no friend no more --
		Go home!  Outta my house I
		want ya!

				ADRIAN
		Don't talk like that to him!

				PAULIE
		Get outta my life both of ya's.

Paulie kicks the door out of frustration and appears to be
bordering on a nervous breakdown.

				PAULIE
			(continuing)
		Outta my house I want ya!!
 

									87.


				ROCKY
		... It's cold outside, Paulie.

Paulie goes to the living room closet and removes a baseball
bat... Rocky and Adrian quickly follow.

				PAULIE
		I don't want ya messin' up my
		sister no more -- He's scum
		from the corner, I don't raise
		ya to hang with no bum!

Adrian is speechless... Rocky moves towards Paulie.

				PAULIE
			(continuing;
			raising the bat)
		... Wanna hit on me?  C'mon --
		C'mon, I'll break both ya arms
		so's they never work...

Rocky freezes...

				ADRIAN
		... Paulie.  Stop now!

				PAULIE
		I want 'im outta here --
			(to Rocky)
		Don't think I'm good enough to
		work for Gazzo?
			(spits)
		That's what I think of bums
		like you an' Gazzo!
			(spits again)
		You're goin' up an' don't care
		enough to throw Paulie some
		crumbs!
			(spits)
		I give ya meat, an' I give ya
		my sister, too!

				ADRIAN
		Only a pig would say that!

Paulie smashes a small table with the bat.

				PAULIE
			(to Adrian)
		You forget what I went through
		to give ya the best.
 

									88.


				ADRIAN
		You gave me what?!  Knots!
		You gave me knots in here
		every day -- you made me
		scared of everything!

				PAULIE
		I always seen ya had the best,
		but did ya ever think of
		puttin' in a good word for me
		with this scumbag!

Paulie smashes a large lamp with the bat.

				ADRIAN
		Don't do that again!

				PAULIE
		Get away from me -- I could
		never even get married 'cause
		you couldn't live by yaself --
		ya'd die by yaself!  So
		instead I put you two
		together -- Did ya think of
		puttin' in a good word for
		me? -- You owe me!

				ADRIAN
		Owe you what?

				PAULIE
		You owe me an' are supposed to
		treat me good!

				ADRIAN
		Good?  Good, Paulie?!  I've
		been treatin' you like a baby.
		Since I can't remember it's so
		long -- I'm the only one who
		feeds you an' puts you in bed
		when ya can't stand up -- and
		it's you that made me feel
		like a loser -- That's what ya
		use to call me 'Loser' -- What
		kind of name is that?  So can
		ya blame me for not remembering
		to talk about you when I'm
		with Rocky -- I don't owe you,
		Paulie, you owe me.

The brother flares up and threatens Adrian with the bat.

				PAULIE
		You busted?!
 

									89.


				ADRIAN
		What?!

				PAULIE
		You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in
		ya pants, didn't ya!  Ya
		pulled down ya pants an' let
		him have it, didn't ya!!

Mortified, Adrian runs to her room... Rocky steps to Paulie.

				ROCKY
			(fuming)
		Hey --

Paulie cocks the bat back and tenses... Rocky remains still.

				PAULIE
			(softly)
		... I can't haul meat no more.

				ROCKY
		What can I do about it?

				PAULIE
		Christ, I been beggin' ya for
		a break until I'm sick inside.

				ROCKY
		What break?  Huh?  What break!
		Who am I to give breaks!  I'm
		a fighter, you haul meat.  You
		do what you do an' I do what I
		do best -- that's it -- that's
		life, man!

Paulie looks ashamed... Rocky walks, then returns.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... An' what ya said to my
		girlfriend ain't right -- Do
		it again, I'll kill ya.

Rocky goes into the bedroom... Adrian has buried her face in
a pillow... She is rocking slightly.  Rocky cradles her and
kisses her cheek.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Wanna hear a dirty joke?
 

									90.


				ADRIAN
			(smiles)
		... Yes --

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAY

Mickey is in his cluttered office above the gym... the room
is dark.  Blankets are tacked over the windows.  Rocky is
watching 8 mm movies of Apollo Creed in action... Rocky
watches with intense concentration as the fighter moves like
a huge dancer around the ring.

				MICKEY
		His defense is great, can't
		lie 'bout that -- You have a
		rollin' style.  Can't retreat
		as fast -- But your style
		ain't retreatin'.

They both watch the flickering images.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		See how he plays sometimes --
		Drives his cornermen nuts.
		Nobody knows his next move --
		Him included.

They watch more action... Creed has a fighter helpless
against the ropes.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Killer instinct -- Ya both got
		the killer touch.  Interestin'.
		See that! -- Right-cross
		combination.  Beautiful.  But
		you got the power to rip the
		body.

They watch more action.

				MICKEY
			(continuing)
		Rocky, when ya climb into the
		square, an' know ya' meetin'
		the best fighter in the world,
		ya' gonna be ready, ya' gonna
		be ready 'cause I been waitin'
		for fifty years -- Fifty years.
		When I'm done with you, you'll
		gonna be able to spit nails.
				(MORE)
 

									91.


				MICKEY (CONT'D)
		You'll gonna be able to eat
		lightin' and crap thunder --
		You'll be a very, very
		dangerous person...

The SCENE FADES on Mickey's voice and Rocky staring
transfixed at the images projecting on the wall...

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY

Rocky is pounding the heavy bag with intense concentration.
As he strikes from all angles, Mickey instructs.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - LATER

Rocky now works on the incline situp board... While doing
situps, he pounds himself in the stomach with a dumbbell.
The pain is evident on his face.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Pushups between two chairs as Mike sits on his shoulders...
Mickey coaching drives him on.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Mike has on a pair of target gloves and Rocky moves around
the ring swinging at them.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Drenched in sweat, Rocky hums the speed bag.  His expression
is hard and flushed.  Mickey clicks a stopwatch and pats
Rocky's shoulder... He is very happy.

INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - STILL LATER

Rocky has just completed exercising with the medicine ball...
Dino hands him a towel... Paulie crosses the gym as Rocky
heads to the steam room... A thin man crosses the gym and
Mickey nods.

				MICKEY
		What cha say, Benny -- Meet
		'The Rock.' This is our
		cutman, Benny Stein.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Benny.

				MICKEY
		Check the eyes, Ben.
 

									92.


Benny checks the skin around Rocky's eyes.

				BENNY
		Ain't bad.  Seen worse --
		Cover up an' things should be
		okay.

				MICKEY
		Take a shower.

Heading towards the shower, Rocky is intercepted by Paulie
who traverses the gym.  He stops Rocky at the shower room
entrance.

				PAULIE
		Yo, Rock, I think I found an
		angle to make some bread usin'
		ya name, ya mind?

Exhausted, Rocky studies Paulie's face a moment and nods
'yes.'... Rocky sways into the shower room and Paulie
strides off.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Running... Rocky's crowd of trailing boys has tripled.
Dashing through the streets, he resembles the Pied Piper.

EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAY

It is twilight and Rocky is alone at the very bottom of a
huge flight of steps that seem to stretch into the heavens...
Rocky takes a deep breath and sprints up the never-ending
stairs... Halfway up, his body shows the strain.  Nearing
the top, Rocky pumps with all his strength and arrives at
the very top... He looks down the steep stairs and swells
with pride... He is ready.

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Rocky is led into Mayor Rizzo's office by an aide... Rocky
is very nervous as he approaches the mayor, who is seated
behind his wide desk.

				MAYOR
		Sit down, Rocky.

Flips open a thick file that lays in front of him.
 

									93.


				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		I've been going over your
		record -- You've been the busy
		type --
			(reading)
		Nineteen arrests -- probation
		three times -- expelled from
		seven public schools in 1964
		and '65.

Rocky tries to sink into the chair.

				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		I'm a very busy man, but I
		just wanted to remind you that
		you'll be setting an example
		for thousands of guys like
		yourself and maybe start them
		off in a new direction and
		give our police force a
		break -- I also hope you try
		your very best and bring pride
		to Philadelphia.

				ROCKY
		... I'll try.

The mayor presses a button and a photographer enters.

				MAYOR
		Would you stand up, please.

Rocky rises and the mayor shakes his hand... Their picture
is taken three times... The photographer exits.

				MAYOR
			(continuing)
		Thank you for coming by,
		Rocky -- good luck.

				ROCKY
			(turns)
		Any time.

				MAYOR
			(sitting)
		Wait... After the fight you'll
		have nearly a hundred and
		fifty thousand dollars -- What
		do you plan to do with it?
 

									94.


				ROCKY
			(smiles)
		... Run for mayor.

The mayor is shocked at first but then breaks into a big,
friendly laugh, and Rocky exits.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Adrian and Rocky are at his apartment.  They are looking at
new scrapbooks.  Newsweek Magazine: Headline: "The Italian
Stallion or Donkey?" -- Philadelphia Magazine -- Rocky
stands with the mayor.

				ADRIAN
		Rocky, do you realize everybody
		in this country knows your
		face, and after the fight
		everybody in the world is
		going to.

				ROCKY
		Yeah...

She flips through Sports Illustrated, The American Sportsman,
Ring Magazine, World Boxing, True, and a multitude of other
clippings.

The TELEPHONE RINGS... Rocky rises and walks to the new
white object hanging on the wall.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		My first call... Hello?  Yeah,
		speakin' -- Who is this?
		Bruce?  Bruce who? -- Yo,
		Bruce!  How ya been?  I ain't
		seen ya for nine or eight
		years -- Yeah, things is
		great, how's things with you
		upstate -- Ya sellin' real
		estate, hey, that's a good
		job... Yeah, I gotta advance,
		but I bought ringside seats
		for the guys at the gym.  I
		get the hundred an' fifty
		grand after the fight...

Adrian overhears the statement.
 

									95.


				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... Yeah, I know it's a lotta
		money -- Condominiums?  Nobody
		uses them anybody.  Listen, I
		think a pet shop is a good
		investment, y'know -- I don't
		care 'bout long hours --
		there's no depreciation --
		that don't matter none to
		me -- Yeah, I like animals.
		Why don't ya give me ya number
		an' I'll call ya back?  Lemme
		getta pencil --

Rocky makes no motion to get a pencil.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Okay, what is it -- four-
		twelve 659-2424.  Yeah, yeah,
		thanks for callin' -- Sure
		I'll get back to ya, Bruce --
		see ya.

Rocky hangs up.

				ADRIAN
		What was that you said about a
		pet shop?

				ROCKY
			(distant)
		... What?

				ADRIAN
		What did you say about a pet
		shop?

				ROCKY
		I don't want ya cleanin'
		nobody else's cages no more.

				ADRIAN
		Is everything all right?

				ROCKY
		I gotta go out for a while.

Rocky grabs his coat and moves to the front door.

				ROCKY
			(continuing; to dog)
		... Come.
 

									96.


INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - NIGHT

Rocky arrives at Goldmill's Gym... He unlocks the gym's door.
Rocky and the dog move through the eerie shadows of the gym.

Rocky moves across the gym with his dog and moves up the
steps to Mickey's office... At the top of the stairs he
looks down at the ring, reflects for a moment, then enters
the office.

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

After turning on the lights, he quickly cleans the cluttered
desk and sets up the projector... He goes to the cabinet and
removes a stack of 16 mm films.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

The office clock indicates it is several hours later.  Rocky
is engrossed in watching another Apollo Creed film.  He sits
motionless.

Rocky sits upright.  Something catches his eyes... He
springs at the projector.  He reruns the scene several times.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - SEVERAL HOURS LATER

Several hours later Rocky is engrossed in watching another
Apollo Creed film... He sits motionless.  Something catches
his eye.  Rocky stops the projector as Apollo is delivering
a knockout blow to an unfortunate opponent.

Rocky moves right up to freeze frame and inspects it like it
was a priceless painting... He backs off and begins writing
on a note pad.

						DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - DAWN

The first light of dawn streams through Mickey's filthy
windows... Rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he
has lost interest in watching the movies.

The film has completed its run through the projector and
lazily flops around on the top reel... Listlessly Rocky rubs
his reddened eyes.
 

									97.


The door opens and Mickey flips on the light... The two men
stare at each other for a long moment.  Mickey studies
Rocky's despondent expression and knows what is on the
fighter's mind.

				MICKEY
		... I know what you're
		thinkin'm kid -- At least ya
		gotta shot -- All ya can do is
		try ya' best.

Rocky stands and, with his dog, inches past Mickey and exits
the room.  Mickey walks over and turns off the projector.
He idly pushes the machine with a lazy motion until it
slides off the desk and crashes to the floor.

EXT. STREET - DAWN

After leaving Mickey's gym, Rocky and his dog listlessly
move down the street and head for home.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Rocky arrives at his apartment... Adrian is asleep on the
couch.  He lowers himself beside her.  Her eyes open.

				ROCKY
		... Can't do it.

				ADRIAN
		... What?

				ROCKY
		... I can't beat him.

				ADRIAN
		Apollo?

				ROCKY
		Yeah, I can't beat him.

Adrian touches his face.

				ROCKY
		I been watchin' the movies --
		studyin' -- He ain't weak
		nowhere.

				ADRIAN
		What're we going to do?

				ROCKY
		... I dunno.
 

									98.


				ADRIAN
		Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.

				ROCKY
		It ain't so bad, 'cause I was
		a nothin' before --

				ADRIAN
		Don't say that.

				ROCKY
		C'mon, it's true -- But that
		don't bother me -- I just
		wanna prove somethin' -- I
		ain't no bum... It don't
		matter if I lose... Don't
		matter if he opens my head...
		The only thing I wanna do is
		go the distance -- That's all.
		Nobody's ever gone fifteen
		rounds with Creed.  If I go
		them fifteen rounds, an' that
		bell rings an' I'm still
		standin', I'm gonna know then
		I weren't just another bum
		from the neighborhood...

Adrian touches Rocky's face... The fighter gently lowers
himself beside his woman.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		... No foolin' around.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

It is the night of the Bicentennial fight... The location is
the Philadelphia Spectrum.

The Spectrum is filling to capacity... Grandly dressed
celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into
their ringside seat.  Nearly everyone is holding a red,
white, and blue sweater...

The arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red, white and
blue.  High above the ring are huge posters of GEORGE
WASHINGTON - ABE LINCOLN - DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - BEN
FRANKLIN - and APOLLO CREED.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo Creed sits in his dressing room... It is dead silent
except for some NOISE that filters under the door from the
arena.
 

									99.


It is a CLOSE-UP of Apollo's hand being taped... The RASPING
SOUND of the adhesive tape is very pronounced.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The atmosphere is identical to Apollo's dressing room.
Adrian watches in silence as Mike wraps Rocky's hand.

Again, the most pronounced SOUND is the RASPING of the
adhesive tape.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo's other hand is being wrapped.  Dead silence except
for the TAPE and APOLLO'S BREATHING.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Rocky's other hand is being wrapped in a CLOSE-UP.  The only
SOUND is the TAPE and ROCKY'S mounting BREATHING PATTERN.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of drops being placed in his nose to help increase
his intake of oxygen.  The tremendously magnified SOUND of
APOLLO TAKING IN AIR.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of the drops being placed in Rocky's nose.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

A heavy coating of vaseline is applied around the Champion's
eyes... In an EXTREME CLOSE-UP, the eyes shine brightly with
the grease.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Grease is smeared around Rocky's eyes... In the EXTREME
CLOSE-UP several deep scars are SEEN.

INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP of Apollo's trainer digging his fingers deeply into
the thick neck muscles of Apollo's upper back and neck.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP OF Mike's arms wrapped around Rocky's waist and
lifting his diaphragm up... Magnified BREATHING ROARS from
the screen.
 

									100.


INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Apollo's trainer slips a mouthpiece into Apollo's mouth.
Apollo shakes his head and the trainer removes it and places
another one in the champ's mouth... Creed nods yes.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone present is motionless as Rocky is in the bathroom.
Alone, Rocky is on his knee praying.  Completing his silent
prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror.
Suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that
in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge
of his life.

Out in the dressing room, the door opens and a guard leans
in and nods that it is time.  He leaves... Rocky steps out.

				MICKEY
		... It's time, kid.

Rocky nods and moves toward Adrian.

				ADRIAN
		... I'll wait for you here.

Rocky nods and she kisses him.  The fighter leaves with his
trainers... Adrian is on the verge of tears.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Rocky, Mickey and Mike start down the long hallway... Up
ahead are three security guards... Rocky rubs his bare
shoulders.

				ROCKY
		Yo, Mick, can I have my rob?

Rocky puts on the robe... Embroidered across the back in
flaming letters is:

		"THE ITALIAN STALLION"

				*Pennzoil*

Mike helps him into the robe... Mickey is not amused.

				MICKEY
		Don't you care what the people
		will say?

				ROCKY
		... I'm doin' it for a friend.
 

									101.


				MICKEY
		Whatta you get outta this?

				ROCKY
		I get the robe an' Paulie gets
		three grand.

				MICKEY
		... Shrewd.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

TWO RINGSIDE COMMENTATORS sit in front of a panel of closed
circuit televisions.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		We would like to welcome our
		viewing audience to the Grand
		World Championship Bicentennial
		Heavyweight Fight -- the first
		major event of the Bicentennial
		Year... A point of interest is
		that the fight is being beamed
		to more than seven hundred and
		fifty million fans in theatres
		in nearly every corner of the
		world.  I would like to
		welcome an old friend, and co-
		commentator for this evening's
		event -- Jimmy Michaels.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		Thank you, Bob.  The
		electricity is everywhere
		tonight.  Rocky Balboa, a
		fifty-to-one underdog, is
		living a Cinderella story
		which has captured peoples'
		imaginations all over the
		world -- to quote a popular
		sports magazine, 'The fighting
		style should be 'The Caveman
		Against the Cavalier.' From
		the increase in sound it
		appears the challenger is now
		approaching the ring... His
		record is forty-four wins,
		twenty losses and thirty-eight
		knockouts.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		I only wonder if this man has
		the skill to go past three
		rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
 

									102.


ANOTHER ANGLE

A wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring.
Many people wish Rocky well as he passes... people also hurl
insults.  From the expression on Mickey's face it is also
the greatest night of his life.  In the audience are familiar
faces from the gym.  From the back of the arena a ROAR goes
up... Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George
Washington.  He throws silver dollars.  The NOISE builds to
DEAFENING proportions.  Creed's trainer holds the rope and
Creed bounds into the ring.  He tears off the Washington
outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in
an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red,
white and blue sequined top hat.  The robe is sequined red,
white and blue.  His boxing trunks are red, white and blue
silk with stars around the waistband.  The boxing shoes
match the trunks.  On his chin is a pointed white Uncle Sam
beard.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		You could go deaf with the
		noise -- it undoubtedly means
		Champion Apollo Creed is
		heading towards the ring --

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Am I seeing right?  Creed is
		approaching the ring in a boat.
		Is he supposed to be George
		Washington?  Obviously so.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		It's been confirmed that it is
		definitely an impersonation of
		George Washington -- a great
		way to start 1976 off.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		I agree.

Immediately Creed begins gracefully dancing in a wide circle.
He passes within inches of Rocky in his Uncle Sam outfit.

				APOLLO
		I want you!  I want you!

The crowd loves the taunting.  Apollo Creed floats back to
his corner.

				MICKEY
		Don't let 'im get you tight.
 

									103.


				ROCKY
		Whatta ya think that outfit
		cost?

ANOTHER ANGLE

The ANNOUNCER steps to the center of the ring... Several men
in suits stand against the ropes... Paulie is dressed nicely
and sits at ringside with a pretty blonde escort.  Rocky
waves at him.  Paulie waves back and secretly gestures at
his date... Rocky smiles and gestures back.

				ANNOUNCER
		Ladies and gentlemen --
		Welcome to the Bicentennial
		Heavyweight Championship
		Fight... We are very proud to
		have with us four former Great
		Champions... Ladies an' gents,
		'The one and only 'Manassa
		Mauler' -- Jack Dempsey!'

The CROWD ROARS and JACK DEMPSEY waves and goes to Creed's
corner, then Rocky's.

				DEMPSEY
		Good luck, kid.

He moves off.

				ROCKY
			(to Mickey)
		Christ, Jack Dempsey.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Announcer points and the timekeeper RINGS the BELL.

				ANNOUNCER
		Former Middleweight Champion --
		'The Bronx Bull' -- Jake
		LaMotta!

JAKE LA MOTTA raises his fist and gives best wishes to both
contenders... Timekeeper RINGS the BELL.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing)
		The man with the big punch --
		Everybody's favorite, 'The
		Brown Bomber ' -- Joe Louis!
 

									104.


JOE LOUIS bows and steps to Creed's corner.  Creed strikes a
boxing pose and Louis tosses a playful punch.
				ROCKY
		They must be friends.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Now, last but certainly not
		least -- the former Heavyweight
		Champion, a son of Philly,
		Smoking Joe Frazier!

FRAZIER rumbles to the center of the ring.  The CROWD CHEERS.
Apollo puts on a show... He grimaces and gestures like he's
going to attack Frazier.  His cornermen hold him back.  They
laugh.  Frazier goes to Rocky's corner.

				FRAZIER
		Save some of him for me.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators beckon to Frazier as he exits the ring.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The former champ looks great --
		Can we get Joe over here --
		here he comes.

Joe Frazier stands in front of the Commentators.

				COMMENTATOR #1
			(continuing)
		Joe, what are your feelings
		about tonight's fight?

				FRAZIER
		Well, I think any man who
		works an' trains hard always
		gotta chance.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		You look in great shape, Joe.

				FRAZIER
		I'm always in shape.

Joe laughs and exits.  The timekeeper RINGS the BELL.
 

									105.


ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		... Now for the evening's main
		event -- In the corner to my
		right, The Challenger, wearing
		white trunks -- At one hundred
		an' ninety-one pounds, one of
		Philly's own sons -- 'The
		Italian Stallion,' Rocky Balboa!

A good CROWD RESPONSE.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		In the far corner, wearing
		red, white an' blue -- Weighing
		in at two hundred and ten
		pounds -- Undefeated in forty-
		six fights -- the Heavyweight
		Champion of the World -- 'The
		Master of Disaster' -- Apollo
		Creed!

The arena EXPLODES and Creed puts on a display of hand speed.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The REFEREE motions to both fighters... They step to the
center of the ring.  As the Referee explains the rules
Apollo and Rocky stare hard into each other's eyes... The
Referee's voice fades and the fighters' expressions fill the
screen... Something soulful and frightening is being
communicated.

				REFEREE
		... Now come out fighting.

The fighters return to their corners.

				MICKEY
		God bless ya, Rock.

				ROCKY
		Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... Creed dances forward and boxes Rocky as
though he considers the man an amateur.
 

									106.


ANOTHER ANGLE

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The Champ stings the slower
		challenger with jabs at
		will -- Balboa blocks eighty
		percent of the blows with his
		face -- Creed doesn't look the
		best he's ever been but is
		moving smoothly -- Creed snaps
		out a triple combination that
		backs Balboa into a corner --
		oh, a solid hook by Creed, a
		master of fist-men.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		The Champion is smiling and
		toying with the man -- trying
		to give the fans their money's
		worth and make a show of it
		with the badly out-classes
		challenger -- Another left to
		right combination.  I feel
		sorry for --

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Creed is down!!!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky suddenly explodes with an upswing hook to the jaw.
Creed is dropped.  The arena EXPLODES.  Creed's eyes show
disbelief.  So do Rocky's.

Rocky backs into his corner... Mickey and Mike yell at him.

				MICKEY
		You can do it!  Goddamnit, you
		got the power!  The body, get
		the body!!!  Ya got him goin'!

				REFEREE
		Six!... Seven!... Eight!...

Creed is up... His playful attitude is gone... he is now all
business.  His lightning jab stings Rocky's face repeatedly.

				APOLLO
		... Come at me, sucker!

Rocky charges and a terrific right crashes against Apollo's
chin, followed by an uppercut to the liver that causes Creed
to cringe...
 

									107.


Apollo counters with jabs and Rocky whips brutal combinations
to the body.

The BELL RINGS.

ROCKY'S CORNER

				ROCKY
		How am I doin'?

				MICKEY
		Real good.

				ROCKY
		See how fast he is -- damn!

				MICKEY
		Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin
		down!!  Use the legs and drive
		through 'im.  Attack --
		Attack -- Attack!

APOLLO'S CORNER

Apollo does not sit.  He stands and clowns with the
spectators to prove he is not hurt.

				APOLLO
			(to Trainer)
		... That boy damn near broke
		my arm.

				TRAINER
		Sure -- He can hit -- Don't
		play no more -- Stick an'
		move, hear?

				APOLLO
		I'll carry him 'till the third.

				TRAINER
		Don't play with this man, he's
		fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel
		some real heat!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL for the second round RINGS... Rocky rushes out fast
and furious.  Apollo melts out a left hook that raises a
goose egg over Rocky's eye... Apollo employs footwork that
dazzles Rocky.  He has class.  He studies Rocky and employs
his lightning jab with cutting accuracy. Still Rocky shuffles
ahead, bombarding Creed's midsection with hooks.
 

									108.


ANOTHER ANGLE

The round ends with Apollo assaulting Rocky with blinding
combinations and delivering a stupendous right cross that
flings Rocky into the ropes and shatters his nose... The
round ends.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo stands in his corner and jokes with the fans, but he
is beginning to show the strain from the body punches.

				APOLLO
		Man, I rearranged his face
		with that right -- The people
		love what's happenin' tonight.

				TRAINER
		People nothin', you in a
		fight, my man, -- ya best
		believe what you hear... Knock
		that boy out soon an' let's go
		home.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky sits as Mickey and Benny try to reduce the swelling
around his eyes... The nose is shattered.

				MICKEY
		Ya nose is broke.

				ROCKY
		Damn!  How's it look?

				MICKEY
		Can't hardly tell.  Don't
		swallow the blood -- Go for
		his ribs.  Don't let 'im
		breathe.

				ROCKY
		... The guy's great.

				MICKEY
		Why don't ya tell 'im you're a
		fan!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators are caught up in the action.  They speak
rapidly into their microphones.
 

									109.


				COMMENTATOR #2
		If you had asked anyone who
		knows boxing, they never
		would've predicted a first
		round knockdown and the second
		round punishment to the body
		of the Champion... Most
		fighters will tell you,
		receiving a good body punch is
		the next worst thing to dying.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Round three ready to start and
		should be interesting to see
		if Creed can put the challenger
		away -- there goes the bell.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Round three... Apollo comes out dancing.  He skips and side-
steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks.  An expert ring general,
Apollo uses the ring fully.  Rocky keeps tearing in and
Creed meets the bombing attack that cause thick swelling...
Near the end of the round Rocky fires a penetrating punch to
the heart.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Apollo almost sprints out of
		his corner -- feints and
		throws a pair of left-right
		combinations.  Balboa drops
		beneath a left upper cut and
		lands a very solid shot on
		Creed's temple -- not much
		movement from Balboa, duck a
		left, a right, another left
		and explodes with a right hook
		to the temple -- I mean
		explodes.  The Champ backs off.

				COMMENTATOR #2
		There's no way Apollo expected
		this kind of hitting power.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		No way -- but the brilliant
		ability of the Champion to
		master situations like this is
		one of his most outstanding
		traits -- Creed tosses a
		perfect right hand that rocks
		Rocky.
				(MORE)
 

									110.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		Creed on the offensive --
		Balboa takes the punishment
		and counters with a left flush
		over the heart... that hurt.

The wallop knocks Apollo off balance... The CAMERA GOES TO A
STEEP ANGLE SHOT from the floor, VERTICALLY UP Apollo's body.
The SCENE GOES INTO SLOW MOTION... Rocky releases a
terrifying uppercut that opens a gash under Creed's eye.
Creed's face contorts with excruciation.

				TRAINER
			(yelling)
		Cover your face!  Cover up!
			(to Assistant)
		My man's cut, my man's
		bleedin' -- Get ready!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL SOUNDS.  Apollo's corner works frantically to close
the wound... The ring DOCTOR inspects the cut.

				TRAINER
		Bad?  Talk to me, man!

				DOCTOR
		Deep, but passable.

				APOLLO
			(staring at Rocky)
		... That man's takin' his job
		too serious.

				TRAINER
		He's movin' to your left --
		don't let him no more -- dance
		and stick, hear?  Don't
		play -- I know what ya feelin',
		but don't play.

				APOLLO
		He got lucky.

				TRAINER
		Luck!  You fightin' a crazy
		man -- but you got him hurt
		bad.
			(to Assistant)
		More ice, now!
 

									111.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's face is in very bad shape, not cut, but wretchedly
swollen around the eyes.

				MICKEY
		How you holdin' up, kid?

				ROCKY
		Fine... That guy's great.

				MICKEY
		Gimme the water!  Ya getttin'
		tagged with his right.  I
		think you should feint left
		and high hook 'im -- Benny,
		check the eyes!  Can ya see?

				ROCKY
			(standing)
		See what?

				MIKE
		Ya sappin' his strength --
		He's losin' steam.

				ROCKY
		He ain't losin' nothin'.

				MICKEY
		Keep on him -- You're doin'
		great.

SERIES OF SHOTS

In the next ten rounds, Apollo cuts and slashes Rocky to
ribbons, but pays dearly... Both his eyes and lips are cut.
Welts across his midsection attest to Rocky's body-battering.

INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Adrian is unable to remain alone... She is lured by the
GROWING ROAR OF THE FANS... She exits the dressing room.

INT. ARENA HALL - NIGHT

Stepping out of the dressing room she walks down the corridor.
The MOUNTING CHEERS make her speed up.  She opens the door
at the end of the corridor and is hit by a THUNDEROUS WAVE
OF SOUND.  The guard at the door inspects her and goes back
to watching the fight.
 

									112.


INT. ARENA - NIGHT

Adrian stands at the rear of the arena and watches the
battle.  She is entranced by the power of it all.

Back in the ring, Rocky keeps grinding ahead.  He plants a
thumping left over the Champion's heart and Creed winces...
Rocky is game but losing.

At ringside Paulie is frantic... He is living the fight from
his seat.

Mr. Gazzo and his Bodyguard watch from the second row.
Gazzo looks proud.  The Bodyguard, impassive.

INT. ANDY'S BAR - NIGHT

A huge and lively crowd look up at the television over the
bar... They see Rocky driving Creed against the ropes and
cheer loudly.

				ANDY
		... The Rock's got real stones.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT

The men are fighting with appalling tenacity.  Rocky rips
and tears into the body... Apollo counters with a ceaseless
stream of rapier-like lefts... The Challenger is seriously
outclassed.

				APOLLO
		C'mon -- Lemme cut yo'!

Rocky wades in and Creed employs incredible footwork.  He
sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross
to Rocky's already broken nose.  Blood sprays from the wound
and red droplets drip from his chin...

Rocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a
torrent of combinations.  Rocky's eyes are closed.  But
Creed cannot drop him... The BELL RINGS.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators shift in their seats.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		Without a doubt this is the
		most punishing brawl I have
		ever seen -- The ringside
		audience is spotted with blood.
				(MORE)
 

									113.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		This fight should have been
		stopped rounds ago but Rocky
		Balboa refuses to fall --

				COMMENTATOR #2
		Not only has he refused to
		fall, but he has beaten the
		Champion's body without mercy
		and the bout has become a
		vicious slugfest.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo's corner is in turmoil... The Champion is definitely
hurt.

				APOLLO
		My side.

				TRAINER
			(to Assistant)
		Get that doctor.

				APOLLO
		No doctor!

				TRAINER
		You're hurtin', man!

				APOLLO
		No doctor!... I'm feelin'
		good, bro!

ANOTHER ANGLE

In Rocky's corner, things are frantic.  His eyes are swollen
shut.

				MICKEY
		Wanna keep goin'?

				ROCKY
		Would you keep goin'?

				MICKEY
		... Yeah.

				MIKE
		No more, ya wanna lose an eye?
		No more.
 

									114.


				ROCKY
		Open my eyes -- Please, open
		my eyes!

Mickey nods to Benny.  He secretly places a small ring knife
between his index and middle finger.  In one smooth movement
he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers
the draining wounds with gauze... It is done so quickly no
one is ever aware of the operation.

ANOTHER ANGLE

At the rear of the arena Adrian looks transfixed at the ring.
She is caught up in the heat of the battle.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS for round fourteen.  Rocky bores in close,
but Apollo still has spring in his legs.  He seems determined
to end it this round... Apollo catches Rocky flush on the
jaw.  Rocky is staggered.  Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose
with pure savagery.  Rocky is driven against the ropes and
receives a devastating beating from the Champion... Rocky is
dropped.

Rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring... Everything
is a distortion.  He looks for familiar faces as though to
ask for help... Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him
to stay down.

				REFEREE
		Six -- Seven -- Eight --

Rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy.  He
is like a wounded wild animal.  The tide suddenly turns.
Rocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific
body punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his
throat... A CRACK is HEARD.  A glaze of pain covers Apollo's
eyes.  It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion
upright... Apollo is badly hurt.  He is bent over.

Rocky moves towards Apollo.  Apollo flicks dread jabs into
Rocky's eyes... The Italian wades in with punches that seem
to bulge out Apollo's back.  Creed takes the punishment like
a stoic.

Blood is running from Apollo's mouth.  In the clinch he
leans over Rocky and it drips down the Italian's neck and
shoulders.  Apollo shields his wound from the ringside
judges and continues to fight.
 

									115.


ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS.  Apollo's men rush out and guide him to his
corner.

				APOLLO
		... Ribs broke --

Blood trickles from the corner of Apollo's mouth.  The
Trainer feels the ribs.

				TRAINER
		Yo' bleedin' inside, man --
		Get that doctor.

				APOLLO
		One more round.

				TRAINER
		Don't kill yourself, man --
		Let the doctor stop the fight.

				APOLLO
		... Stop jivin'!

				TRAINER
		Cover the ribs -- Look here,
		elbow down, tight -- Tight --
		stand straight -- you're the
		best, you're the best!

				APOLLO
		... Thanks.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky no longer resembles himself... His face has completely
been beaten to jelly, but his mood is buoyant.

				ROCKY
		How I look out there, Mick?

				MICKEY
			(truly worried)
		Great, kid, great.

The ring Doctor leans over Rocky and checks the eyes.

				DOCTOR
		One more round -- How do you
		feel?

Rocky is approaching the supreme moment of his life.  He
cannot be bothered with pain or doctors.
 

									116.


				ROCKY
		Fine -- Go away, I'm gonna
		make it -- I'm gonna make it!

Everyone is distraught over Rocky's dangerous condition.

				MICKEY
		We gotta stop it, kid.

				MIKE
		Ya gave it ya best shot!

				MICKEY
		Nobody's gonna say ya didn't
		give ya all.  I can't let ya
		go out.

Rocky stands and eyes them all.

				ROCKY
			(impassioned
			and quietly)
		I'll kill ya all... Don't stop
		nothin' --

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... Apollo moves cautiously out of his corner
and circles to Rocky's right.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Commentators stare unansweringly at the fighters.

				COMMENTATOR #1
		The fight has slowed down to a
		near stand-still -- Creed
		circles to Rocky's right...
		The spectrum is nearly
		silent -- Neither fighter has
		made a motion to throw... I've
		never seen anything like it in
		the last round of a
		championship fight... Apollo
		spits blood on the canvas.  It
		appears he is protecting his
		right side.  His ribs were
		probably injured at the end of
		round fourteen.
				(MORE)
 

									117.


				COMMENTATOR #1 (CONT'D)
		It's confirmed, unofficially,
		Creed's ribs may be broken --
		Apollo fakes a left and throws
		a big tired right -- Balboa's
		mouthpiece is out!  Creed
		attacks with one hand!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo feints and Rocky falls for it.  The Champion unleashes
a lethal blow to the side of the head that jolts Rocky's
mouthpiece into the second row... Rocky sags against the
ropes in a crucified position... The insane crowd leaps to
their feet.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's bloody teeth snarl at Apollo and he waves him to
come ahead and fight toe to toe... Apollo obliges with a
weary but effective burst of rights and lefts that have K.O.
written on every punch.  Rocky counters the assault blow for
blow.

				ROCKY
		Gimme ya best!!!!

Mickey looks at the clock... TEN SECONDS TO GO.

				ROCKY
			(continuing)
		Gimme ya best!!!

Blood sprays over the ropes and onto the ringside
photographers... They are horrified and wipe away the blood.

The fighters stand toe to toe and drag every remaining bit
of strength from their souls and beat each other without
mercy.  They look hypnotized and have entered a dimension
far beyond blood and pain.

				SIX
				FIVE
				FOUR
				THREE
				TWO
				ONE!

ANOTHER ANGLE

The BELL RINGS... The arena EXPLODES with thunderous approval.
 

									118.


Their cornermen rush to their collapsed fighters... In the
midst of all the confusion both fighters look at each other
with unabashed respect -- They stand like blood-drenched
gladiators on the most dramatic night of their lives.

As though reacting to some unspoken command, they both step
towards each other and embrace... Apollo whispers in Rocky's
ear.

				APOLLO
		... Ain't gonna be no rematch.

				ROCKY
		... Don't want one.

Mickey comes over and separates them and leads him back to
his corner... Mickey embraces him.

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Announcer enters the ring with a microphone.

				ANNOUNCER
		Attention, please!!  Attention!!
		Ladies and gentlemen, tonight
		we have had the rare privilege
		to have witnessed the greatest
		exhibitions of stamina and
		guts ever in the history of
		sports.

The CROWD ROARS.

				ANNOUNCER
			(continuing)
		Ladies and gentlemen -- We
		have a split decision!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo did not expect this and tenses.  His corner nervously
tries to reassure him.  It does no good.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky did not expect this either and looks in confusion at
Mickey, but Mickey is frozen with anticipation.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Judge Walker scores it eight-
		seven Creed... Judge Roseman
		scores it eight-seven Balboa.
 

									119.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo is rigid.  Fear radiates from his eyes.  To lose the
crown on this night after the fight he fought would kill
him... A silence has blanketed the arena.

ANOTHER ANGLE

				ANNOUNCER
		Judge Conners scores it nine-
		six Creed... Winner and still
		Heavyweight Champion of the
		World, Apollo Creed!

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky sorely smiles and looks at the waves of CHEERING fans
that circle the ring and reach out towards him... Mickey
grabs Rocky's hand and raises it.  The CROWD ROARS.

				MICKEY
		I don't care what they say,
		you're a winner.

				ROCKY
		Yo, can I have my locker back?

Mickey and Rocky look at each other and grin.  Mickey hugs
Rocky like a son.  Mickey raises Rocky's hand again.  Rocky
turns away from Mickey and pats Benny the cut-man's
shoulder... Benny smiles wearily.  Rocky stares across the
ring at Apollo Creed, who stands victorious, but his face
and body are badly distorted... The two men lock stares that
reflect admiration.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Apollo climbs out of the ring and the fans crush forward
screaming his name and waving red, white and blue banners.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky also climbs out of the ring and waves of frantic well-
wishing fans rumble forward... Mickey's eyes show mounting
apprehension as the fans become abnormally active.

ANOTHER ANGLE

They shove the police aside and clutch wildly at Creed.
Creed's army of bodyguards swing angrily at the crowd but
they are soon engulfed by screaming waves of humanity.
Apollo is suddenly hoisted into the air and is being carried
along by a legion of fans.
 

									120.


ANOTHER ANGLE

On the opposite aisle Rocky is experiencing the same
overwhelming adulation by his fans but does not seem to be
frightened by it, like Apollo.  Mickey tries his best to
control things but his voice is drowned out in the growing
clamor.  The fans shove the guards aside and hoist Rocky to
their shoulders.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Rocky's and Apollo's fans are aggressively competing against
each other... chanting, 'Creed, Creed, Creed.'

Rocky's fans counter by bellowing, 'Rocky, Rocky, Rocky.'

ANOTHER ANGLE

Paulie tries to get to Rocky but is shoved aside and he
starts swinging.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Both Rocky and Apollo are completely at the mercy of the
crowd.  They are being passed overhead and remain helpless
as their bodies float up the aisle on the sea of hands...
The CHANTING IS DEAFENING.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Fearful that Rocky is in danger, Adrian tries to move
forward.  Running headlong into the crowd, she angles
through the mass to get to Rocky.

ANOTHER ANGLE

She is manhandled and shoved in a multitude of directions,
but she keeps her feet... She sees him.  In the distance,
Rocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall
and waits for the procession to pass.

The procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's
unbelievably battered but smiling face.  He appears to be
king of the world.

The procession approaches and passes Adrian.  She jumps on
her toes and waves frantically but is not seen.  She screams
Rocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through
the racket and reaches Rocky.

Rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages
to see Adrian jumping up and down waving.  The crowd is
carrying him away.  He attempts to lower himself but the
crowd won't permit it.
 

									121.


Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's
heads and shoulders.  He resembles a man trying to go up a
down escalator.  People are jammed so tightly together Rocky
manages to crawl across them to Adrian.

Still suspended in air, Rocky leans down and Adrian jumps up
and they lock in an embrace.

				ADRIAN
		I love you -- I love you -- I
		love you...

The two are swept along into the greatest night anyone can
remember...

          EXT. HIGHWAY. AFTERNOON.


          
          A ribbon of freeway stretching into a blue and pink late
          afternoon sky. A huge dark sedan, windows tinted gold,
          headlights blazing, powers directly for us.

          
          CUT TO: A heavy, low-slung, pickup truck traveling toward
          the sedan.

          
          WIDE SHOT: Sky, freeway, the cars closing.

          
          TIGHT ON: The sedan.

          
          TIGHT ON: The pickup.

          
          Like thunderous, jousting opponents, the cars pass in a
          deafening cacophony of noise.

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          TIGHT ON: The fat face of GREGORY, yelling at the
          disappearing sedan.

          

           GREGORY
           A dog of the house of Capulet moves
           me!

          
          He and the pimply-faced front-seat passenger, SAMPSON,
          explode with laughter.

          
          The red-haired driver BENVOLIO, keeps his eyes on the road.

          

          EXT. EXIT RAMP. AFTERNOON.


          
          The truck spirals down an exit ramp and screeches into busy
          driveway of a large gas station.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Attendants immediately run to the truck. Two clean
          windshields and duco, the third fills the gas tank.

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          Gregory in the back seat is boasting outrageously.

          

           GREGORY
           A dog of that house shall move me
           to stand. I will take the wall of
           any man or maid of Capulets.

          
          Sampson, sarcastically.

          

           SAMPSON
           That shows thee a weak slave. For
           the weakest goes to the wall.

          

           GREGORY
           'Tis true; and therefore women,
           being the weaker vessels, are ever
           thrust to the wall. Therefore, I
           will push Capulet's men from the
           wall, and thrust his maids to the
           wall.

          
          Benvolio, disgusted, gets out of the car.

          

           BENVOLIO
           The quarrel is between our masters...

          

           GREGORY
           (yelling after him)
           ...and us their men.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          FOLLOW: Benvolio as he heads for the bathroom.

          
          PICK UP: A mother wrangling three little boys out of a
          station wagon - the smallest kid carries a toy pistol.

          
          SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: Past the mother to - the huge black
          sedan pulling up outside the gas station mini-mart.

          
          The front door of the sedan opens. Shiny black boots -
          decorated with tiny, silver, cat-shaped spurs - plant
          themselves on the ground. The boots are joined by two other
          pairs of well-shod feet.

          
          HOLD: The spurred boots move out of frame.

          
          CRANE UP: The other feet belong to a tough-looking Latin
          youth ABRA - and his goateed side-kick PETRUCHIO.

          
          Abra and Petruchio enter the mini-mart, as four white-clad
          girls exit.

          
          FOLLOW: The girls as they head for their car.

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          Sampson is trying to out boast Gregory.

          

           SAMPSON
           I will show myself a tyrant. When
           I have fought with the men I will
           be civil with the maids, I will cut
           off their heads.

          
          Gregory; mock outrage.

          

           GREGORY
           The heads of the maids?

          
          Sampson leers lecherously at the girls.

          

           SAMPSON
           Ay, the heads of the maids, or
           their maiden heads, take it in what
           sense thou wilt.

          

           GREGORY
           They must take it in sense that
           feel it.

          
          Gregory and Sampson pump up the song on the sound system and
          sing out at the girls.

          

           GREGORY/SAMPSON

           (SINGING)
           I am a pretty piece of flesh!
           I am a pretty piece of flesh!
           Me, they shall feel while I am able
           to stand;
           I am a pretty piece of flesh!

          
          The girls, pretending not to notice, get into the car.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION - MINIMART. AFTERNOON.


          
          GREGORY'S P.O.V.: The car pulls away revealing... Abra and
          Petruchio exiting the mini-mart.

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: Gregory.

          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson - Their singing abruptly halts.

          

           SAMPSON
           Here comes of the House of Capulet.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Abra and Petruchio stare coldly toward the boys.

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson swallowing hard.

          
          CLOSE ON: Gregory; eyes locked to the Capulets. With fake
          bravado he nudges Sampson.

          

           GREGORY
           Quarrel I will back thee.

          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson trying to quell his rising panic.

          

           SAMPSON
           Let us take the law of our sides.
           Let them begin.

          
          SUDDENLY: BANG! Gregory and Sampson jump.

          
          WHIP PAN: It was the garage attendant slamming the hood.

          
          Gregory and Sampson are mortally embarrassed.

          

          EXT. MINI-MART. AFTERNOON.


          
          Abra and Petruchio laugh contemptuously and move to their

          CAR:

          
          FOLLOW: The mother and kids exiting the mini-mart.

          
          SUPER FAST SCAN TRACK: To...

          

          INT. TRUCK. AFTERNOON.


          
          Sampson furiously tries to save face.

          

           SAMPSON
           I will bite my thumb at them; which
           is a disgrace to them if they bear
           it.

          
          Sampson quickly bites his thumb toward Abra's back as he
          gets into the sedan.

          

          INT. SEDAN. AFTERNOON.


          
          Abra's eyes flick to the rear view mirror.

          
          E.C.U.: The rear view mirror; Sampson biting his thumb.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Suddenly, a blood curdling screech of tires - the sedan,
          rubber burning, reverses full speed toward Sampson and
          Gregory.

          
          The mother in the station wagon brakes to avoid collision -
          a sports car shunts into her vehicle. Mother and children
          scream.

          
          Attendants scatter.

          
          The Capulet car shudders to a halt inches from the truck,
          blocking its path.

          

          INT. BLACK SEDAN. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: A scurry of limbs scrabbling across seats and
          reaching for door handles;

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Abra hauls Sampson from the truck. Gregory leaps out,
          Petruchio covers him. Abra slams Sampson against the side of
          the vehicle - then, goading him to go for his gun, screams:

          

           ABRA
           Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

          
          Sampson's shaking hand hovers - ready to draw.

          

           SAMPSON
           I do bite my thumb, sir.

          

          INT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON.


          
          CUT TO: The panicked mother in the station wagon. She
          motions her children to the floor.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Customers run for cover.

          
          CLOSE ON: Abra: An hysterical rage; he shrieks:

          

           ABRA
           Do you bite you thumb at us, sir?

          

           SAMPSON
           (sweating, murmurs to Gregory)
           Is the law on our side if I say "Ay"?

          

           GREGORY
           No.

          

          INT. BATHROOM. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: The black cowboy boots, trousers down around them.
          The sound of a toilet flushing.

          
          PAN TO: The next cubicle, the door opens revealing Benvolio.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson, still sweating.

          

           SAMPSON
           No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at
           you, sir - but I do bite my thumb,
           sir!

          
          CUT TO: Gregory; a ridiculous inquiry.

          

           GREGORY
           Do you quarrel, sir?

          
          CUT TO: Abra; a dangerous smile.

          

           ABRA
           Quarrel sir, no sir.

          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson; unconvincing bravado...

          

           SAMPSON
           But if you do, sir, I am for you. I
           serve as good a man as you.

          
          CLOSE ON: Abra; a lethal question.

          

           ABRA
           No better?

          
          CLOSE ON: Sampson, trapped.

          

           SAMPSON
           Well sir...

          

          INT. STATION WAGON. AFTERNOON.


          
          CUT TO: Inside the station wagon. The mother does not
          notice her five year old aiming a toy gun toward the boys.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          CUT TO: Gregory's P.O.V.: Benvolio emerging from the
          bathroom - he whispers maniacally.

          

           GREGORY
           Here comes our kinsman. Say better!

          
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: Sampson; he screams:

          

           SAMPSON

           YES SIR, BETTER!

          
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: Abra demonically roars:

          

           ABRA

           THOU LIEST!

          
          CUT TO: Benvolio. Terror stricken, he sees the boys.

          
          DISTORTED OUT OF CONTROL CLOSE UP: Abra shrieks:

          

           ABRA

           DRAW IF YOU BE MEN!

          
          LIGHTNING CUT: Four hands reaching for guns.

          
          SLAM ZOOM: To Benvolio - weapon outstretched he screams:

          

           BENVOLIO
           Part, fools! You know not what you
           do!

          
          MUSIC STING; A SUPER MARCO SLAM ZOOM along the barrel of
          Benvolio's gun; the engraved gun type reads:

          
          'Sword 9mm series S'

          
          CUT TO: Benvolio. He screams in desperation:

          

           BENVOLIO
           Put up your swords!

          
          Gregory, Sampson, Abra, and Petruchio freeze. A moment -
          then from behind, the unmistakable sound of a gun being
          cocked.

          
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: The black cowboy boots.

          
          CRANE UP: To find the dark cold eyes and feline smile, of
          the wearer of the boots. His name is TYBALT; a cigarette is
          clenched between his teeth and his gun is aimed at Benvolio's
          head.

          

           TYBALT
           What, art thou drawn amoung these
           heartless hinds?
           Turn thee Benvolio.

          
          Benvolio, a choked explanation:

          

           BENVOLIO
           I do but keep the peace.

          
          A mocking smile.

          

           TYBALT
           Peace? I hate the word
           As I hate hell, all Montagues, and...

          
          EXTREME CLOSE UP: Tybalt's finger squeezing the trigger...

          
          Suddenly we hear firing from Tybalt's blind side.

          
          Tybalt redirects his weapon, cracking off a single shot at
          the surprise attacker.

          

          EXT./INT. MINIMART. AFTERNOON.


          
          It is the five year old from the station wagon. The bullet
          smacks the toy gun from the child's hand, shattering the
          wagon's window.

          
          Mother and children scream.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          A panicked Benvolio falls back, accidentally his gun fires -
          the bullet whistles past Tybalt's head.

          
          Tybalt combat rolls, and using a screaming car load of girls
          as cover, returns two quick shots, narrowly missing Benvolio.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          The gas station attendant hits a button and heavy metal
          screens slam down.

          

          EXT. GAS STATION. AFTERNOON.


          
          CUT TO: Gregory firing - a bullet rips through Abra's arm.

          
          Petruchio dives for cover; Gregory and Sampson leap into
          Benvolio's truck. Rubber burns as they smash past the
          Capulet vehicle.

          
          CLOSE ON: Tybalt taking aim.

          

          EXT. HIGHWAY - SUPERMARKET. AFTERNOON.


          
          His first shot plugs the fuel tank, the second a tire. Out
          of control and spewing gasoline the Montague truck careens
          across the highway and through the glass front of a
          supermarket.

          
          Gregory and Sampson throw themselves from the truck moments
          before...

          

          EXT. SUPERMARKET. AFTERNOON.


          
          CLOSE ON: The gas tank erupts into an almighty fireball.

          
          The screen fills with flame: the following images combust in
          front of us:

          

          EXT. HIGHWAY - SUPERMARKET - FROM AIR. AFTERNOON.


          
          NEWS CHOPPER P.O.V.: Citizens run in the streets.

          
          Looters raid shops near the supermarket - security guards
          return fire.

          

          INT. RESTAURANT. NIGHT.


          
          A table of dark suited men and their wives.

          
          CLOSE ON: The powerful 60 year old face of FULGENCIO CAPULET.
          Seated next to him is his much younger wife GLORIA.

          
          SUDDENLY: Windows explode in a tidal wave of glass. Diners
          take cover.

          
          Capulet moves fearlessly toward the window.

          

           CAPULET
           (to a waiter)
           Give me my long sword!

          

          EXT. STREET. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: The word MONTAGUE fills the screen.

          
          PULL BACK: We see the word is the number plate of a large
          black limousine.

          
          The limousine is stuck in the traffic snarl - bullets bounce
          off its bullet proof windshield.

          

          INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. NIGHT.


          
          TED MONTAGUE, a 60 year old red-faced bulldog of a man,
          bursts from the back of the limousine.

          

           MONTAGUE
           What noise is this!

          
          As Ted draws an enormous pearl handed revolver, CAROLINE,
          his conservatively dressed wife, tries to restrain him.

          

           CAROLINE
           Thou shalt not stir one foot to
           seek a foe!

          

           MONTAGUE
           (shrugging her off)
           Hold me not, let me go!

          

          EXT. STREET. NIGHT.


          
          Crouched behind a truck, Benvolio shakily tries to re-load.

          
          CLOSE ON: The barrel of Tybalt's gun enters frame and
          presses into Benvolio's forehead. Tybalt whispers sweetly.

          

           TYBALT
           Look upon thy death, Benvolio.

          
          CLOSE ON: Tybalt's finger on the trigger. Benvolio screams
          a scream of mortal horror.

          
          SUDDENLY Tybalt is blinded by a burning shaft of light. A
          magnificently powerful helicopter gunship hovers above him.
          A command booms from the chopper's public address system.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           (over PA)
           Rebellious subjects, enemies to
           peace,
           Throw your mistempered weapons to
           the ground.

          

          INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: The steely gray eyes of CAPTAIN PRINCE, chief of
          the Verona Beach Police Department. He lifts the microphone
          and repeats the command.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Throw your mistempered weapons to
           the ground!

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH. NIGHT.


          
          Tybalt looks up to the chopper. Patrol cars screech to a
          halt.

          
          An almighty orchestral chord.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH - MATTE SHOT. NIGHT.


          
          SUPER WIDE SHOT: A trail of devastation winds up through
          grid-locked traffic to the burning supermarket.

          
          In the distance looms an enormous statue of Christ flanked
          by two glass towers. We push toward the towers. One is
          neon-crowned MONTAGUE, the other, CAPULET.

          
          We hear:

          

           VOICE OVER
           Two households, both alike in
           dignity.
           In fair Verona, where we lay our

           SCENE
           From ancient grudge break to new
           mutiny,
           Where civil blood makes civil hands
           unclean.
           From forth the fatal loins of these
           two foes
           A pair of star crossed lovers take
           their life.
           Whose misadventured piteous

           OVERTHROWS
           Doth with their death bury their
           parents strife.

          
          A dark chord.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH SKYLINE. NIGHT.


          
          A swarm of helicopters thunder into frame. We see
          compressed, time-lapsed, images of their journey.

          
          SLAM INTO: A coat of arms that labels a large tower - the
          emblem reads; "Verona Beach Police Department: In God We
          Trust".

          

          HOLD:

          

          INT. CAPTAIN PRINCE'S PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Captain Prince's grim features. He eyes Capulet
          and Montague.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Three civil brawls, bred of an airy 

           WORD
           By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
           Have thrice disturbed the quiet of
           our streets.

          
          Capulet's lawyer tries to intervene.

          

           LAWYER
           My noble Prince I can...

          
          Captain Prince overriding, slams the desk.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           If ever you disturb our streets
           again,
           Your lives shall pay the forfeit of
           the peace.

          
          Hold on Captain Prince's determined gaze.

          

          EXT. VERONA STREET. DAWN.


          
          A majestic sunrise; Ted Montague's limousine sulks through
          deserted streets. In the distance, Jesus looks out over the
          now peaceful city.

          

          INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN.


          
          Ted Montague, his wife Caroline, and nephew Benvolio ride in
          uncomfortable silence.

          
          Caroline finally speaks her anger.

          

           CAROLINE
           O where is Romeo? Saw you him
           today?
           (pointedly to Montague)
           Right glad I am he was not at this
           fray.

          
          Montague snorts derisively and stares out the window.
          Embarrassed, Benvolio tries to be of assistance.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Madam, underneath The Grove of

           SYCAMORE
           So early walking did I see your son.

          
          Ted Montague speaks with contempt.

          

           MONTAGUE
           Many a morning hath he there been

           SEEN
           With tears augmenting the fresh
           morning's dew.

          
          Caroline struggles to contain her emotion.

          

           CAROLINE
           Away from light steals home my
           heavy son
           And private in his chamber pens
           himself,
           Shuts up his windows, locks fair
           daylight out
           And makes himself an artificial
           night.

          
          Montague barks into the car intercom.

          

           MONTAGUE
           Westward from this city side.

          

          EXT. STREET. DAWN.


          
          The limousine U-turns heading west.

          

          EXT. BEACH. DAWN.


          
          To the melancholic strains of Mozart's "Serenade for Winds",
          we see a blond nineteen year old boy sitting alone on an
          empty beach.

          
          CLOSE ON: The boy, ROMEO. Looking out over the ocean he
          sucks on the last of a cigarette and then writes intensely
          in a small worn note book.

          
          We hear his voice over.

          

           ROMEO (V/O)
           Love is a smoke made with the fume
           of sighs;
           Being purged, a fire sparkling in
           lovers' eyes;
           Being vexed, a sea nourished with
           lovers' tears.
           What is it else? A madness most
           discreet,
           A choking gall and a preserving
           sweet.

          

          INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN.


          
          The limo is parked in a cross street that runs down to the
          beach.

          
          Opposite the limo, young diehard clubbers, faded drag queens
          and street people, hang outside a dilapidated nightclub. A
          broken neon sign reads: "The Grove of Sick Amore."

          
          Ted, Caroline and Benvolio sit watching the silhouette of
          Romeo on the beach.

          

           MONTAGUE
           Black and portentous must this
           humour prove
           Unless good counsel may the cause
           remove.

          

          EXT. BEACH. DAWN.


          
          P.O.V.: From the limousine. Romeo rises and listlessly
          makes his way up the beach - seeing his father's car he
          turns and heads for the path that hugs the beach front.

          

          INT. MONTAGUE'S LIMOUSINE. DAWN.


          

           BENVOLIO
           So please you step aside.
           I'll know his grievance or be much
           denied.

          
          Benvolio clambers out of the limo.

          
          CLOSE ON: Montague, an encouraging smile.

          

           MONTAGUE
           Come Madam. Let's away.

          

          EXT. STREET. DAWN.


          
          The limousine pulls away and Benvolio heads after Romeo. He
          pauses. A deck at the rear of "Sick Amore" sprawls onto the
          beach. At the base of the deck, Benvolio can see Romeo
          squatting in discussion with an old drunk. Benvolio
          approaches with a not very convincing casualness.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Good morrow, cousin.

          
          Romeo turns. Sore, red, unfriendly eyes squint back at
          Benvolio.

          

           ROMEO
           Is the day so young?

          

           BENVOLIO
           But new struck, Coz.

          
          Romeo rises, Benvolio follows.

          

           ROMEO
           Ay me! Sad hours seem long.

          
          Romeo stops as if taking in Benvolio for the first time.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Was that my father that went hence
           so fast?

          

           BENVOLIO

           (GUILTY)
           It was.

          
          Benvolio chases Romeo down the path which divides the beach
          from a string of cheap souvenir shops and sleazy bars.

          

           BENVOLIO
           What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

          

           ROMEO
           Not having that which having makes
           them short.

          

           BENVOLIO
           In love?

          

           ROMEO
           Out.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Of love?

          

           ROMEO
           Out of her favor where I am in love.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Alas that love, so gentle in his
           view,
           Should be so tyrannical and rough
           in proof!

          

           ROMEO
           Alas that love, whose view...

          
          Romeo is halted by the sight of last night's disturbance
          displayed on a small TV screen in an outdoor bar.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           What fray was here?

          
          Benvolio starts to reply.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)

           (ANGRILY)
           Yet tell me not, for I have heard
           it all.
           Here's much to do with hate, but
           more with love.

          
          Romeo turns the corner away from the beach. He strides
          along the sidewalk raging.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Why then, O brawling love, O loving
           hate,
           O anything, of nothing first
           create!
           O heavy lightness, serious vanity,
           Misshapen chaos of well-seeming
           forms,
           Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold
           fire, sick health,
           Still-waking sleep, that is not
           what it is!

          
          Romeo screams at a huge bouncer who lounges in the doorway
          of a sex club.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           This love feel I, that feel no love
           in this!

          
          The bouncer's hand moves to his gun. Romeo, ignoring him,
          turns on Benvolio. A mocking laughter through tears:

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Dost thou not laugh?

          
          Benvolio, nervously eyeing the bouncer, shepherds Romeo out
          of danger.

          

           BENVOLIO
           No, coz, I rather weep.

          
          Romeo smiles.

          

           ROMEO
           Farewell, my coz.

          
          Romeo, breaking into a jog, leaves Benvolio behind. Benvolio
          pursues him down the street.

          

          EXT. ROMEO'S CAR. DAY.


          
          CLOSE ON: The sleeping face of a fourteen year old boy -

          BALTHASAR.

          
          PULL BACK: Balthasar sleeps on the hood of a magnificent
          silver car.

          
          Three or four kids doze on the sidewalk. As Romeo
          approaches, they jump up and begin vigorously polishing the
          already gleaming car.

          
          Balthasar wakes. He springs off the hood, chases the kids
          away, then, producing a huge bunch of keys, opens the car
          door for Romeo.

          
          Benvolio intercepts Romeo at the car.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Tell me in sadness, who is it that
           you love.

          

           ROMEO
           In sadness, cousin, I do love...a
           woman.

          

           BENVOLIO
           I aimed so near when I supposed you
           loved.

          
          Romeo leans against the car.

          

           ROMEO
           A right good marksman; and she's
           fair I love.

          
          Romeo pulls his shirt down to reveal a small shoulder tattoo.

          
          CLOSE ON: The tattooed word; ROSALINE.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Rosaline!
           (he is impressed)
           A right fair mark, fair coz, is
           soonest hit.

          

           ROMEO
           She'll not be hit with Cupid's
           arrow.
           She hath Dian's wit,
           And in strong proof of chastity
           lives well armed.

          
          Benvolio can't believe it.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Then she hath sworn that she will
           still live chaste?

          

           ROMEO
           She hath; and in that sparing makes
           huge waste.

          
          Benvolio - a plan.

           BENVOLIO
           Be ruled by me; forget to think of
           her.

          

           ROMEO
           O, teach me how I should forget to
           think!

          
          Benvolio indicates one of the working girls already strutting
          the foot path.

          

           BENVOLIO
           By giving liberty unto thine eyes.
           Examine other beauties.

          
          Romeo laughs dismissively. He throws the kids a few coins
          and slides into the drivers seat. Balthasar jumps in back.

          

           ROMEO
           Farewell. Thou canst not teach me
           to forget.

          

           BENVOLIO
           I'll pay that doctrine, or else die
           in debt.

          
          Benvolio leaps into the passenger seat of the moving vehicle.

          

          INT. CAPULET OFFICE. DAY.


          
          An orchestral fanfare. TRACK DOWN: Past monstrous letters
          that read CAPULET and in through a window to discover
          Fulgencio Capulet. He stares out the window toward the
          other tallest building in Verona; the one crested with the
          word MONTAGUE.

          

           CAPULET
           But Montague is bound as well as I,
           In penalty alike;

          
          Capulet turns: on the other side of his desk sits DAVID
          PARIS; a square-jawed young man in a red cashmere sweater.
          Tea has been served from an exquisite silver tea service.

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           And 'tis not hard, I think, for me
           so old as we to keep the peace.

          
          Dave smiles obligingly.

          

           DAVE
           Of honorable reckoning are you
           both,
           And pity 'tis you lived at odds so
           long.

          
          An awkward pause: Dave sips tea, then, with a deep breath...

          

           DAVE (CONT.)
           But now, my lord, what say you to
           my suit?

          
          Capulet considers the framed photograph on his desk.

          

           CAPULET
           But saying o'er what I have said

           BEFORE;
           My child is yet a stranger in the

           WORLD;
           Let two more summers wither in
           their pride,
           Ere we may think her ripe to be a
           bride.

          
          Dave is politely insistent.

          

           DAVE
           Younger than she are happy mothers
           made.

          

           CAPULET
           (checking him hard)
           And too soon marred are those so
           early made.
           Earth hath swallowed all my hopes
           but she;
           She is the hopeful lady of my earth.

          
          Capulet rounds the desk and places a fatherly hand on Dave's
          shoulder.

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           But woo her, gentle Paris, get her
           heart.
           My will to her consent is but a
           part,
           And she agreed, within her scope of

           CHOICE
           Lies my consent and fair according
           voice.
           This night I hold an old Accustomed
           feast.

          
          Capulet leans close.

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           At my poor house, look to behold
           this night,
           Fresh female buds that make dark
           heaven light.
           Hear all; all see,
           And like her most whose merit most
           shall be.

          
          Capulet smiles knowingly. Dave seems encouraged.

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           (a hearty slap)
           Come go with me!

          
          Capulet excitedly ushers Dave from the office.

          

          INT. POOL HALL. DAY.


          
          Dim, smoke filled. Benvolio and Romeo play pool.

          

           BENVOLIO
           (chalking his cue)
           Take thou some new infection to thy
           eye.

          
          He lines up the six ball top pocket.

          

           BENVOLIO (CONT.)
           And the rank poison of the old will
           die.

          
          A hopeless shot that slams the eight ball toward the side
          pocket. Romeo stops it with his hand and hurls it against
          the other balls.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

          
          Romeo sinks the other balls with his hands.

          

           ROMEO
           Not mad, but bound more than a
           madman is;
           Shut up in prison, kept without my
           food,

          
          Romeo stalks away from the table.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Whipped and tormented.

          
          He stops at the gun check, rummaging in his pocket.

          

           ROMEO
           Good day, good fellow.

          
          A crusty old man looks up from the small television. His
          entire face a tattooed shooting target, the bullseye between
          his eyes.

          
          The old man points to the sign that reads: "No ticket no
          gun." Romeo finally produces a ticket. Crusty the Target
          goes out back. Romeo's attention is caught by the television.

          

          INT. T.V. STUDIO SET. DAY


          

          CUT TO: TELEVISION.

          
          An ostentatious woman and her over groomed partner Rich,
          hosts what looks to be a kind of Entertainment Tonight show.
          The graphic behind them reads "Solemnity Nights" with Susan
          Santandiago and Rich Ranchidis.

          
          Susan speaks conspiratorially to camera.

          

           SUSAN
           Now I'll tell you without asking.
           The great
           Rich Capulet, holds an old
           accustomed feast;

          
          Rich chimes in:

          

           RICH
           A fair Assembly.

          

           SUSAN
           I Pray you sir can you read?

          
          A list of names begins to scroll across the screen. Rich
          reads them off.

          

           RICH
           Signor Placentio and his wife and
           daughters,
           Signor Martino, the Lady Widow

          INT. POOL HALL. DAY.


          
          CUT TO: Benvolio, he leans into Romeo.

          

           BENVOLIO
           At this same ancient feast of

           CAPULET'S
           Sups the fair Rosaline; whom thou
           so loves,
           With all the admired beauties of
           Verona.
           Go thither, and with unattained eye
           Compare her face with some that I
           shall show,
           And I will make thee think thy swan
           a crow.

           I'll go along, no such sight to be
           shown.
           But to rejoice in splendour of mine

          The boys move off.

          

          PUSH IN ON: THE TELEVISION.

          

          EXT. CAPULET STATE. DAY.


          
          An aerial shot of a magnificent island estate. An Italianate
          wonder of Florentine architecture. Armed guards patrol the
          grounds. The telecaption reads "Capulet Mansion."

          
          The file tape loses its television quality. We sweep down
          through manicured gardens, where workers prepare decorations
          for tonight's celebrations, and into the house. The music
          darkens and we hear the desperate calling of a girl's name.

          INT. BATHROOM. DAY.


          
          CLOSE ON: The still, serene, submerged features of a
          beautiful young girl. Dark floating hair gently frames the
          face. Heavy liquid eyes stare up through the water.

          
          We hear, though faintly, the calling:

          

           VOICE OVER

           J U L I E T !

          
          With a rush JULIET surfaces. As she gulps air, we realise
          that she is in fact, in a bath.

          
          We hear the calling loudly again.

          

           VOICE OVER

           J U L I E T !

          
          Juliet listens. For a moment she is very still, then she
          closes her eyes and slides back beneath the surface of the
          water.

          

          INT. ENTRANCE HALL CAPULET MANSION. DAY.


          
          A Gothic, unfriendly environment heavy with religious
          iconography. The entrance hall is crowded with workers and
          servants preparing for tonight's party.

          
          Gloria Capulet fiddles with a short black wig in the hallway
          mirror. She is attired in full Cleopatra costume.

          
          Dissatisfied with the wig, she rips it from her head and
          calls maniacally.

          

           GLORIA

           J U L I E T !

          
          Gloria is met by the NURSE, a fat, grandmotherly Hispanic
          woman.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Nurse, where's my daughter? Call
           her forth to me.

          

           NURSE
           I bade her come. God forbid!
           Where's this girl?
           Juliet!

          
          CUT TO: The top of the stairs. As if from nowhere, Juliet
          has appeared. She wears a bathrobe and her hair is wet.

          

           JULIET

           (COOLLY)
           Madam, I am here. What is you will.

          
          Gloria, startled, sweeps up the stairs and shuffles her
          daughter toward a doorway.

          

           GLORIA
           Nurse, give leave awhile, we must
           talk in secret.

          

          INT. GLORIA'S DRESSING ROOM. DAY.


          
          Gloria shepherds Juliet into her opulent dressing room and
          closes the door. She circles with nervous vexation searching
          for words, stops, then suddenly opens the door and yells out
          to the Nurse.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Nurse, come back again.
           I have remembered me, thou's hear
           our counsel.

          
          The Nurse enters. Gloria, still refusing eye contact,
          checks her appearance once more in the mirror. She takes a
          hairbrush and, feigning pleasantness, intensely brushes her
          hair.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Nurse, thou knowest my daughter's
           of a pretty age.

          

           NURSE
           (to Juliet)
           Thou wast the prettiest babe that
           e'er I nursed.

          
          The hair brush clatters onto the dresser. A moment of tense
          silence. Gloria grips herself and pours a sherry.

          
          Back still turned, she speaks to her daughter.

          

           GLORIA
           By my count, I was your mother much
           upon these years
           That you are now a maid.

          
          A nembutal twists like a pin in the corner of Gloria's mouth.
          She slugs it down with the sherry and turns abruptly to face
          Juliet.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Thus then in brief, the valiant
           Paris seeks you for his love.

          
          CUT TO: Juliet; an uncomprehending stare.

          
          The Nurse, caught off guard, tries to buoy the situation.

          

           NURSE
           A man, young lady! Lady, such a

           MAN
           As all the world - why, he's a man
           of wax.

          
          The medication takes immediate effect upon Gloria. She
          joins Juliet on the couch and coos in Paris's favour.

          

           GLORIA
           Verona's summer hath not such a
           flower.

          

           NURSE
           Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a
           very flower.

          

           GLORIA
           This night you shall behold him at
           our feast;
           Read o'er the volume of young
           Paris' face
           And find delight writ there with
           beauty's pen.
           This precious book of love, this
           unbound lover,
           To beautify him only lacks a cover.
           So shall you share all that he doth
           possess,
           By having him, making yourself no
           less.

          
          Gloria probes Juliet's thoughts.

          

           GLORIA
           Can you like of Paris' love?

          
          Juliet, adept at negotiating her mother's strange moods,
          chooses her words precisely.

          

           JULIET
           I'll look to like, if looking
           liking move,
           But no more deep will I endart mine
           eye,
           Than your consent gives strength to
           make it fly.

          
          PETER the chauffeur enters.

          

           PETER
           Madam. The guests are come.

          

           GLORIA
           (checks the mirror)
           We follow thee.

          
          She exits, Nurse in tow.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet stares out the windows and across the water.

          
          Suddenly the Nurse's face leers into shot. She whispers
          enthusiastically into Juliet's ear.

          

           NURSE
           Go girl, seek happy nights to happy
           days.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet's face.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION. DAY/NIGHT.


          
          JUMP CUT: Aerial shot of Capulet Mansion. We time lapse
          from late afternoon to night; fairy lights illuminate,
          guests appear, music swells, and a single incandescent
          flare, explodes pink against the inky sky.

          

          EXT. BEACH. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo: his face glows pink. He is sitting on the
          grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arthur,
          with fake chain mail and sword.

          
          Romeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay. The sound
          of the party drifts across the water. Balthasar, dressed as
          Frankenstein's monster, touches a lighter to a large bong
          and Romeo inhales smoke.

          
          Behind them, Benvolio, drunk and dressed as a pizza, is
          yelling at Gregory, who, dressed as a Viking, is trying to
          cut slices off his pizza costume. Sampson, also dressed as
          a Viking, sits in the back of a car. One arm is bandaged
          and he swigs from a bottle.

          
          Suddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights. A reckless
          sports car speeds toward the boys. Stereo screaming, the
          car skids to a halt.

          
          CLOSE ON: Music blares from the sound system. A silver
          stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself
          firmly in the dirt.

          
          CUT TO: The boys, eyes wide with amazement.

          
          CUT TO: Another stiletto follows the first. Guitar groans.

          
          PAN: Slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged legs, past
          a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini-skirt and up
          over a muscular dark skinned stomach and tiny sequined bra
          top, to discover: the 21 year old male, African American
          face of MERCUTIO.

          
          CUT TO: The boys. Recovering from the initial shock, they
          laugh and cat-call raucously.

          
          CUT TO: Mercutio. He roughly jams a short black wig onto
          his head and yells above the music.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Strike drum!

          
          Mercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere
          within his mini-skirt and dances down the beach to the boys.

          
          Aggressively bumping and grinding, Mercutio distributes the
          invitations. Reaching Romeo, he declares:

          

           MERCUTIO
           We'll on without apology.

          
          Romeo lets the invitation fall to the sand.

          

           ROMEO
           I am not for this ambling.
           Being but heavy, I will bear the
           light.

          
          Romeo pulls on the bong once more.

          
          Suddenly, Mercutio is upon Romeo. Hauling him to his feet,
          he waltzes him through the sand.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you
           dance.

          
          Romeo pushes Mercutio away.

          

           ROMEO
           Not I, believe me. You have
           dancing shoes
           With nimble soles. I have a soul
           of lead.

          
          Mercutio in mock sympathy.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Too great oppression for a tender
           thing.

          

           ROMEO
           Is love a tender thing? It is too
           rough, too rude, too boisterous,
           and it pricks like thorn.

          
          Romeo lies staring up at the stars.

          

           MERCUTIO
           If love be rough with you, be rough
           with love.

          
          Mercutio jumps on Romeo.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Prick love for pricking, and you
           beat love down.

          
          Romeo fights Mercutio off.

          

           ROMEO
           Under love's heavy burden do I sink!

          
          CUT TO: Benvolio, impatiently honking the horn.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Every man betake him to his legs!

          
          Mercutio heads Romeo toward the car.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Come, we burn daylight, ho!

          
          Romeo pulls away.

          

           ROMEO
           But 'tis no wit to go.

          
          Mercutio turns, exasperated.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Why, may one ask?

          

           ROMEO
           I dreamt a dream tonight.

          

           MERCUTIO
           And so did I.

          

           ROMEO
           Well, what was yours?

          

           MERCUTIO
           That dreamers often lie.

          

           ROMEO
           In bed asleep, while they do dream
           things true.

          
          Mercutio produces a tiny gold pill case.

          

           MERCUTIO
           O, then I see Queen Mab hath been
           with you.
           She is the fairies' midwife, and
           she comes
           In shape no bigger than an agate

           STONE
           On the forefinger of an alderman,
           Drawn with a team of little atomies
           Over men's noses as they lie asleep.

          
          Tantalisingly, he passes the case beneath Romeo's nose.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
           Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat.

          
          With a conjurer's dexterity Mercutio extracts a small, gray
          pill.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           And in this state she gallops night
           by night
           Through lovers' brains, and then
           they dream of love;

          
          He palms the pills. It reappears from behind Romeo's ear.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           O'er lawyers' fingers who straight
           dream on fees;
           O'er ladies' lips, who straight on
           kisses dream,
           Which oft the angry Mab with
           blisters plagues.
           Because their breaths with
           sweetmeats tainted are.

          
          The pill box glints in the moonlight.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Sometime she driveth o'er a
           soldier's neck;
           And then dreams he of cutting
           foreign throats.
           And being thus frighted, swears a
           prayer or two
           And sleeps again.

          
          Mercutio now intensely angry:

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           This is that very Mab
           That plaits the manes of horses in
           the night
           And bakes the elf-locks in foul
           sluttish hairs

          
          He screams into the night.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           This is the hag, when maids lie on
           their backs,
           That presses them and learns them
           first to bear,
           Making them women of good carriage.
           This is she, this is she...

          
          CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He breaks off. There is a strange
          stillness amongst the group. Romeo goes to his friend.

          

           ROMEO
           Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace.
           Thou talkest of nothing.

          
          Mercutio meets Romeo's gaze.

          

           MERCUTIO
           True, I talk of dreams;
           Which are the children of an idle
           brain,
           Begot of nothing but vain fantasy.
           Which is as thin of substance as
           the air
           And more inconstant than the wind,
           who woos
           Even now the frozen bosom of the

           NORTH
           And, being angered, puffs away from

           THENCE
           Turning his attention to the dew-
           dropping south.

          
          CUT TO: Benvolio in the car. The alcohol has caught up with
          him and he looks a little queasy.

          

           BENVOLIO
           This wind you talk of blows us from

           OURSELVES:
           Supper is done and we shall come
           too late.

          
          Romeo looks toward the distant city.

          

           ROMEO
           I fear, too early, for my mind

           MISGIVES
           Some consequence yet hanging in the

           STARS
           Shall bitterly begin his fearful

           DATE
           With this night's revels, and
           expire the term
           Of a despised life closed in my
           breast,
           By some vile forfeit of untimely
           death.

          
          PAUSE: The water turns golden as fireworks explode across
          the bay. Romeo smiles.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           But he that hath the steerage of my

           COURSE
           Direct my sail!

          
          He takes the pill and drops it into his mouth.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           On, lusty gentlemen!

          
          With the rush of a mind altering cocktail, we ZOOM IN on
          Romeo's eyes; they shimmer with the shooting star reflection
          of exploding fireworks - a bending Eastern chord, we launch
          into Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love', sung by the vocalist from
          Soundgarden with orchestration by 'Deconstruction' and sitar
          by Ravi Shankar.

          

          EXT. MERCUTIO'S CAR - ON FREEWAY. NIGHT.


          
          PULL OUT: From Romeo's eyes. He is lying in the passenger
          seat of Mercutio's convertible as it rockets along the
          freeway. The camera is directly above Romeo. He stares up
          at the fireworks that reflect in the windshield. The car
          and freeway begin to rotate and the camera follows. We feel
          that the car is now travelling upside-down. The camera
          sways through a brilliant explosion of fireworks that fill
          the screen with a zillion pixilating, colored dots of fire.

          

          INT. CAPULET'S MANSION - BALLROOM. NIGHT.


          
          PULL OUT: To discover the glittering dots of fire refracting
          from the sparkling domed roof of the magnificently ornate
          Capulet Ballroom. The camera swoops down over bizarrely
          costumed revellers cavorting to a driving Latin big band.
          The camera partners with a drugged Mercutio and Benvolio who
          shamelessly caper with each other in a mock antic adagio.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo gazing blankly at the dance floor.

          
          CUT TO: Mercutio. He sweeps up a thirty-something
          sophisticate and twirls her in Romeo's direction.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Everyman betake him to his legs!

          
          Romeo moves off through the crowd.

          
          CUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: Contorted images of costumed guests
          eat, drink and laugh in a grotesque collision of Yves Saint
          Laurent cocktail party and Bacchanalian romp.

          
          Suddenly a large arm coils around Romeo's neck.

          
          DISTORTED EXTREME CLOSE UP: A seriously intoxicated Fulgencio
          Capulet; his puffy red face squeezes against Romeo's.

          

           CAPULET
           Ah, I have seen the day that I

           COULD
           Tell a whispering tale in a fair
           ladies ear.
           Such as would please.

          
          Capulet screams above the music:

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           Come musicians play!

          
          Blood drums in Romeo's ears. Breaking free from Capulet's
          grasp as he pushes through the crowd toward the bathroom.

          

          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Silent, underwater shot. Romeo's tranquil features submerged
          in a basin of water.

          

          BEAT.

          
          With a gasp, Romeo rises. A moment. His breathing calms.
          Then, smoothing water into his hair, he gazes into the
          bathroom mirror. He turns:

          
          The entire wall opposite the mirror, is a magnificent salt-
          water fish tank.

          
          Romeo, drawn by it's submarine beauty, leans against the
          fish tank. Applause echoes faintly through the bathroom
          speakers.

          

          INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT.


          
          As the applause dies, a dark-haired Latina Diva takes the
          spotlight. The band ease into the opening bars of a love
          ballad.

          

          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.


          
          As the music swells, Romeo watches a moustached catfish
          glide past a medieval castle.

          
          Suddenly, Romeo pulls away. Peering back at him through the
          castle is a pair of exquisitely beautiful angelic eyes.

          
          The Diva's first pure, achingly beautiful notes soar.

          
          Confused, Romeo looks again. There is no mistake - it is a
          girl. Through a shimmering curtain of ribbon weed, two dark
          wide eyes, a childish nose and sumptuous full lips.

          
          Romeo pushes his face closer to the glass. The other face
          snaps abruptly away.

          

          INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: Juliet, dressed as an angel, on the other side of
          the tank. We now realise that the girls' powder room and
          the boys' bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world.

          
          Juliet warily moves closer to the glass.

          

          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo leans his face against the glass. The love ballad
          builds.

          
          SLOW TRACK: From Romeo's profile, in through the water, and...

          

          INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.


          
          ...out the other side, to find Juliet in profile, peering
          into the tank.

          

          INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo presses his nose lightly against the glass.

          

          INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Juliet; a tiny smile.

          
          Suddenly, CRASH! The door slams open. Juliet turns,
          startled. It is the Nurse.

          

           NURSE
           Juliet, your mother calls.

          
          The Nurse bustles Juliet out the door. Juliet looks over
          her shoulder at the mystery boy.

          

          INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo, now without his mask, slams out of the bathroom -
          Juliet and the Nurse have disappeared into the crowd.

          
          CUT TO: Juliet being dragged along by the Nurse. She
          glances back toward the mystery boy, but he is gone.

          
          Juliet and the Nurse rejoin Dave Paris, who is dressed as an
          astronaut, and Gloria, at the side of the dance floor.

          
          Dave, irresistible smile, extends his hand to Juliet.

          

           DAVE
           Will you now deny to dance?

          
          Juliet looks to Dave, desperately searching for a reason to
          decline. Gloria, brushing aside her silly daughter's
          protests, slugs the last of her champagne and corrals them
          onto the dance floor.

          

           GLORIA
           (whispering to Juliet)
           A man, young lady, such a man.

          
          As Juliet is dragged onto the floor her eyes furtively
          search for the boy.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo in the crowd. Desperate to find the girl, he
          roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as Lucifer, Prince
          of Darkness.

          
          HOLD ON: Lucifer. He removes his mask: it is Tybalt. He
          turns to Abra, who's dressed as a demon.

          

           TYBALT
           What, dares the slave come hither
           to fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
           Now by the stock and honor of my

           KIN
           To strike him dead I hold it not a
           sin.

          
          Tybalt moves off aggressively, but is halted as Capulet
          slams a hand into his chest.

          

           CAPULET
           Why how now kinsman, wherefore
           storm you so?

          

           TYBALT
           Uncle, this is that villain Romeo.
           A Montague, our foe.

          
          Capulet peers across the ballroom.

          

           CAPULET
           Young Romeo is it?

          

           TYBALT
           'Tis he.

          

           CAPULET
           Content thee gentle coz, let him
           alone.
           I would not for the wealth of all
           this town
           Here in my house do him
           disparagement.
           Therefore be patient; take no note
           of him.

          
          Tybalt can't believe it.

          

           TYBALT
           I'll not endure him.

          
          CLOSE ON: Capulet, exploding with rage.

           CAPULET
           He shall be endured!
           (slapping Tybalt viciously)
           What, goodman boy! I say he shall!
           Go to.

          
          Capulet violently shoves Tybalt to the ground.

          

           CAPULET
           You'll make a mutiny among my guests!

          
          A middle aged couple look on shocked - Capulet waves to them

          FESTIVELY:

          

           CAPULET
           What? Cheerly my hearts!

          
          Capulet snorts at Tybalt in disgust.

          

           CAPULET
           You'll not endure him! Am I the
           master here or you? Go to.

          
          Smoothing his hair into place, Capulet turns back into the
          ballroom.

          
          CLOSE ON: Tybalt choking back tears of rage.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo moving through the crowd. For a moment the
          crush clears and he spies the Angel on the dance floor.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo whispers:

          

           ROMEO
           Did my heart love till now?
           Forswear it, sight.
           For I ne'er saw true beauty till
           this night.

          
          Romeo begins to circumnavigate the dance floor in an attempt
          to get closer to Juliet.

          
          CUT TO: Dave slow dancing with Juliet.

          
          Juliet's eyes search the room for the boy.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet.

          
          Their eyes connect.

          
          Juliet looks quickly back to Dave who, oblivious, returns
          his most devastating smile.

          
          CUT TO: The songstress, her voice soars.

          
          CUT TO: Juliet. Unable to look away from the boy, she
          stares over Dave's shoulder.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo. Ignoring the danger, he continues to move
          toward the Angel.

          
          With the Diva's spiralling final notes, the ballad concludes.

          
          A complete black out. As the crowd break into wild applause,
          Juliet's eyes search the darkness, but the boy is gone.

          
          The crowd cheers and screams its applause. An avalanche of
          balloons, tinsel and confetti rains down from the roof;
          swathes of red silk drop from the ceiling and the space is
          transformed.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet, searching for the boy.

          
          Suddenly: A gasp, Juliet's eyes widen, shocked.

          
          In the dark, a hand has shot out from the drape curtaining
          off the stage and clasped hers. Juliet barely dares breathe.

          
          She glances furtively to Dave Paris - he watches the stage.

          
          Slowly Juliet turns toward the hand; there through a break
          in the curtain she can see eye, cheek and lips of the
          mystery boy. As the Diva reprises the chorus, Romeo gently
          pulls Juliet behind the curtain.

          

          INT. BEHIND CURTAIN. NIGHT.


          
          Concealed from the party by the red velvet drape, hands
          still clasped, the teenagers are so close their bodies
          almost touch.

          

           ROMEO
           If I profane with my unworthiest

           HAND
           This holy shrine, the gentle sin is
           this.
           My lips, two blushing pilgrims,
           ready stand
           To smooth that rough touch with a
           tender kiss.

          
          Romeo moves his lips toward Juliet's. She stops him.

          

           JULIET
           Good pilgrim, you do wrong your
           hand too much,
           Which mannerly devotion shows in
           this.
           For saints have hands that pilgrim's
           hands do touch,
           And palm to palm is holy palmers'
           kiss.

          

           ROMEO
           Have not saints lips, and holy
           palmers too?

          

           JULIET
           (a gentle scolding)
           Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must
           use in prayer.

          

           ROMEO
           O, then, dear saint, let lips do
           what hands do,
           They pray: grant thou, lest faith
           turn to despair.

          

           JULIET
           Saints do not move, though grant
           for prayer's sake.

          

           ROMEO
           Then move not while my prayer's
           effect I take.

          
          He kisses her.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Thus from my lips, by thine my sin
           is purged.

          

           JULIET
           Then have my lips the sin that they
           have took.

          

           ROMEO
           Sin from my lips? O trespass
           sweetly urged!
           Give me my sin again.

          
          He kisses her.

          

           JULIET
           You kiss by th' book.

          
          They kiss again.

          
          Suddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple.
          They break apart - Nurse has pulled open the curtain and
          stands eyeing them severely.

          

           NURSE
           Madam, your mother craves a word
           with you.

          
          We see that the party is breaking up. But for groups of
          die-hard revellers, the room is nearly empty.

          

           NURSE (CONT.)
           Come, let's away.

          
          She takes firm control of her charge.

          
          Juliet furtively motions for the startled Romeo not to
          follow as he trails them across the room.

          
          CUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: The Nurse and Juliet reach the door,
          but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase
          that arcs around to the mezzanine level. They join a vexed
          Gloria Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris.

          
          Inaudible words are exchanged. Juliet flickers her eyes
          nervously to Romeo.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo. He halts at the foot of the stairs unsure.

          
          CUT TO: Gloria. Catching Juliet's interest in the boy, she
          indicates to her daughter to 'COME ALONG'.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo; a dawning realisation.

          

           ROMEO
           (under his breath)
           Is she a Capulet?

          
          CUT TO: Juliet. She stops and turns back.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo, comprehending the reality of who she is.

          
          CUT TO: Juliet. The Nurse whispers in her ear.

          

           NURSE
           His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
           The only son of your great enemy.

          
          An orchestral treatment of Joy Division's "Love will tear us
          Apart" swells;

          
          HOLD ON: Juliet. Like a cloud passing across the sun, a
          dark coldness descends upon her.

          
          CUT TO: Mercutio. He throws himself upon the shell shocked
          Romeo.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Away, begone, the sport is at its
           best.

          
          Mercutio shuttles Romeo toward the door.

          

           ROMEO
           Ay so I fear,

          
          A covert glance over his shoulder.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           The more is my unrest.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.


          
          Mercutio bundles Romeo through the front door and down the
          stairs to the waiting getaway car.

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION - STAIRS ALCOVE WINDOW - NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: Juliet. Manoeuvred by the Nurse up the stairs, she
          breaks away and rushes to a tiny, windowed alcove.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE. NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: Mercutio's convertible and its noisy confederacy
          joining the line of departing limos.

          
          A huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in
          giant words "CAPULET."

          
          As the convertible passes beneath the blazing words, Romeo
          turns. Through a deluge of falling sparks, he glimpses the
          mystery girl high up in the tower.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet leaning out of the tower window. Brilliant
          sparkles light in her eyes.

          
          PUSH IN: We hear her secret whisper:

          

           JULIET
           My only love, sprung from my only
           hate.
           Too early seen unknown, and known
           too late.
           Prodigious birth of love it is to me

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE DRIVE. NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: JULIET'S P.O.V.: In slow motion Romeo, through the
          falling curtain of fiery embers.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)(V/O)
           That I must love a loathed enemy.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - WINDOW. NIGHT.


          
          Warm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks.
          Juliet closes the window and leans against the glass.

          
          CRANE DOWN: The side of the building past revellers who
          don't know when to leave. Standing in the front doorway is
          someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing
          Romeo. It is Tybalt. The music darkens as we push through
          the smoky wind.

          

           TYBALT
           I will withdraw. But this intrusion
           shall,
           Now seeming sweet, convert to
           bitterest gall.

          

          INT. MERCUTIO'S CAR. NIGHT.


          
          Caught in the jam of departing vehicles, Mercutio's car
          crawls along the bridge that links Capulet island with the
          mainland. The boys sing along raucously with the radio.

          

           BOYS
           "I am a pretty piece of flesh,
           I am a pretty piece of flesh..."

          
          PUSH IN: On Romeo, he whispers:

          

           ROMEO
           Can I go forward when my heart is
           here?
           Turn back, dull earth, and find thy
           centre out.

          
          Romeo leaps from the car. Benvolio yells after him.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Romeo! Cousin Romeo! Romeo!

          

          EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo runs back along the bridge toward the estate. At the
          gates, armed guards supervise the exodus of vehicles. Romeo
          uses the traffic to shield himself from view.

          
          Romeo leaps from the bridge and into the shadows at the base
          of the high stone wall that borders the compound.

          

          EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT.


          
          Mercutio's car prowls back along the bridge. The last
          guests have departed and the gates are swinging shut. The
          convertible halts in front of them.

          

           BENVOLIO
           He ran this way. Call, good
           Mercutio.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Nay, I'll conjure too.

          
          Mercutio leaps from the car. He postures like a magician in
          a low-budget variety special. The boys cheer him on.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion!
           Lover!
           I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright
           eyes,
           By her high forehead and her
           scarlet lip,
           By her fine foot, straight leg, and
           quivering thigh.
           And the demesnes that there adjacent
           lie,
           That in thy likeness thou appear to
           us!

          

          EXT. CAPULET WALL. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo's fake chain mail shirt tangled in the
          barbed wire at the top of the wall.

          
          PAN DOWN: Romeo, now on the other side of the wall, pulls up
          his undershirt and gingerly inspects the cuts inflicted by
          the wire.

          
          Mercutio's cavorting echoes from the bridge. Romeo smiles
          ironically.

          

           ROMEO
           He jests at scars that never felt a
           wound.

          
          Romeo moves off through the darkened grounds of Capulet
          estate.

          

          EXT. CAPULET BRIDGE. NIGHT.


          
          The boys laugh hysterically as Mercutio staggers around the
          bridge in imitation of a love sick fool.

          

           MERCUTIO
           O Romeo, that she were, O that she

           WERE
           An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!

          
          The hilarity is abruptly arrested as a security spotlight
          blazes to life, pinning Mercutio in its beam. The sound of
          automatic weapons cocking pierces the night.

          
          CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He's brave but not stupid. He gets
          back into the car.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Come, shall we go?

          

          EXT. THE BACK OF CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: A pair of stone cherubs on top of the retaining
          wall of a terraced garden. Romeo's face appears between them.

          
          Romeo hauls himself up onto the wall. Below is a Greco-
          Roman style pool area. To the right the darkened rear wing
          of Capulet Mansion. Suddenly the back of the house explodes
          with light. Romeo takes cover.

          

           ROMEO
           But soft, what light through yonder
           window breaks?

          
          Romeo's question is answered as out onto the verandah comes
          Juliet. She is still clad in her angel robe, but without
          the halo and wings. She slowly descends to pool level.

          

           ROMEO
           It is the East, and Juliet is the
           sun!
           Arise, fair sun, and kill the
           envious moon,
           Who is already sick and pale with

           GRIEF
           That thou her maid art far more
           fair than she.
           Be not her maid, since she is
           envious.
           Her vestal livery is but sick and
           green,
           And none but fools do wear it.
          Juliet stands on the top step of the pool stairs. She is
          directly below Romeo as he whispers.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Cast it off!

          
          Juliet sits on the edge of the pool, her legs dangle in the
          water.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           It is my lady. O, it is my love!
           O that she knew she were!

          
          Juliet sighs.

          

           JULIET
           Ay me!

          

           ROMEO

           (WHISPERS)
           She speaks.
           O, speak again, bright angel!

          
          Juliet looks longingly toward the stars.

          

           JULIET
           O Romeo, Romeo! - Whyfore art thou
           Romeo?
           Deny thy father and refuse thy
           name.
           Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn
           my love,
           And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo. Incredulous.

          

           ROMEO
           Shall I hear more, or shall I speak
           at this?

          

           JULIET
           'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
           Thou are thyself, though not a
           Montague.
           What's Montague? It is not hand
           nor foot
           Nor arm nor face nor any other part
           Belonging to a man. O, be some
           other name!
           What's in a name?
           That which we call a rose
           By any other word would smell as
           sweet.
           So Romeo would, were he not Romeo
           called,
           Retain that dear perfection which
           he owes
           Without that title. Romeo, doff
           thy name,
           And for thy name, which is no part
           of thee,
           Take all myself.

          
          Romeo wildly calls:

          

           ROMEO
           I take thee at thy word!
           Call me but love, and I'll be new
           baptised.
           Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

          
          Romeo jumps down from the wall. Juliet screams, and turns,
          toppling backwards. Romeo grabs her hand but her momentum
          overbalances him and they both plunge headlong into the pool.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL - UNDERWATER. NIGHT.


          
          Underwater shot: A slow motion phosphorescent tangle of
          arms, legs and bodies.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - BACK GARDEN. NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: A security guard. Alerted by the noise he moves
          toward the pool area.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION - POOL GARDEN - NIGHT.


          
          CUT TO: Above water, real time: Romeo and Juliet surface
          spluttering. Juliet thrashes the water in an attempt to get
          distance from her attacker.

          

           JULIET
           What man art thou that, thus
           bescreened in night,
           So stumblest on my counsel?

          
          Romeo: A calming gesture as he tries to tread water.

          

           ROMEO
           By a name I know not how to tell
           thee who I am:
           My name, dear saint, is hateful to

           MYSELF
           Because it is an enemy to thee.
          The ferocious barking of a guard dog arrests the teenagers
          attention. A moment, then they slide beneath the water.

          
          CUT TO: The security guard and dog appearing above the pool
          area.

          
          GUARD'S P.O.V.: The rippling surface of the water.

          
          CUT TO - UNDERWATER SHOT: Romeo and Juliet submerged, hair
          streaming, stare at each other like two beautiful fish.

          
          CUT TO: The guard. He can see noisy caterers cleaning up
          around the other side of the house. Frowning, he returns
          the way he came.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo and Juliet. Gasping for air, they cautiously
          surface. A moment - then Juliet, a small smile.

          

           JULIET
           Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?

          

           ROMEO
           Neither, fair maid, if either thee
           dislike.

          
          Juliet looks nervously toward the house. She drags Romeo
          toward a small grotto at the end of the pool.

          

           JULIET
           How cam'st thou hither, tell me,
           and whyfore?
           The garden walls are high and hard
           to climb,
           And the place death, considering
           who thou art.

          

           ROMEO
           (with splashy bravado)
           With love's light wings did I o'er
           perch these walls.
           For stony limits cannot hold love
           out,
           And what love can do, that dares
           love attempt.
           Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop
           to me.

          
          Juliet drags Romeo firmly into the grotto.

          

           JULIET
           (a real fear)
           If they do see thee, they will
           murder thee.

          
          Romeo slowly pulls Juliet toward him.

          

           ROMEO
           I have night's cloak to hide me
           from their eyes.
           And but thou love me, let them find
           me here.
           My life were better ended by their

           HATE
           Than death prorogued, wanting of
           thy love.

          
          The lovers kiss long and deep. Then Juliet, suddenly
          fearful, pushes Romeo away.

          

           JULIET
           Thou knowest the mask of night is
           on my face,
           Else would a maiden blush bepaint
           my cheek,
           For that which thou hast heard me
           speak tonight.
           Fain would I dwell on form - fain,
           fain deny
           What I have spoke. But farewell
           compliment!
           Dost thou love me?

          
          Romeo tries to speak, Juliet silences him.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           I know thou wilt say 'Ay', and I
           will take thy word. Yet, if thou
           swearest,
           Thou mayst prove false. O gentle
           Romeo,
           If thou dost love, pronounce it
           faithfully.
           Or if thou think'st I am too
           quickly won,
           I'll frown, and be perverse, and
           say thee nay,
           So thou wilt woo. But else, not
           for the world.
           In truth, fair Montague, I am too
           fond,
           And therefore thou mayst think my
           'haviour light.
           But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove
           more true
           Than those that have more cunning
           to be strange.

          

           ROMEO
           Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
           That tips with silver all these
           fruit-tree tops -

          

           JULIET
           O, swear not by the moon, th'
           inconstant moon,
           That monthly changes in her circled
           orb,
           Lest that thy love prove likewise
           variable.

          

           ROMEO
           What shall I swear by?

          

           JULIET
           Do not swear at all.
           Or if thou wilt, swear by thy
           gracious self,
           Which is the god of my idolatry,
           And I'll believe thee.

          
          She touches his cheek. Romeo moves his lips close.

          

           ROMEO
           If my heart's dear love -

          
          Confused, Juliet breaks away.

          

           JULIET
           Well, do not swear. Although I joy
           in thee,
           I have no joy of this contract
           tonight.
           It is too rash, too unadvised, too

           SUDDEN;
           Too like the lightning, which doth
           cease to be
           Ere one can say 'it lightens.'
           Sweet, good night.
           This bud of love, by summer's
           ripening breath,
           May prove a beauteous flower when
           next we meet.
           Good night, good night. As sweet
           repose and rest
           Come to thy heart as that within my
           breast.

          
          She rushes up the stairs - Romeo follows desperately.

          

           ROMEO
           O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

          
          Juliet - a shocked look.

          

           JULIET
           What satisfaction canst thou have
           tonight?

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo.

          

           ROMEO
           The exchange of thy love's faithful
           vow for mine.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet. She runs joyously to Romeo.

          

           JULIET
           I gave thee mind before thou didst
           request it!

          
          Kissing him passionately.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           And yet I would it were to give
           again.

          

           ROMEO
           Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what
           purpose love?

          

           JULIET
           But to be frank and give it thee
           again.

          
          They kiss again. The Nurse calls from inside.

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Juliet!

          
          Juliet looks to the house.

          

           JULIET

           (BREATHLESSLY)
           Three words, dear Romeo, and good
           night indeed.
           If that thy bent of love be
           honourable.
           Thy purpose marriage, send me word
           tomorrow,
           By one that I'll procure to come to
           thee,
           Where and what time thou wilt
           perform the rite,
           And all my fortunes at thy foot
           I'll lay
           And follow thee my lord throughout
           the world.

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Madam!

          

           JULIET
           I come, anon - But if thou meanest
           not well,
           I do beseech thee...

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Madam!

          

           JULIET
           (to Nurse)
           By and by I come!
           To cease thy strife and leave me to
           my grief.
           Tomorrow will I send.

          
          Romeo holds Juliet's gaze.

          

           ROMEO
           So thrive my soul.

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Madam!

          
          Juliet breaks away.

          

           JULIET
           A thousand times good night!

          
          With a final kiss, Juliet runs inside.

          

           ROMEO
           A thousand times the worse, to want
           thy light.
           Love goes toward love as schoolboys
           from their books;
           But love from love, toward school
           with heavy looks.

          
          Juliet re-appears at the upper balcony.

          

           JULIET
           Romeo! What o'clock tomorrow
           Shall I send to thee?

          

           ROMEO
           By the hour of nine.

          
          Juliet unclasps a delicate silver necklace from around her
          neck.

          

           JULIET
           I will not fail. 'Tis twenty year
           till then.
           Goodnight, goodnight! Parting is
           such sweet sorrow.
           That I shall say goodnight till it
           be morrow.

          
          She lets the necklace fall from her hand. Romeo catches it
          and she is gone.

          

           ROMEO
           Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace
           in thy breast,
           Would I were sleep and peace, so
           sweet to rest.

          

          INT. GREENHOUSE. DAWN.


          
          Morning sunlight filters through the lush foliage of a
          tropical rainforest.

          
          PAN DOWN: As we hear:

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (O/S)
           O mickle is the powerful grace that

           LIES
           In plants, herbs, stones, and their
           true qualities.

          
          We discover the intensely concentrating features of FATHER
          LAURENCE. Fifties, wiry and wearing a priest's collar,
          Laurence delicately makes an incision in the bulb of a small
          purple flowered plant.

          
          A pair of fresh faced ten year old boys look on in wonderment
          as a vivid blue sap oozes from the incision.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Within the infant rind of this weak

           FLOWER
           Poison hath residence, and medicine
           power.

          
          PULL BACK: The Priest carefully gathers the sap into a
          beaker. We discover that we are in a small tropical
          greenhouse.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           (to the boys)
           For this, being smelt, with that
           part cheers each part;
           Being tasted, stays all senses with
           the heart.
          The boys follow the Father as he moves out of the greenhouse
          and into an adjoining work area. The walls are lined with
          bottles of herbs and dried plants and a television flickers
          in the corner.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           For naught so vile on the earth
           doth live,
           But to the earth some special good
           doth give;

          
          With the precision of a chemist, Father Laurence funnels the
          sap into a small bottle and places it in the refrigerator.
          From out of the refrigerator he produces a large jar of
          candy. He eyes the boys sternly.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Nor aught so good but, strained
           from that fair use,
           Revolts from true birth, stumbling
           on abuse.

          
          The boys take their candy and scram.

          
          CUT TO: The muted television. A morning news program shows
          footage of a murder scene cordoned off with police tape. A
          distraught mother is being restrained.

          
          CLOSE ON: The priest contemplating the television.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Two such opposed kings encamp them

           STILL
           In man as well as herbs: grace and
           rude will;
           And where the worser is predominant,
           Full soon the canker death eats up
           that plant.

          
          A feverish knocking breaks the priest's reverie.

          

           ROMEO (O/S)
           Good morrow, father!

          
          Father Laurence snaps off the television and exits the
          workroom.

          

          EXT. WALL. DAWN.


          
          Romeo, dressed in last night's chain mail, pounds desperately
          on a wooden door set into a high stone wall.

          

           ROMEO
           Good morrow, father!

          

          EXT. COURTYARD. DAWN.


          
          From the workroom, Father Laurence enters a courtyard which
          encloses a tranquil tropical garden. He opens a door in the
          wall of the courtyard and smiles as the costumed Romeo
          bursts in.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Benedicite!
           What early tongue so sweet saluteth
           me?

          
          Without pausing, the priest continues through the courtyard
          and toward the church.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Young son, it argues a distempered

           HEAD
           So soon to bid good morrow to thy
           bed.
           Or if not so, then here I hit it
           right -
           Our Romeo hath not been in bed
           tonight.

          
          The priest enters the back of the church.

          

          INT. SACRISTY. DAWN.


          
          Romeo, on fire to tell of his experience, follows the priest
          into the sacristy.

          

           ROMEO
           The last is true. The sweeter rest
           was mine.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           (he stops)
           God pardon sin! Wast thou with
           Rosaline?

          

           ROMEO
           With Rosaline, my ghostly father?
           No.
           I have forgot that name and that
           name's woe.

          
          The Father lays out the cut glass bottles and communion tray
          for mass.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           That's my good son! But where hast
           thou been then?

          
          Unconsciously, Romeo helps the priest prepare. It is clear
          he knows the routine by heart.

          

           ROMEO
           I have been feasting with mine
           enemy,
           Where on a sudden one hath wounded
           me.
           That's by me wounded. Both our

           REMEDIES
           Within they help and holy physic
           lies.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           (buttoning a long
           black cassock)
           Be plain, good son, and homely in
           thy drift.
           Riddling confession finds but
           riddling shrift.

          

           ROMEO
           Then plainly know my heart's dear
           love is set,
           On the fair daughter of rich
           Capulet.
           We met, we wooed, and made exchange
           of vow,
           I'll tell thee as we pass. But
           this I pray,
           That thou consent to marry us today.

          
          CUT TO: The Priest, thunderstruck. The two kids, now
          dressed in red altar-boy robes, enter.

          

           ALTAR BOYS
           Good morrow, Romeo.

          
          The apoplectic priest waves the boys away. They get the
          message and bolt.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Holy Saint Francis! What a change
           is here!
           Is Rosaline, that thou didst love
           so dear,
           So soon foresaken? Young men's
           love then lies
           Not truly in their hearts, but in
           their eyes.

          

           ROMEO
           Thou chid'st me oft for loving
           Rosaline.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           (very angry)
           For doting, not for loving, pupil
           mine.

          

           ROMEO
           I pray thee chide me not. Her I
           love now
           Doth grace for grace and love for
           love allow.
           The other did not so.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           O, she knew well
           Thy love did read by rote, that
           could not spell.

          
          The Father falls into a chair and considers. He looks
          through the sacristy door to where a small children's choir
          has assembled. Their angelic voices soar into the purest of
          hymns.

          

           CHOIR
           How can you just leave me standing
           Alone in a world so cold,
           Maybe I'm just too demanding,
           Maybe I'm just like my father, too
           bold,
           Maybe you're just like my mother,
           She's never satisfied.
           Why do we scream at each other?
           This is what it sounds like when
           doves cry...

          
          We recognise the hymn as "When Doves Cry" by Prince.

          
          PUSH IN: On the Priest; moved, he looks to Romeo.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           But come, young waverer, come, go
           with me.
           In one respect I'll thy assistant
           be.
           For this alliance may so happy

           PROVE
           To turn your households' rancor to
           pure love.

          
          Romeo hurriedly assists the priest with his vestments.

          

           ROMEO
           O, let us hence! I stand on sudden
           haste.

          
          Father Laurence holds Romeo in his powerful gaze.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Wisely and slow. They stumble that
           run fast.

          
          The procession is joined by the two little altar boys and
          the mass begins.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY.


          
          As the Angelic voices of the choir soar, we see a pay phone
          etched with hyper-real starkness against the white sand,
          green sea and blue sky.

          
          A single leaning palm tree frames the image like a ridiculous
          tourist postcard.

          
          Benvolio speaks on the pay phone. Mercutio, torso naked but
          for his holstered Sports Rapier 9mm, drums his fingers on
          the side of the booth.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Where the devil should this Romeo
           be?
           Came he not home tonight?

          

           BENVOLIO
           (slamming down the phone)
           Not to his father's. I spoke with
           his man.

          
          Mercutio storms off down the beach.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Why, that same pale hard-hearted
           wench, that Rosaline,
           Torments him so that he will sure
           run mad.

          

           BENVOLIO
           (running to keep up)
           Tybalt hath sent a letter to his
           father's house.

          

           MERCUTIO
           (halts abruptly)
           A challenge, on my life.

          
          CLOSE ON: Benvolio, unsure.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Romeo will answer it?

          

           MERCUTIO
           Any man that can write may answer a
           letter.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Nay, he will answer the letter's
           master, how he dares, being dared.

          
          Mercutio clamps Benvolio into a headlock.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Alas, poor Romeo, he is already
           dead!
           Stabbed with a white wench's black
           eye,

          
          He whispers into Benvolio's ear:

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Run through the ear with a love
           song.
           (in disgust)
           And is he a man to encounter Tybalt?

          

           BENVOLIO
           (struggling to break free)
           Why, what is Tybalt?

          

           MERCUTIO
           (releasing him)
           More than Prince of Cats, I can
           tell you.
           O, he's the courageous captain of
           compliments.
           The very butcher of a silk button.

          
          Lightening fast, Mercutio draws his gun. He twirls it in an
          impressive display of gunmanship which ends with the barrel
          between the startled Benvolio's eyes.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           A duellist, a duellist.

          
          Romeo's car pulls into the beach side parking lot. Benvolio
          heads toward it.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!

          

          EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY.


          
          Romeo alights from his car and throws his keys to Balthasar
          who lounges outside the beach side hang. Mercutio saunters
          up the beach with mock nonchalance.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Signor Romeo, Bonjour. There's a
           French salutation to your French
           slop. You gave us the counterfeit
           fairly last night.

          

           ROMEO
           Good morrow to you both. What
           counterfeit did I give you?

          

           MERCUTIO
           The slip, sir, the slip. Can you
           not conceive?

          
          Romeo smiles smugly.

          

           ROMEO
           Pardon, good Mercutio. My business
           was great, and in such a case as
           mine a man may strain courtesy.

          

           MERCUTIO

           (SARCASTICALLY)
           A most courteous exposition.

          

           ROMEO
           Nay I am the very pink of courtesy.

          

           MERCUTIO

           (CAMPLY)
           Pink for flower?

          
          The boys laugh. Romeo feigns anger.

          

           ROMEO
           I will bite thee on the ear for
           that jest!

          
          Mercutio, goading Romeo to follow, backs off down the beach.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Come between us, good Benvolio! My
           wits faint.

          
          Mercutio flicks sand at Romeo, then sprints off down the
          beach. Romeo, laughing, gives chase.

          

           ROMEO
           Switch and spurs, switch and spurs,
           or I'll cry a match.

          

          EXT. BEACH - SHORELINE. DAY.


          
          Romeo is gaining on Mercutio, who runs headlong into the sea.
          With a yell, Romeo dives in after him.

          

          EXT. BEACH - AT SEA. DAY.


          
          Mercutio splashes the laughing Romeo.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Why, is not this better now than
           groaning for love?

          
          Romeo tries to dunk Mercutio.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Now art thou sociable.

          
          Mercutio, evading, heads for shore.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Now art thou Romeo. Now art thou...

          

          EXT. BEACH - SHORELINE. DAY.


          
          Romeo tackles Mercutio on the wet sand. Mercutio falls
          suddenly serious.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)

           (QUIETLY)
           What thou art, by art as well as by
           nature.

          
          A moment between the boys. A shadow falls across them.
          Romeo looks up.

          

           ROMEO
           Here's goodly gear.

          
          Standing above the boys is the Nurse. She wears a
          ridiculous, all red, "Jackie O" style disguise of sunglasses,
          scarf and parasol.

          

           MERCUTIO

           (BEMUSED)
           God ye good e'en fair gentlewoman.

          
          The nurse, ignoring Mercutio, speaks dramatically to Romeo.

          

           NURSE
           I desire some confidence with you.

          
          She turns and walks back to the parking lot where Peter the
          chauffer waits beside the limousine.

          
          Benvolio and the other boys look on curiously.

          

           MERCUTIO
           A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!

          
          But Romeo rises and to the amazement of Mercutio actually
          follows this woman. Mercutio looks questioningly to
          Benvolio, who shrugs.

          

           BENVOLIO
           She will endite him to some supper?

          
          Even more strangely, Romeo gets into the limousine.

          

           MERCUTIO
           (taken by surprise)
           Romeo, will you come to your
           father's?
           We'll to dinner thither.

          

           ROMEO
           (as he closes the door)
           I will follow you.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell.

          
          The car pulls away.

          

          EXT. STREET. DAY.


          
          The limousine drives through Verona Beach.

          

          INT. MOVING LIMOUSINE. DAY.


          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo jammed into the corner of the seat. The
          Nurse's face is pressed alarmingly close to his. She speaks
          in cold deadly earnest.

          

           NURSE
           If ye should lead her in a fool's
           paradise, as they say, it were a
           very gross kind of behavior, as
           they say. For the gentlewoman is
           young; and therefore, if you should
           deal double with her, truly it were
           an ill thing and very weak dealing.

          
          BEAT: Romeo chooses his words carefully.

          

           ROMEO
           Bid her to come to confession this
           afternoon,
           And there she shall at Friar
           Laurence's cell
           Be shrived and
           (PUSH IN ON: Romeo)
           married.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY.


          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet's face peering out her bedroom window.

          

           JULIET
           O God she comes!

          

          EXT. CAPULETS MANSION - DRIVEWAY. DAY.


          
          PULL BACK: JULIET'S P.O.V.: The limousine pulls up at the
          front door, the Nurse alights.

          
          Juliet bolts from the room.

          

          INT. LANDING. DAY.


          
          Juliet hurries down the stairs - the Nurse, a way ahead,
          disappears into a doorway.

          

          INT. STAIRWAY. DAY.


          
          Juliet races down a dark stairwell that leads to the bowels
          of the house.

          

          INT. KITCHEN. DAY.


          
          The kitchen, obviously the Nurse's domain, is decorated with
          a mixture of religious iconography and travel posters. Most
          of the posters depict a strange city of decadent, decaying,
          beauty.

          
          Juliet bursts breathlessly into the room.

          

           JULIET
           O honey nurse, what news?

          
          The Nurse, buried up to her ample hips inside the
          refrigerator, does not turn around.

          
          Juliet cries impatiently.

          

           JULIET
           Nurse!

          
          The nurse emerges from the ice box laden with food. Moving
          to the counter she starts to make a sandwich.

          

           NURSE
           I am aweary, give me leave awhile.
           Fie, how my bones ache. What a
           jaunce have I.

          
          Juliet under her breath.

          

           JULIET
           I would thou hadst my bones and I
           thy news.

          
          Juliet goes to the nurse.

          

           JULIET
           Nay come, I pray thee, speak: good;

           GOOD
           Nurse, speak.

          
          Sandwich made, the nurse shuffles over to a corner couch.

          

           NURSE
           Jesu, what haste. Can you not stay
           awhile?
           Can you not see I am out of breath?

          
          Juliet cannot stand the suspense any longer.

          

           JULIET
           How art thou out of breath when
           thou hast breath
           To say to me that thou art out of
           breath!
           Is the news good or bad? Answer to
           that.

          
          The Nurse takes a big bite from her sandwich and answers
          through thoughtful chews.

          

           NURSE
           Well, you have made a simple
           choice.
           You know not how to choose a man.
           Romeo? No, not he.
           Though his face be better than any
           man's, yet his leg excels all men's
           and for a hand and a foot and a
           body, though they be not to be
           talked on, yet they are past
           compare.
           He's not the flower of courtesy,
           but I'll warrant him as gentle as a
           lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve
           God. What, have you dined at home?

          
          Juliet is flabbergasted.

          

           JULIET
           No, no. But all this I did know
           before. What says he of our
           marriage? What of that

          

           NURSE
           Lord how my head aches! What a
           head have I:
           My back -

          
          This is a game that Juliet knows well. She moves behind the
          Nurse and begins massaging her back.

          

           NURSE (CONT.)
           o' t'other side - ah, my back!
           Beshrew your heart for sending me

           ABOUT
           To catch my death with jauncing up
           and down.

          
          With sublime self control, Juliet coo's sweetly.

          

           JULIET
           I'faith I am sorry that thou art
           not well.
           Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me,
           what says my love?

          

           NURSE
           Your love says like an honest
           gentleman,
           And a courteous, and a kind, and a
           handsome,
           And I warrant a virtuous - Where is
           your mother?

          
          Juliet cracks.

          

           JULIET
           Where is my mother? How oddly thou
           repliest!
           'Your love says, like an honest
           gentleman, "Where is your mother"'!

          
          The nurse sulks.

          

           NURSE
           O God's lady dear are you so hot?
           Henceforth do your messages yourself.

          
          Juliet's frustration explodes.

          

           JULIET
           Here's such a coil! COME WHAT SAYS

           ROMEO?

          
          PAUSE: The Nurse considers Juliet.

          

           NURSE
           Have you got leave to go to
           confession today?

          

           JULIET
           I have.

          

           NURSE
           Then hie you hence to Father
           Laurence cell.
           There stays a husband to make you a
           wife!

          
          Juliet, with a scream of joy, hugs the Nurse to her.

          
          HOLD ON: Juliet's ecstatic features.

          

          INT. CHURCH. DAY.


          

          TIGHT ON: FATHER LAURENCE:

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           These violent delights have violent
           ends!

          
          PULL BACK: Father Laurence is preaching energetically from
          the pulpit. Hidden from the congregation, Romeo waits in a
          small alcove chapel at the side of the altar.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           The sweetest honey
           Is loathsome in its own
           deliciousness,
           Therefore love moderately.

          
          The Father glances toward Romeo.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Long love doth so.
           Too swift arrives as tardy as too
           slow.
          Juliet pushes through the double doors at the far end of the
          church.

          
          Father Laurence motions to the middle-aged choir master who
          leads the choir into a choral version of Led Zeppelin's "A
          Whole Lot of Love" with Latin lyrics.

          
          Father Laurence hurries from the altar over to Romeo.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Here comes the lady.

          
          Juliet bursts into the tiny chapel. Trying to observe a
          vestige of decorum, she greets Father Laurence.

          

           JULIET
           Good afternoon to my ghostly
           confessor.

          
          But before the priest can reply, the two lovers embrace,
          kissing passionately.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE

           (DRYLY)
           Romeo shall thank thee, daughter,
           for us both.

          
          The choir completes the hymn and the priest, realising it is
          his cue, rushes back to the altar. He quickly delivers a
          prayer to the congregation while eyeing the increasingly
          amorous smooching of the young couple.

          
          The choir launch into a joyous chorus and the priest returns
          to Romeo and Juliet. He delicately parts the couple.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Come, come, and we will make short
           work.
           For, by your leaves, you shall not
           stay alone
           Till Holy Church incorporate two in
           one.

          
          A young boy with a voice like Jamiroquai steps forward. He
          launches into a wailing solo.

          
          MACRO CLOSE UP: A simple silver ring. Engraved on the
          inside of the band are the words 'I love thee.'

          
          PULL BACK: Romeo slips the ring onto Juliet's finger as the
          priest executes the formal sacrament of marriage.

          INT./EXT. CHURCH. DAY.


          
          CRANE UP: Through the majestic patterning of stained glass,
          and out of the church to find Peter, the chauffeur, cradling
          a small camera as he waits nervously beside the limo.

          

          EXT. CHURCH. DAY.


          
          The music swells in celebration. Romeo and Juliet, now
          newly-wed, rush from the side door of the church. The
          priest follows, throwing handfuls of rice. Peter studiously
          takes a snap as the bride and groom kiss.

          
          Peter holds the door of the limousine open. Reluctantly
          Juliet gets into the car.

          
          As the car pulls out of the driveway, Romeo runs alongside.

          
          HOLD: On Romeo as he watches the big black car speed away.

          

          EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.


          
          FISH-EYE VIEW: From the bottom of the ocean; Mercutio's
          distorted features. Gun aimed, he stares intently into the
          water.

          
          A muffled BANG! and a bullet whizzes past the camera.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH. DAY.


          
          We see that Mercutio - wading in knee deep water close to
          the beach - is hunting fish.

          
          Benvolio shelters in the shade of an unmanned life guard
          tower.

          
          A shimmering heat haze blankets the deserted beach and the
          horizon is stacked with purple storm clouds.

          

           BENVOLIO
           I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's
           retire.
           The day is hot,

          
          Mercutio, ignoring him, plugs away at another fish. Benvolio
          nervously looks to see if there is any reaction to the sound
          of the shot.

          

           BENVOLIO (CONT.)
           The Capels are abroad. And if we
           meet we shall not 'scape a brawl.

          
          Mercutio strides out of the water.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Thou art like one of these fellows
           that, when he enters the confines
           of a tavern, claps me his sword
           upon the table and says 'God send
           me no need of thee!'
           (he hands Benvolio
           his gun)
           and by the operation of the second
           cup draws him on the drawer, when
           indeed there is no need.

          
          Another incredible sleight of hand routine and Mercutio has
          managed to draw Benvolio's pistol, retrieve his own gun, and
          trap Benvolio with a barrel at each temple.

          
          The joke has worn thin for Benvolio; he pushes past Mercutio
          toward where Balthasar, Sampson and Gregory lounge in the
          shade of the beach-side hang.

          
          Suddenly he stops dead - a monstrous black sedan prowls into
          the beach side parking lot.

          

           BENVOLIO
           By my head, here comes the Capulets.

          

           MERCUTIO
           By my heel, I care not.

          

          EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY.


          
          The sedan mounts the curb and slides to a halt only metres
          from Benvolio and Mercutio.

          
          Tybalt, Abra and Petruchio alight from the sedan and walk
          menacingly toward Mercutio and Benvolio.

          

           TYBALT
           Gentlemen, good day. A word with
           one of you.

          
          The boys from the hang, drawn the Capulet car, converge -
          eyes dart nervously, hands stray towards guns.

          
          Mercutio smiles mockingly.

          

           MERCUTIO
           And but one word with one of us?
           Couple it with something. Make it
           a word and a...

          
          Leaning close to Tybalt, he camps the implication.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           ...blow.

          
          Mercutio scores. The boys laugh.

          

           TYBALT

           (FURIOUS)
           You shall find me apt enough to
           that, sir,
           (clutching at his
           side arm)
           And you will give me occasion.

          
          CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He stops, eyeing the hand on the gun.
          No one moves.

          

           MERCUTIO
           (a breathy, coquettish

           VOICE)
           Could you not take some occasion
           without giving?

          
          The boys fall about again. Tybalt cracks.

          

           TYBALT
           Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.

          
          The accusation stings - Mercutio's anger flares.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Consort? What, dost thou make us
           minstrels? And thou make minstrels
           of us look to hear nothing but
           discords. Here's my fiddlestick.

          
          Indicating his holstered gun.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Here's that shall make you dance.
           (barking at Tybalt)
           Zounds,
           (goading him to go
           for his gun)
           consort!

          
          CLOSE ON: Tybalt.

          
          CLOSE ON: Mercutio. He will not back down. Benvolio tries
          to diffuse things.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Either withdraw unto some private
           place.
           Or reason coldly of your grievances.
           Here all eyes gaze on us.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Men's eyes were made to look, and
           let them gaze.
           I will not budge for no man's
           pleasure, I.

          
          At that moment, Romeo's car pulls into the lot. Tybalt
          smiles.

          

           TYBALT
           Well sir, here comes my man.

          
          Tybalt moves toward Romeo who bounds from his car full of
          happy news.

          

           TYBALT
           Romeo, the love I bear thee can

           AFFORD
           No better term than this:

          
          CLOSE ON: Tybalt. He clears his jacket from his side arm
          and issues the challenge.

          

           TYBALT (CONT.)
           Thou art a villain!

          
          CLOSE ON: Mercutio.

          
          CLOSE ON: Benvolio.

          
          All eyes are on Romeo.

          
          Romeo calmly approaches his now cousin.

          

           ROMEO
           Tybalt, the reason that I have to
           love thee
           Doth much excuse the appertaining

           RAGE
           To such a greeting: villain am I
           none,
           Therefore farewell. I see thou
           knowest me not.

          
          Romeo turns, and to the amazement of all, walks back to his
          car. Tybalt, unable to shoot him in the back, is confused.
          He hurls himself into his sedan.

          
          Kicking it into a sand spraying U-turn, he careens the short
          distance to Romeo's car. Slamming into the back of it he
          blocks Romeo in.

          
          Tybalt leaps out, maniacally kicking at bumper, door and
          headlights. Romeo flicks the locks down. Tybalt shatters
          the side window and hauls Romeo through the door, slamming
          him against the savaged fuselage.

          

           TYBALT
           Boy, this shall not excuse the

           INJURIES
           That thou hast done me!

          
          He smashes Romeo across the face, Romeo crashes to the
          roadway.

          

           TYBALT

           (YELLING)
           Turn and draw.

          
          A cut has opened in the side of Romeo's mouth. He unsteadily
          lifts himself up, and meeting Tybalt's gaze, speaks through
          bloodied teeth.

          

           ROMEO
           I never injured thee,
           And so, good Capulet, which name I

           TENDER
           As dearly as mine own...

          
          Romeo cautiously extracts his gun...

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           ...be satisfied.

          
          ...and throws it at Tybalt's feet.

          
          Storm clouds obscure the sun as Romeo turns and walks from
          the parking lot.

          
          Mercutio, Benvolio and the others cannot believe their eyes.

          

           MERCUTIO
           O calm, dishonourable, vile
           submission!

          

          EXT. BEACH - VACANT LOT. DAY.


          
          Tybalt's anger must be answered. He ceremoniously disarms,
          gives his weapon to Abra, and sprints after Romeo who is now
          passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand
          hotel. A bone-cracking kick sends Romeo crumbling into the
          vacant lot. The boys swarm toward the fray.
          Romeo, still refusing the fight, scrambles up the stairs of
          the deserted hotel. Tybalt trips him and Romeo careens into
          an ornamental wooden railing, smashing it to pieces.

          
          Tybalt kicks savagely at the helpless Romeo.

          
          Suddenly, Mercutio appears running full tilt down the
          concrete terrace. He plucks up one of the splintered wooden
          palings and yells...

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Tybalt, you ratcatcher,

          
          ...as he bludgeons him across the face. Tybalt goes down.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Will you walk?

          
          Tybalt leaps to his feet grabbing a lump of wood.

          

           TYBALT
           What wouldst thou have with me?

          
          He swipes at Mercutio.

          

           MERCUTIO

           (AVOIDING)
           Good King of Cats, nothing but one
           of your nine lives.

          
          Mercutio jabs, Tybalt sidesteps.

          

           TYBALT
           I am for you.

          
          Tybalt aims a double-handed blow to Mercutio's head.
          Mercutio blocks, hooking Tybalt's stick away.

          
          Unarmed, Tybalt throws his full body weight upon Mercutio,
          slamming him against a window that shatters in a storm of
          glass.

          
          Lightning fast, Mercutio jackknifes to his feet. He raises
          his weapon to deliver a skull-crushing final blow to the
          trapped Tybalt. Romeo rushes between them.

          

           ROMEO
           Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio!

          
          Seizing the opportunity, Tybalt lunges at Romeo with a
          lethal triangle of broken glass. He misses, gouging instead
          a slash of flesh from Mercutio's stomach.
          A scream of excruciating pain as Mercutio grabs at his
          bloodied side. Everyone is still. In the abrupt silence,
          sirens are heard closing in the distance. Abra tugs at
          Tybalt.

          

           ABRA
           Away Tybalt!

          
          They bolt for their vehicle.

          
          Benvolio goes to Mercutio.

          

           BENVOLIO
           Art thou hurt?

          
          But Mercutio, covering his wound with his hand, laughs.

          

           MERCUTIO
           Ay, ay, a scratch.

          
          He turns to his assembled fans at the bottom of the stairs.
          With outrageous bravado he plays at being Caesar the
          conqueror.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           A scratch!

          
          The boys cheer their conquering hero. Romeo helps Mercutio
          down the stairs.

          

           ROMEO
           Courage, man. The hurt cannot be
           much.

          
          Mercutio holding his bleeding side, jokes through the pain.

          

           MERCUTIO
           'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow
           and you shall find me a grave man.

          
          He turns the next thought to the assembled audience.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           (through crazy laughter)
           A plague o' both your houses!

          
          Mercutio turns from the cheering boys to Romeo who is
          struggling to support his weight.

          
          Mercutio - through weak and desperate breathing.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           Why the devil came you between us?
           I was hurt under your arm.
          Romeo starts to register the panic in Mercutio's eyes.

          

           ROMEO
           I thought all for the best.

          
          Like an animal trying to break free from a mortal trap,
          Mercutio pushes Romeo away. He screams in horror, as if
          falling in the dark:

          

           MERCUTIO
           A plague o' both your houses!
           They have made worms' meat of me.

          
          Mercutio staggers down the stairs and collapses in the dirt.
          Romeo is there instantly, cradling his friend's head out of
          the dust. The dying boy stares back at Romeo, smiling
          through the chilling cold.

          

           MERCUTIO (CONT.)
           (a silent whisper)
           Your houses!

          
          Everything stands still, everything is quiet. The storm
          finally breaks.

          

          EXT. BEACH - RAIN. DAY.


          
          Tiny drops of water fall from the sky and bespeckle
          Mercutio's lifeless body. The droplets grow to a heavy rain.
          Romeo can hear the faint sound a thousand miles away of
          Benvolio whispering:

          

           BENVOLIO
           Mercutio is dead!

          
          Tears streak Romeo's face. He cries out.

          

           ROMEO
           Oh sweet Juliet,
           Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
           And in my temper softened valor's
           steel!

          
          The sound of Tybalt's vehicle starting brings back cold
          reality. Romeo's sorrow turns to uncontrollable rage.

          
          Shrugging aside Benvolio's attempts to restrain him, Romeo
          runs to his car.

          

          EXT. BEACH - PARKING LOT. DAY.


          
          Up ahead Tybalt's sedan screeches into a fishtailing U-turn
          and powers away.
          Romeo jumps into his vehicle. In an effort to head Tybalt
          off, he guns his damaged machine down a one way street.

          
          The rain is now blinding. Romeo stops for nothing;
          pedestrians flee, cars spin out of control.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH STREETS - FROM AIR. DAY.


          
          AERIAL SHOT: The two cars speed along parallel roads toward
          Plaza Jesu. Romeo is gaining.

          

          EXT. VERONA STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAY.


          
          CUT TO: Tybalt's car negotiating the immense roundabout at
          the foot of the statue of Jesus.

          

          EXT. CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAY.


          
          CUT TO: Romeo's car firing out of the one way street and
          slamming into Tybalt's car. Tybalt's car careens out of
          control up the stairs of the statue, clips the fountain,
          flips, and slides upside down onto the roadway.

          
          CUT TO: Tybalt scrambling from his upturned vehicle.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo running toward him.

          
          SUDDENLY Romeo is halted by Tybalt's drawn gun. Fearlessly
          marching toward it, he screams through tears.

          

           ROMEO
           Mercutio's soul
           Is but a little way above our heads,

          
          Romeo grabs the barrel of the gun; forcing it between his
          own eyes, he growls insanely at Tybalt.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Staying for thine to keep him
           company.

          
          Tybalt, unnerved, tries to back off.

          

           TYBALT
           Thou, wretched boy, shalt with him
           hence.

          
          Romeo, refusing to let go of the gun, forces Tybalt backward
          through the torrential rain.

          

           ROMEO
           (with frightening intensity)
           Either thou or I, or both, must go
           with him.

          
          Cars swerve, Romeo is relentless. He grips Tybalt's hand
          trying to force him to shoot.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Either thou or I, or both, must go
           with him.

          
          Panicked, Tybalt wrenches free and lurches onto the roadway.
          Blinded by the headlights of an oncoming car he thuds onto
          its hood as it skids to a halt. The impact catapults his
          gun high into the air.

          
          Romeo coldly follows its slow motion, spinning trajectory.

          
          Real time stretches as the gun dances high above his head.
          Police sirens, cars swerving, people screaming, and the
          yelling of panicked commands fade to a nothingness.

          
          Romeo stands calmly considering the gun in the air. A
          harrowing symphonic tone and the echo of Mercutio's voice
          can be heard.

          

           MERCUTIO (V/O)
           Why the devil came you between us?

          
          CUT TO: Patrol cars sliding to a halt.

          
          CUT TO: The spinning gun slowly falling to earth.

          
          CUT TO: Tybalt rising from the ground.

          
          CUT TO: Cops leaping from their cars.

          
          CUT TO: The gun landing in Romeo's hand. His eyes full of
          rage.

          
          CUT TO: Cops levelling their revolvers.

          

           COP
           (Romeo in his sights)
           Put up thy weapon.

          
          CUT TO: Real time - Romeo fires three deliberate shots.
          Tybalt's body convulses backwards against the car, hitting
          it with a thud, bloodying the shattered windscreen.

          
          The cop fires. A bullet grazes Romeo's arm - his gun drops
          as he screams.

          

           ROMEO
           O, I am fortune's fool!

          
          At that moment a roaring hurricane wind hits; blinding police.

          
          CLOSE ON: The scaffolding surrounding the Jesus statue.
          Part of it's canvas covering rips away. Scaffold rains down
          as the insanely flapping material tries to smash free from
          it's moorings.

          
          Through the mayhem, a rusty Ford driven by Balthasar, slides
          to a halt.

          
          Balthasar screams out at Romeo.

          

           BALTHASAR
           Romeo, away be gone! Stand not
           amazed!

          
          Romeo collapses into the front seat.

          
          The cops open fire as Balthasar speeds off into the storm.

          

          INT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. AFTERNOON.


          
          Romeo is bleeding from the bullet graze.

          

          EXT. CAUSEWAY. AFTERNOON.


          
          The gale-force winds throw waves across the causeway as the
          fugitives disappear into the black afternoon.

          
          CRANE UP: In the distance we see Montague and Capulet towers.
          Divided by the statue of Christ, they suffer the storm's rage.

          

          EXT. MONUMENT. AFTERNOON.


          
          Away, below the outstretched arms of Christ, lights from
          emergency vehicles pulse red through the downpour.

          
          THE CAMERA: Falls through heavy rain toward a woman crouched
          over the lifeless body of Tybalt.

          
          She cries:

          

           GLORIA
           Tybalt!

          
          Cops nervously eye Fulgencio Capulet and Ted Montague, who,
          both flanked by body guards, face each other across the
          crime scene. Medics stand by helplessly as Gloria clings to
          Tybalt's body. A handcuffed Benvolio looks on.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother's
           child!
           O, the blood is spilled of my dear
           kinsman.

          
          Police lines part as Captain Prince arrives.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Where are the vile beginners of
           this fray?

          
          Benvolio struggles forward.

          

           BENVOLIO
           O noble Prince I can discover all
           The unlucky manage of this fatal
           brawl.

          
          Gloria appeals hysterically:

          

           GLORIA
           Prince as thou art true,
           For blood of ours shed blood of
           Montague!

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

          

           BENVOLIO
           (pointing to Tybalt's corpse)
           There lies the man, slain by young
           Romeo,
           That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio.

          
          Gloria interjects savagely.

          

           GLORIA
           He speaks not true! Affection
           makes him false!

          

           BENVOLIO
           Romeo, that spoke him fair, could
           not take
           Truce with the unruly spleen of

           TYBALT
           Deaf to peace!

          

           GLORIA
           He is a kinsman to the Montague!
           I beg for justice which thou Prince
           must give.
           Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not
           live!

          
          Captain Prince turns to Gloria.

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.
           Who now the price of his dear blood
           doth owe?

          
          Ted Montague pleads:

          

           MONTAGUE
           Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio's
           friend; His fault concludes but
           what the law should end,
           The life of Tybalt.

          
          Captain Prince eyes Montague coldly.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           And for that offence
           Immediately we do exile him.

          
          Montague, body guards in tow, surges forward.

          

           MONTAGUE
           Noble Prince...?

          
          Prince silences him.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           I will be deaf to pleading and

           EXCUSES;
           Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase
           out abuses.
           Therefore use none.

          
          The Captain turns and addresses his assembled officers.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.)
           Let Romeo hence in haste,
           Else, when he is found that hour is
           his last.

          
          CLOSE ON: Captain Prince.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.)
           Bear hence this body and attend our
           will.
           Mercy but murders, pardoning those
           that kill.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. AFTERNOON.


          
          An acoustic guitar version of Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear
          Us Apart.' Juliet traces the path of a raindrop on the
          window pane as she speaks her thoughts to the storm.

          

           JULIET
           Come gentle night, coming loving
           black browed night,
           Give me my Romeo. And when I shall
           die,
           Take him and cut him out in little
           stars,
           And he will make the face of heaven
           so fine
           That all the world will be in love
           with night,
           And pay no worship to the garish
           sun.
           O, I have bought the mansion of a

           LOVE
           But not possessed it, and though I
           am sold,
           Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is
           this day
           As is the night before some festival
           To an impatient child that hath new

           ROBES
           And may not wear them.

          

          EXT. CAPULET'S MANSION - DRIVEWAY. AFTERNOON.


          
          Juliet's P.O.V.: The limousine pulls into the driveway.

          
          PULL OUT: Of the window and CRANE DOWN: Juliet runs from the
          room.

          

          EXT. CAPULET MANSION. AFTERNOON.


          
          Through the open doorway we see an excited Juliet meet the
          Nurse at the bottom of the stairs.

          
          The music surges.

          
          TRACK IN: The Nurse's words are lost in the storm.

          
          Juliet buckles.

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION. AFTERNOON.


          
          We are close enough now to hear Juliet's words.

          

           JULIET
           Oh God! Did Romeo's hand shed
           Tybalt's blood?

          

           NURSE
           It did, it did! Alas the day, it
           did!

          

           JULIET
           Oh serpent heart, hid with a
           flowering face.
           Was ever book containing such vile

           MATTER
           So fairly bound? O, that deceit
           should dwell
           In such a gorgeous palace!

          

           NURSE
           There's no trust, No faith, no
           honesty in men. All perjured,
           All forsworn, all naught, all
           dissemblers.
           Shame come to Romeo.

          

           JULIET
           Blistered be thy tongue
           For such a wish! He was not born
           to shame. Upon his brow shame is
           ashamed to sit.

          

           NURSE
           Will you speak well of him that
           killed your cousin?

          

           JULIET
           Shall I speak ill of him that is my
           husband?
           Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall
           smooth thy name
           When I, thy three-hours wife have
           mangled it?
           But whyfore, villain, didst thou
           kill my cousin?
           That villain cousin would have
           killed my husband.
           All this is comfort, wherefore weep
           I then?
           Some word there was worser than
           Tybalt's death:
           I would forget it fain - exiled.
           Tybalt is dead, and Romeo exiled.
           To speak that word is father,
           mother,
           Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet, all slain,
           All dead.

          
          Juliet sinks to the floor, overwhelmed by tears.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           Nurse, I'll to my wedding bed,
           And death, not Romeo, take my
           maidenhead.

          
          Nurse looks down at Juliet. She goes and comforts her.

          

           NURSE
           Hie to your chamber. I'll find

           ROMEO
           To comfort you. I know well where
           he is.
           Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at
           night.

          
          Juliet looks up through tears.

          

           JULIET
           O find him, give this ring to my
           true knight,
           And bid him come to take his last
           farewell.

          
          SLAM MACRO ZOOM: Into the ring. The screen fills with the
          words 'I love thee'.

          

          INT. PRESBYTERY BEDROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo lies on the bed shirtless and crying. His wound has
          been bandaged and Balthasar crouches frightened in the corner.

          
          The priest leads the Nurse into the room.

          
          Romeo looks up.

          

           ROMEO
           Nurse!

          
          She goes to him.

          

           NURSE
           Ah sir! Ah sir! Death's the end
           of all.

          

           ROMEO
           Speakest thou of Juliet?
           Where is she? And how doth she?
           And what says
           My concealed lady to our cancelled
           love?

          

           NURSE
           O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps
           and weeps,
           And then on Romeo cries, and then
           falls down again.

          
          Romeo is wailing inconsolably.

           ROMEO
           As if that name,
           Shot from the deadly level of a
           gun,
           Did murder her, as that name's
           cursed hand murdered her kinsman!

          
          Father Laurence shakes the hysterical boy.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           I thought thy disposition better
           tempered!
           Thy Juliet is alive, There art thou
           happy.
           The law that threatened death
           becomes thy friend
           And turns it to exile. There art
           thou happy.
           A pack of blessings light upon thy
           back.

          
          Romeo calms. The Nurse gives him the ring.

          

           NURSE
           Here sir, a ring my lady bid me
           give you.

          
          Romeo enfolds the ring in his hand.

          

           ROMEO
           How well my comfort is revived by
           this.

          
          The priest goes to his wardrobe, removes a clean white shirt
          and helps Romeo put it on.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Go, get thee to thy love, as was
           decreed.
           Ascend her chamber. Hence and
           comfort her.
           But look thou stay not till the
           Watch be set,
           For then thou canst not pass to
           Mantua where thou shalt live till
           we can find a time
           To blaze your marriage, reconcile
           your friends,
           Beg pardon of the Prince and call
           thee back,
           With twenty hundred thousand times
           more joy
           Than thou wentst forth in
           lamentation.

          
          Father Laurence ushers Romeo from the room.

          

          INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT.


          
          They hurry down the hallway.

          
          The priest opens the front door.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Go hence. Be gone by the break of

           DAY
           Sojourn in Mantua. Give me thy hand.

          
          Romeo embraces him.

          

           ROMEO
           Farewell.

          
          The priest and Balthasar watch as Romeo and the Nurse sprint
          for the car.

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.


          
          Sobs echo through the house.

          
          Dave Paris stands in the entrance hallway clutching a huge
          bunch of flowers.

          
          Fulgencio Capulet stands beside him, whisky glass in hand.

          
          CUT TO: Gloria on the upper landing. There is a strange
          faraway quality about her as she descends to Dave and Capulet.

          

           GLORIA
           She'll not come down tonight.

          
          Dave, an understanding smile.

          

           DAVE
           These times of woe afford no times
           to woo.

          
          Capulet guides Dave into the house.

          

           CAPULET
           Look you, she loved her kinsman
           Tybalt dearly.

          

           GLORIA

           (JOINING)
           And so did I.

          

           CAPULET
           (a cold glance at Gloria)
           Well, we were born to die.

          
          Capulet takes a large slug of whisky. Gloria leans close to
          Dave.

          

           GLORIA
           I'll know her mind early tomorrow.
           Tonight she's mewed up to her
           heaviness.

          
          As Gloria, Dave and Capulet exit down the hallway we CRANE
          UP: toward Juliet's bedroom door.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet's face. Tears stream onto the pillow.
          Without warning a hand lightly touches her cheek. Juliet's
          eyes dart up to discover Romeo standing above her.

          
          A still moment of disbelief. Leaning down, Roemo kisses
          away the tears that fall from her dark, wide eyes.

          
          Juliet's lips find Romeo's and they gently sink back onto
          the bed.

          

          INT. SITTING ROOM. NIGHT.


          
          Capulet sits in an armchair drinking. Dave and Gloria sit
          opposite as Capulet whips himself into a frenzy of drunken
          excitement.

          

           CAPULET
           We'll keep no great ado - a friend
           or two.
           For, hark you, Tybalt being slain
           so late,
           It may be thought we held him
           carelessly,
           Being our kinsman if we revel
           much -
           But soft what day is this?

          

           DAVE
           Monday my lord.

          

           CAPULET
           Well Wednesday is too soon - what
           say you to Thursday?

          
          Gloria looks up alarmed; Dave is stunned.

          

           DAVE
           My lord I...

          

           CAPULET
           (leaning close)
           I will make a desperate tender of
           my child's love.
           (a drunken good humour)
           I think she will be ruled in all
           respects by me;
           (exploding with
           hearty laughter)
           Nay, more, I doubt it not!

          
          CUT TO: Gloria, her face hardens.

          

           CAPULET
           (to Dave)
           But what say you to Thursday?

          
          Dave is trying to catch up.

          

           DAVE
           My lord I...

          
          CUT TO: Capulet he eyes Dave intently.

          

           DAVE (CONT.)
           I would that Thursday were tomorrow.

          
          Delighted, Capulet jumps to his feet.

          

           CAPULET
           A Thursday let it be then!

          
          Capulet holds out his glass in toast. Dave and Gloria rise.

          

           CAPULET
           Wife, go you to Juliet ere you go
           to bed.
           Tell her, a Thursday she shall be

           MARRIED
           To this noble sir!

          
          CLOSE ON: The glasses clink.

          

          EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAWN.


          
          A pink and gold dawn breaks over Capulet Mansion.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN.


          
          A tangle of young limbs.

          
          Romeo and Juliet blissfully asleep. The dawn light creeps
          into the room.

          

          EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAWN.


          
          Balthasar's car covertly pulls into a side road near the
          estate.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN.


          
          Romeo and Juliet still asleep.

          
          CRANE DOWN: Toward the sleeping innocence of the faces.

          
          HOLD: A shadow of fear passes across Romeo's features.

          
          With a cry of panic, he sits bolt upright.

          
          Wide awake, but disorientated, Romeo stares around the
          room - as Juliet stirs, he remembers where he is.

          
          Slipping quietly from the bed, Romeo begins to dress.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo. A pair of lips enter frame and find his
          neck. It is Juliet. She hugs herself to him.

          

           JULIET
           Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet
           near day.

          
          Romeo turns - softly he strokes her cheek.

          

           ROMEO
           I must be gone and live, or stay
           and die.

          
          Juliet kisses his finger-tips.

          

           JULIET
           Yond light is not daylight,

          
          And then his cheek...

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           I know it, I
           It is some meteor that the sun

           EXHALES
           To light thee on thy way to Mantua.
           Therefore stay yet. Thou needest
           not to be gone.

          
          Romeo, feverishly returning the kisses, throws himself on
          Juliet.

          

           ROMEO
           Let me be taken, let me be put to
           death.
           I have more care to stay than will
           to go.
           Come, death, and welcome! Juliet
           wills it so.

          
          Juliet is suddenly still. Romeo kisses her gently.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           How is't, my soul? Let's talk. It
           is not day.

          
          Juliet pulls Romeo to his feet.

          

           JULIET
           It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone,
           away!
           O, now be gone! More light and
           light it grows.

          
          Frantically she helps him into his clothes.

          

           ROMEO
           More light and light: more dark and
           dark our woes.

          
          There is an urgent knocking on the door. They freeze.

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Madam!

          

           JULIET
           Nurse!

          

           NURSE (O/S)
           Your lady mother is coming to your
           chamber.

          

           JULIET
           Then, window, let day in, and let
           life out.

          
          Desperately Juliet pulls Romeo out onto the balcony.

          

          EXT. BALCONY. DAWN.


          
          The storm, now past, has left a morning achingly pure.

          

           ROMEO
           Farewell, farewell. One kiss, and
           I'll descend.
          Romeo climbs down from the balcony and into the shadows.

          

           JULIET
           O, think'st thou we shall ever meet
           again?

          
          Romeo smiles up at her.

          

           ROMEO
           I doubt it not;

          
          Juliet's face darkens.

          

           JULIET
           O God, I have an ill-divining soul.
           Methinks I see thee, now thou art
           so low,
           As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

          
          Romeo scrambles back up to the balcony.

          

           ROMEO
           Trust me, love, all these woes
           shall serve
           For sweet discourses in our times
           to come.

          
          From Juliet's bedroom comes the brittle sound of Gloria
          Capulet's voice.

          

           GLORIA
           Ho daughter! Are you up?

          
          Juliet spins around. Gloria has parted the curtains and is
          staring directly at her daughter.

          

           GLORIA
           Well, well.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo sheltered just below the lip of the balcony.

          
          FOLLOW: His hand, as it slowly reaches up and touches
          Juliet's fingers hidden behind her back.

          
          Gloria returns to the room. Juliet steals a glance toward
          Romeo as he silently mouths:

          

           ROMEO
           Adieu, adieu!

          
          As Romeo's face disappears into the shadows Juliet whispers
          a little prayer to herself.

          

           JULIET
           O Fortune, Fortune! Be fickle,
           Fortune,
           Fo then I hope thou wilt not keep
           him long
           But send him back.

          

          INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAWN.


          
          Juliet is trying not to cry as she goes in to her mother.
          Gloria turns to her.

          

           GLORIA
           Thou hast a careful father, child:
           One who, to put thee from thy
           heaviness,
           Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
           That thou expects not nor I looked
           not for.

          
          Juliet plays along.

          

           JULIET
           Madam, in happy time. What day is
           that?

          
          Gloria takes a deep breath.

          

           GLORIA
           Marry, my child, early next Thursday

           MORN
           The gallant, young, and noble
           gentleman,
           Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
           Shall happily make thee there a
           joyful bride.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet. She can barely speak.

          

           JULIET
           Now by Saint Peter's Church, and
           Peter too,
           He shall not make me there a joyful
           bride!

          
          Fear passes across Gloria's face.

          

           GLORIA
           Here comes your father. Tell him
           so yourself.

          
          Capulet - whisky glass in hand - ebulliently bursts into the
          room.

          

           CAPULET
           How now, wife?
           Have you delivered to her our decree?

          

           GLORIA
           Ay, sir. But she will none, she
           gives you thanks.
           I would the fool were married to
           her grave!

          
          Capulet - a dangerous calm.

          

           CAPULET
           How? Will she none?
           Is she not proud? Doth she not
           count her blest,
           Unworthy as she is, that we have

           WROUGHT
           So worthy a gentleman to be her
           bride?

          

           JULIET
           Not proud you have, but thankful
           that you have.
           Proud can I never be of what I hate.

          
          PAUSE: Capulet considers his daughter, then -

          
          BAM! He hurls his glass against the wall, shattering it
          into a thousand pieces.

          

           CAPULET
           Thank me no thankings, nor proud me
           no prouds,
           But fettle your fine joints 'gainst
           Thursday next ...

          
          Capulet advances. Juliet, terrified, retreats into the
          hallway.

          

           JULIET
           Hear me with patience but to speak
           a word...

          

          INT. LANDING. DAY.


          
          The Nurse appears as Capulet picks his daughter up and
          shakes her like a rag doll.

          

           CAPULET
           Speak not, reply not, do not answer
           me!

          
          He throws her to the floor. His fist thuds as it slams into
          her face.

          

           GLORIA

           (SCREAMING)
           Fie, fie! What are you mad?

          
          Gloria tries to restrain Capulet. He back-hands her,
          sending her flying against the wall - bellowing insanely, he
          advances on his cowering daughter.

          

           CAPULET
           Hang thee, young baggage!
           Disobedient wretch.

          
          The Nurse throws herself between Capulet and Juliet.

          

           NURSE
           God in heaven bless her!
           You are to blame, my lord, to rate
           her so.

          
          Furious, Capulet shunts her aside.

          

           CAPULET
           Peace, you mumbling fool!

          
          Capulet yanks his daughter's face close to his.

          

           CAPULET (CONT.)
           I tell thee what - get thee to
           church a Thursday
           Or never after look me in the face.
           And you be mine, I'll give you to
           my friend.
           And you be not, hang, beg, starve,
           die in the streets,
           Trust to it. Bethink you. I'll
           not be forsworn.

          
          Capulet storms off down the hall.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet. She huddles, shaking at the top of the
          stairs.

          

           JULIET
           O sweet my mother, cast me not
           away!
           Delay this marriage for a month, a
           week.
           Or if you do not, make the bridal

           BED
           In that dim monument where Tybalt
           lies.

          
          A trickle of blood issues from Gloria's cut lip. She checks
          her appearance in the hall mirror.

          

           GLORIA
           Talk not to me, for I'll not speak
           a word.
           Do as thou wilt, for I have done
           with thee.

          
          Gloria leaves.

          

           JULIET
           O God! - O Nurse, how shall this be
           prevented?

          
          The Nurse doesn't reply.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           What sayest thou? Hast thou not a
           word of joy?
           Some comfort, Nurse.

          
          A heavy silence.

          
          The Nurse goes to Juliet.

          

           NURSE
           Faith, here it is.
           I think it best you married with
           this Paris.
           O, he's a lovely gentleman!
           I think you are happy in this
           second match,
           For it excels your first; or if it
           did not,
           Your first is dead - or 'twere as
           good he were
           As living here and you no use of him.

          
          Juliet is very still.

          

           JULIET
           Speakest thou from thy heart?

          

           NURSE
           And from my soul too. Else beshrew
           them both.

          

           JULIET
           Amen.

          

           NURSE

           (UNSURE)
           What?

          
          Juliet is matter of fact.

          

           JULIET
           Well, thou hast comforted me
           marvellous much.
           Go in; and tell my lady I am gone,
           Having displeased my father, to
           Friar Laurence,
           To make confession and to be
           absolved.

          
          The old woman nods. She strokes Juliet's hair.

          

           NURSE
           This is wisely done.

          
          Juliet does not look up.

          
          A disturbing choral chant:

          

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. CHURCH. DAY.


          
          Sunlight pierces stained glass - the chant a sinister
          underscoring. We hear Dave Paris' voice:

          

           DAVE (O/S)
           Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's
           death...

          
          CRANE DOWN: Father Laurence and Dave Paris stand at the
          front of the church.

          

           DAVE (CONT.)
           ...Now, sir, her father counts it

           DANGEROUS
           That she doth give her sorrow so
           much sway,
           And in his wisdom hastes our

           MARRIAGE
           To stop the inundation of her
           tears...

          
          Father Laurence turns. Juliet stands framed in the white
          glare of the doorway.

          
          Dave smiles.

          

           DAVE
           Happily met, my lady and my wife.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet's hand concealed beneath her coat - we can
          just see the handle of a gun.

          
          Juliet advances slowly, an icy calm:

          

           JULIET
           That may be, sir, when I may be a
           wife.

          

           DAVE
           That 'may be', must be, love, on
           Thursday next.

          
          Juliet stares past Dave.

          

           JULIET
           What must be, shall be.

          
          Father Laurence, a forced cheerfulness.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           That's a certain text.

          

           DAVE
           Come you to make confession?

          
          Juliet forces a smile.

          

           JULIET
           Are you at leisure, holy father,
           now?
           Or shall I come to you at evening
           mass?

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           My leisure serves me, pensive
           daughter, now.
           (to Dave)
           We must entreat the time alone.

          

           DAVE
           God shield I should disturb
           devotion! - Juliet, on Thursday
           early will I rouse ye;

          
          Dave bends.

          
          CLOSE ON: Juliet; she stares stonily ahead as Dave kisses
          her cheek.

          

           DAVE (CONT.)
           Till then, adieu, and keep this
           holy kiss.

          
          Dave leaves.

          
          TRACK WITH: Juliet; she runs for the sacristy.

          
          The priest follows.

          

          INT. SACRISTY. DAY.


          
          Juliet, shaking with sobs takes refuge in the shadows of the
          small room.

          
          The priest goes to her.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           O Juliet, I already know thy grief.

          
          Juliet pulls away.

          

           JULIET
           Tell me not, Father, that thou
           hearest of this,
           Unless thou tell me how I may
           prevent it.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           It strains me past the compass of
           my wits.

          

           JULIET

           (DESPERATELY)
           If in thy wisdom thou canst give no

           HELP
           Do thou but call my resolution
           wise,
           And with this I'll help it presently!

          
          She pulls the gun, pointing it towards herself.

          
          Horrified, Father Laurence moves to her.

          
          Juliet, panicked, levels the gun at him.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Hold daughter!

          

           JULIET
           (through tears)
           Be not so long to speak. I lone to
           die!

          
          Father Laurence holds out a soothing hand.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           I do spy a kind of hope,
           Which craves as desperate an

           EXECUTION
           As that is desperate which we would
           prevent.
           If, rather than marry Paris,
           Thou hast the strength of will to
           slay thyself,
           Then it is likely thou wilt

           UNDERTAKE
           A thing like death...

          
          We hear the distended chords of Fauré's Requiem.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           to chide away this shame...

          
          It continues throughout as;

          
          The entire screen fills with a glinting tear drop of blue
          liquid.

          
          Reflected in the fluid's convex surface, the face of Father
          Laurence.

          
          The face disappears as the tear drop falls and splashes into
          a clear water solution.

          
          Like a comet in slow motion, the drop stains the water a
          cobalt hue.

          

          INT. GREENHOUSE WORKROOM. DAY.


          
          PULL BACK: The blue liquid fills a tiny glass vial held by
          Father Laurence.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           No warmth, no breath shall testify
           thou livest.
           Each part, deprived of supple
           government,
           Shall stiff and stark and cold
           appear, like death.
           Now when the bridegroom in the

           MORNING
           Comes to rouse thee from thy bed,
           there art thou, dead.
           Thou shalt be borne to that same
           ancient vault
           Where all the kindred of the
           Capulets lie.
           In the meantime, against thou shalt
           awake,
           Shall Romeo by my letters know our
           drift,
           And hither shall he come.
           And that very
           Night shall Romeo bear thee hence
           to Mantua.

          
          The priest cautiously hands Juliet the vial.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Take thou this vial, being then in
           bed,
           And this distilling liquor drink
           thou off.
           I'll send my letters to thy lord
           with speed to Mantua.

          

          EXT. CHURCH. DAY.


          
          As Father Laurence speaks, the screen fills with an express
          envelope addressed "Romeo - Mantua." The envelope pulls away
          from the camera and falls into a canvas bag brimming with
          hundreds of like envelopes.

          
          TRACK: With the canvas bag. It continues its journey into
          the back of an express delivery van.

          
          Heavy double doors slam shut, filling the screen with the
          slogan 'Speed Express.'

          
          The van pulls away.

          EXT. MANTUA. DAY.


          
          A burning red sun is setting over an endless vista of ragged
          wasteland.

          
          CRANE DOWN: A weathered sign reads - Mantua: Behind it a
          vast colony of permanent trailer homes stretches into the
          distance.

          
          The rap, rap, rap of knocking echoes through the park...

          
          CUT TO: The source of the knocking. An express delivery
          man, envelope in hand, raps vigorously on the door of an
          unremarkable trailer.

          

          INT. TRAILER. DAY.


          
          TOPOGRAPHICAL SHOT: Romeo lies flat on a single bed in the
          crampled trailer.

          
          The rap, rap, rap is very loud now. We move toward Romeo
          and realise he cannot hear the knocking because he has
          Walkman headphones on.

          

          EXT. TRAILER. DAY.


          
          Unsuccessful, the delivery man is filling out a "WE CALLED"
          card. He pushes it under the door.

          

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION. NIGHT.


          
          The heraldic 'Wedding Chimes' by JS Bach. Juliet stands
          resplendent in a radiant bridal gown. The image floats
          ethereally in a towering slab of mirror.

          
          PULL OUT: From the mirror. The wedding dress is in fact
          being held in front of Juliet by two members of the house
          staff. Juliet is dressed in her night gown. The Nurse
          suggests various pairs of shoes.

          

           JULIET

           (DISINTERESTED)
           Ay, these attires are best.

          
          The fuss dispensed with, the staff leave.

          

           JULIET
           But, gentle Nurse,
           I pray thee leave me to myself
           tonight.

          

           NURSE
           Why Bride?

          
          Juliet navigates the Nurse toward the door.

          

           JULIET
           (almost in tears)
           To move the heavens to smile upon
           my state,
           Which, well thou knowest, is cross
           and full of sin.

          
          Juliet holds the Nurse in a pleading stare. She leaves.

          
          Alone now, Juliet hurries to her bedside drawer. She
          cautiously removes a rolled piece of cloth from which she
          produces the glass vial.

          

           JULIET

           (WHISPERS)
           What if this mixture do not work at
           all?
           Shall I be married then tomorrow
           morning?

          
          She cautiously begins to unscrew the tiny black lid.
          Suddenly, a knock at her door. Palming the vial, Juliet
          swings around to meet the arrival of her mother. Gloria
          probes her daughter's uneasiness.

          

           GLORIA
           What, are you busy, ho? Need you
           my help?

          

           JULIET
           (makes light of it)
           No, madam. We have culled such

           NECESSARIES
           As are behoveful for our state
           tomorrow.
           So please you, let me now be left
           alone,
           And let the Nurse this night sit up
           with you.

          
          Juliet begins to pull down the covers on her bed.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           For I am sure you have your hands
           full all
           In this so sudden business.

          
          Gloria, sensing Juliet's distress, moves cautiously toward
          her. Taking hold of the bed covers she helps her daughter
          into bed.

          

           GLORIA
           Good night.

          
          Juliet slides into bed. Gloria covers her with the blanket.

          

           GLORIA (CONT.)
           Get thee to bed, and rest, for thou
           hast need.

          
          A brief moment between mother and daughter. Gloria, unable
          to cross that final barrier, moves to the door; but she is
          stopped by the urgency in Juliet's voice.

          

           JULIET
           Farewell!

          
          Gloria turns to Juliet.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           God knows when we shall meet again.

          
          CLOSE ON: Gloria. A faint perplexity, and then with an
          almost warm smile she turns out the light and leaves.

          
          The room is in darkness but for patterns of moonlight
          through windows.

          
          TRACK: Toward Juliet. The sombre tones of Fauré's Requiem
          seep into our consciousness.

          

           JULIET
           I have a faint cold fear thrills
           through my veins
           That almost freezes up the heat of
           life.

          
          She brings the vial her mouth.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           Come, vial. Romeo, I drink to thee.

          
          Juliet drinks, a sudden violent convulsion, her face contorts
          in fear.

          

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          EXT. CAPULET ESTATE. DAY.


          
          The sky is filled with green and grey clouds. A gusty rain
          blows the flower arrangements across the lawn. Large white
          wedding marquees flap in the wind.

          
          Through blurring rain, we see ambulances and police vehicles,
          lights flashing. Father Laurence, accompanied by a dour
          looking man in black, alights from his car. We follow their
          P.O.V.: We hear snatches of radio calls.

          

           MEDIC ONE (OVER RADIO)
           Mortal drugs?

          

           MEDIC TWO (OVER RADIO)
           Of lethal quantity as 'twould
           render death.

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION - DINING ROOM. DAY.


          
          They enter the house and pass the vast dining room, bedecked
          with wedding decorations.

          
          Capulet sits at the large mahogany table. In the background
          Gloria stares vacantly.

          
          Moving swiftly toward a doorway, the music builds.

          

          INT. CAPULET MANSION - JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY.


          
          The door opens. On the bed Juliet's still body. Father
          Laurence closes the door. The priest kneels and hastily
          examines Juliet's pupils. He looks to the man in black who
          retrieves the glass vial from the floor and pockets it.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           (to the man in black)
           As the custom is,
           In all her best array bear her to
           church.

          
          When the man in black allows two other dark suited men into
          the room, it becomes clear he is the undertaker.

          

           UNDERTAKER
           She shall be borne to that same
           ancient vault
           Where all the kindred of the
           Capulets lie.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. DAY.


          
          A thousand voices proclaim the 'Song of Ascension.'

          
          PAN DOWN: From the vaulting glass ceiling of the Capulet
          mausoleum.

          
          On view, enshrined in literally thousands of lit candles, is
          Juliet's peaceful body.

          
          We move through lines of Capulet mourners. In the shadows
          of the front door a young man hides.

          
          CLOSE ON: The young man. We recognise the distressed face
          of Balthasar.

          
          PUSH IN: Balthasar rushes from the Mausoleum.

          

          EXT. MANTUA. DAY.


          
          We are high above Mantua. Beyond the trailer park stretches
          a long ribbon of black highway.

          
          As a Speed Express van turns off the highway and into the
          park, we hear Romeo's voice over:

          

           ROMEO (V/O)
           If I may trust the flattering truth
           of sleep
           My dreams presage some joyful news
           at hand...

          
          CRANE DOWN: The Express van pulls up at the front office.
          The driver alights and goes inside.

          

          INT. TRAILER. DAY.


          
          Romeo sits at the trailer's small kitchen table smoking and
          writing in his notebook. The "WE CALLED" card lies next to
          an overflowing ashtray.

          
          His voice over continues.

          

           ROMEO (V/O)
           And all this day an unaccustomed

           SPIRIT
           Lifts me above the ground with
           cheerful thoughts.
           I dreamt my lady came and found me

           DEAD
           And breathed such life with kisses
           in my lips
           That I revived and was an emperor.
           Ah me, how sweet is love itself

           POSSESSED
           When but love's shadows are so rich
           in joy.

          
          Stubbing out his cigarette, Romeo gazes through the trailer
          window to see Balthasar's speeding car turn off the highway
          and into the trailer park.

          

           ROMEO
           News from Verona!

          
          An excited Romeo rushes from the trailer.

          

          EXT. TRAILER PARK. DAY.


          
          CRANE HIGH: Romeo sprints across open ground to intercept
          Balthasar's car. We see, but Romeo cannot, the Express van
          approaching from the office. The car slews to a halt and
          Balthasar jumps out.

          
          Romeo yells joyously.

          

           ROMEO
           How now, Balthasar?

          
          Bathlasar cannot speak.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Dost thou not bring me letters from
           the Priest?
           How doth my lady? Is my father
           well?
           How doth my lady Juliet? That I
           ask again,
           For nothing can be ill if she be
           well.

          
          Balthasar does not know how to say what he has come to tell.
          He looks away.

          

           BALTHASAR
           Then she is well and nothing can be
           ill.
           Her body sleeps in Capels' monument,
           And her immortal part with angels
           lives.
           I saw her laid low in her kindred's
           vault.

          
          For a long moment Romeo is profoundly still. When he
          speaks, it is with a chilling calm.

          

           ROMEO
           Is it e'en so?

          
          Balthasar nods.

          
          Romeo turns and stares into the distant wasteland.

          
          CLOSE ON: He speaks with bitter determination.

          

           ROMEO
           Then I defy you stars.

          
          Romeo moves to the car.

          

           ROMEO
           I will hence tonight.

          
          Balthasar tries to restrain him.

          

           BALTHASAR
           Have patience...

          
          Exploding with fury, Romeo throws Balthasar against the
          vehicle.

          

           ROMEO
           Leave me!

          
          CUT TO: The Speed Express messenger. Returning to his
          truck, the priest's undelivered envelope in his hand, the
          messenger looks toward the two boys.

          
          CUT TO: The boys. Balthasar pleads with Romeo.

          

           BALTHASAR
           Your looks are pale and wild and do

           IMPORT
           Some misadventure.

          

           ROMEO
           (with cold serenity)
           Tush, thou art deceived.
           (a niggling thought)
           Hast thou no letters to me from the
           Priest?

          
          Balthasar shakes his head.

          
          Romeo smiles.

          

           ROMEO
           No matter - I will hence tonight.

          
          Romeo climbs into the passenger seat of the car. Balthasar
          reluctantly gets behind the wheel.

          
          As silent tears begin to flow, Romeo turns his face to the
          setting sun.

          
          PUSH IN: As he whispers:

          

           ROMEO
           Well Juliet, I will lie with thee
           tonight.

          
          Balthasar's car roars out of the park.

          
          CUT TO: The delivery man. He looks to the envelope in his
          hand, then gets back into his truck.

          

          EXT. HIGHWAY. NIGHT.


          
          Balthasar's car speeds along the night-time highway.

          
          CRANE UP: In the distance the glow of city lights.

          

          EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT.


          
          Balthasar's car pulls into an alley and stops outside a
          decrepity apartment block.

          INT. APARTMENT BLOCK. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: A bespectacled eye peers through the crack of a
          partly open doorway. Below the face, the barrel of a
          shotgun protrudes menacingly.

          
          CUT TO: Romeo in the dark, paint peeling hallway.

          

           ROMEO
           Let me have
           A dram of poison, such soon-
           speeding gear
           As will disperse itself through all
           the veins
           That the life-weary taker may fall
           dead.

          
          The eye considers, a voice rasps back.

          

           APOTHECARY
           Such mortal drugs I have, but
           Verona's law
           Is death to any he that utters them.

          
          Romeo speaks with fury.

          

           ROMEO
           The world is not thy friend, nor
           the world's law.
           Then be not poor, but break it and
           take this.

          
          Romeo shoves a wad of money at THE APOTHECARY'S face.

          
          BEAT. The rattle of a latch chain and the door swings open.

          
          Standing in the doorway is The Apothecary. Sixty something,
          he has a face scarred with age and abuse.

          

           APOTHECARY
           My poverty, but not my will consents.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo.

          

           ROMEO
           I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

          

          INT. PRESBYTERY. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Father Laurence. He speaks into the telephone
          with concern.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Who bore my letter then to Romeo?

          

          INT. SPEED EXPRESS DEPOT. NIGHT.


          
          A bored clerk is on the other end of the line. The priest's
          letter is on the counter beside him.

          

           CLERK
           I could not sent it - here it is
           again.

          

          INT. PRESBYTERY. NIGHT.


          
          Father Laurence is worried.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           By my brotherhood, unhappy fortune!
           The letter was of dear import.
           (PAUSE: the priest listens)
           Adieu.

          
          He hangs up the receiver and looks at the wall clock.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE (CONT.)
           Now must I to the monument alone.
           Within this hour will fair Juliet
           awake.

          
          DISSOLVE FROM: The clock to...

          

          INT. APOTHECARY'S APARTMENT. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: A cat skitters across a stained formica table.

          
          PULL BACK: The Apothecary's apartment is filled with cats.
          Dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room. Romeo stands
          nervously. The Apothecary extracts a small chemist's vial
          from inside a 'Statue of Our Lady' table lamp - he now
          speaks with cool professionalism.

          

           APOTHECARY
           Drink it off and if you had the
           strength of twenty men it would
           dispatch you straight.

          
          Romeo takes the vial and hands over the money.

          

           ROMEO
           There is my gold - worse poison to
           men's souls
           Than these poor compounds that thou
           mayst not sell.

          

          INT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. NIGHT.


          
          Motor running, Balthasar waits in the alley outside the
          apartment building. He checks the rear view mirror and
          freezes. At the end of the alleyway a police car crawls to
          a halt.

          

          EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo exits the building, and as he does so, the streetlight
          catches his face. The Cop's and Romeo's eyes meet.

          

          INT. POLICE CAR. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: The cop.

          

           COP
           This is that banished haughty
           Montague.

          

          INT. BALTHASAR'S CAR.


          
          Balthasar cracks; he guns the engine and the car lurches
          forward.

          

          EXT. ALLEYWAY. NIGHT.


          
          Tires screech as Romeo dives into the passenger seat of
          Balthasar's moving vehicle.

          
          Siren blaring, the police car gives chase.

          

          AERIAL SHOT. NIGHT.

          
          Balthasar's car winds through traffic - the patrol car
          gaining.

          

          EXT. ANOTHER PART OF TOWN. NIGHT.


          
          A police car U-turns over a median strip.

          

          EXT. BALTHASAR'S CAR. NIGHT.


          
          TIGHT ON: A rusted brown hood.

          
          The tortured engine screams as Balthasar negotiates the
          speeding car through city traffic.

          
          CRANE UP: Red and blue police light approach fast.

          

          INT. PRECINCT OFFICE. NIGHT.


          
          Captain Prince barrels through the corridors of police
          headquarters pulling on his flying jacket.

          

          EXT. STREET. NIGHT.


          
          TIGHT ON: A smoking tire as it lays rubber to the asphalt.

          
          Balthasar grits his teeth as he weaves the car through the
          impossibly tight space between a container truck and a bus.

          
          WHIP PAN: The patrol car is almost upon them when... in a
          seemingly suicidal manoeuvre Balthasar throws his car into a
          right-angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic.
          Horns blare.

          
          CUT TO: A skidding, squealing, out of control sedan, braking
          to avoid collision.

          
          Miraculously, Balthasar's vehicle shoots out of it its path
          and onto the other side of the roadway.

          
          The sedan slams into the following patrol car.

          

          EXT. DRIVEWAY. NIGHT.


          
          Balthasar's car speeds into the driveway of the Verona Beach
          Eternal Rest Cemetery.

          

          INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.


          
          Captain Prince scans the night time city below. He speaks
          to the pilot and the chopper banks sharply.

          

          EXT. CEMETERY. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: A stone angel etched against the night sky.

          
          PAN DOWN: Romeo pulls a crowbar from the trunk of the parked
          car. Police sirens sound in the distance.

          
          Romeo eyes Balthasar intently.

          

           ROMEO
           Upon thy life, whatever thou

           HEAREST
           Or seest, stand all aloof. Give me
           the light -

          
          Balthasar stands motionless - Romeo rips the torch from his
          hands and strides into the cemetery. Balthasar follows.

          

           BALTHASAR
           I do beseech you...

          
          Romeo turns, punching Balthasar hard; he goes down, blood
          spurting from his nose.

          

           ROMEO
           Do not interrupt me in my course or
           By heaven I will tear thee joint by

           JOINT
           And strew this hungry churchyard
           with thy limbs!

          
          Balthasar slowly rises. Both boys are trying hard not to cry.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           The time and my intents are savage
           wild,
           More fierce and more inexorable far
           Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

          

           BALTHASAR
           I will be gone and not trouble ye.

          
          Romeo smiles.

          

           ROMEO
           So shalt thou show me friendship.

          
          They embrace as Romeo whispers.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Live, and be prosperous; and
           farewell, good fellow.

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: A crowbar wrenches at ornate glass and iron doors.

          
          PULL BACK: The Gothic structure of the mausoleum rears
          against the night sky. Romeo frenziedly attacks the gates
          of the small side chapel.

          

           ROMEO
           Thou detestable maw, thou womb of
           death,
           Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to
           open.

          
          With a final heave the doors scrape open.

          
          Silence.

          
          ROMEO'S P.O.V.: An endless marble corridor lit by hundreds
          of tiny flickering eternal flames.

          
          CLOSE ON: Romeo. He murmurs:

           ROMEO
           In despite I'll cram thee with more
           food.

          
          Suddenly a hurricane wind and whirr of machinery: like a
          huge black insect, Captain Prince's chopper swoops down over
          the mausoleum.

          
          Romeo is caught in the glare of the chopper's burning arc
          light. Sirens scream, police units race through the cemetery.
          Blinded, Romeo fires wildly toward the chopper.

          
          The police cars screech to a halt.

          
          CLOSE ON: A police marksman in the chopper. His finger
          squeezes the rifle trigger.

          
          BANG! A bullet slams into Romeo's shoulder. The other cops
          open fire and Romeo is sent reeling backwards into the
          mausoleum in a fusillade of bullets.

          

          INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.


          
          An angry Captain Prince bellows into the radio.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Hold! Hold!

          
          The police hold their fire.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Bleeding from the shoulder wound, Romeo drags shut the heavy
          double doors of the chapel. He bangs off three shots
          through a pane of broken glass and screams at the police.

          

           ROMEO
           Stand all aloof!

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Outside the chopper hovers. Police take up siege positions.
          Captain Prince's voice echoes through the bullhorn.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Romeo, come forth, come forth.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Romeo uses the crowbar to wedge the doors shut. He bangs
          off another shot as he yells out at the Police.

          

           ROMEO
           Tempt not a desperate man!

          
          Romeo waits. There is no response from the cops.

          

          INT. CHOPPER. NIGHT.


          
          As the chopper settles to earth, Captain Prince speaks into
          the radio.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Bring forth these enemies Montague
           and Capulet.

          

          INT. PRIEST'S CAR. NIGHT.


          
          Orange rescue lights reflect through the windshield of the
          priest's car as it crawls past the crashed sedan and police
          vehicle.

          
          Father Laurence thumps the steering wheel in frustration.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Saint Francis be my speed tonight!

          
          Across the road Police swarm around the entrance to the
          cemetery.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Fear comes upon me.
           O, much I fear some ill unthrifty
           thing.

          
          HOLD ON: The green glow of the car clock as the seconds
          pulse away.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          TRACK: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames.

          
          DISCOVER: Romeo. He weakly stands at the entrance to the
          viewing chapel.

          
          The chapel is dark.

          
          As Romeo's eyes adjust he can just see, picked out by a
          shaft of blue moonlight, the glowing figure of a sleeping
          girl. He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead
          Capulets.

          
          Romeo is close now. He halts as if in the presence of an
          unbelievable vision. He lights a match and the room glows
          gold. The warm light reveals a Juliet even more beautiful
          in seeming death.

          
          Romeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround
          her.

          

           ROMEO
           O my love, my wife,
           Death, that hath sucked the honey
           of thy breath,
           Hath had no power yet upon thy
           beauty,
           Thou art not conquered. Beauty's
           ensign yet
           Is crimson in thy lips and in thy
           cheeks,
           And death's pale flag is not
           advanced there.

          
          Romeo kneels close, as if not wanting to wake a sleeping
          child. Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet
           so fair?
           Shall I believe that unsubstantial

           DEATH
           Is amorous and keeps thee here in

           DARK
           To be his paramour? For fear of

           THAT
           I still will stay with thee. Here,
           oh here
           Will I set up my everlasting rest
           And shake the yoke of inauspicious

           STARS
           From this world-wearied flesh.

          
          He lays himself close.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           Eyes, look your last.
           Arms, take your last embrace. And,
           lips, O you
           The doors of breath, seal with a
           righteous kiss...

          
          Gently Romeo kisses Juliet's lips. Ever so slightly,
          Juliet's hand moves - Romeo does not notice.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           A dateless bargain to engrossing
           death.

          
          Romeo drinks from the vial; the power of the compound is
          immediate. He convulses and falls, his head resting on
          Juliet.

          

           ROMEO (CONT.)
           (fighting for breath)
           O true apothecary, thy drugs are
           quick.

          
          Behind Romeo's head we can see Juliet's eyes opening. Romeo
          sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs. Through
          a blurry consciousness Juliet becomes aware of Romeo.

          

           JULIET
           Oh Romeo, what's here?

          
          Forcing herself up, she cradles his head in her arms.
          Romeo's clear wide eyes stare back, he is completely still
          but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across
          motionless lips.

          
          Juliet finds the vial clenched in Romeo's hand. Tears slip
          from her eyes.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           Drunk all, and left
           No friendly drop to help me after.
           I will kiss thy lips.
           Haply some poison yet doth hang on

           THEM
           To make me die with a restorative.

          
          She delicately kisses Romeo's lips.

          

           JULIET (CONT.)
           (a heart-broken whisper)
           Thy lips are warm.

          
          Desperately the lovers cling to each other. With all his
          desire to stay alive, Romeo whispers:

          

           ROMEO
           Thus with a kiss I die.

          
          There is no breath. He is still. Silence. Sobbing, Juliet
          hugs the lifeless Romeo to her.

          

           JULIET
           Romeo. O' my true love Romeo.

          
          She looks to the gun in his hand.

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          TRACK: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets taking
          cover behind a patrol car.

          
          Two police officers urgently convey Montague and his wife
          toward them.

          
          Discover Father Laurence arriving.

          
          CUT TO: Father Laurence's P.O.V.: Patrol cars, lights
          flashing, surround the mausoleum.

          
          He sees, through the open door of a police car, a hand-
          cuffed youth. It is Balthasar. Father Laurence hurries to
          him.

          
          It is dawning on Father Laurence.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Balthasar?

          

           BALTHASAR

           (DESPERATELY)
           I brought news of Juliet's death...
           And then in post came Romeo from

           MANTUA
           To this same place... to this same
           monument.

          
          CLOSE ON: Father Laurence.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           How long hath he been there?

          

           BALTHASAR
           Full half an hour.

          
          Father Laurence turns towards the mausoleum.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           Romeo.
           (a shock of realisation)
           The lady stirs...

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          TRACK SLOW TOWARD: Juliet: Sobbing uncontrollably she prises
          the gun from Romeo's hand.

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Father Laurence, desperate, breaks through the police line
          and runs toward the mausoleum.

          
          CUT TO: The parents and Captain Prince.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           Hold! Go not forth!

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Juliet turns the gun on herself.

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          CLOSE ON: Father Laurence, he screams as he mounts the
          mausoleum stairs.

          

           FATHER LAURENCE
           The lady stirs!

          
          CRACK! The sound of a single gun shot rips through the night.

          
          CUT TO: Captain Prince.

          
          CUT TO: The parents, a look of cold shock.

          
          CUT TO: The priest - his cry echoes through the night.

          

          INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          Juliet lies peacefully on Romeo's chest. Her eyes awake. A
          wash of deep red blood floods across them both. As we move
          away from the forms of the two young lovers lit by a ring of
          candles, the police burst in, guns ready to resolve what has
          already been resolved. Continuing up, we pass through the
          glass dome of the viewing chapel, and over the building.

          

          EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.


          
          There, huddled at the base of the Mausoleum steps, are the
          Montague and Capulet parents and Father Laurence.

          
          From high up we see Captain Prince emerge from the Mausoleum
          and speak to the group. A moment, then their cries float
          gently up.

          

          EXT. SKY. NIGHT.


          
          We are travelling high into the sky now. The cries of the
          parents and the buzz of radio calls fade to nothing.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT-FROM AIR. DAWN.


          
          As the sun struggled to rise, we push toward the figure of
          Jesus silently surveying the city.

          

          EXT. VERONA BEACH - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAWN.


          
          As Jesus' face fills the screen, droplets of water begin to
          streak his cheeks.

          
          HOLD: Music swells; the droplets grow to a torrent, and a
          heavy rain begins to fall.

          
          For a long beat, we stay with this image.

          
          CRANE DOWN: From the Jesus. A sea of black umbrellas
          stretches back from the steps of Freedom Tower.

          

          EXT. FREEDOM TOWER. DAY.


          
          At the top of the steps are a pair of flower strewn caskets.
          Before the caskets stand Fulgencia and Gloria Capulet, and
          Ted and Caroline Montague. They stare with blank,
          uncomprehending sorrow.

          
          Among the crowd we see the distraught faces of Benvolio,
          Balthasar, Father Laurence and the Nurse.

          
          The caskets are gently slid into a pair of long black cars.
          Montague and Capulet descend the stairs. Captain Prince
          blocks their path. He holds them in his gaze.

          

           CAPTAIN PRINCE
           See what a scourge is laid upon
           your hate,
           That heaven finds means to kill
           your joys with love;
           And I, for winking at your discords
           too,
           Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All
           are punished.

          
          The Prince steps aside. The procession moves off. Montague
          and Capulet look to one another, a moment, and then the two
          adversaries together follow the bodies of their dead children.

          
          AERIAL SHOT: The rain falls. Two black cars lead the people
          of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade.

          
          As the cars pass beneath the towering effigy of Jesus, the
          image pixilates into a television picture.

          
          PULL OUT: A TV anchor woman watches the image on a studio
          monitor.

          
          She turns:

          

           ANCHOR WOMAN
           (to camera)
           A glooming peace this morning with
           it brings:
           The sun for sorrow will not show
           his head.
           Go hence, to have more talk of
           these sad things.
           Some shall be pardoned, and some
           punished,
           For never was a story of more woe
           Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

          
          The anchor woman changes beat to the next story; but her
          dialogue fades, and her image gets smaller as the television
          recedes into a black distance.

          
          The music that reminds us most of these two lost lives
          swells. When the television is very small it is switched off.

          

          BLACK SCREEN. HOLD A BEAT.

  FADE IN

  EXT. AN IMPOSSIBLE EXPANSE OF MARYLAND FARMLAND - DAY

  The wind rustles the endless field of corn, blows over the
  freshly mown meadow of soybeans, and magically sways a copse of
  trees.

  It's a Fall after-noon. A SUDDEN POUNDING OF GALLOPING HOOVES
  breaks the peace and... A HORSE and RIDER burst between the rows
  of corn into the meadow.  They are running for their lives.

  CLOSE ON:

  The rider is a bride -- a beautiful woman dressed in a
  disheveled wedding gown, it's train tattered and flying like a
  knight's banner out behind her. This is MAGGIE CARPENTER.

  The horse is frothing and wild-eyed, like the bride, who turns
  to look behind her in terror.  The horse's labored breathing
  mingles with Maggie's panicked gasps.

  We see a WEDDING BOUQUET fly into a ditch as the horse thunders
  on.  Maggie clings to the reins.  She looks as though she is
  running from the devil himself.

          IKE (V.O.)
    Hey, Fisher, pick up.  I have some
    column ideas I want to bounce off you.
    Not there?  Okay.  Listen I'm thinking
    of writing about those mind-numbing
    informercials that are always on.

  Ike walks out of his apartment building talking on cell phone.

          IKE (cont'd)
    What do you think?  Good idea, right?
    Boring, down to death, pointless -- It
    sucks.

  Ike yells at a CONSTRUCTION WORKER.

          IKE (cont'd)
    If you guys are here any longer,
    they're gonna make you sign a lease.

          CONSTRUCTION WORKER
    Your column should be so funny.

  Ike turns and walks down the street, talking into cell phone.

          IKE
    Okay, I was also thinking I might write
    about...

  He spots a RICH LADY with tons of diamonds getting out of a
  Limousine, talking to a CHAUFFEUR.  He goes up to her.

          IKE (cont'd)
    Excuse me.  I was thinking of doing an
    article on limousines.  What would you
    say to people who never had a chance to
    drive in a limo?

  They walk up to her DOORMAN.

          LADY
    I'm sorry, I don't know any people like
    that.

  Ike walks off.  They stare at him as he goes.

  EXT. ANOTHER NEW YORK STREET - DAY

  Ike's talking on the phone to his friend's machine again.

          IKE
      (into phone)
    Fisher?  Come on -- I know you're
    sitting there laughing at me.  Pick up.
    I want to run an idea past you.

  Ike continues walking now in the full panic of writer's block.
  He pleads into his friend's answering machine as he walks.

          IKE (cont'd)
      (into phone)
    I just could use someone to toss it
    back and forth with for a few minutes,
    get the juice flowing, help me.  I have
    an hour and twenty-seven minutes and
    fifty-two seconds.  Hello?

  He walks away from the t-shirt table towards the bar.  The
  Vendor calls out to him.

          T-SHIRT VENDOR
    Hey, Ike, when are you going to put me
    in an article?

          IKE
    When your t-shirts stop shrinking.

  Ike enters the bar.  The Woman drops the shirt she was holding
  and walks off with her children.  The T-shirt Vendor goes back
  to selling his shirts.

  INT. NEW YORK BAR - LATE DAY

  Ike sits at the bar speaking to an attractive Woman nearby, a
  MAN puts is USA Today on the bar and addresses the BARTENDER.

              MAN
    I see photos of a lot of dead writers
    on these walls.  Got any living ones?
    I have a story to tell that could win
    one of them a Pulitzer.
      (then, with enthusiasm)
    Picture this, if you will.  A small
    town in Maryland, a sleepy little
    village, within that a hardware store...

  The Man continues speaking as Ike and the woman continue their
  conversation.

          WOMAN
    So what's in store for us in tomorrow's
    column?

          IKE
    I don't know yet.  I'm kind of a last-
    minute man.  Ideas don't flow until an
    hour or two before deadline.

  The Woman gets up and begins throwing darts.

          WOMAN
      (interrupting)
    This is very interesting.  You get your
    ideas for your column from life.  You
    start up a conversation with a woman in
    a bar, attack her choice of reading
    material, try and get a rise out of her
    while you contemplate whether or not
    she's worth hitting on.

          IKE
    No, I can't hit on you until I get an
    idea.

  She starts throwing darts.

          WOMAN
    That's flattering.

          IKE
    No, you don't understand.

  The Woman goes to her bar stool, gathering her bag and leaves a
  tip for the Bartender.

          WOMAN
    I think I do understand.  So my not
    responding to your baiting me will
    inspire one of those potential bitter
    diatribes you love to write about women
    and all the things we do to drive men
    crazy?

          IKE
      (taken aback)
    I don't write bitter diatribes about
    women... very often.

  She whacks him with a newspaper, then shakes his hand.

          WOMAN
    Only when the ideas aren't flowing,
    huh?  Well, it was very nice to meet
    you, one-minute man.

  The Woman leaves the bar.

          IKE
      (as she exits)
    That's last minute man.
      (then, louder)
    And it's the quality that counts.

          BARTENDER
    You know, for a good looking man, you
    strike out a lot.

          MAN
    I've seen much worse.

  The phone rings.  Te Bartender answers it as Ike sits back on
  his bar stool.  Ike grabs the woman's magazine that she left on
  the bar and starts glancing at it.  The Man at the bar has heard
  the whole thing.

          MAN (cont'd)
    I said, I've seen much worse.

  Ike looks at the Man with reservation.  The Man is George
  Swilling.

          IKE
    Excuse me?

          MAN
    The brush-off.

  Ike gets up and moves to the dart board.  He removes the darts.

          MAN (cont'd)
    I've witnessed far more treacherous and
    nefarious exits than that.  At least
    she castigated you in private.

          IKE
    Not as private as I thought.

  Ike turns slightly, giving the man his back.

          IKE (cont'd)
    Kevin, you've got some napkins?

          BARTENDER
    Writing or wiping?

          IKE
    Give me a pen.

  The Bartender gives him cocktail napkins and a pen.  Ike starts
  making notes.  Ike looks up from his writing.  The Man gets up
  and starts throwing darts.

          MAN
      (throwing darts hard)
    Ah, come on.  They deserve it.  They
    love you, they hate you, they're hot,
    they're cold, they're high, they're
    low...

          IKE
    ... They're up, they're down.  It's
    really fun making this list with you,
    but I've got a column to go write.

          BARTENDER
    Ike.

          MAN
      (undeterred)
    But you don't have a really superb idea!
    Well, there's a girl from my hometown
    you could write about.

  Ike moves to the Bartender and pays him.

          BARTENDER
      (to Man)
    Excuse me, we don't need any new ideas.

          MAN
    She likes to dump grooms right at the
    altar.  They call her "The Runaway
    Bride".

  Both Ike and Bartender turn and stare.

          MAN
    She performed the travesty seven or
    eight times.  Right at the altar she
    turns around and runs like hell.
    Bolts.

  Ike turns and heads for the door.  The Man calls after him,
  getting up from his stool without stopping his enthusiastic
  story.

          MAN (cont'd)
    Adios.  Plows down the aisle, knocking
    old ladies out of her way like the
    running of the bulls at Pamplona.  And
    guess what?

          IKE
    I give up.

          MAN
    She has the next victim all lined up.
    She's twirling another body on the
    spit.

  Ike stops in his tracks.  He turns back around in spite of
  himself.

          MAN
      (beginning his story)
    Imagine if you will, a small town in
    Maryland...

    "Today is a day of profound
    introspection, I have been accused
    of using this column to direct bitter
    diatribes at the opposite sex!  This
    uncomfortable accusation has plunged me

    serious reflection, from which I have
    emerged with the conclusion that, yes

    Holy moly.

  The older one, Mrs. Pressman, listens with a pained expression

  Neither one can believe what they're reading.

          PEGGY
      (reads)
    "What is unusual about Miss Carpenter
    is that she likes to dress her men up

    ... Or not!

  We follow MAGGIE down the back stairs inside The Hale Hardware
  Store, the prettiest, most welcoming shop of its kind anywhere
  in small town USA.  Somehow the place ha taken on the spirit of
  the owner's daughter; both stop and shop-girl radiate brightness,
  charm, and possibility.  Maggie comes down steps with a faucet
  handle and goes to an elderly customer, MR. PAXTON.

          MAGGIE
      (bright)
    Here we go!  One antique hot water
    handle with the "HOT" still on it,
    guaranteed to fit any American Standard
    cast iron tub with a four-inch center
    made between 1924 and 1938.  In other
    words, I think you're out of the
    doghouse with Mrs. Paxton.

          MR. PAXTON
      (amazed)
    Hallelujah.

          MAGGIE
    Alright, Mr. Paxton, I'll put it on
    your account.

  Maggie rounds the bend, another customer, EARL, stands by the
  paint machine.

    Maggie.

          MAGGIE
      (walking past customer)
    You don't need an air conditioner, Earl,
    you just need an attic fan -- There's
    more in the back.

  Maggie steps behind the front counter of the store and takes the
  account book out.  Her voice trails off as she sees the dour
  expression on the faces of her friends.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    What?

  Peggy nervously mentions the newspaper.

          PEGGY
      (delicate)
    So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?

          MAGGIE
      (serious)
    Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say
    it's the rudest and most offensive...
    joke anybody's ever played on me!

  To their amazement, Maggie starts smiling.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    You guys!  How long did this take you?

  Maggie stays amused.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    Where'd you get this done?
      (laughing)
    You creeps!  I should disinvite you!
    And why did you say seven times?  This
    is four.

          PEGGY
    Uh, Maggie, you told us to bachelorette
    jokes, so we didn't...

  Maggie looks at the stricken face of her friends.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
    Holy moly.

  Peggy looks like she is going to cry with sympathy for Maggie.
  Maggie is starting to feel uncomfortable.  She looks down,
  dubiously, at the paper.

          MAGGIE
    Um, you know, now would be a good
    moment to tell me this is fake.
      (no response)
    It won't be funny if you drag it out.
    Okay?
      (no response)
    Okay, well... I mean, I can find out...
    Real newspapers smear.  Phoney papers
    don't.

  She picks up the paper and brushes it against her apron, leaving
  an INK SMEAR!!

  She nearly kneels over.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
      (sitting)
    Bag.

  Peggy and Mrs. Pressman immediately spring to her side.  They
  give her a bag to breathe in.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
    Bag.

              CUT TO:

  INT. MAGGIE'S WORKOUT ROOM/GYM - NIGHT

  We see Maggie kickboxing in anger.  The radio is on.  She
  suddenly stops, yanks Ike's article off the wall, leaves her
  workout area and goes to her desk.

  ANGLE ON DESK AREA:

  She turns off the radio and begins to type her letter.

          MAGGIE (V.O.)
      "Dear Editor..."

  EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

  As Maggie's VOICE-OVER continues to read her letter, we take in
  a Manhattan busy day.  It is big, loud, and anonymous.

          MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)
    "Greeting from the sticks!  Perhaps you
    believe that a rural education is
    focused mainly on hog calling and
    tractor maintenance rather than reading.
    Why else would you print a piece of
    fiction about me and call it fact?"

  Te CAMERA FINDS Ike, striding across a busy street, dodging
  taxies.  A WOMAN smacks him with a newspaper.  He passes a WOMAN
  TRAFFIC OFFICER, then a hot dog stand.  He greets and passes a
  FALAFEL VENDOR.  THE CAMERA PANS to a USA Today Truck.

          MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)
    "I suppose Mr. Graham was too busy
    thinking us slanderous statements about
    how I dump men for kicks to bother with
    something silly like accuracy in
    reporting.  Which is understandable,
    because with a "man-eater" like me on
    the loose, who has time to check facts?"

  EXT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCKS - CONTINUOUS

  He passes regular GUYS who cheer him.

          MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)
    "Still, we cannibalistic queens can get
    pretty cranky when we see things in
    print that hurt our feelings, like that
    we deliberately abandon fiances with
    malice aforethought."

  INT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCKS - CONTINUOUS

  He enters the newspaper building, going to Ellie's office.

  INT. USA TODAY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

  He walks through the crowded city room.  His arrival attracts a
  lot of attention from his CO-WORKERS.  Ike seems a little
  surprised, but he's pleased.

          MAGGIE (V.O.; cont'd)
    "That's why I was surprised to find Mr.
    Graham's editor was a woman. Call me a
    sentimental fool, but I sort of hoped
    we man-eater could stick together."

  Ike works his way down the hall to the editor's office.  CHUFFA
  Ike greets various workers.  He steps up to the editor's
  secretary, ELAINE.  She doesn't smile.

          IKE
      (to Elaine)
    I'll put in a good word for you.

          ELAINE
    No, no, don't mention my name in there.

          IKE
    Why?

  A buzz.

          ELAINE
    You can go in now.

  Ike goes into Ellie's office.  Elaine picks up her phone.

              CUT TO:

  INT. ELLIE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

  ELLIE is that editor.  Stylish and successful looking, she's
  about Ike's age.  Ellie sits behind a big desk with a scowl on
  her pretty face.  Her casual-looking husband, Fisher, sits
  nonchalantly on the arm of the couch.  Ike enters as Ellie reads
  Maggie's letter.

          ELLIE
      (reading letter)
    "Anyway, I'm just dropping you big city
    folk this little note to say that I have
    thought of a ritual sacrifice that would
    satisfy my current appetite: Ike
    Graham's column on a platter.  Yours
    truly, Maggie Carpenter.  P.S. -- I
    have inclosed a list of the gross
    factual misrepresentations in your
    article.  There are fifteen."

  Ike sits as Ellie puts the letter down and takes off her glasses.

          IKE
      (chuckles as he sits)
    Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.

          ELLIE
    I left four messages.  You don't return
    my calls.

          IKE
    So?  I never returned your calls, even
    when we were married.  And what's
    Fisher doing here anyway?

  Fisher gets and places a photo of the cat on a bookshelf on his
  way to the other side of the room.

          FISHER
    Ellie asked me to come down to offer
    moral support.

          IKE
    Since when does Ellie need moral supp--

          ELLIE
    -- It's for you, Ike.

          IKE
    What?

          ELLIE
    Journalism lesson number one.  If you
    fabricate your facts, you get fired.

  Ellie pushes USA Today lawyer's letter across the desk for him
  to read.  Ike picks it up and skims the letter.  His face is as
  impassive as stone.

          IKE
    Lesson number two.  Never work for your
    former spouse.

          ELLIE
    That's not nothing to do with it.  You
    cooked this story up and you know it.

          IKE
    I didn't cook up a story.  I had a
    source.

          ELLIE
    Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze-
    hound in a bar?

          FISHER
    In vino veritas.

          IKE
    Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk
    guys in bars are good.  It means
    they're not driving.

  Ike gets up and stands near Ellie, making his point.

          IKE (cont'd)
    Besides, I'm a columnist.  This is what
    columnists are supposed to do.  This is
    what you like.  We push, we stretch, we
    go out on a limo.  That's what makes me
    good!

          ELLIE
    No, that's what makes you unemployed.

          IKE
    I merely write the stuff.  You're the
    one that serves it up.

  Ike puts down the letter and puts his glasses back into his
  pocket.

          ELLIE
    Not anymore.  I have to draw the line.
      (pushing a piece
       of paper)
    She sent us this list.  Our lawyers say
    it's actionable.

  Ellie hands Ike Maggie's list.

          IKE
      (scoffs)
    Lawyers.
      (glances at list)
    I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is
    going to be very tough on you.  It's
    going to be hard to get over.  There
    will be therapy bills for you.

          ELLIE
      (shrugs)
    I already made an appointment for later
    today.

          IKE
      (putting the list
       down, standing)
    See?  You want custody of my job? ...
    Why not just consider my wrist slapped
    and call me when you feel I've served
    my time?

          ELLIE
    I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.

  Fisher winces and looks away.  Ike and Ellie look at each other
  for a sober moment.

          ELLIE (V.O.; cont'd)
    If you go quietly, I'll get you
    severance pay.

  Ellie fidgets with her toy rake, then Ike heads for the door.
  He laughs a little at the painful truth of her words and walks
  out.  Ellie collapses back in her chair.  Fisher goes to her and
  rubs her shoulders.

  EXT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - DAY

  Ike rides sadly on the back of a forklift, gets off and walks
  out.

  EXT. HALE RESIDENTIAL STREET - ANOTHER MORNING

  ANGLE ON MAGGIE'S HOUSE:

  A train goes by.  A modest clapboard house with a porch.  Two
  entrances.  A PAPERBOY tosses a paper onto the lawn in front of
  the house.  The front door opens and Maggie appears fresh out of
  bed, wearing only a jacket and panties.  Heedless of being seen
  this way, she scampers out to the sidewalk to pick up her
  delivered paper:  USA Today.  She tears off the plastic bag and
  rips into it, looking for her letter.  She finds it.  A smile on
  her face, then she scampers back into the house.

  INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

  Maggie skips back into her house which she shares with Father
  and Grandma.  A cozy and eclectic place creatively furnished on
  a shoe-string.  She rushes into:  KITCHEN WHERE BOB KELLY,
  fiance #4, is packing cans into a backpack.  Bob, 38, has a
  pleasant face and a body that is almost shockingly buff.  He's
  wearing a T-shirt that reads: "Mountaineers Do It Against the
  Wall.", Maggie dances over, waving the paper and singing.

          MAGGIE
    She canned him, she canned him...

  Bob test the weight of the backpack adding dehydrate food.

          BOB
    Come here, Mag, and try this on.

  Maggie puts the paper on the kitchen counter and starts to read
  aloud, paying no mind to Bob, who is sticking her arms through
  the straps of the backpack.

          MAGGIE
    Listen: "Dear Ms. Carpenter, I
    apologize to you for this unfortunate
    matter.  Ike Graham's column will no
    longer be appearing in this paper.
    Best of luck in you upcoming marriage!"

  Bob continues to hold up the weight of the backpack as he straps
  it onto Maggie's shoulders.

          BOB
    That-a-girl!  You sacked him.
      (checking pack)
    This is the weight of the pack you're
    going to have to carry in the Himalayas.
    Tell me if it's too heavy.

  Bob lets go and Maggie FALLS BACKWARD, disappearing behind the
  counter, and hitting the floor, with a THUD.  Bob looks down at
  her.  Maggie's voice rises from the floor behind the counter.

          MAGGIE (o.s.)
    It's a little... It's a little heavy...
    Help me, baby.

  Bob has no answer.  He reaches a hand down.  He yelps as Maggie
  pulls him down on top of her, out of frame.  We HEAR them giggle
  and kiss.

  INT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - ANOTHER DAY

  Fisher uses the dock for a photo shoot featuring men and women
  in evening and formal wear from Escada for G.Q.  Fisher is not
  actually shooting the camera, but rather supervising it.
  Fisher claps his hands and calls the models to attention.  Then
  he goes onto the stage and sets the models in their positions.

          FISHER (cont'd)
    Remember, we are putting the "fun" back
    into formal.
      (to Ike)
    I just say that for the agency guys.  I
    don't even know what that means.  Now
    follow me.

  INT. USA TODAY OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY

  Elevator doors open.  Ike and Fisher exit and walk towards the
  coffee table.

          FISHER
    Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride
    piece, and since I do freelance stuff
    for G.Q., I'm in a different position
    now...

          IKE
    What are you trying to say to me, Fish?

  They stop walking.

          FISHER
    Vindication.  How would you like to get
    some?  A chance to prove that, though
    your facts weren't entirely straight,
    your theory was correct.

          IKE
      (hiding his hope)
    The real story on Miss Carpenter.

          FISHER
    All the gory details.

  They start walking again.

          IKE
      (excited)
    The anatomy of the black widow spider
    of Maryland.

          FISHER
    It wouldn't be a bad way to get you
    back into writing feature pieces
    again.

          IKE
      (enthusiastically)
    This is good.  It is a good story,
    Fish.

  They stop at the coffee table and grab something to eat.

          FISHER
      (nods)
    If she runs, then it's a cover story.
    All true.  All accurate.

          IKE
      (confesses)
    Okay, you were right.  I hated my
    column, but I can do this assignment.

          FISHER
    Then you've got it.  If you leave
    tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll
    have plenty of time before her next
    wedding trot.

          IKE
    "Paid vindication"  That's what I call
    justice.

          FISHER
    Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know.
    They like the idea, but my hands are
    tied with budget restraints.

          IKE
    But I'll get my normal fee, right?

  He walks away.

          IKE
    You want me to do it on spec?!

  He follows him.

              CUT TO:

  EXT. MARYLAND HIGHWAY - DAY

  We see Ike driving down the highway.  The car sputters a little
  as he and Fisher continue their conversation in voice-over. (If
  needed by the editor.)

          FISHER (V.O.)
    Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word.
    Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a
    play!  Plato never got a book advance...

          IKE (V.O.)
    Oh yeah!  I happen to know from
    reliable sources that Nietzche got
    expenses and a rental car.

  We hear Fisher laugh.

          IKE (V.O.; cont'd)
    I'm going to make this work, Fish.  I'm
    going to do it!

  Ike's car drives into Hale, passing a billboard reading,
  "Welcome to Hale."

              CUT TO:

  EXT. HALE STREET - DAY

  Ike drives down picturesque Main Street.  He passes Hale
  Hardware.  Sign says: "At Curl.  Be back soon."

  EXT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - DAY

  A BARBERSHOP QUARTET is singing in front of the only hotel in
  town.  Ike pulls up and goes inside.

  INT. LOBBY/ATLANTIC HOTEL - DAY

  Ike has checked into the Atlantic Hotel.  The clerk, LEE, hands
  him his key.  Ike asks about room service and the restaurant.
  An OLDER WOMAN asks him if he plays bridge as he goes up the
  stairs to his room.

  EXT. HALE MAIN STREET - DAY

  Ike exits his hotel as the Barber Shop Quartet finishes singing
  "Camptown Races."

  He now walks down the charming main artery of the town, looking
  exactly like what he is:  a cynical New York out of his element
  on sunny Main Street, USA.  KIDS ride by on bikes, streaming
  balloons behind them.  A balloon hits Ike on the face.  As he
  crosses the street, he mutters into his tape recorder:

          IKE
    I think I'm in Maryberry.

  Flags hang on all the storefronts and the place sparkles with
  wholesome attitudes as PEOPLE greet each other familiarly.  Ike
  comes to beauty parlor called "Curl Up and Dye".  The place is
  doing business and crowded with WOMEN.

  INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY

  Cindy, the manicurist, does Mrs. Pressman's nails.  Maggie sits
  on the floor next to Peggy's salon chair, fixing the base of a
  barber chair.  She tightens a screw and looks up, satisfied.
  Cindy's dog is on the floor near Maggie.

          MAGGIE
    Cindy, you better 86 Sprout.  He seems
    to be enjoying the petroleum
    distillates.

  Cindy rolls over in her chair, picks up her dog and rolls back
  to her station.

          CINDY
    That's it.  Back to obedience school.

          MAGGIE
      (to Peggy)
    Okay -- have a seat... gently,
    carefully.

  Peggy sits in the chair.  Maggie spins her around and around.

          PEGGY
      (delighted as
       she spins)
    You're a goddess!

          MAGGIE
    I didn't even need to change this
    gasket, just put in a little hydraulic
    fluid.

          PEGGY
    Stop it.  When you talk like that, I
    get turned on and it frightens me.

  JUST THEN.  Ike enters the salon, taking off his sunglasses.
  Peggy hops off the chair.

          IKE
    Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie
    Carpenter.  There was a sign at the
    hardware store across the street...

          PEGGY
    Are you a reporter?

  It's a little early in the game for Ike to be thrown off guard.

          IKE
      (shocked)
    What?

          PEGGY
      (eyeing his loafers)
    It's been our experience that anyone
    with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers
    ends up being another big city reporter
    wanting to interview Maggie.

          IKE
    About her upcoming wedding and all.

          PEGGY
    No, about her getting that asshole from
    New York fired.

  Ike smiles down at his loafers and shrugs.

          IKE
    I am just such a reporter.  And you are?

          PEGGY
    Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.

  Peggy steps aside.  Ike moves toward Cindy and Mrs. Pressman.

          IKE
    And who are these lovely ladies?

  Te ladies shake his hand and introduce themselves.

          CINDY
    Cindy.  Maggie's unmarried cousin.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
    Mrs. Pressman.  No relation.

          PEGGY
    And you are?

          IKE
      (turning toward her)
    Looking for Maggie.

          PEGGY
    Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.

  Maggie looks over from her sitting position on the floor.  She
  gives Ike the once-over, focusing on the shoes.

          MAGGIE
      (yelling to Peggy)
    Reporter?

          PEGGY
    Yup!

  Ike crouches to see Maggie on the floor just as she rises to her
  feet.  Ike straightens up.  For a moment, he is thrown by her
  beauty and intelligent eyes.

          MAGGIE
    I hope you have a different angle.
    It's pretty much all been covered.

          IKE
    Originality is my speciality.

          MAGGIE
    Excellent.

          PEGGY
    Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in
    here unless they're getting haircut.

          MAGGIE
    She's the boss.

          IKE
    Sorry, no.  I just got one.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
      (to Ike)
    Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact
    for you.

          IKE
      (steps to Mrs. Pressman)
    Yes, Mrs. Pressman.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
    It's her fourth time to the altar, you
    know.  Not seven like they said.

          IKE
    I know.  Tell me something.  Do you
    think she's going to make it all the
    way this time?

  During the Ike/Mrs. Pressman exchange, Maggie looks at Ike.
  There's something familiar about him.  She looks over at Peggy
  and beckons her to a copy of Ike's column affixed to a mirror.
  A goatee and horns, have been scrawled on Ike's byline picture.
  He's been "devilized".  Peggy coughs as she recognizes Ike in
  the newspaper clipping.

          MAGGIE
    She swallowed her gun.

  Mrs. Pressman continues her story to Ike.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
    I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the
    newsstand, he's our local bookie, you
    know, he's giving eight to one odds she
    won't.  He says she's so famous now,
    maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm
    going to wait to hear what the pros say.

          IKE
    Good fact.  Well, you let me know.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
    Oh, I will.

  ANGLE ON:

  Maggie indicates column to Peggy.  She looks over at the part of
  the shop used to wash and dye hair.  There's a sink, stool and a
  cabinet affixed to the wall above sink, which holds various
  shampoos and hair dyes.  Maggie gets an idea.  Maggie and Peggy
  step forward toward Ike.

          MAGGIE
    Well, instead of a haircut, how about
    a wash?  You know, get all that city
    grit out of it.

          IKE
    You'll answer my questions?

  Maggie nods affirmatively.

          IKE (cont'd)
      (removing his jacket)
    Fine.  You wash, I'll ask the
    questions.

          PEGGY
    Great.

  Ike hands Peggy his jacket.  A mystified Peggy leads Ike to the
  sink.  While she does this...

          MAGGIE
    Have a seat.  Peggy, why don't you give
    him the special treatment that
    strengthens the follicles.

  Ike sits in the chair near the sink.  Maggie shakes out a smock
  and puts it around Ike.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    So, what do you want to know?

  Ike leans and rests his head on the sink.  Peggy bends over him
  and wets his hair.  She grabs various hair coloring products.

          IKE
    Getting nervous?

          MAGGIE
    Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never
    been more certain in my life.  Except
    -- I am having all kinds of weird
    dreams.

  Ike pulls the cloth down from over his face.

          IKE
    Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me
    about them?

          MAGGIE
    Yes.

          PEGGY
      (calming)
    Let's just put this back here for the
    aromatherapy.

  Peggy recovers his face, then continues to fuss with the hair
  coloring products.  Maggie helps.

  INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - LATER

  Ike sits with a towel over his head as Peggy blow-dries the back
  of his head.  His back is to the mirror, his body faces Maggie.
  Cindy does her own nails as Mrs. Pressman scratches off lottery
  tickets.  The dog, Sprout, sits in is basket.

          MAGGIE
    In another one...

  PETE, wearing a hat, comes in the front door of the salon.

          PEGGY
    Hey, Pete, I'll be right with you.

  Ike peeks out from under his towel as Maggie continues.

          MAGGIE
    I'm inside the church.  Everyone I know
    is there, only they're not really them.
    They're like Frankenstein monsters, but
    without the bolts coming out of their
    necks.  It's all very "Night of the
    Living Dead".  And here's the creepiest
    part -- I look down at my dress and
    it's red.  I mean, I have no idea what
    it means.  Red's not my color!

  Ike listens intently and stares steadily into her eyes.  Peggy
  removes the towel.  His hair is divided into equal parts and
  dyed orange and red.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    So what do you think?

  Ike stares back at her, the tickle of suspicion creeping up his
  spine.

          IKE
    I think you'd look good in red.

          PEGGY
    No, she's talking about your hair.

  Maggie swivels his chair so that Ike faces the mirror.  Ike
  looks at his brightly colored hair.

          MAGGIE
    You're all ready for football season,
    Mr. Graham.

  Ike stares at his hair in total confusion.  With icy calm, Ike
  rises from his chair and primps the end of his hair as if giving
  it the finishing touches.  Then he sees his defaced newspaper
  clipping and all becomes clear.  He picks up the article and
  shows it to everyone.  Ike does a slow burn.

          IKE
    Yes, I think I nailed the personality
    profile of the women of Hale.

  Ike turns and puts the clipping up on the mirror.

          IKE (cont'd)
      (to Peggy)
    My jacket, please.

  Peggy hands him his jacket.

          IKE (cont'd)
      (sarcastically)
    Thank you.

  Ike moves toward the door.  He spots Pete.

          IKE (cont'd)
      (putting on jacket;
       to Pete)
    Excuse me, Pete, do you know a place
    that sells shampoo... Strong shampoo?

      PETE
    Doc's Pharmacy.  Third and Elm.  Tell
    him Pete sent you.  Want my hat?

          IKE
    No thanks.

  Ike smiles at Maggie and exits.

          MAGGIE
      (to Peggy)
    He seems crabby.

              CUT TO:

  EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

  In front of beauty salon, Maggie follows Ike out.

          MAGGIE
    If you're looking for Elm Street, it's
    that way.

  She puts on her sunglasses.

          IKE
    Thank you.

  He walks the other way.

          MAGGIE
    If you came down here in the pursuit of
    happiness, you might as well go back.
    Because you can't make me feel bad.

  She stops walking and turns to Ike.

          IKE
    I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm
    here for vindication.  In my heart...

          MAGGIE
    You have one?

  Ike walks back to Maggie.

          IKE
    I feel I'm right about you.  You got me
    fired, lady.  You destroyed my
    reputation and you screwed up my hair.
    You chew men up, spit them out and
    loved it.  And I'm down here to satisfy
    myself on that point.

  PASSERSBY stare at Ike's hair and giggle.

          MAGGIE
    Did something happen to make you care
    about reality?

          IKE
    Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm
    onto the truth.  You're going to do the
    same thing to "poor bastard number four"
    that you did to the last three.  You're
    going to run again.  And I'm not
    leaving until you do.

          MAGGIE
    You're going to be very disappointed.

          IKE
    We'll see.

          MAGGIE
    I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got
    to get back to work.  I still have my
    job.

  He stares at her for a beat, stung by her words.

          MAGGIE
    I have nothing to hide, Mr. Graham.
    Talk to whoever you want.  You might
    actually stumble upon a fact or two.

  Maggie walks away.  Ike walks a few steps and stops at a KID on
  a bike.

          IKE
    Hey, kid, I'll give you ten bucks for
    your hat.

  Kid agrees.  Ike puts the hat on and starts to cross the street.
  An OLD WOMAN walks by and hits him with a newspaper.  Ike is
  stunned.

  EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DUSK

  Maggie pulls into the driveway in her truck.  She's in a fine
  mood as she walks right in the house.

  INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DUSK

  Bob, Walter, and Maggie's GRANDMOTHER JULIA sit in the living
  room.  Grandma is sewing one of Maggie's wedding veils.  Walter
  drinks wine, Ike wears a hat.

          WALTER
    You know, when I only see one dog, I
    know I've had too much to drink.

  Te family dog, Skipper, sits near a ceramic dog table.  Maggie
  smiles as she walks in the front door and puts down her tool box
  and bag.

          MAGGIE
    You'll never guess who came crawling
    into town with his tail between his
    legs.

          IKE (o.s.)
    Who?

  Maggie enters the parlor to see Ike smiling evilly from his seat
  on the couch.

          IKE (cont'd)
      (innocently)
    Hello, Maggie.  I just came by to
    apologize to your family.
      (looks to Walter)
    When I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  I pushed a
    story.  I made a mistake.

          WALTER
    In other words -- he's only human.  An
    he brought us a bottle of wine.

  Raises the bottle to Maggie.

          IKE
    They made me put my hat back on.

          WALTER
    Oh, yeah.  Scared the hell out of
    Skipper.

          MAGGIE
    You've got to be kidding me.

  Maggie stares at them both.

          BOB
      (enjoying the moment)
    No, no, you should have seen Skipper.
      (then, imitates
       growling)
    It wasn't that funny.

  Maggie gives him a look that says, "You are not absolved."  She
  smiles stiffly, looking back at Ike.  She then sits on the arm
  of Bob's chair and puts her arm on his shoulder.

          MAGGIE
    So, the forces of good and evil have
    already met.

  Maggie takes the wine bottle from the table next to Walter.  She
  snaps a look to Bob, who follows her.

          BOB
    I'll help you take into the kitchen.

          GRANDMA JULIA
    Check on the crabs, Bob.

  We overhear them murmuring in annoyed tones about the wedding
  plans as they exit... Walter puts down his drink.

          IKE
    Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out
    there.  You don't think they'll call it
    off...?

          WALTER
    Well, wedding cake freezes.  This we
    know.

          IKE
    You know, your daughter seems...

  Ike notices that he's been sewn to the veil.

          GRANDMA JULIA
    Sorry.

          IKE
    That's okay, Grandma.

  Grandma cuts the thread and separates the veil from Ike's sleeve.

          IKE (cont'd)
      (continuing his thought)
    ... Like such a lovely girl.

  Walter points to a portrait painting on the wall.

          WALTER
    Like her mother.

          IKE
      (seeing the portrait)
    Ah, beautiful.
      (gets up to admire
       the portrait)
    I just can't see her leaving multiple
    grooms in the dust like that.

          GRANDMA JULIA
    Oh, yes, you can.  She's has 'em all on
    tape.

          IKE
    She has a tape?

          WALTER
      (good-natured)
    Yeah.  Lee at the hotel videos wedding.
    I mean Maggie didn't know she was going
    to make the hundred-yard dash.

  Walter gestures to a pile of video cassettes on the bookcase.
  Ike checks on the tapes.

          IKE
    Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee
    operation, Grandma's birthday...

          WALTER
    Gotta tell you this about my daughter.
    My daughter makes real good time, even
    in a long dress and heels.  Maggie may
    not be Hale's longest running joke, but
    she certainly is the fastest.

  Walter cracks up.

          GRANDMA JULIA
      (sarcastically)
    Ha ha.

  CLOSE ON:  A tape.  It reads: "Maggie I, II, III."  Ike's
  interest is more than piqued.  Ike picks it up.  They get up and
  go to the dining room.

              DISSOLVE TO:

  INT. DINNING ROOM/MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

  The family dog, Skipper, steals food from the table.  Walter
  scolds him.  Walter whacks his crab with his hammer and Ike
  copies him.

          WALTER (cont'd)
    Emma and I were only blessed with one
    child, not for lacking of trying.

          MAGGIE
    This is good, Dad, don't leave anything
    out.

  Ike's hammer flies out of his hand.  He goes to pick it up.

          WALTER
    So I've come to see it as a bonus,
    really, that we've been able to plan,
    and pay for, so many weddings.

          MAGGIE
    Not this one.  This one's on me.

  Walter reacts.

          IKE
    That's fair.

          MAGGIE
    Despite what you think, I don't do it
    on purpose.  And I have no intention of
    doing it again.

          BOB
    That's right, Maggie.  Just keep your
    eye on the ball.

  Ike raises his eyebrows in question.  Bob explains.

          BOB (cont'd)
    Sports psychology.  It was my major in
    college.

          IKE
    Ahh.

          BOB
      (false modesty)
    I'm the town's unofficial fitness
    trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and
    body combining for success.  You could
    say or you can quote me, I'm a glass
    half full king of guy.

          MAGGIE
      (boasting)
    Bob's the head of the P.E. department
    at the high school.  And he coaches the
    football team.  And he's climbed
    Everest.

  To Maggie's satisfaction, Ike shoots Bob a look of begrudging
  respect.  Nobody who's been up Everest is a total clown.

          IKE
      (impressed)
    Everest.  Is that right?

          MAGGIE
    Twice...

          IKE
    Really?

          MAGGIE
      (sticking it to Ike)
    Without oxygen...

          BOB
    My girl likes to brag about me.

  Bob and Maggie kiss Ike two little love-birds.

          BOB (cont'd)
    I'm taking her trekking on Annapurna on
    our honeymoon.

  Ike is highly amused.

          IKE
    How romantic.

          MAGGIE
      (sharply)
    We think so.

          IKE
    Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed
    with two Sherpas and a yak.

  Walter cracks up, Maggie shoots Ike a look.  He smiles back.

              CUT TO:

  INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM/INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM (NYC)

  INTERCUT TELEPHONE CONVERSATION

  Fisher and Ellie are exercising.  Fisher is on a cycle machine.
  Ellie does yoga stretches.  Ike sits back on the couch, puts on
  his glasses and watches a video taped wedding playing on the TV
  screen.  Superimposed titles read "Brian Norris wedding."

          IKE
      (to Fisher; into phone)
    You won't believe what I'm looking at,
    Fisher.  A videotape of all three train
    wrecks.

  THE TV - CLOSE

  Two flower girls and Peggy enter a crowded church where the
  groom, Brian, and his best man wait at the altar.

  Now we see Maggie come down the aisle, then walk past the altar.
  We see Maggie move away another aisle and out of the church.
  SHOCKED WEDDING GUESTS rise in horror, as she runs from this
  first wedding.  She drags the train boy up the second aisle as
  she leaves.  Ike hangs up.  He gets up to pick up the remote and
  then sits back down to watch.

  The tape fast-forwards to the next wedding.  Now Ike is looking
  at a much more relaxed, hipper, backyard wedding.  It says,
  "Gill Chavez Wedding".  He hits the fast-forward button
  (sometimes slowing down).

  ON TV:

  We see the Carpenter's backyard.  It is Gill and Maggie's
  wedding day.  The yard is crowded with a MIXTURE of Hells
  Angels-types, Deadheads and townspeople.  The "altar" is a band
  platform against the back fence.

  Gill is waiting on the platform with a rock combo playing
  Grateful Dead-type music.  He makes an introductory speech.

  Maggie steps out onto the back porch.  She's beautiful in a
  hippie-type wedding ensemble.  She walks with her father to a
  trampoline.  We can see her tattoo.  She jumps on the trampoline,
  then dives into the crowd.  They watch her and body surf her
  over their heads to the back fence.

  As she hits the stage, she looks at Peggy and Gill, then decides
  to go.  She jumps off the stage and runs up to a passing GUY on
  a dirt bike.  She jumps on and turns and waves as she rides
  away.  During the video, Ike scribbles: "Gill Chavez".  Maggie
  goes off on dirt bike.  The tape fast-forwards to the last of
  Maggie's fiascoes.

  ON IKE'STV

  He now sees the third wedding.  It's outdoors, in a tree lined
  area, MUSICIANS plays.  Ike laughs as he discovers that Maggie
  approaches the altar on horseback, in a simple white dress,
  wearing a crown of flowers.  The Maid Marian look.  Ike slows the
  tape.

  ON TV:  IT SAYS, "GEORGE SWILLING WEDDING".

  As Maggie rides down the aisle, suddenly the horse whinnies!

  Maggie has kicked it in the shins.  It rears and bolts,
  galloping off with the bride.  Ike FREEZE FRAMES the tape on an
  image of Maggie, hair blowing.  Although she is panic-stricken,
  her soul seems to shine through in tat single frame.  As Ike
  stares at her, the smirk fades from his face.  He just looks at
  her, allowing himself to see her expression, her eyes.  He can't
  help it.

  She gets to him.  Ike gets a restless look on his face.  He
  stares closely.  The groom is George from the bar.

          IKE
    Kamikaze!

              CUT TO:

  EXT. TE TROUT BAKERY - THE NEXT DAY

  Establishing.  High angle wide shot of a bakery in Hale.  Ike
  exits a neighboring shop and walks down the block.  He pauses in
  front of the bakery to take a look at Maggie's truck.  As he
  does, a middle-aged Black WOMAN walks by and whacks him with a
  newspaper.  Ike is stunned as she walks off.  He turns to a MAN
  sitting on a bench.

          IKE
    Did you see that?

              CUT TO:

  INT. THE TROUT BAKERY - CONTINUOUS

  CLOSE ON a group of plastic grooms and brides on a counter top.

  MRS. TROUT is behind the counter helping Maggie with a selection
  of grooms for her wedding cake.  The groom figures are spread out
  on the counter.  All sizes and colors, some attached to brides,
  some solo, some tuxes, some in dinner jackets.

          MRS. TROUT
    This one's very popular, but oh, you've
    used this one before... Brian.  But I
    like the white dinner jacket.

          MAGGIE
    No, he's no good.  Too blond.

          MRS. TROUT
      (picks up another)
    We'll go with total traditional.

          MAGGIE
    Too dark.

  Then, Ike comes up behind her as she discards another groom.

          IKE
    But he's got the Bobster's eyes.

  Maggie cringes at the sound of Ike's voice.

          IKE (cont'd)
    No -- the Bobster's eyes are closer set.

  She ignores him and continues her search.

          IKE (cont'd)
      (to Mrs. Trout)
    Could I have two coffees, please?  And
    what is that wonderful smell?
      (seeing the
       cinnamon rolls)
    I'll have two of those delicious
    looking cinnamon rolls.

          MRS. TROUT
    Sure.
      (picking up a
       miniature bride)
    Here, Maggie.  I think this makes the
    best you.

  Mrs. Trout steps away to get his order.  Ike moves to the other
  side of Maggie and picks up the bride and groom figure.

          IKE
    Let's see... Excuse me, isn't that cute?
    Ahh...

  He makes the bride figure repeatedly knock the groom figure in
  the head and run away screaming.

          IKE (cont'd)
    Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam!  Oh, help me!
    Help me!  Yup!  That's her all right.

  Mrs. Trout just about bursts a gut laughing.  Maggie takes the
  bride from Ike coldly.

          MRS. TROUT
    You must be that Mr. Graham fellow.

  Ike turns and goes to her.

          IKE
    Yes, I am.  And who are you?

          MRS. TROUT
    Betty Trout.  Five dollars.

          IKE
      (as he pays)
    Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to
    be making the wedding cake and they say
    you're throwing --

          MRS. TROUT
      (interrupting)
    -- The luau for Maggie.

  She starts picking lint off his sleeve and buttons his cuff.

          MAGGIE
      (all smiles for
       Mrs. Trout)
    Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I
    can't wait to show it to you.

          IKE
      (cynical delight)
    A pre-wedding luau?

          MRS. TROUT
    Yes.  My husband and I love luaus.
    It'll be fun.

  Mrs. Trout turns and grabs Ike's bag containing two coffees.

          IKE
    Fun?  Fun isn't the word.

  Mrs. Trout beams.  Maggie understands his answer a little better.
  Mrs. Trout hands Ike his items and he pays.

          MRS. TROUT
    If you're still in town, you should
    stop by.

          MAGGIE
    No, I'm sure he doesn't.

          IKE
      (to Mrs. Trout)
    Actually, I would love to come.
      (taps her service bell)
    Thank you.  Thank you so much.

  Maggie steps over, carrying her bride and groom figure choices.

          MAGGIE
      (exasperated)
    Is that what you're going to do now?
    Follow me around everywhere I go?

  Ike smiles at Maggie enigmatically as he picks up his order and
  heads for the door.

          IKE
    No.

  He starts to leave with his bag.  Mrs. Trout stops him.

          MRS. TROUT
      (handing him the
       other bag)
    Your two cinnamon rolls.

          IKE
    Bye, Betty.  Thanks.

  He leaves.

          MAGGIE
    He's not a nice person.

  Maggie hands Mrs. Trout her bride and broom figures.  Maggie
  looks at Mrs. Trout, suddenly nervous.  She dashes out.  Mrs.
  Trout imitates Ike bamming the bride and groom, laughing.

              CUT TO:

  EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

  Various High School SPORTS TEAMS practice.  Maggie strides across
  the football field, a scowl on her face.  A few HIGH SCHOOL
  FOOTBALL PLAYERS job past Maggie, doing laps.  A boy, KENDALL,
  calls out to her affectionately as she passes.  One of them,
  DENNIS, slows his pace to run alongside Maggie.

          DENNIS
      (playful)
    Maggie, don't marry Coach!  Marry me.
    I love you.

          MAGGIE
    You're jail bait, Dennis.  Go away.
    Run your laps.  Go. Go.

  Dennis runs on as Maggie continues toward her goal: Bob and Ike,
  standing together on the other side of the field.

  ANGLE ON BOB AND IKE

  They're both standing on the blocking sled.  Wave after wave of
  VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS ram into the sled and drive it across
  the field with both Ike and Bob on top of it.  Ike is munching on
  one of the cinnamon rolls as Bob pushes the KIDS.

          BOB
    Drive!  Drive!  From your hips, get low,
    get low, get low.  Next!

  Ike smiles broadly atop of the sled as he sees Maggie
  approaching, looking mighty peeved.  He nudges Bob and points to
  Maggie.  Bob lights up at the sight of her.

          BOB (cont'd)
    Good job, gentlemen... Special teams.

  The football players move away from the sled.  Bob moves to
  Maggie, leaves Ike alone.

          BOB (cont'd)
      (to Maggie)
    Hey, honey!

  Bob kisses and embraces Maggie.  She doesn't see Ike immediately,
  then:

          MAGGIE
      (indicating Ike)
    What is he up to now?

          BOB
    Ike just came by to check out the team.

          IKE
    And talk about you.

  Ike grins and shows Maggie the notes in his pocket.

          MAGGIE
    Bob -- are you making friends with this
    man?

          BOB
    I'm just bragging about how great you
    are.  I'm the luckiest man alive.

  Bob grabs Maggie around the waist and smooches her adoringly.
  Maggie scowls at Ike.  He nods, all charm.

          IKE
    Well -- I've got to get moving -- lot
    of work to do today!  I'll see you two
    love-birds later.

  Ike leaves.  Bob calls after him.

          BOB
    See you at the wedding.

          IKE
    You bet ya, Coach.

  Maggie is aghast.  She stares at Bob.  Ike joins in behind a line
  of peppy cheerleaders.

          MAGGIE
    At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob,
    don't you realize he's writing another
    article about me?

          BOB
    Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a
    good offense, right?  You're not going
    to let your opponent throw you off
    your game.

          MAGGIE
    You don't understand this guy.

          BOB
    Let him come to the wedding.  You're
    not running, right?  Say it. "I'm
    not..."

          MAGGIE
      (irritably)
    I'm not running.

          BOB
    So if you're not running and Ike Graham
    is there to see it, then any article he
    writes has got to have a happy ending,
    right?  All we're doing is turning
    lemon into lemonade.

          MAGGIE
    I've got news for you.  No amount of
    sugar and water is going to turn like
    Graham into something you want to take
    on a picnic.

  Bob gives Maggie a big hug.

          BOB
    Where's that homemade sunshine?

  Bob blows his whistle, then puts Maggie on the football sled.

          BOB (cont'd)
    I want you boys to take my princess on
    the ride of her life... Honey, tell 'em
    where you parked your car.

  Maggie screams as the boys push her down the football field.

  INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH/CHURCH - DAY

  Maggie kneels, hands folded reverently.  The booth's grate opens
  before her.

          MAGGIE
    Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
    My last confession was... ahh...

  She tries to recall.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    ... Anyway, I have sort of a technical
    question here.  I've been having -- bad
    thoughts.  I mean, really bad thoughts
    ...

          PRIEST
    Of an impure nature?

          MAGGIE
    No -- like -- I'm having a problem with
    that whole turn-the-other-cheek concept.
    I want revenge.  I want to destroy this
    guy's life, career, everything. On the
    sin scale, how big is that?  I mean,
    can I "Hail Mary" my way out of it?

          PRIEST
    Child, any sin in one's heart is...

          MAGGIE
      (impatient)
    The name's Maggie.  It wasn't this side
    of ten years ago that you had your
    tongue down my throat.  So don't call
    me "child", Brian.  It annoys me.

          PRIEST/    BRIAN
    Now don't get upset.

  Brian closes the confessional window and exits

          MAGGIE
      (still inside
       the booth)
    Brian, open up.  Don't ignore me.

  Brian leans into her confessional.  She steps out to join him.

          BRIAN
    You're not even Catholic, Maggie -- you
    really shouldn't come to confession.

  He's a nice looking and gentle man.  They regard each other for a
  beat.

          MAGGIE
    I'm sorry.  I'm just so stressed out
    about that slime-ball reporter being in
    town.  I jus had to come warn you he
    might show up here and start asking you
    all kinds of ridiculous questions.

  Brian moves away.  Maggie follows and sits in a nearby pew.

          BRIAN
    Actually, he only asked me one
    ridiculous question.  The rest weren't
    so bad.

          MAGGIE
      (sliding along
       the pew)
    What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell
    him we dated before you were a priest?

          BRIAN
    Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good,
    Maggie.

          MAGGIE
    What did he ask?

  A woman, MRS. MURPHY, rushes in.

          MRS. MURPHY
    Father, am I too late?

          BRIAN
    No, no.

          MRS. MURPHY
    It won't take long.  Jus two venials.

  The woman goes into the confessional booth to wait.

          BRIAN
    Only respectful things.  What did we
    have in common back then... What kind
    of music did you like... Did you ruin
    my life when you left me standing at
    the altar...

          MAGGIE
    And what did you say?

          BRIAN
    How could I be angry at you when
    clearly what has happened to me is as
    God intended?

          MAGGIE
      (relieved)
    Good one!  Thanks.

          BRIAN
    It happens to be how I feel.

  Brian sits next to Maggie.

          MAGGIE
    God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean,
    I'm...
      (sighs)
    Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a
    lunatic, but I know exactly where he's
    going next.

          BRIAN
    God bless you, Maggie.

  She turns to rush out, then stops herself.

          MAGGIE
    Oh, wait, my purse.

  She moves to the confessional, knocks, then speaks to Mrs. Murphy.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    Excuse me, sorry, forgot my purse.
    Good luck.

  Maggie closes the booth curtain and turns to Brian.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    Wait -- what was the ridiculous
    question he asked?

  Brian smiles mischievously.

          BRIAN
    He wanted to know how you used to like
    your eggs.

          MAGGIE
    Weird.  Like after all those years you
    would remem--

  She starts to go, then stops in her tracks as she hears:

          BRIAN
      (interrupting)
    -- Scrambled, with salt, pepper and
    dill.  Same as me.

  Maggie  looks at Brian.  Suddenly, she remembers too.

          MAGGIE
      (tenderly)
    I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.

          BRIAN
    I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to
    be.  But if you ever become a Catholic,
    may I ask you a favor, Maggie?

          MAGGIE
    Of course.

          BRIAN
    Could your confess to Father Patrick
    from now on?

          MAGGIE
    Of course.

  And she scampers out.  Brian goes back into the confessional.

  EXT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY

  Maggie drives up to an old brick firehouse that is now an auto
  garage.  The faded sign reads: "Gill's Garage".

  INT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY

  Maggie rushes inside and looks around.  No one is in sight.
  Several cars, including a yellow jeep-like car up on a hydraulic
  lift, are in the funky garage.

          MAGGIE
    Gill?  Lydia?  Gill?

  A CRASH, coming from the nearby back room, we hear loud muttering
  in Spanish, then out stumbles GILL CHAVEZ, 34, wearing a grease-
  stained Grateful Dead tie-dyed T-shirt.  He grins triumphantly,
  worshipfully cradling a CASSETTE TAPE in his hands.

          GILL
    Hey -- I found it!

  Maggie regards her former fiance with patient warmth.

          MAGGIE
    Found what?

  Gill looks up and gives Maggie a fond, hazy smile.

          GILL
    Mags!  Hey, look -- The tape from the
    Radio City Music Hall concert --
    Remember that night I as trying to get
    Jerry to let me sit in on "Ripple"?

  He pulls out the cassette from its case.  It's broken.  The tape
  is dangling from the cassette.

          GILL (cont'd)
      (disappointed)
    Oh, I'll play it for you.

  Gill picks up an electric GUITAR and starts to play.

          MAGGIE
      (shouts over the music)
    Listen, Gill -- There's this reporter
    who's ben making my life a living hell
    ... If he comes by here, don't talk to
    him.  And whatever yo do....
      (crosses to Gill)
    ... Don't show him that picture of me
    at the concert in San Francisco --

  Suddenly, a loud CHUCKLING emanates from the car overhead.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    What was that?

  Maggie stops Gill from playing.  She shoots her ex an angry glare
  and moves a lever on the shop wall.  With a HUM, the car descends.

          GILL
    We went to San Francisco twice.
    Remember one time we had a flat tire...
    Which picture?

  As the hydraulic lift slows, the car is lowered, revealing Ike
  sitting in the driver's seat.  He has been enjoying the
  photograph he's holding.

          IKE
      (feigning shock)
    Imagine!  Maggie Carpenter topless in a
    public arena.
      (checks photo again)
    And I see there was a chill in the air.

  Maggie swipes for the photo, but Ike is faster at pulling it away.

          MAGGIE
    Give me that!

          IKE
    But the most interesting thing here is
    that I don't see the rose tattoo that
    I've heard about on your back.

  Gill takes off his guitar and sets it down.

          GILL
    Ike bet me fifty bucks you don't still
    have it, Mags.  I said "You're on, man!
    Maggie loved that thing!"  And I could
    really use fifty bucks.

  Maggie is conspicuously silent.

          GILL (cont'd)
      (looking worried)
    Mags?

          MAGGIE
    I'm not gonna show you guys anything.
    I am a soon-to-be-married woman.  Now
    give me that photograph.

  Maggie seethes.

          IKE
    Sure, I would love to give this to you.
    Just give us one quick gander at that
    rose, and, I'll gladly hand it over.

  She tries to grab the photo again.  Ike pulls it away.

          MAGGIE
    Fine.  Here.

  Maggie quickly turns around and pulls down the back of her shirt,
  revealing the top of her back and a pristine expanse of skin.  No
  tattoo.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
      (turning back around)
    Satisfied?

          IKE
    Completely.

  Gill is still trying to grasp the meaning of this.

          GILL
    Maggie?  You got it removed?

          IKE
    Gill, I'll go ya double or nothing if
    was a stick-on.

          GILL
      (dismayed)
    Maggie?

          MAGGIE
      (admitting)
    I'm really, really afraid of needles...
    It doesn't make me a bad person.

  Ike laughs.  Maggie looks at him with rage.  Gill dramatically
  pulls down the front of his t-shirt.

          GILL
    Look.

  There it is on Gill's chest: the rose tattoo.  Maggie sighs,
  pained.  Gill shows it to Ike.  Ike looks at the tattoo.  He
  shakes his head at Maggie.

          IKE
      (sincerely)
    Look, look, man.  I think the man is
    heartbroken.

          MAGGIE
    He is not!

  Maggie moves the lever on the wall again, sending Ike back up to
  the ceiling in the car.  She grabs the photo from Ike and exits.

          GILL
    I think I am.

  Gill grabs his guitar and sits.

          GILL (cont'd)
    Hey, Ike, what would Jerry do?

  The hydraulic lift stops moving.  Ike leans out.

          IKE
    Jerry.  He'd play.  He'd play... Jerry
    would play his heart out.

  Ike sings and taps along in tempo on the side of the car as Gill
  sings and plays "Ripple".

              CUT TO:

  EXT. HOTEL PORCH - NEXT DAY, SATURDAY MORNING

  As Maggie drives into town with Peggy, they see Ike on porch with
  SHERIFF, POLICE CHIEF and MAIL    MAN, all playing instruments as
  a blues band.  Ike is not bad on slide guitar.  They all like
  Ike.

  Maggie "CHUFFAS" with Peggy and moves on.

  EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - LATER THAT DAY

  CLOSE ON:

  The slow, loopy pitch of a softball.  A bat connects.

  NEW ANGLE:

  A big wholesome man, CORY, runs for first base.  He just beats
  out the throw.  Bob, acting as umpire, yells, "Safe!"  Happy,
  Cory turns to the stands and waves.

  ANGLE ON:

  Maggie and Peggy, cheering loudly.  Peggy tries to whoop harder
  than Maggie, but that would be tough.  From firs base, Cory waves
  back to them.  The two women sit back down and Maggie takes back
  up with their conversation.  Maggie is still al steamed up.

          MAGGIE
    Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about
    my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn
    that tattoo stuff into a big deal --
    that I was never serious about Gill,
    blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.

          PEGGY
    For what reason?  Some personal
    satisfaction?

          MAGGIE
    That's what he says, but if he thinks
    that I don't realize he's writing
    another article, then he's an idiot.

          PEGGY
    It's probably because you got him fired.

          MAGGIE
      (sarcastic)
    Ya think?

          PEGGY
    Not that he doesn't deserve to get
    fired... Look!  Cory's going for
    second!... Sneaky!

  ANGLE ON:

  Cory as he runs for second base and with a slide beats the throw
  for the force out.  The women jump and cheer -- Maggie, again,
  the most boisterous.

  ANGLE ON:

  Dennis recognizes Ike as he walks up.  Dennis tells Ike that he
  is going to marry Maggie some day and shows Ike where Maggie is
  sitting.

  ANGLE ON:

  Maggie spots Ike as they sit back down.  She groans.

          MAGGIE
    There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.

          PEGGY
    Where?

          MAGGIE
    Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking
    to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn
    into one of those "sources say" things.

          PEGGY
    He looks better with that stuff out of
    his hair.  He's an attractive man.

  Ike finds Maggie in the crowd and leaves Dennis.

          MAGGIE
    I'd say you've been in the sun too long.
    You handle him, okay?  I could use five
    minutes off from that creep.

  Before Peggy can protest, Maggie climbs down off the bleachers
  and goes and stands near the dugout near the rest of Cory's team.

          PEGGY
    Okay, that's fine.  I can do that.

  Ike comes up to Peggy.

          IKE
    Hello, Peggy Phleming, "not the ice-skater".

  Ike indicates the seat next to Peggy.

          PEGGY
      (protesting weakly)
    That's Maggie's seat...

  Ike sits down comfortably.

          IKE
    ... And this is Maggie's beer.

  He starts drinking it.  ON THE FIELD, Cory is getting ready to
  steal third.

          IKE (cont'd)
    That your  husband out there?  Cory
    Phleming, a local radio announcer.

          PEGGY
    Have you listened to his morning show,
    "Wake up with ballplayer"?

          IKE
    Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I
    hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.

          PEGGY
    This game is pretty important to him.
    He made all-stars in high school, you
    know.

          IKE
    That must have made you proud.

  Peggy takes a small sip off her soda.

          PEGGY
    He was going with Maggie back then.
      (quickly)
    He was never one of her... I mean, they
    were never going to get... They just
    dated for a while.

  Cory dives in for third and makes it.  The crowd goes wild.
  Peggy yells and jumps in.

          PEGGY (cont'd)
    Good job, honey!

  But Maggie's whoop sails out above it all.  Cory waves.  But not
  at Peggy.  He directs his delight at Maggie, who jumps up and
  down by the dugout.

  Ike looks between Cory, Maggie and finally, Peggy.  Peggy jerks
  her waving hand back down to her side and sits down.  Ike
  pretends not to have noticed.  The two watch as Maggie and Cory
  smile at each other.

          IKE
    It's nice that they're still friends.

          PEGGY
      (looking at Maggie
       and Cory)
    Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago.
    See, she's not a man-hater at all.
    She's very supportive of men...

  Next BATTER hits one to deep left field and it lands in the grave
  yard.  Cory scores, greeted by Maggie.  Ike and Peggy watch as
  Cory and Maggie belly-bump and high-five each other in
  celebration of Cory's play.  No looks at Peggy.  Ike keeps an
  empathetic silence, seeing that Peggy is truly hurt.

          PEGGY (cont'd)
    I'll be back in a second.

  Suddenly, Peggy stands, pushes past him and runs down the steps.
  Maggie looks up just in time to catch Peggy's exit.  Ike pulls
  his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it.

  Maggie shoots Ike an accusing look, walks up to him in the
  bleachers and sits next to him.

          MAGGIE
    You've been here for three minutes.
    What did you do to her?

          IKE
    You can turn that finger around.

  Ike does an on-the-button imitation of Maggie jumping excitedly
  at Cory.  Now Maggie sees what he's getting at.

          MAGGIE
      (defensive)
    You misinterpret everything.  We've all
    been friends our whole lives.  But
    that's the types of relationship you
    wouldn't understand.

          IKE
    Obviously, I'm not the only one who
    doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie
    leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.

  Ike walks away.  Alone, Maggie tries to seem enthused.

          MAGGIE
    See, I cheer good.  What is he, a cheer
    critic?

  EXT./INT. STREET/BAR - LATER - DUSK

  Sitting in front of Inn Hale Bar, we see the BARTENDER
  pantomiming holding the reins of a wildly galloping horse.  We've
  seen something like this before.  Maggie's wild ride away from
  her last wedding.  Ike laughs with Bartender just as Maggie
  drives by the bar and sees this.

          MAGGIE
      (to herself)
    This guy never stops.

  INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - NIGHT

  Maggie walks up to the front desk of the hotel, where Lee is
  sleeping with his feet up.  She knocks his feet off the counter.

          MAGGIE
    Lee, hey, wake up.  Give me the key to
    the reporter's room.  I want to snoop
    around.

          LEE
      (handing her the key)
    Okay.  Second floor.

          MAGGIE
    Thanks.

          LEE
    Don't take anything big.

  Maggie moves up the stairs towards Ike's room.

  INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

  Maggie walks towards Ike's room, checks that no one sees her and
  enters.

  INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

  Maggie lets herself in the modest room and turns on the lights
  on.  She spots on audio cassette on the desk near the door.  She
  holds the cassette up to the light to read the hand-written
  label.  It says "Miles Davis" on it.  She pockets the tape.  She
  walks to the living room.

  MAGGIE'S POV:

  Ike has placed post-its on a framed picture, using the frame as a
  bulletin board.  Post-it notes lay out the information he has
  gathered under headings and subheadings.  Parents "Mother"
  deceased, subheaded by "Walter" and there is one for "Brian",
  "Gill", and "Bob".  Maggie smiles and shakes her head.  She rips
  one post-it down and reads it to herself.

          MAGGIE
      (reads)
    "How does she get all these guys to
    propose?  She's not that beautiful."
      (snorts)
    Bite me, paper boy.

  She begins ripping many of other post-it off the picture frame.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
      (as she takes post-its)
    Rude...

  She's ripping them down, fast and furious, then shoves them in
  her shoulder bag.

  INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL HALLWAY - CONTINUING

  Ike comes down hallway as Harvey puts his shoes out to be shined.

  BACK INSIDE THE ROOM

  Maggie, looking around, discovers the wedding video on the
  coffee table and grabs that, too.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    Thief!

  THE SOUND OF A KEY IN THE DOOR makes Maggie jump.  She flees to
  the bathroom, and shuts and locks the door.  Just as Ike enters,
  he sniffs and looks around the room, instantly knowing something
  is up.  He sees all his notes gone and a glimpse of Maggie as she
  closes the bathroom door.  Ike is steaming.  A BUMP sounds from
  the bathroom.  He goes over to the door and tries the handle.
  It's locked.  He starts to pound on the door.

          IKE
    All right, I know you're in there...
    You steal my research... You're messing
    with the first amendment now.  Open up.
    Open up.  You got no place to go.

  INT. IKE'S HOTEL BATHROOM - CONTINUING

  Ike's wrong.  Maggie is already trying to open the first
  bathroom window.  It's stuck.  She climbs over the bathtub,
  opens that window and starts to climb out.

          IKE
    I want to have a very serious discussion
    with you as to why you're such a pain in
    the ass.

  We HEAR Ike slamming his body against the bathroom door.

  As Ike breaks in, he runs to the window and yells after her.

  EXT. IKE'S HOTEL WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

          IKE (cont'd)
    That's breaking and entering.  I'll call
    the sheriff.

          MAGGIE
    You do that.  And remind him he's
    bringing the wine to the luau.  Thanks.

  She disappears around the ledge of the building and runs off.
  Ike's neighbor, Harvey, sits reading near his window.

              CUT TO:

  EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

  Establishing.

  INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

  CLOSE ON:  A CASSETTE PLAYER.  We see the familiar handwritten
  label: "Miles Davis."  "Kind of Blue" plays as Maggie listens in
  a chair, looking shell-shocked, surrounded by the post-its she
  stole from Ike's room.  We see as she reads them: "Father, two-
  fisted drinker," "Peggy, best friend, but Peggy doesn't totally
  trust Maggie," "Bob" -- doesn't love him.  Overwhelmed, she
  finishes reading the last note, leans back, puts her feet up on
  the table, deep in the mood of the melancholy music.

  The CAMERA MOVES on the last note on the floor next to her chair.
  It reads: "SHOWS NO REMORSE".

  FADE TO BLACK.

  FADE IN:

  EXT. MAIN STREET/BEAUTY PARLOR - NEXT DAY

  It's early morning.  Mrs. Pressman hands Peggy a cup of coffee
  to go.  Peggy walks to the beauty parlor, unlocks the front door
  and goes in.

  INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY

  Peggy enters and starts about her opening duties.  She turns on
  the lights and turns and sees her friend, Maggie.

          MAGGIE
    Do you think I flirt with Cory?

  Peggy stops in her track.  Maggie is sitting curled up in a salon
  chair.  She looks like she hasn't slept.

          PEGGY
    Good morning to you, too.  You look good.

          MAGGIE
    Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with
    Cory?

          PEGGY
    Yes.

  Maggie looks miserable.

          MAGGIE
    I don't mean it.

  Peggy moves to the salon mirror near Maggie with her cup of
  coffee.

          PEGGY
    I know.  I think sometimes you just
    sort of spaz-out with random excess
    flirtation energy and it just lands on
    anything male that moves.

          MAGGIE
    On anything male that moves?  As
    opposed to anything male that doesn't
    move?

  Peggy pours her coffee out of its Styrofoam cup into a ceramic mug.

          PEGGY
    Like certain kinds of coral.

  Peggy sits in the salon chair next to Maggie.

          MAGGIE
    I'm going to kill myself.

          PEGGY
    Why?

          MAGGIE
    Because you think I'm all like... "Hey
    man, check me out".

          PEGGY
      (friendly)
    No, I don't think you're like, "I'm
    charming and mysterious in a way that
    even I don't understand and something
    about me is crying out for protection
    from a big man like you".  Very hard
    to compete with.  Especially to us
    married women who have lost our mystery.

          MAGGIE
    But you haven't lost your mystery!
    You're very mysterious!

          PEGGY
    No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious
    are two different things.

          MAGGIE
    But I'm weird.

          PEGGY
    No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird
    are two different things.

          MAGGIE
    Peggy, there's distinct possibility
    that I might be profoundly and
    irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that,
    I love you and I can promise that I
    will no longer flirt with Cory, and I
    beg your forgiveness.

  Maggie looks ready to cry.

          PEGGY
    I'm not worried about you and Cory or
    Cory and me or even that you're
    irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie,
    you've been like this since we were
    kids.  And I think now that you are
    aware of it and that it hurts people's
    feelings, maybe it's time to move on
    with your life and commit to someone of
    your own, like Bob, if he's the one.

          MAGGIE
    I think you're right.
      (then)
    Is there anything I can do to make it
    up to you?

          PEGGY
    Something that brings warmth to my heart.
      (pause)
    Duckbill platypus.

          MAGGIE
    It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at
    three in the morning at a tick hunt.
    It's not anymore.

  Maggie makes her funny face.  Peggy doesn't laugh.

          PEGGY
    You're right.  It's not funny now.
    Maybe we both grew up.

          MAGGIE
    Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?

              CUT TO:

  EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT MORNING

  Maggie exits her house, gets on her bike and rides off towards
  town.

  INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING

  Ike is still in bed.  He slowly blinks awake, stretches, and is
  about to  throw off the covers when Maggie's voice breaks the
  silence.

          MAGGIE
    Freeze.  Hold on to those covers -- I
    didn't come here to see Ike Junior.

  Maggie smiles cheerfully at Ike from the foot of the bed.  He
  narrows his eyes at her.

          IKE
    I take it the desk clerk is one of your
    many admirers.

          MAGGIE
      (deadpan)
    How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.

  Ike notices Maggie is holding two coffees.

          IKE
    Coffee.  Now.

  Maggie hands it to him.

          MAGGIE
    You're welcome.  Your notes made
    interesting bedtime reading -- if you
    like trashy fiction.  Your observations
    are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete.
    You must be very proud.

          IKE
    I'm not a boastful man.  What's your
    point?

  Ike puts a shirt on as Maggie speaks.

          MAGGIE
    My point is that one again, you're
    getting it all wrong.  That won't
    improve your reputation any, and it's
    not very flattering to me either.  So,
    I'm going to give you a chance to write
    the truth.

          IKE
    Really.

  Maggie turns away from him as he dresses.

          MAGGIE
    I've decided to cooperate and let you
    interview me.
      (beat)
    For a thousand bucks.

  Ike clears his throat as he stands putting his pants on.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    I want a big wedding and a killer dress
    and for a grand I will answer all your
    questions and let you follow me around.

  Ike takes his coffee with him as he picks up his glasses, puts
  them on and crosses to the window.

          IKE
    My magazine doesn't pay because for
    stories.  It's not what you call ethical.

          MAGGIE
    Oh, but making up the facts as you go
    along is ethical?  Actually, I meant
    you.  You probably got severance or
    expenses or both.  I'll take your check.
    No credit cards.

          IKE
      (to Maggie)
    You've seen the post-its.  I've already
    got more juicy material than I need.
    Why should I pay you dollar one?

          MAGGIE
    Because I think you're writing on spec
    and with a first person interview, you
    might actually sell that thing.

  Ike knows she's right.

          IKE
    Too much.

          MAGGIE
    Seven-fifty.

          IKE
    Five hundred.

          MAGGIE
    Six-fifty.

          IKE
    Done.

  Scowling, he writes out the check and hands it to her.  Maggie
  looks at it and smile sweetly.

              CUT TO:

  EXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DAY

  Ike jogs alongside of Maggie on her bike.  Maggie parks her bike
  and they go inside her door to the house.

  INT. MAGGIE'S FOYER AND STAIRS - DAY

  Maggie leads Ike upstairs to her workroom.

          MAGGIE
    Pardon the mess.  I haven't cleaned
    since the fifth grade.

  INT. MAGGIE'S WORKROOM - LATER

  Insert on a cappuccino machine.  We PULL BACK and see Maggie and
  Ike standing at her work table.  An automatic cappuccino maker
  stands on the table.  Its base is made from a used paint mixing
  machine.  It looks very shiny and futuristic.  Maggie's logo
  "MAG" is on the side.  The machine shakes as it steams the
  cappuccino.  Ike notices another homemade machine on the table.

          IKE (cont'd)
    What's this over here?

          MAGGIE
    It's a birthday present for my cousin.
    Put your finger in.

          IKE
    Cindy the manicurist.

  He puts his finger in the wrong hole of the machine.

          MAGGIE
    No, the other one.

  He puts his finger in the correct hole.  She turns it on.  The
  brushes rotate.

          IKE
      (laughing)
    This is wonderful.  You reconfigure all
    these industrial parts and you do
    something amazing with it.

  He looks around and spots some gadgets and lamps on another table.
  He walks to them.

          IKE (cont'd)
    Amazing.  Found industrial stuff.
    Willow lamp... Rasta lamp...

  He picks up one of the many logos on the counter.  Each boasts a
  "MAG" logo.

          IKE (cont'd)
    Is this your preferred logo?

          MAGGIE
    I think so.

          IKE
    I like it.  This whole thing is pretty
    incredible.
      (studying a lamp)
    I think you could probably sell this
    lamp idea in New York.

          MAGGIE
    Maybe someday.

          IKE
    You afraid to try?

          MAGGIE
      (stares at him)
    No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe
    someday.

          IKE
    Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely
    incredible.
      (sitting)
    I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this
    isn't exactly a woman's room.

          MAGGIE
    What an incredible chauvinistic
    observation.

  INT. MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER THAT DAY

  Maggie's showing Ike engagement rings.

          MAGGIE
    That's Brian's.  He took me ut canoeing
    on the lake and gave me the ring in a
    velvet box.

  Ike snores.  Maggie hits him.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
      (defensive)
    It was classic.

  Maggie hands Ike another ring.  This one is in the shape of a
  Grateful Dead rose.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    Gill.  Of course.  He proposed at the
    tie-dye t-shirt stand at a Dead concert.
    It was very sweet until he hallucinated
    that the drum set was a blood-sucking
    space alien.

          IKE
    Always a mood killer.

          MAGGIE
    Still sweet.

  Maggie hands Ike a third ring.  It's in the shape of a butterfly
  and studded with multi-color gems.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    George.  He proposed at a butterfly
    farm in St. Thomas.  The ring was
    inside a cocoon.

          IKE
      (grimacing)
    It's a little "Silence of the Lambs"
    for me.  I can't believe you waited for
    the wedding to run.

          MAGGIE
    He's an entomologist!  I thought it was
    very unique.

  Now Maggie shows Ike the ring on her hand.  It's a gold "#1" with
  a diamond set into the number.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    And here we are at Bob.  He proposed
    during the seventh inning stretch...

  Ike touches her hand to examine the ring more closely.  Her
  surprise at his touch shows on her face as she finishes her
  sentence.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    ... At an Oriole's game.

  She takes her hand down.  Ike steps away.

          IKE
    Wait.  Don't tell me.  The scoreboard
    lit up with "Mary me, Maggie."

  Ike picks up his cup of cappuccino and moves behind the couch.

          MAGGIE
    It was one of the most wonderful
    moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even
    applauded.

          IKE
      (stopping)
    Highly suspect.

          MAGGIE
    What do you mean?  It was incredibly
    romantic!

          IKE
    Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got
    to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.

  Ike moves back to the couch.

          IKE (cont'd)
    I think the most anybody can honestly
    say is, "Look..."
      (sits on the arm
       of the couch)
    "I guarantee that we'll have tough
    times.  I guarantee that at some point
    one or both of us will want to get out
    of this thing.  But I also guarantee
    that if I don't ask you to be  mine,
    I'll regret it for the rest of my life.
    Because I know in my heart -- you're
    the only one for me"

  Maggie stares at Ike for a beat.  His words have taken a little
  bit of her breath away.  She covers.

          MAGGIE
    I like it.

  She moves from the fireplace to a chair and sits.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    I'd like it better on a scoreboard.
      (lightly)
    Is that how you proposed when you asked
    your wife to marry you?


  Ike is taken aback.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    Don't look so surprised, you've got
    divorce written all over you.

          IKE
    I'm a work in progress.

          MAGGIE
    So?  Is that what you said to her?

          IKE
    No.  I think I said something eloquent
    like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya
    know.  What do you think?"

          MAGGIE
    Now that's romantic.  A proposal like
    that and you didn't find eternal bliss?
    What went wrong?

  Ike takes a swallow of cappuccino.

          IKE
    I don't know.

          MAGGIE
    You don't know.

          IKE
    No.

          MAGGIE
    Maybe you should ask her some time.
    Ever thought of that?

  Ike is restless.  He stands up.

          IKE
    Call me crazy, but I believe that check
    I gave you entitles me to ask the
    questions for a while.

  Ike puts down his cup of coffee, gets his tape recorder and sits
  close to Maggie.

          MAGGIE
    Fair enough.
      (thinks a beat)
    Actually...

  Maggie move to TV.  She picks up Ike's stolen post-it notes and
  her wedding video on top of the TV, and goes to the front door.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    I'll just need one more day to make sure
    your check clears.

          IKE
    Ow!

              DISSOLVE TO:

  EXT. HALE STREET - THE NEXT DAY

  Ike and Maggie drive in Maggie's truck.  They pull up in front of
  a Bridal Shop.

  A spectacular dress fills the small window.  It's beautiful,
  romantic, sexy.  Maggie and Ike can be seen in the reflection.

          MAGGIE
    Even with everything that's happened
    I've still never been married and I
    still deserve a beautiful dress.

          IKE
    Agreed.

  Maggie gives Ike a smile that lights up the sky.  They go inside.

  INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY

  The place is fairly large and prosperous, probably the place to
  go in the Tri-County area.  A little FLOWER GIRL, 10, is being
  fitted on the pedestal in the middle of the room.  A saleswoman,
  POLLY, has taken the flower girl under her wing.  They are both
  under the expert eyes of a stern looking woman, MRS. WHITTENMEYER,
  the shop owner.  Also, the girl's MOTHER is there watching.

      POLLY
      (to the mother)
    She'll be the prettiest little flower
    girl in your daughter's wedding.

          MAGGIE
    Mr. Whittenmeyer.  Hi, Polly!

  The flower girl sees Maggie and runs and hides behind Polly.

          POLLY
    Hi, Maggie.  You'll have to excuse her,
    Maggie.  Some of the children are
    afraid of you since you dragged that
    little boy up the aisle.

          MAGGIE
    I didn't drag.
      (then to the girl)
    He tripped on his shoelaces.

  Mrs. Whittenmeyer comes forward to greet Maggie.

          MRS. WHITTENMEYER
    You've come for your dress.  Good!
    I'll get it from the back.

  Maggie leads her to the front window.

          MAGGIE
      (happily)
    Actually, I would like to get this dress.

  She points to the dress.  She smiles back to Mrs. Whittenmeyer,
  expecting her to share her joy.  Mrs. Whittenmeyer darkens.

          MRS. WHITTENMEYER
      (to Polly)
    Polly, take Leslie into change.
      (then, to Maggie)
    But the one you have on hold is lovely.

          MAGGIE
      (pleasantly)
    Yes.  But I've changed my mind.

          MRS. WHITTENMEYER
    It's one thousand dollars.

  Maggie is keenly aware of Ike listening in.

          MAGGIE
    I have one thousand dollars.

          MRS. WHITTENMEYER
      (firmly)
    The other one is only three hundred
    dollars.

  Maggie lowers her voice, hoping to lessen the humiliation of the
  moment.

          MAGGIE
    Is this dress for sale?

          MRS. WHITTENMEYER
    It just seems like an awful lot of
    money to spend on one of your dresses,
    Maggie... You only wear them for about
    ten minutes.

  Ike watches with regret as Maggie's child-like enthusiasm
  drains away, her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of
  the shop owner.  He's starting to see that it's no always easy
  being Maggie. There's a tremor in her voice.

          MAGGIE
    Yeah, that's a good point.
      (then, sitting)
    The other dress is nice.

  Ike calls out to Mrs. Whittenmeyer.

          IKE
    Mrs. Whittenmeyer.  May I talk to you
    for a second?

  She walks over to him.

          IKE (cont'd)
    I don't know much about this kind of
    thing.  I'm from out of town.  You're a
    salesperson, right?  You're here to
    sell wedding dresses.

          MRS. WHITTENMEYER
      (huffy)
    Yes.  I've been here for thirty years.

          IKE
    Perfect.  Because Miss Carpenter is
    here to buy one.  But not just any one.
    She wants that one.

          MRS. WHITTENMEYER
    It's a thousand dollars!

  Ike goes over and takes the mannequin out of the window.  Mrs.
  Whittenmeyer catches the wig as he puts the mannequin under his
  arm.

          IKE (cont'd)
    Look, Aunt Bea, we're buying this
    beautiful dress and anything else she
    wants or I'm coming back here with a
    squirt gun filled with India ink.

  Mrs. Whittenmeyer wilts under Ike's fierce gaze.  She turns to
  Maggie.

          MRS. WHITTENMEYER
    Will he really do that?

  Maggie gives her a look.

          MR. WHITTENMEYER (cont'd)
      (to Maggie)
    Well, why don't you pick out some
    accessories while I get this ready,
    dear.  Polly, will you come help me,
    please?

  Polly comes to help carry the mannequin away.

  ANGLE ON POLLY AND MRS. WHITTENMEYER:

          POLLY
      (whispering to Mrs. Whittenmeyer)
    It's a thousand dollars.

          MRS. WHITTENMEYER
    Shhhh!  The man has ink!

  Maggie looks gratefully at Ike.

          IKE
    Tough to spend money in this town.

  TIME CUT: A FEW MINUTES LATER:

  Ike sits as he hears Maggie's voice behind him.

          MAGGIE (o.s.)
    What do you think?

  Ike turns around.  Maggie is standing on the pedestal, wearing
  the dress and looking unbelievably gorgeous.  She is overwhelming
  to behold and Ike has to struggle to keep his face under control.

          IKE
      (stammering)
    You look... uh... You look fine.

          MAGGIE
    Fine.  The newspaper's upside down.
    That's better than fine.

          IKE
    Bob will be very happy.

  She glows.  Then the moment between them is broken as she
  suddenly remembers something and grabs the veil off her head.

          MAGGIE
    Bob!  I almost forgot!  I have to meet
    Bob!

  INT. DINER - DAY

  This is a great place -- a major hub of social life in Hale.  The
  food is greasy and good, Mrs. Pressman is the waitress, and the
  CROWD the essence of what is wonderful about a small town.  Bob,
  Maggie and Ike sit on the counter.  Mrs. Pressman CHUFFS about
  the luau, then moves around the corner.

          BOB
    Mrs. Pressman, I think we're ready to
    order.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
    We're out the special because
    somebody...
      (indicates COOK with head)
    ... didn't order enough sausage.

          BOB
    Let me have the garden omelette.  Egg
    whites only.

  Ike looks at Maggie.  He'd bet a thousand bucks on what she'd say
  next.

          MAGGIE
    I'll have the same.

          IKE
      (clears his throat)
    Of course.

          MAGGIE
    What was that?  I can't order  my eggs
    without sarcasm?

          BOB
    Neutral corners you two.  You're on the
    same team now.  Any more fighting and
    it's fifteen minutes in the penalty box.
      (gently, to Ike)
    Maggie's the nicest person you'll ever
    meet.  But she's always focusing out
    there.  She's got to start focusing
    more in here.
      (taps his chest)
    That's why she's had some -- whatever
    you want to call it -- problems in the
    past.
      (to Maggie)
    That's what we're working on -- focus.
    Right, Maggie?  Focus on Maggie.  Focus
    on Bob.

  As Bob has been talking, Ike has been watching Maggie's face.
  The joy seems to have drained out of her.

          MAGGIE
      (quietly)
    Right.

          BOB
      (to Ike)
    I lead Maggie through a visualization
    exercise.  All the sports shrinks use
    this head stuff.  Visualize the end
    zone, if you catch my drift.

  Bob takes out a notepad and hands it to Maggie.

          BOB (cont'd)
    Here's today's mantra: "It's an open
    field to Big Bob."

          IKE
    Tell me.  When you get to the altar,
    will you spike the bouquet?

          MAGGIE
    You know, there's no...

  Before Maggie can finish, Ike intercepts her.

          IKE
    Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is
    never done.
      (heading to the door)
    Mrs. Pressman, thank you.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
    Tootaloo.

  INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

          GRANDMA JULIA (V.O.)
    I'd like to explain about the weddings.
    There are reasons why they didn't come
    off.  Three weddings, no "I do's".  You
    can't believe how much cake we were
    left with.  I should weigh three
    hundred pounds.  I don't think her
    father minded spending so much money on
    booze that nobody drank.

  We hear Grandma as through the hotel doors, we see Maggie exit
  the diner.  She gets a bag from inside the cab of her truck and
  comes inside the hotel where she finds Ike talking to Grandma,
  who is having tea with her friend, NETTA.

          MAGGIE
    Ike... Hi, Grandma.

          IKE
    Gram here was going to give me the
    skinny on why you run from marital
    bliss.

          GRANDMA JULIA
    Right, cover your ears, Netta.  It's
    not that she's afraid of the wedding,
    she's afraid of the wedding night.
    Innocent girls are terrified of "the
    one-eyed snake".
      (getting into it)
    Why, when I was a virgin bride, I took
    a knitting needle with me into the bed...

  Ike winces.

          MAGGIE
    Actually, Grandma, I charmed the one-
    eyed snake awhile ago.

          GRANDMA JULIA
    Oh, yeah, I forgot.  I'll tell you one
    thing, your grandpa didn't forget that
    wedding night.
      (no Netta)
    You can take your hands off your ears,
    Netta.  Your tea's getting cold.

          MAGGIE
    Can you excuse us a minute?
      (then to Ike)
    May I have a word with you, please?

  Maggie moves toward door.

          IKE
    Bye, Netta... Bye, Grandam.

  He steps over to Maggie in the doorway.

          MAGGIE
    I found this and didn't know if it was
    something interesting.

  Maggie hands Ike a 30-year-old LP: Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue."

          IKE
      (excited)
    Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This
    is "King of Blue"!  This is the
    original recording.  Hard to find in
    good condition.  Where did you find
    this?

          MAGGIE
      (casual)
    It was in the attic.  It was jus
    sitting there gathering dust.

          IKE
    It's valuable.  Hang onto it.

          MAGGIE
    No.  You take it.

  She steps outside, leaving Ike with the record.

          IKE
    Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music
    I like and then finding me a rare album.
    You're not trying to soften me up, are
    you?

          MAGGIE
    No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I
    wouldn't attempt the impossible.

  She turns and walks back to the diner where Mrs. Pressman is
  outside watering plants.  Ike looks after Maggie and then back
  down at the record in his hand.  Somehow it makes him sad.

              CUT TO:

  INT. IKE'S CAR - LATER THAT DAY

  Ike drives through Hale gobbling french fries from the fast food
  bag in his lap.  Ike passes THE INN HALE BAR, same dump of a
  tavern he talked to bartender at.

  ANGLE ON: MAGGIE'S CAR parked a few cars down.  He pulls over
  and parks.  He gets out and speaks into his tape recorder.

  INT./EXT. THE INN HALE BAR -- DAY

  Ike approaches the window of the bar.  There's a DRUNK MAN and a
  DOG sitting outside.  Inside, we see two figures from the back,
  arms around each other.  One is definitely Maggie.  The other is
  definitely not Bob.

          MAGGIE
      (coaxing)
    C'mon.  Let's go.

  As Maggie helps the man get up,  we see that it's Walter, Maggie's
  father -- dead drunk.

          WALTER
      (belligerently)
    I haven't had any fun since you got
    your driver's license...

  They stumble and lurch, exiting the bar toward Maggie's car.

          MAGGIE
    I'm not exactly having fun, either...
    Steady.

          WALTER
      (to Dog)
    Good boy, Port Hole.

          MAGGIE
    His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.

          WALTER
    I changed it.
      (then to Drunk)
    See you later, Mr. Travis.
      (then to Maggie)
    That guy has a problem... Maggie, you
    can run everyone's life but your own.


  Maggie's having trouble keeping him steady as she opens the car
  door.  Ike is there in a flash to help her pull Walter into the
  car.

          WALTER (cont'd)
    Good daughters let their fathers pass
    out.

  Walter passes out on the front seat.

          MAGGIE
      (without difficulty)

    Ike... Please don't write anything
    about this --

          IKE
    No.  Forget about it.  Don't even think
    about it.

  Maggie looks at him with real gratitude.  She swings the car
  door shut.

          MAGGIE
    Watch your leg, Dad.
      (then to Ike)
    I'm so tired of this.

          IKE
    Why don't you let him sleep it off in
    the trunk. I'll take you for a ride.
    Then we'll come back for him.
      (to Drunk on bench)
    Keep an eye on him.

      DRUNK MAN
    I'm too loaded.

          IKE
    I was talking to the dog.
      (turning to Maggie)
    All right?

  Maggie thinks about this for a moment.  She takes a deep breath.

          MAGGIE
    Okay... I'll just grab my jacket.

              CUT TO:

  EXT. ROAD - LATE DUSK TO NIGHT

  Establishing of Ike's car driving.

  INT. IKE'S CAR - LATE DUSK TO NIGHT

  Maggie and Ike ride along.

          IKE
    My dad managed a business and two
    mistresses.  He wanted me to be a
    novelist.  More?

  Maggie nods,

          IKE (cont'd)
    My mother wanted me to become a
    musician.  0 for two.  But at least
    I'm a journalist and we all know
    journalism is literature in a hurry.

  EXT. IKE'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

  Ike and Maggie stare forward.  Both seem in melancholy moods.
  They're beginning to sense they're in trouble here.  Suddenly,
  the car falters and jerks.  It shows to a stop on the shoulder of
  the road.  The car backfires and smokes.

  EXT. IKE'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD -  NIGHT

  Ike and Maggie sit in the steaming car for a moment.

          MAGGIE
    Your filter's clogged.  This takes
    unleaded.

          IKE
    Can you fix it?

          MAGGIE
    First I have to find some tools.  I
    need a half and a nine-six-tenth.

          IKE
      (removing his glasses)
    Of what?

          MAGGIE
      (in amazement)
    Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.

  Maggie slams the food closed.

          IKE
    Kind of isolated.

          MAGGIE
    Yeah.  It's kind of nice.

  An uncomfortable silent pause.  Ike breaks the moment.

          IKE
    There's one thing we New Yorkers know
    how to do is hail a cab.  If there's no
    cab, we walk.

  Ike stares off down the road.  Maggie indicates a building in
  the distance, then turns off the car lights.

          MAGGIE
    I can get some tools over there.... and
    save the battery... There's one thing
    we country girls know how to do is cut
    across a field.  It's quicker.

  Maggie points diagonally across the field to where a gas station
  sign glows and the lights from the outer house twinkle.

  He smiles and follows her into the field.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    Be careful of snakes.

          IKE
    Snakes?  Are you serious?  I don't like
    snakes.  I've never even seen a snake.

  He steps carefully into the field, then hops gingerly toward Maggie.

  MOMENTS LATER

  Maggie leads Ike through a cornfield.

          MAGGIE
    Do you think there's only one right
    person for everybody?

  Ike chooses his words carefully.

          IKE
    No.  But I think attraction is too
    often mistaken for rightness.
    Attraction is very misleading.  And if
    it's mutual, it's well, terribly
    distracting.

          MAGGIE
    Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean
    anything.

  Ike nods as they come to a wooden fence.  She puts her hand on
  his shoulder.  Ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a
  boost over the top.  We see the flicker of misunderstanding cross
  Maggie's face at the initial contact.  Neither of them moves --
  forward or back, but the electricity is obvious.

  ANGLE ON:  Ike.  His conflicted feelings are apparent.  With
  difficulty, Maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove
  their hands.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
      (lightly)
    I suddenly forgot how to climb a fence.

  They look at each other for a moment, then:

          MAGGIE AND IKE
      (breaking the
       moment jokingly)
    "Tools".

  She climbs over the fence on her own and Ike follows.  They see
  an old guy, LIONEL, whittling on a porch.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    Lionel, can I borrow some tools?

          IKE
    Yeah, we need a half and nine-
    sixteenths.

          LIONEL
    Gonna bust out of another wedding?

          IKE
    You're sure well known around here.

  EXT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S BUILDING - THE NEXT DAY

  Establishing shot.

  INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S KITCHEN (NYC) - DAY

  INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

  INTERCUT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS:

  Ike sits on his bed, on the phone, working and eating his
  breakfast.  He's watching Maggie's wedding tape again.  Fisher
  is cooking an elaborate breakfast.  Ellie rushes around getting
  ready for work.  He is on the phone to Ike.

          FISHER
      (into phone)
    Yes, well, my theory was that she may
    be running because she gets attention...
    Negative attention is attention.
    Like when women whack you on the street
    because of your column, that's negative
    attention.

          IKE (V.O.)
    This is about her negative attention,
    not mine.  Did you get the
    reimbursement for the dress yet?

          FISHER
      (into phone)
    No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you
    think she's still gonna run?

          IKE (V.O.)
    I don't know.

  Ellie enters the kitchen, hears the question and shakes her head
  to herself.  If only these boys would give it up.

  INT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

  He is finding it very hard to gloat.  Fisher is annoying him.

          IKE
      (into phone)
    Look -- I'll be in there later today.
    I'll come by and tell you all about it.

          FISHER (V.O.)
    You're coming here?

          IKE
      (into phone)
    Yeah.

          FISHER (V.O.)
    Then come for dinner.

          IKE
      (into phone)
    Okay, we'll order out.

          FISHER (V.O.)
    Order out like a Philistine, when you
    got the Galloping Gourmet here?...

  Ike hangs up and watches more of the George Swilling wedding
  video.

  INT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY

  The bar from the opening scene.  GEORGE SWILLING, the same man
  Ike talked to before, is sitting on a stool, nursing his drink.
  He looks better.  Ike enters.  George looks up and recognizes
  Ike, who takes the bar stool next to him.

          IKE
    Get this man a Kamikaze.

          GEORGE
    Splendid dissection of Maggie Carpenter,
    very professional job.

  Ike sits and leans over to George.

          IKE
      (whispers)
    You could have told me you were fiance
    number three.

          GEORGE
    And end up in the papers?  I've been
    humiliated enough already to last a
    lifetime, thank you.  I'm sorry she got
    you canned.

          IKE
    Thanks.

          GEORGE
    She's a cacophony of contradictions.

          IKE
    Well, I'm writing another article on
    the cacophony.

          GEORGE
    Ah, can't stay away from her, can you?
    Like a moth to a flame.

          IKE
    Guess you'd know about that.  You're an
    entomologist, right?  How's business?

          GEORGE
      (taking a sip
       of his drink)
    Not bad.  I was traveling around
    studying the reproductive and migratory
    patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.

          IKE
      (sarcastic)
    Neuter a locust, feed the world.

      GORGE
    Not the world.  Just Africa and China.

  Ike wipes the smirk off his face.  Like Maggie's other men, this
  guy has a worthy accomplishment under his belt.

          GEORGE (cont'd)
    You know Maggie was the only girl I
    ever met who would hold my tarantula.
    On the first date.

          IKE (cont'd)
    So, tell me, George, why do you think
    she ran?

          GEORGE
    Same as you said.  What did you call
    her?  A "man-eater", "a devouring death
    goddess."

          IKE
    I don't think that's why she ran.

          GEORGE
    Why do YOU think she ran?

  Ike sips his drink before answering.

          IKE
    I don't know.  I'm working on it.  I
    was on the wrong track.

          GEORGE
    And you defending her?

          IKE
    No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a
    journalist.  I'm a truth teller.

          GEORGE
    Unbelievable, she got to you.

          IKE
    Oh, please!

      GORGE
    Join the club.
      (passing him
       his drink)
    Here, you need this more than me.

  George heads out.

          IKE
      (protecting, taking
       his tape recorder
       out of his pocket)
    I'm writing an article, I'm getting
    paid to do this, it's going to be a
    cover story, it's going to be published
    ... The facts will be read someday.

  As George pauses in the doorway, Ike holds up his tape recorder.

          IKE (cont'd)
    What kind of eggs did she like?

          GEORGE
    Poached, just like me.

  George exits.

              CUT TO:

  EXT. NEW YORK STREET/FISHER AND ELLIE'S BUILDING - DAY

  Ike walks down a street toward Ellie and Fisher.

              CUT TO:

  INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S APARTMENT (NYC) - NIGHT

  Ellie is on the phone as Fisher enters with beer.  Ike sits at
  the piano.

          FISHER
      (sarcastically)
    Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese
    takeout.  That's New York living.

          ELLIE
      (into phone)
    ... Just call me when you have it.
      (hangs up, then to Fisher)
    Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a
    man-eater?

          FISHER
    Or a vegetarian?

          ELLIE
    Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys,
    But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap.
    Nice guys, but he lives with his mom...
    Nice guys, but he just out of prison.

          IKE
    No... They're interesting guys.  Each
    one of these guys has something going
    for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest.
    Another's become a priest.  One's a
    pretty good guitar player.  And this
    guy today tried to end world hunger, if
    you can believe that...

          FISHER
    Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?

          ELLIE
    Fisher, let him talk.

          IKE
      (sits)
    But one of those guys -- not one of
    them -- knew her at all.  Each one was
    convinced that she was perfect for them,
    but they didn't see her.  And she never
    showed up so they couldn't see her.
    It's a very symbolic thing happening.
    She becomes what she thinks they wanted
    to be.

  Fisher doesn't like the sound of this.  He glances at Ellie, who
  is looking very interested.

          FISHER
      (in shock)
    Ike is turning sensitive and I can't
    bear to watch.  I'm going to make a
    fresh pot of tea.

  The phone rings as Fisher exits.  Ike goes to the piano as Ellie
  picks up the phone.

          ELLIE
      (into phone)
    Yeah... Oh, Jay... Okay... Bye.
      (hangs up, then yells to Fisher)
    Fisher, don't forget the fortune
    cookies.

  She joins Ike at the piano.  Ike gets serious.

          IKE
    Is that what I did to you?  Is that
    what happened?  Did I just not see
    you?

          ELLIE
    No.  No, you didn't.

  He hugs her.

          IKE
      (heartfelt)
    Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry,
    Ellie.

          ELLIE
    I'm sorry, too.
      (beat)
    Wow.  That only took us between years
    to say.

  Ellie blinks back sentimental tears.

              CUT TO:

  EXT. TROUT'S BARN - THE NEXT NIGHT

  We hear Hawaiian music.  We see a truck with GUESTS drive up and
  HULA DANCERS through barn slats.

  INT. TROUT'S BARN - NIGHT

  It's a small barn that's been converted into a luau with a bar.
  A BAND plays for two hula dancers.  The Trouts had decorated it
  as a little slice of Hawaii.  There are tiki lights, numerous
  rented plastic palm trees and fiberglass copies of Hawaiian
  statuary.  Strings of colored lights crisscross the ceiling.
  It looks like a Hawaiian high school gym on prom night.

  Maggie's family, Mrs. Trout and people we've already met, and
  more, are here, milling around wit tropical drinks garnished
  with umbrellas.  Plastic leis abound and most people have
  managed to find their old Hawaiian shirts.

  As we come in, the hula dancers finish their applause and Mrs.
  Trout announces.  Hula dancers stop.

          LOU TROUT
    Welcome to our annual country luau.  As
    you know, Betty and I got married on
    the rim of the crater, Diamond Head.

          MRS. TROUT
      (grabbing the
       microphone)
    This year, we're dedicating our first
    dance to the soon-to-be newlyweds, the
    King and Queen of Hawaii, Maggie and
    Bob.

  The couple enters.  Bob is a goody bronzed god in his King
  Kamahamela outfit.  Maggie is spectacular in her authentic
  looking Hawaiian Princess get-up.  But her face reflects none
  of the festivities around her.  Every now and then, she looks up
  and glances around for Ike, hating herself for it.

          MRS. TROUT (cont'd)
    King and Queen, dance.

  Maggie and Bob start to dance as the Quarter sings "Aloha Oe."

          MRS. TROUT (cont'd)
    Everybody dance.

  Everybody dances.

              TIMES OUT:

  Maggie and Bob pose for pictures with some of the guests.

          MRS. TROUT
    Pictures of the King and Queen.

  Dennis poses with Maggie.  Cory poses with Bob.  Mrs. Trout runs
  out of film and goes to get more, leaving Peggy and Maggie alone.
  Peggy whispers to Maggie.

          PEGGY
    Lighten up, wahine.

          MAGGIE
    Lighten up, what?

          PEGGY
    This party is for you and Bob.  Get
    your mind off the reporter.

          MAGGIE
    I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours.
    It just gives me the creeps a little bit.
    I'd feel better if I knew where he was.

          PEGGY
      (nods to door)
    Would it?

  ANGLE ON:  Ike just entering the party.  At least he tried.
  He's got a tropical sheet wrapped around his pants and shirt.
  He walks to the bar and is greeted warmly by Lee.  Maggie gets
  very flustered.

          PEGGY (cont'd)
    What are you doing?

          MAGGIE
      (after a beat)
    I'm going to go dance with Bob.
    Because he's the man.
      (referring to her headdress)
    I like those grapes.

  Maggie dances affectionately with Bob as Mr. Trout, tending
  bar, greets Ike.

          LOU TROUT
    Hey, Mr. Graham, welcome to our luau.
    What can I get you?

          IKE
    You got something without a toy in it?

            TIME CUT:

  A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON

  A pair of expressive pantomime "A Little Grass Shack".

  PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

  Mrs. Trout is on stage, introducing hula contestants.  Grandma
  judges the Hawaiian dancing.  The party is at full tilt -- a
  little wild, a little goofy.  Some guests (Bob, Cindy, Cory, Lee
  and Ted) do the limbo.  Walter, Mrs. Pressman doesn't turn as
  she hears him.

          IKE
    Aloha.  That's a very fetching
    headdress you're wearing.

  Ike leans into Maggie, enjoying the smell of her hair.  She
  notices, but acts casual.

          MAGGIE
    Where did you disappear to?

          IKE
    Missed me bad, huh?

              TIME CUT:

  All the guests start banding their pineapple cups.  Walter rises
  unsteadily, lifting his pineapple.

          MRS. TROUT
    Attention.  Listen to Walter.  Listen
    close, he slurs.
      (then)
    Shut up, wahines!

          WALTER
    In the tradition that has grown through
    the years, it is now Toast Time!  First
    up, our host, "A Honey of a Beekeeper",
    Lou Trout..

  Lou Trout stands with his glass raised.

          LOUT TROUT
    May the groom's heart be filled with
    hopes and the bride's feet be filled
    with lead!

  There are shouts of "Hear hear!"  Walter roars.

          MRS. TROUT
    May the pitter-patter of little feet
    not be Maggie's.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
    May the gifts be returned!

          TED
    May the back of the dress be as pretty
    as the front!

  The laughter swells and swells, led by Walter.

  ANGLE ON:

  Ike watches as Maggie takes the heat, raising her glass along
  with the others.  Bob raises his glass like the good sport he is.
  Ike can't believe it.

          WALTER
    You know the old saying, "You're not
    losing a daughter..."  Well, I'd like to!

  Walter gets a bit laugh.  He goes again.

          WALTER (cont'd)
    Maggie may not be Hale's longest
    running joke...
      (under her breath)

  Maggie finishes the punchline along with his father.

          WALTER AND     MAGGIE
    -- But she's certainly the fastest.

  Uproarious laughter.  Maggie looks terribly pained.  Ike's had
  enough.  He pushes himself to his feet.  Walter is thrilled.  He
  shushes the CROWD.

          WALTER (cont'd)
    Oh, look, Mr. Graham, how about a toast?

          IKE
    I don't know, give me a minute.
      (to Maggie)
    Are you all right with this?

          MAGGIE
    Excuse me?

          IKE
    Are you all right with this?  You think
    this is funny?

          MAGGIE
    Yes.

          IKE
    I don't and I don't think you should...

          BOB
    It's a joke.  They're kidding.

          WALTER AND CROWD
      (yell)
    Come on and give us a toast.

          IKE
    You want me to make a toast?  Okay...
    I'll give you a toast.  To Maggie's
    family and friends.  May you find
    yourselves the bull's eye of an easy
    target.  May you be publicly flogged
    for all of your bad choices and may
    your noses to rubbed in all of your
    mistakes...

  Ike watches their reaction.  The silence is deafening.  All the
  guests stare at Maggie.  Mortified, she holds back tears.

          MRS. TROUT
    That was funny.
      (a pause)
    But enough toasts, let's hula.  Let's
    start the music up.

  She gets everyone up to hula.  Band plays fast tune.  Maggie
  walks through the CROWD down the steps and outside.  Ike
  follows, but Peggy grabs a coat for her.  Bob watches her go as
  Cory approaches.

          CORY
    Hey, Bob.  I got twenty dollars bet on--

          BOB
    Not now.

  Bob rushes after Maggie.

          PEGGY
      (calling after her)
    Maggie.  Maggie.
      (to Ike,  handing him a jacket)
    Here.  She may need this.  It's not
    really Hawaii.

  Ike exits.  Then, Bob comes over.

          BOB
    Where'd Maggie go?

          PEGGY
    Oh, she just went to get me something
    from the car.

  Cory comes over with Dennis to Bob and Peggy.  BOB/PEGGY/CORY/
  DENNIS CHUFFA:  About Bart Starr and football.  (Which keeps Bob
  from going outside to follow Maggie).  Bob thinks about it.

  EXT. TROUT'S BARN - NIGHT

  Ike runs after Maggie.  He grabs her arm and turns her to him.

          IKE
    I'm the only goddamn person in there
    pulling for you.

          MAGGIE
    You humiliated me!

          IKE
    No, Maggie, I defended you.
    Humiliating you is what everyone else
    is doing.  It's the theme of this party.

          MAGGIE
    I had it under control.  Now they feel
    sorry for me.

          IKE
    Well, they should.  Because they're
    about to watch you hang yourself again.

  Maggie has no response.

          IKE (cont'd)
    -- Tell me something, do you really
    care about Mount Everest?

          MAGGIE
    It's fun!  It's high.

          IKE
    Or the sexual habits of locusts?

          MAGGIE
    That was very interesting research
    George was doing!

          IKE
    What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary
    tattoo?

          MAGGIE
    I already explained about that.

          IKE
    And where you ever really going to run
    the leper colony in Molokai?

          MAGGIE
      (wincing)
    Brian told you that?

          IKE
    Or maybe you just wanted to wear the
    headdress.

          MAGGIE
    Every one of those times I was being
    supportive.  Something you won't
    understand.

          IKE
    Supportive?  You weren't being
    supportive.  You were being scared.
    Just like now.  You are the most lost
    woman I have ever laid eyes on.

          MAGGIE
    Lost!

          IKE
    That's right.  You're so lost you don't
    even know how you like your eggs.

          MAGGIE
    What!?

          IKE
    With the priest, you liked them
    scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried.
    With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's
    egg whites only, thank you very much.

          MAGGIE
    That's called changing your mind.

          IKE
    No, that's called not having a mind of
    your own.  What are you doing, Maggie?
    You really want to let that man drag
    you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You
    don't want to climb Annapuma.

          MAGGIE
    Yes I do!

          IKE
    No you don't.  You want a man who will
    lead you down the beach with his head
    over your eyes just so you can discover
    the feel of the sand under your feet.
    You want a guy who will take you into a
    cave with a thousand candles just to
    read you a poem.  You want a man to
    wake you up at dawn because he's
    burning to talk to you and he can't
    wait another minute to find out what
    you'll say.  Am I right?

  He's laid her flat.  Maggie can't speak.

          IKE (cont'd)
    Am I right?

  She fights back angry tears.

          MAGGIE
    Stop.  Stop it!  I'm getting married on
    Sunday, and you're just trying to make
    me run!  Why?  Because you're a cynical,
    exploitative, mean-hearted creep who
    wouldn't know real love if it bit him
    in the armpit!  And all you do is tear
    other people down and-and-and laugh at
    them, and criticize what they do,
    because you're too afraid to do
    anything yourself!  I read your column.
    You never wrote one about you.  I'm not
    the only one who's lost and you know it!
    Am I right?  Well?  Am I right?

  ANGLE ON:  Bob comes outside.

          BOB
    Mag.  Help me out here.  Green Bay.
    Right guard.

  Both Maggie and Ike are breathing hard.  Bob comes up to Maggie
  and gives Ike a very hard look as he puts his arm around his
  fiancee.

          BOB (cont'd)
    You know... Blocked Bart Starr, crewcut
    ... Are you okay?

  Maggie adjusts her face as best she can.

          MAGGIE
    Yes.

          BOB
    Let me take you back inside, okay?

  She lets him lead her away.

          MAGGIE
    Jerry Kramer.

  Ike looks at her drooped shoulder and he shakes his head and
  walks to his car.

  EXT. HALE METHODIST CHURCH - THE NEXT DAY

  Peggy and Cindy arrive for the rehearsal.  They leave Cindy's
  dog in Peggy's car and walk to the church.

          CINDY
    Tell me, why does Maggie need another
    wedding rehearsal and two days before
    the wedding?  She's already done this.

          PEGGY
    Bob is making her visualize the
    ceremony.

              CUT TO:

  INT. HALE METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

  They are in the church proper now.  Peggy waits in a pew as Bob
  leads Maggie and Ike up the back steps of the church.

          BOB
      (to Maggie)
    Okay, we're ready.  Want me to have Ike
    leave now?

  Maggie turns on Ike with "cheerful" hostility.

          MAGGIE
    No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the
    pastor.

          IKE
    I'd rather not.

          MAGGIE
      (sarcastically)
    Come on, it'll give you a great view.
    It's perfect.
      (seeing Peggy)
    Hey.

  Maggie smiles at Bob.  Ike sighs and goes with it.  Bob pulls Ike
  to the head of the aisle and places him.  Peggy follows Maggie
  into the foyer to get ready.  Cindy sits with Ted at the organ.

          BOB
    Team effort, Pastor Ike... Cindy, ready?
      (after no response)
    Cindy, come on.

  Cindy leaves to join the girls in the foyer.

  INT. CHURCH FOYER - THAT MOMENT

  Once in the privacy of the foyer, Peggy and Maggie talk.

          PEGGY
    He's going to be the pastor?

          MAGGIE
    Yep.  I want him to be front and center
    and to watch everything.

          PEGGY
    What happened at the luau?

          MAGGIE
      (flustered)
    ... I don't even want to talk about
    the luau.
      (then seeing a hanging rope)
    What's this?

          PEGGY
    It's for the bell.

  Cindy joins them.

          CINDY
    Bob's in a hurry.

          PEGGY
    Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us
    visualize.  Remember what Bob said?
    "Be the ball."

          CINDY
    "Sink the putt."

          PEGGY
    "Make the shot."

          CINDY
    "Nothing but net."

          PEGGY
    "Never say die."

  Maggie puts her hands up.

          MAGGIE
    Go!

  Peggy and Cindy exit.  Maggie pulls the bell rope and sways back
  and forth as she rings the bell.

  INT. CHAPEL - THAT MOMENT

  It is Maggie's turn to enter.  They all turn expectantly.  Too
  much time passes.  Ted plays the organ, then stops.  Maggie
  swings back and forth in the foyer doorway.

          BOB
    Honey, are you okay?

  Maggie stops ringing the bell and pulls herself together.  She
  walks into the aisle looking a little shaky.  She takes a few
  tremulous steps slowly with her eyes closed, peeking
  occasionally with one eye.

          IKE
      (taking off his jacket)
    At this pace, it could be an evening
    wedding.

          BOB
    Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're
    taking this too fast.

  He begins to pace.

          BOB (cont'd)
    We need to limber you up a little.
    You're tensing.
      (thinks a moment;
       to Ike, moving him
       to groom's spot)
    You stand here and be me so she knows
    how far she'll have to go.
      (then to Maggie)
    I'm going to walk with you.

  Bob goes to Maggie and walks behind her.

          BOB (cont'd)
    Visualize!  Visualize!  It's game time.

  ANGLE ON:

  Maggie walking.

          BOB (cont'd)
    You are the football.  You're spiraling
    through the air towards the hands of
    the groom.

  She proceeds down the aisle.  Bob behind her.

          MAGGIE
      (eyes down)
    Yes, I'm spiraling through the air.

  ANGLE ON:

  Maggie raises her eyes and sees Ike in front of her as groom.
  Ike and Maggie lock gazes.  If they had to, they couldn't look
  away.  All the things unspoken are now communicated -- the love,
  the longing.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    I streak towards the goal line.

  Maggie's pace quickens.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    And I land on the goal line.

  ANGLE ON:

  Bob beams to see Maggie's eager arrival at Ike's side.  He
  switches off the music and proceeds like a proud coach to be the
  pastor.

          BOB
    Okay, I'm the pastor.  Dearly beloved,
    blah, blah, blah.  So on and so forth.
    Ra ta ta ta.  Yabada dabada.  I now
    pronounce you man and wife.  Kiss the
    bride, badum dum.
      (then moving toward Ted)
    We have the crescendo that leads to us
    right back down the aisle and out the...

  Ike kisses Maggie.  It is a world class, Olympic kiss.  It is a
  kiss that changes everything and can never be taken back.  It is
  a kiss you only get once in your life.

  NEW ANGLE:

  Bob's smile dies.  Cindy's mouth drops open as the kiss goes on
  and on.  Peggy loses control and screams.

          BOB (cont'd)
    Maggie!!!!?

  Like a bucket of water thrown on two dogs, Ike and Maggie are
  startled out of their kiss.  They pull apart and smile at each
  other.

  ANGLE ON:  Bob.

          BOB (cont'd)
      (furious)
    If you were imagining me, you did great.
      (to Ike)
    What the hell were you doing?

          IKE
      (eyes on Maggie)
    I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back.

          MAGGIE
      (dazed but happy)
    I kissed him back.

          BOB
    Yeah, I caught that.  Want to tell me
    how long this has been going on?

  Maggie looks at Ike, wondrous, confused.

          MAGGIE
    About a minute...?

          IKE
    A little longer for me.

          MAGGIE
    Really?

          BOB
    What do you expect me to say to this?

          IKE
    How about -- "I hope you'll be very
    happy together"?

  Bob hauls back and punches Ike in the face.  Ike drops.

          BOB
    I hope you'll be very happy together.

  Bob storms down the aisle and out of the church.

          MAGGIE
      (to Peggy)
    Take care of him.

  Maggie leaves.

              CUT TO:

  EXT. CHURCH - THAT MOMENT

  Bob is halfway down the walk.  Maggie appears at the church door
  and calls after him.

          MAGGIE
    Bob, I'm sorry!
      (half to herself)
    At least I backed out before the
    wedding.  That's progress!

  He keeps marching.  Now Peggy appears next to Maggie.  Maggie
  calls again.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    Some woman is going to make you a lot
    happier than I ever could...

  The words are barely out of her mouth when Cindy comes out the
  door, racing after Bob at a full sprint.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    See?

          PEGGY
    Well, Maggie -- in the words of Mrs.
    Pressman: "Holy moly".  Call me later.

  Peggy goes to her car.  Cindy joins her as Bob speeds off in his
  car.  Now Ike takes Peggy's place next to Maggie.  Maggie turns
  to face Ike.  They are both beet red, stammering and unable to
  look at each other, trying to act normal.

          MAGGIE
    Okay.  So... what, uh... What just
    happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In
    there?

          IKE
    I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't
    even want to talk about it.

          MAGGIE
    Me, either.

  Ike GRABS Maggie and BOOM -- they are all over each other,
  kissing frantically, tongues, hands, hair, elbow, you name it.
  Blathering fools.

          IKE
      (blathering)
    I love you.  I love you.

          MAGGIE
      (blathering)
    I love you, too.

  They come up for air.

          IKE
    Wait.  We have to talk.  We have to do
    some talking now.  Pull up a railing.

  Maggie sits on the railing, then Ike backs up and sits on the
  opposite railing.

          IKE (cont'd)
    You have to go down an aisle and say "I
    do".  You have to get married.

          MAGGIE
    To who?  Are you asking me?

          IKE
    Me?

  Ike backs up to opposite railing and sits facing Maggie.

          MAGGIE
    Yes, you!

          IKE
      (thinks)
    Well, you do have the dress.

          MAGGIE
    And the church.

          IKE
    And the wedding date.  There's the two
    of us.
      (beat)
    So, you think... maybe... You have to
    go down the aisle with somebody you
    love and who love you back.

          MAGGIE
    I'm okay with that.

          IKE
    So am I.

          MAGGIE
    So, we'll...

  They both nod and sit there smiling, sort of. The organist, Ted,
  closes the church door.

      TED
    Good night.

  Ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and quietly speaks
  into it.

          IKE
    I'm getting married.

  WIDE SHOT:

  They smile at each other and remain sitting.  Then, silence.

              CUT TO:

  EXT. STREET/HALE/ATLANTIC HOTEL - THAT NIGHT

  Ike drives up and parks in front of the hotel as he talks on his
  cell phone.

  INTERCUT WITH:

  INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM (NYC) - NIGHT

  Ellie's on the phone.  Fisher sits nearby.

          ELLIE
    Ike's going to get married.

  Fisher throws himself onto the carpet and rolls himself
  helpless with laughter.

          ELLIE (cont'd)
      (without turning to him)
    Fisher, if you pee on that Persian,
    I'll kill you.

              CUT TO:

  INT. BEAUTY SALON - NIGHT DAY

  Maggie talks to Peggy, Cindy and Grandma Julia.  Grandma Julia
  sits under a hair dryer.  Sprout, the dog, sits in his basket.

          CINDY
    I love his eyes.  I just believe
    they're listening to you.

          PEGGY
    His hair... any color.

          GRANDMA JULIA
    I like his tight butt.

  Peggy laughs.

          MAGGIE
    Grandma!

          PEGGY
      (to Cindy)
    See, this is a mature relationship.
    She's really found it.

              CUT TO:

  LOVE MONTAGE SHOTS:

  EXT. OCEAN - DAY

  Ike and Maggie fishing.

  INT. MAGGIE'S WORKSHOP/HOME - DAY

  They play ping-pong.  They laugh, enjoying the moment.

  INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DAY

  Ike and Maggie have fun playing cards.  The game is slapjack.

  EXT. FIELD - DAY

  Maggie and Ike horseback riding.  They sit on their horses
  amongst trees, "nuzzling".  Ike reads as he pushes Maggie in a
  tire swing.

  INT. MAGGIE'S ROOM - DAY

  Ike and Maggie open and close a Hoberman ball by holding its
  opposite ends in their teeth.  Grandma looks in.

  INT. MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

  There is a fire in the fireplace.  Maggie and Ike sit as Ike
  shows Maggie some passages from his favorite books.  He's
  reading something from Yeats at the moment.  They seem happy.

  EXT. CHURCH - THE DAY OF THE WEDDING

  It is a media circus including FOUR REPORTERS, Midday with
  Meredith and the T-shirt Vendor.  Plus three other people the
  reporters are interviewing, a GERMAN LADY, BUTCH KENAN, a
  farmer and Grandma Julia.  Reporter DINA NAPOLI walks down the
  church steps.

          DINA NAPOLI (OF WBAL)
    Wedding bells are ringing for the
    fourth time today in Hale, Maryland.
    Maggie Carpenter, "Always a Bride --
    Never a Bridesmaid", will be attempting
    to complete her fourth wedding ceremony.
    We'll come back on the air when the
    results are in.  Back to you, Jessica.

  Meredith, the low-end public access TV reporter, films himself
  pointing a cheap video camera himself.

          MEREDITH
    The turnout for this morning's wedding
    is usually reserved for royalty or
    Hollywood stars, but Maggie Carpenter
    is Hale, Maryland's special star and
    the citizens of Hale are out in full
    force today.

  The NY T-shirt Vendor pitches his wares.

          T-SHIRT VENDOR
    I got "Bye-bye Birdie".  "What part of
    'I do' don't you understand?"... Get
    your "Runaway Bride" T-shirts here...

  Reporter JULIE MURPHY stands near Grandma Julia and Mrs.
  Pressman.

          JULIE MURPHY (Channel 6)
    The bride's been here for almost an
    hour, but being around in the beginning
    was never her problem.  We'll be here,
    showing you the full wedding ceremony,
    we hope.

  Reporter JACKI and TIFFANY stand at the edge of the CROWD
  reporting.

          JACKI/REPORTER #3 (WBOC TV16)
    Will she or won't she?  That is on the
    minds of these several hundreds folks,
    who are standing here this morning.
    Not to mention on the mind of Groom
    Number #4, ex-USA Today columnist, Ike
    Graham, who is missing in action.

  EXT. WINDOW OF CHURCH/INT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM - DAY

  INSERT window of church.  Peggy peers out the window at the
  carnival scene.  Cindy sits with Maggie as she leans forward,
  doubled over on a child's chair.  Peggy moves from the window to
  sit with them.

          MAGGIE
      (moves to window)
    He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not
    coming.

          PEGGY
    No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a
    "V".

          MAGGIE
    You and your lucky geese.  You always
    see geese.

          PEGGY
    Not eight...

          CINDY
    And in a "V".

          MAGGIE
    Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.

  They ad lib various words starting with the letter "V".  Maggie
  is nervous.

          CINDY
    Rub your ears.

          PEGGY
    Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing.
    Cory does that to me when I
    hyperventilate.

  Maggie rubs her ears.

          CINDY
    We do it to our dog.

          MAGGIE
    It's hurting.

          CINDY
    We'll rub.

  After they rub Maggie's ears a bit:

          PEGGY
    He's here!  He's here!

  They all squeeze and peer out window.  They scream in excitement.
  Cindy rushes to Maggie's wedding dress.

          CINDY
    I'll get the dress.

          MAGGIE
    He's here!... He's here!

          PEGGY
    Now's the time for calm... If you don't
    calm down, you won't get your dress on...
      (reassuringly)
    He's the one... He's the one.

  Peggy moves to help Cindy with the dress.  Maggie stands alone at
  the window a moment.  She picks up a toy horse.

          MAGGIE
    This is not a good sign.

  Maggie goes over to Peggy and Cindy, and starts to get into her
  bridal gown.  They continue to ad lib words standing with the
  letter "V".

          CINDY
    We have to hurry.  The Sunday School
    kids will be here soon.

              CUT TO:

  INT. IKE'S CAR - DAY

  Ike pulls up slowly.  GUESTS peer through the his car window and
  wave.  Ike rubs his headache.

          JULIE MURPHY
    Well, the groom just pulled up.  There
    was talk of a "now show", but he is
    here.

          DINA NAPOLI
    Ike Graham is here!

  IKE'SPOV:

  He moves as he takes it all in:  a FAMILY eats a fast food picnic
  on a neighbor's lawn, invited GUESTS flock by in their party
  best, and local NEWS TEAMS block the way.  The STATE SENATOR is
  making a speech welcoming the press to Maryland.  A large GROUP
  of reporters head up the church's stairs, hauling their
  equipment.  They enter the flood of PEOPLE streaming inside the
  church.  Ike snaps.

  EXT. IKE'S CAR - CONTINUING

  Ike stops the car where it is and jumps out, slamming the door in
  anger.  The REPORTERS swarm around him as he gets out of the car.
  They continue to pound him with questions as he walks to church
  steps.  An OLDER LADY smacks him on the shoulder with a
  newspaper.  He turns in astonishment and continues up the
  steps.  He charges up the stairs and grabs Lee.

          IKE
    Shoot ours so she has one with an
    ending.

  Mrs. Pressman stands, shooting Ike with her video camera.

          IKE (cont'd)
      (pleading)
    Mrs. Pressman, please.

          MRS. PRESSMAN
    It's okay.  There's no microphone.
    You're no fun.

          IKE
    No, I'm not.

  Ike retreats into the church.  Lee comes up to him again with his
  video camera:  CHUFFA about Scorsese.

  INT. CHURCH - CONTINUING

  As Fisher and Ellie sign the guest book, a LOCAL LADY stares at
  Ellie.  Ellie stares back at her until she leaves.  Ike walks
  away from Lee and turns smack into Ellie and Fisher.  Ike puts
  his arms around them and gives them a big hug.

          IKE
    Friends.  Thank you.  Thank you.

  Over Ellie's shoulder, Ike sees Fisher's grinning face.

          IKE (cont'd)
    We are friends, aren't we, Fisher?

          FISHER
      (grinning)
    Of course we are.  Of course.

          IKE
    Then you'll be my best man.

          FISHER
    Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm
    best.

          IKE
    Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell
    you what to do.  And someone will tell
    me what to do.

          ELLIE
    You always looked great in that suit...
    And Ike?
      (emotional)
    I'm happy for you, honey.

  Ellie whispers in his ear.

          ELLIE (cont'd)
    I'll have a car around the back to
    whisk you out of here if she runs.

  Ellie kisses him on the cheek and walks away.

  ANGLE ON:

  Bob comes up to Ike.  He looks like he's going to punch Ike, then
  abruptly holds out a rose boutonniere.

          BOB
    You look awful.

          IKE
      (sarcastically)
    Thank you.

  Bob hands the flower to Ike.  Ike is shaking.  Bob catches this
  and looks up to Ike.  It is a moment of clean honesty between the
  men.

          BOB
    Ike.  Need help?

  He takes the boutonniere and puts it on Ike's lapel.

          BOB (cont'd)
    I'm glad it's you.

          IKE
    Really?

          BOB
    I didn't want to find out I wasn't for
    her in the fourth quarter.

          IKE
    Got any last minute advice?

          BOB
      (motioning to their eyes)
    Maintain eye contact.

  Bob turns and leaves, going down a side staircase.

          IKE
      (to himself)
    Eye contact.  Eye contact.

  Out of the corner of his eye, Ike sees a pictures of Christ on the
  wall.  He leans into the picture and whispers.

          IKE (cont'd)
    Cover me.

  He walks into the chapel.

  INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUING

  Ike steps up and stands next to Fisher.

          FISHER
      (to Ike)
    I have no idea what I'm doing.

          IKE
    Your job is... the ring.
      (to Fisher)
    Do you have the ring?!

          FISHER
    I just found out I'm best man!  I'm
    lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?

  Ike gives the ring to Fisher.  The Pastor approaches Ike.  Ike
  turns away and look out over the guests.

  IKE'SPOV:  There are most of the TOWNSPEOPLE we've come to
  know, plus some NEW YORKERS for Ike, with little ponytails.
  Armani wire rims, Donna Karan bodysuits.  There's a lot of
  smirking, checking out the hicks, forming their stories for
  cocktail hour.  Elaine is in back all dressed in black, mourning
  Ike.  Mrs. Trout approaches Ike.

          MRS. TROUT
    You should thank Lou and I for the
    wedding car -- a '63 Buick.

          IKE
    Thank you.

          MRS. TROUT
    Oh, come on.  You're practically family.

  Mrs. Trout starts picking lint off Fisher's jacket.

          FISHER
    Hello.  I'm Fisher.

          MRS. TROUT
    This doesn't want to come out.

          FISHER
    You just pull a hair from my neck.

          IKE
    Mrs. Trout, go back to your seat!

  INT. CHURCH FOYER - DAY

  Peggy joins Maggie, who is blowing bubblegum and swaying in
  front of an oscillating fan.  Grandma and Walter come in.
  Grandma gives her a kiss on the cheek.

          GRANDMA JULIA
    Good luck, Maggie.

          MAGGIE
    Thank you, Grandma.

  Grandma leaves.  Walter steps up.

          WALTER
      (quietly to Maggie)
    I'm really rooting for this one.

          MAGGIE
    Thank you, Dad.

  Peggy turns off the fan.  Cindy takes the bag from Maggie.

          CINDY
    Spit.

  Maggie spits her bubblegum into the bag.  Peggy hands Maggie her
  bouquet.

          PEGGY
    Let's go.

          MAGGIE
    No sauntering down the aisle.  Just
    make time.  Let's just get there.

  Cindy and Peggy nod and leave.  The door closes.

  INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUING

  Both extends his hand to Elaine.

          ELAINE
    Hi, I'm Elaine from New York.

          BOB
    Hello.  I'm Bob, Maggie's fourth
    attempt.

          ELAINE
    I'm sorry.

          BOB
    That's okay.  There's a lid for every
    pot.  Besides, I'm comfortable with Ike.
    I mean, Jack Dempsey lost his
    heavyweight title to a New Yorker.

            ELAINE
    I know.  Gene Tunney.

  The organ begins to play.  The organist is Ted.  Grandma, Walter,
  Mrs. Pressman and the Trouts watch.  Mrs. Trout picks lint off of
  her husband's jacket.

  ANGLE ON:

  Cindy and Peggy enter with the confident air of people who have
  done this before.  They make it to the head of the aisle all too
  quickly.  Peggy gives Ike a wink and an encouraging smile.

  INT. CHURCH FOYER - CONTINUING

  The door opens and Dennis sticks his head in.

          DENNIS
    They're ready, Maggie.

          MAGGIE
    Just a second.

  Dennis closes the door behind him as he goes back into the
  chapel.  Maggie has a moment alone.  She looks at back door as
  possible escape route, then changes her mind.  She signals the
  start of the wedding by knocking on the door.

  INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS

  Immediately, Cory and Dennis open the doors for her entrance.
  All the guests stand as Maggie enter the chapel smiling.

  MAGGIE'S POV:

  The aisle stretches before her into infinity.  Faces goggle at
  her from every direction.  The tiny figure of Ike stands like a
  beacon a long way off.

  NEW ANGLE:

  She plunges forward with a sped-up hesitation step.

  ANGLE ON:

  Ike rocks imperceptibly, urging her on.  Peggy and Cindy make
  little "come on" motions.  It seems to be working.  Maggie
  approaches rapidly.  The CROWD has turned from skepticism to
  looks and noises of encouragement.

  ANGLE ON: MAGGIE

  But then her feet gradually begin to slow.

  ANGLE ON:

  Fisher gives a little "darn, so close" look.

  ANGLE ON:

  But Ike is too busy maintaining eye contact.  His eyes urge
  Maggie closer -- loving her, willing her on.

  CLOSE ON:

  Maggie stops her walk, gives Ike a teasing smile, and then
  resumes with her walk toward him.  His face.  Her face.  His
  face.  Her face.

  CLOSE ON:

  Her foot inches forward.  The other follows.

  NEW ANGLE:

  A sigh now rises from the GUESTS as Maggie closes in on Ike.  He
  smiles at her.  She smiles at him.  She is almost there... She's
  there, smiling at Ike.  The Pastor gestures to the guests to sit
  down.  They do.

  ANGLE ON:

  Ike sneezes.  She looks down and imagines she sees the carpet
  splitting apart.  And she bolts like a bat out of hell!  In a
  flurry of white, she is halfway down the aisle before Ike knows
  what hits him.

  ANGLE ON:

  Ike stands there dazed.  For a second.  Then she springs into
  action, charging after her.

          IKE
      (yelling out)
    Block the doors!

  Like a general, he points to Dennis and Cory in the back and
  sends them into action.  The doors shut in Maggie's face.  But
  she's a wild animal cornered.   She moves to the side.  The
  TOWNSPEOPLE stand so Ike can hurry through the pew.  Ike climbs
  on the pews towards her as GUEST crowd the aisle, blocking his
  path.  Like a gazelle, she leaps to the side aisle and scampers
  down and away.  Fisher gets on his cell phone.  Ike charges from
  one of the full pews, crosses the aisle and leaps across the pews
  near the staircase to cut her off.  He grabs her veil and it
  comes off in his hands.  Maggie disappears down the steps of the
  church basement.  Ike fumble with the veil and jumps over the
  railing, landing on Dennis' toe.  He follows down the stairs
  after her.  Mrs. Pressman and Walter exchange bet money.

              CUT TO:

  INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - CONTINUING

  Maggie comes down steps and enters the church children's Sunday
  school class.  A lot of KIDS And TEACHERS are doing religious
  arts and crafts.  As Maggie runs through:

          MAGGIE
    There's a man coming down those steps
    with lots of candy in his pockets.  If
    you tickle him, he'll give candy.

  She gives her bouquet to a little GIRL as she goes by.  Ike comes
  down stairs.

          IKE
    Maggie!

  The KIDS mob him, grabbing his pockets.  Ike fights his way
  through KIDS.

  ANGLE ON:

  Maggie as she's in the church kitchen and hops on counter and
  heads out the window.  The window is wide enough.

  ANGLE ON:

  Ike as he gets to the window, but Maggie is out in driveway.

  EXT. CHURCH DRIVEWAY - CONTINUING

  Maggie flies toward a FedEx truck at next house just leaving.

  ANOTHER ANGLE:

  She gathers her dress and jumps in as Ike yells from window,
  then, quickly climbs out onto the lawn as the truck starts to
  pull away.

          IKE
    Maggie!

  Maggie looks back once, tearful and regretful, and disappears
  inside the truck.  The truck races off.

  The PHOTOGRAPHERS turn their cameras on Ike, en masse.  He is
  enveloped by a barrage of bright lights.

  Ellie and Fisher, who have also stepped outside on chapel front
  steps, are looking around as Ike turns around the corner and
  past the church.

          ELLIE
    Look, he's running after her.

          FISHER
    Look, he's in pretty good shape.

          ELLIE
    Poor Ike.

  They look after the FedEx truck and watch Ike chasing the truck
  down the road away from the church.

          IKE
      (running; yells)
    Maggie!

          ELLIE
    Where do you think she's going?

          FISHER
    Wherever it is, she'll be there by ten-
    thirty tomorrow.

  Cindy, Cory, Peggy and Meredith also rush out of the church and
  comment on Maggie's runaway.  Further down the road, Ike still
  chases the truck, yelling:

          IKE
    Maggie!

  As the truck rounds the bend in the road and disappears, Ike
  stops and stares alone after the disappearing truck.  A swarm of
  REPORTERS catch up to him, flashing pictures and asking
  questions.  Another camera flashes and we cut to:

  A NEWSPAPER PHOTO

  Of Ike's stunned face on the cover of the USA Today.  The caption
  reads: "Hit and Run:  Runaway Bride Strikes again".  And we see
  headlines in other papers.

  INT. HARDWARE STORE - NIGHT

  Maggie is sitting, end of a long day.  Peggy sticks her head in
  entrance door.

          PEGGY
    You okay?  I'm closing.

          MAGGIE
    I'm just finishing up, too.

          PEGGY
    Want to go to Butch's for a drink or
    something?

          MAGGIE
      (interrupting)
    No, I'm just going to head home.

          PEGGY
    Okay.

  Peggy starts to go, then moves close to Maggie.

          PEGGY (cont'd)
      (stepping closer
       and making a "V"
       with her fingers)
    You know, I was just thinking about
    that geese thing.  I think the "V" was
    half of a "W".  A "W" for...

          MAGGIE
    What are you talking about?

          PEGGY
    Wedding.  Wedding.
      (holding Maggie's face)
    You just have to get the rest of your
    ducks in a row.

          MAGGIE
    Thank you.  You still think that he
    was....

          PEGGY
    Quick.  Very quick.

  Peggy exits.  Maggie stares, losing herself in thought.  Then a
  VOICE startles her.

          VOICE
      (whispers)
    Marry me, Maggie.

  Maggie jumps and turns to see:  DENNIS -- the kid from the high
  school football team, popping up from a low position near the
  counter.

          MAGGIE
      (softly)
    Hi, Dennis.

          DENNIS
    I am going to propose, you know.  I
    mean, the right way.  Soon as I turn
    eighteen.

          MAGGIE
    You're sweet, Dennis.  But you've got
    to go.  I'm closing up.  Here's a candy
    bar and one for your brother.

  Dennis takes the candy and starts to go.

          DENNIS
    I'm not giving up.   A person shouldn't
    give up.

  Dennis exits.  Maggie is alone.  She turns out the lamp she
  designed, then on again.  She turns off the other lamp on the
  counter and exits.  We hold on Maggie's designed lamp.

  INT. IKE'S HALLWAY AND APARTMENT - NIGHT

  Ike walks up to his door, carrying his mail and a bag of
  carryout.  He opens the door and walks into his apartment.  He
  pets Italics, who sits on his sofa bed.  Without taking off his
  coat, he goes to his keyboard and plays music as he CHUFFAS to
  his cat about marriage and divorce.

  INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DAY

  Dad and Grandma Julia are there.  Grandma is making lunch.
  Walter is juggling oranges.  There's glass of beer on the
  kitchen counter.

          WALTER
    That's Maggie.  Home for lunch.

          GRANDMA JULIA
    She's been doing this since the last
    wedding.  I don't think it's good.

  Maggie walks in and kisses Grandma on the cheek.

          MAGGIE
    Hey.  Grandma, what's for lunch?

          GRANDMA JULIA
    Turkey and cheese.

          WALTER
    Honey, your grandmother and I were
    thinking about opening a wedding gift
    museum.

  Walter laughs.

          MAGGIE
    STOP!

  Walter looks at his daughter in surprise.  He's never heard a
  tone like this in her voice before.

          WALTER
    What?

          MAGGIE
      (quiet fury)
    Just stop it.  Don't say another word
    like that.

          WALTER
      (putting down the oranges)
    Maggie, it's just a joke...

          MAGGIE
    No.  It's my life.

          WALTER
    A harmless joke.

          MAGGIE
    No, it's humiliating and you've been
    doing it since I was a kid.  I don't
    like it.  Stop.  You may not like
    having a daughter with problems.  But
    guess what?  I don't like having a
    father who's drunk all the time.  I'll
    eat in my room.

  Maggie takes a plate and exits.

          GRANDMA JULIA
    That needed to be said.  You know --
    you're always making jokes about her,
    so they won't make jokes about your
    drinking.

  Walter reacts.

  the window, looks away, stops and looks again.  The window
  display is made up of an assortment of Maggie's lamps.  Logo
  "MAG" is on them.  He smiles and walks on.

  Ike walks along sidewalk, crosses street, enters his building.

  sees and is stunned to find:  MAGGIE, sitting on the couch
  holding Italics, the cat.

          MAGGIE
    Hello, Ike.

  He closes the closet and crosses to his desk.

          IKE
    Don't tell me.  My doorman is one of
    your many admires... I knew I should
    have given him a better Christmas gift.

  Maggie smiles tenuously.  She's more than a little terrified.

          MAGGIE
    I've been making friends with your cat.
      (then)
    Is it okay that I'm here?

          IKE
    I don't have much choice in the matter
    now, do I?  But I can't speak for
    Italics.
      (to Cat)
    Traitor!

  He moves to the kitchen.

          MAGGIE
    I don't blame you for being mad...

  Ike looks at her.  Apparently the word "mad" is an understatement.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    ... Or... furious.

  Ike looks at her again.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    ... Irate?  Livid?  How's that?

  He starts putting cat food in a bowl.  The cat leaves Maggie's
  side and starts to east.

          IKE
    Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie?
    You here on business?  I saw your lamps.
    They're terrific.

          MAGGIE
    It's something I've always wanted to do.

  Ike leaves the kitchen, turns on the balcony lights and re-enters
  the living room from the balcony.

          IKE
    You actually could make breaking and
    entering into a new career.
      (after opening
       the glass doors)
    So, what are you doing here?

          MAGGIE
    I wanted to talk to you about why I run
    or ride away from things.

  Ike moves away from her and sits on the steps near the balcony
  window, listening.

          IKE
      (after sitting)
    Does it matter?

          MAGGIE
    I think so... When I was walking down
    the aisle?  I was  walking toward
    somebody who didn't have any idea who I
    really was.  And it was only half the
    other person's fault, because I had
    done everything to convince him that I
    was exactly what he wanted.  So it was
    good that I didn't go through with it
    because it would have been a lie, but
    you -- you knew the real me.

          IKE
    Yes, I did.

          MAGGIE
    I didn't.  And you being the one at the
    end of the aisle didn't just fix that.

  Ike takes this in.  She's reaching him -- but then the defenses
  go back up.  He turns to her.

          IKE
    No, I couldn't fix anything...
      (as he gets up)
    But I still ended up chasing a truck.

  Ike moves out to the balcony.  After a moment, Maggie follows him.

  EXT. BALCONY/IKE'SAPARTMENT - NIGHT

  The balcony overlooks Central Park.  The twinkling lights of the
  city stretch out across the beautiful night.  Ike looks out at
  the view with his back to Maggie as she speaks.

          MAGGIE
    I understand why you bring up the truck.
    Let me explain something.  The fact is,
    you've seen me at my worst, most
    embarrassing, deviously plotting,
    potentially but not certifiably,
    psychotic state.  And if you liked me
    then, I mean, now... I can't imagine...
      (crosses to him)
    Benedict.

  Ike has no response.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    I love eggs Benedict.  I hate all the
    other kinds.

  She hesitates.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    ... I hate big weddings with everybody
    staring.  I would like to get married
    on a weekday while everybody is at work.
    If I ride off into the sunset, I want
    my own horse.

          IKE
    Should I be writing this down?

  She returns to the balcony and hands him the box.

          IKE (cont'd)
    What's this?

          MAGGIE
    These are for you.

  He opens it.  It's her running shoes.

          IKE
    Used?

          MAGGIE
    They're mine.  I'm turning in my
    running shoes to you.

          IKE
    This is getting serious.

  Now she is glowing at him, shining with the full force of her.

          MAGGIE
    And one more thing.  I know it's hard
    to believe there could be more.  Um...

  Maggie glances around and spots a DECK CHAIR, which she turns so
  it is facing the city lights.  Then she softly says:

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    If you could have a seat, please.

  Ike sits.  Maggie takes the box from him and puts it aide.  And
  then she gets down on one knee.

          IKE
      (laughing)
    Oh my God.  No.

  Maggie smiles up at him.  Ike tips his head back and covers his
  eyes with his hand.

          MAGGIE
    No, no -- don't hide your face, this
    only happens once in a lifetime.  It's
    definitely a first to me, and you're
    not going to want to miss it.

  He smiles as he looks at Maggie.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    I love you, Homer Eisenhower Graham.
    Will you marry me?

  Ike swallows, overwhelmed, overjoyed, and scared shitless.

          IKE
    Maggie, I gotta think about this a
    little bit.

  Maggie hops cheerfully back to her feet.

          MAGGIE
      (cheerful)
    Good.

  She gets off her knees and stands.

          MAGGIE (cont'd)
    I was hoping you'd say that.

          IKE
      (laughing)
    You were not.

          MAGGIE
    I was, because if you said "yes" right
    away, I wouldn't get to say this next
    part.  And I've been practicing it.
      (pulling up a chair
       and sitting)
    Ready?

          IKE
    I'm listening.

          MAGGIE
      (tenderly)
    "I guarantee that we'll have tough
    times.  I guarantee  that at some point
    one or both oof us will want to get out.
    But I also guarantee that if I don't
    ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for
    the rest of my life. Because I know in
    my heart -- you're the only one for me".

  Ike takes her hands affectionately.

          IKE
    Pretty good speech, Maggie.

          MAGGIE
    I borrowed it from this guy I know.
    So?

  Ike looks into Maggie's shining face and pauses.  He gets up and
  motions with his hand for her to stay seated.  He goes inside and
  turns on some music.  The cat is sitting by the radio.  He
  returns to the balcony and takes Maggie's hand.

          IKE
    Dance with me.

  They start to dance a slow dance.

              DISSOLVE TO:

  EXT. LARGE GREEN FIELD - DAY

  We see a hill and on top of it is a Pastor marrying Maggie and
  Ike, in beautiful wedding attire.  We see Maggie walk down a
  leaf-lined aisle to a waiting Ike.  They kiss as we hear the vows
  and hear them each say "I do".  They kiss a twirling, whirling
  kiss, a circular kiss.  We hear the applause of about twenty
  people.  Slowly, we see the twenty people come over the crest of
  the hill.  They are all Maggie's family and friends, plus the
  old grooms.  They are all paired in twos, like a love Noah's ark.
  We see others get the news.

  INT. CHURCH - DAY

  Priest Brian hears about Maggie's wedding.

  INT. BAKERY - DAY

  Mrs. Trout hears about Maggie's wedding.

  INT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY

  George, Groom #3, hears about Maggie's wedding.

  INT. ELLIE'S OFFICE OR APARTMENT - DAY

  Ellie and Fisher hear about Maggie's wedding.

  EXT. FIELD - DAY

  ANOTHER ANGLE:

  Maggie and Ike finally break the kiss.  Ike takes her hand and
  walks her to two horses.  Ike and Maggie, on the two horses, ride
  off happily in their wedding clothes.  As the group cheers,
  Maggie throws bouquet.  We see it float in the air.

              FADE TO BLACK.

      THE END
