	1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN

	It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through 
	the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the 
	trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.

	Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to 
	the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
	then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to 
	emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set 
	of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, 
	in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." 
	The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier 
	beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no 
	shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
	painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the 
	right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
	slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.

	Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though 
	unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
	We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
	swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
	in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
	As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow 
	and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
	in a paisley design.

	Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
	the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
	ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
	ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
	pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
	Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
	no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
	eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.

	The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
	AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
	about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
	and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
	casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
	laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
	US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out 
	with AUTOMATIC FIRE.

	Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
	screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
	appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
	we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
	Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
	feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
	savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
	they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
	They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
	bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
	They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
	as they move.

	The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
	mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.

	We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
	running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
	only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
	painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
	FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
	and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
	around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
	are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
	frightened.

	An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
	on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
	TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
	dead.

	OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
	Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
	stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
	with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
	and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
	and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
	bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
	electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :


		MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW


	2  TITLE SEQUENCE

	The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, 
	growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
	transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
	look at, like the sun itself.

	Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
	again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
	is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
	cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
	distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
	stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
	MUSIC  now.

	We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
	as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
	close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
	CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
	Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like
	shapes of :


	3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY

	The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
	cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

	It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
	bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
	cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
	head of a large American Corporation, and this is his
	party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
	catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
	smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
	paint. Charlie is going on and on :

				CHARLIE
		... It's crazy -- sugar is up to
		200 dollars a ton -- sugar !

				LAWYER
		What about oil ?

				CHARLIE
		Food, oil --look, let me show you
		something. This is the economy of
		the United States in two years --

	He takes a newspaper, draws a circle.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		This is West Germany.
			(he draws another,
			 bigger circle)
		This is Japan.
			(another , bigger)
		This is Italy.
			(a dot)
		This is Iran.
			(a very big circle)
		And this is Saudi Arabia... In
		two years ?
			(a gigantic circle)
		Do you understand ?

				ACCOUNTANT
		What's to prevent it ?

				CHARLIE
		Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
		I didn't build a two-billion-dollar
		company in the last twenty years
		by doing nothing. We can protect
		our interests.
			(pause, for a drink)
		We are still the most powerful
		nation in the world. Militarily.

	He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		You know bodyguard; he was a
		captain in Viet Nam. You talk to
		him, except he won't talk. This
		kind of man can kill you with his
		pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.

	The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		Carries a attache case at all
		times. You know what's in it ?
			(another sip)
		An Ingram Machine pistol.

	Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a
	NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

		CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.)
	I don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit. You can kill
	neither should this country.			with the ridge of your
	If we're strong, we should			hand to the throat; you
	protect our interests, and			can crush a skull with
	we should have the respect			your knee... but you
	of the world, even if it				can't kill anybody with
	takes another war.				your pinky.

	The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :
	Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the
	good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The attache case has been empty
		for three years, but it makes him
		safe to think there's a machine
		pistol in it.

		I don't like automatic weapons.
		They jam.

		I saw a friend of mine get
		ripped open because he flicked his
		M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
		How much money did the contractors
		make on the M-16 ?

	Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some
	reading, flirting, drinking.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		He likes to hear stories about Nam.
		I tell him I can't; they're not
		cleared. The truth is he wouldn't
		understand.

	We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the
	opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We 
	MOVE CLOSER.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There's no way I can tell them...
		what really happened over there.

		I wouldn't've believed it if
		someone'd told me.

	We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips
	from a beer, but we cannot see his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There was only one part that
		mattered -- for me, anyway. I
		don't even know if I remember
		all of it. I can't remember
		how it ended, exactly -- because
		when it ended I was insane.

							DISSOLVE TO :

	4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY

	A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and
	shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.
	Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.
	WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed
	by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his
	shoes and sell him things.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		But I know how it started
		for me -- I was on R. and R.
		in Saigon; my first time south
		of the DMZ in three months. I
		wasn't sure, but I thought this
		guy was following me.

	Willard looks back.


	5  HIS VIEW

	an American CIVILIAN.


	6  MED. VIEW

	Willard ducks into a bar.


	7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY

	Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few
	tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly
	crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly
	past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching
	sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

	An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of
	drinks and approaches Willard's table.

				CAPTAIN
		How about a drink ?

				WILLARD
		Sure, thanks.

	He sits down at the table with the drinks.

				CAPTAIN
		Winning the war by yourself.

				WILLARD
			(he calls for the waiter)
		Part.

				CAPTAIN
		Which part is that ?

				WILLARD
		My part.
			(TO THE WAITER)
		Beer, with ice and water.

	   
				CAPTAIN
		That's good gin.

				WILLARD
		I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.

				CAPTAIN
		Delta ?

				WILLARD
		No.

				CAPTAIN
		North ?

				WILLARD
		Yeah. Way north.

				CAPTAIN
		What unit were you with ?

				WILLARD
		None.

				CAPTAIN
		Rangers, eh?

				WILLARD
		Sort of.

	The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over
	his shoulder.

				CAPTAIN
		Were you Longe Range Recon --

				WILLARD
		No -- I worked too far north for
		LRRP.

	He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the
	Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard
	notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,
	then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.

				CAPTAIN
		That's quite an array of ribbons...

				WILLARD
		Let's talk about you.

				CAPTAIN
		I was an FO for the 25th.

				WILLARD
		Tracks ?

				CAPTAIN
		Yeah.

				WILLARD
		Fat. That's real fat.

				CAPTAIN
		Sometimes.

				WILLARD
		At least you always have enough
		water. How many gallons does
		each one of those damn things
		carry ?

				CAPTAIN
		Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

				WILLARD
		You know, I can remember once,
		getting back below the DMZ -- and
		the first Americans we ran into
		were a track squadron. I just
		couldn't believe how much water
		they had. We'd been chewing
		bamboo shoots for almost a week,
		and before that, for two weeks,
		we'd been drinking anything --
		rain water, river shit, stuff
		right out of the paddies. And
		there were these guys standing
		by their trucks spilling water
		all over. I could've killed them.
			(solemnly)
		I swear to God I would have, too,
		if ...

				CAPTAIN
		I didn't know we had units up
		there in North Vietnam.

				WILLARD
		We do.

				CAPTAIN
		How long were you up there ?

				WILLARD
		A long time.

				CAPTAIN
		A year ? Waiter another beer.

				WILLARD
		I go up on missions. Listen
		Captain, buy me all the beer
		you want, but you better tell
		that asshole over there you're
		not going to find out anymore
		about me.

	Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the
	Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.
	He rises and comes over to the bar.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		What do you want ?

				CIVILIAN
			(indicating the Army jeep)
		If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon
		Group, we'd like you to come with
		us.

				WILLARD
		Whose orders ?

				CAPTAIN
		Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th
		A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --
		Com-Sec -- Intelligence --
		Nha Trang.

				WILLARD
		Who are you ?

				CIVILIAN
		The agency.

	Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks
	roght out toward the jeep without saying another word.
	The Civilian follows.


	8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

	A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle
	before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed
	wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
	fortified, concealed compound.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		They took me to some place outside
		Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
		for all operations in South East Asia.
		I'd worked for Intelligence before --

	Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A
	large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground
	corridor -- they enter.


	9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM

	A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to
	attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange
	reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic
	maps and filled with smoke.

	The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
	and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly
	reclaiming it.

				WILLARD
		Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
		reporting as ordered, sir.

				COLONEL (O.S.)
		Okay, Willard, sit down.

	Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
	bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks
	and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL
	puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind
	him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.

				COLONEL
		Have you ever seen this officer
		before, Captain Willard ?

	He points to the Major.

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		This gentleman or myself ?

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		I believe on your last job you
		executed a tax collector in Kontum,
		is that right ?

				WILLARD
		I am not presently disposed to
		discuss that, sir.

				MAJOR
		Very good.

	He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The
	Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.

				COLONEL
		You know much about about Special Forces;
		Green Berets, Captain ?

				WILLARD
		I've worked with them on occasions
		and I saw the movie , sir.

	The officer smiles at this.

				COLONEL
		Then you can appreciate Command's
		concern over their -- shall we say
		'erratic' methods of operation.
			(pause)
		I have never favored elite units,
		Captain, including your paratroopers
		or whatever. Just because a man
		jumps out of an airplane or wears
		a silly hat doesn't give him any
		priviliges in my book -- not in
		this man's army.

				MAJOR
		We didn't need 'em in Korea --
		no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
		and an M-1 Garand, none of this
		fancy crap -- no sir.

				CIVILIAN
			(stopping him)
		Major.

				COLONEL
		We have Special Forces A
		detachments all along the
		Cambodian border. Two here and
		another one here -- twelve or
		fourteen Americans -- pretty
		much on their own; they train
		and motivate Montagnard natives;
		pick their own operations. If
		they need something, they call 
		for it, and get it within
		reason. What we're concerned
		with is here.


	10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP

				COLONEL
		The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
		It was originally a larger base,
		built up along the river in an
		old Cambodian fortress.
	
		The area has been relatively
		quiet for the past two years --
		but --


	11  MED VIEW

				COLONEL
		... Captain, we know something's
		going on up there -- Major --

	The Major looks at some papers in front of him.

				MAJOR
		Communications naturally dwindled
		with the lack of V.C. activity,
		this is routine, expected ... but
		six months ago communication
		virtually stopped.

				COLONEL
		About the same time -- large numbers
		of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
		began leaving the area -- this in
		itself is not unusual since these
		people have fought with the Rhade
		Tribe that lived in the area for
		centuries. But what is unusual is
		that we began to find Rhade refugees
		too -- in the same sampans as the
		M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
		of V.C. They've put up with war
		for twenty years -- but something
		is driving them out.

				MAJOR
		We communicate with the base
		infrequently. What they call for
		are air strikes, immediate --
		always at night. And we don't
		know what or who the air strikes
		are called on.

				WILLARD
		Who ?

				MAJOR
		You see, no one has really gone
		into this area and come back alive.

				WILLARD
		Why me ?

				MAJOR
		Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,
		Special Forces. We understand
		you knew him.

	He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				COLONEL
		He's commanding the detachment
		at Nu Mung Ba.

	The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,
	flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the
	AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target
	coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military.
	Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like
	someone dumb, except very fast.

				VOICE (ON TAPE)
		Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick --
		Mark flare -- affirmative damn --
		Immediate receive -- hearing
		automatic weapons fire man ...

	GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background.

				SECOND VOICE
		Blue Delta five
		This Big Rhine -- three
		Need that ordinance immediately
		Goddamn give it to me immediate
		Christ -- Big Rhino --
		Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn.

	A heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER
	-- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK
	MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE
	peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words.

				THIRD VOICE
		This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta.

				MAJOR
		That's Colonel Kurtz.

				KURTZ (V.O.)
		I want that napalm dropped in the
		trees -- spread it among the
		branches.

		We'll give you a flare -- an
		orange one -- bright orange.
			(STATIC)
		We'd also like some white phosporous,
		Blue Delta. White phosporous, give
		it to me.

	STATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off.

				WILLARD
		I only met Kurtz once.

				CIVILIAN
		Would he remember you ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				COLONEL
		What was your impression of him ?

	Willard shrugs.

				CIVILIAN
		You didn't like him.

				WILLARD
		Anyone got a cigarette.

	The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I thought he was a lame.

				COLONEL
		A lame ?

				WILLARD
		This is years ago, before he
		joined Special Forces, I guess.
		We had an argument.

				COLONEL
		About what ?

				WILLARD
		I don't know. He was a lame,
		that's all.

				COLONEL
		But why ?

				WILLARD
		He couldn't get through a
		sentence without all these
		big words; about why we kill.

				COLONEL
		Well, he's killing now.

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				CIVILIAN
		What does that mean ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
		believe he's capable of that.
		I just don't believe it.

				COLONEL
		It's got to be Kurtz.

				CIVILIAN
		The point is that Kurtz or
		somebody attacked a South
		Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three
		days ago. Last week a Recon
		helicopter was lost in the area --
		another took heavy damage --
		direct fire from their base
		camp.

				WILLARD
		Our Recon flight ?

				CIVILIAN
		Ours.

				WILLARD
		Touchy.

				CIVILIAN
		You can see, of course, the
		implications, if any of this --
		even rumours leaked out.

				WILLARD
		You want me to clean it up --
		simple and quiet.

				CIVILIAN
		Exactly -- you'll go up the
		Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --
		appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by
		accident, re-establish your
		acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,
		find out what's happened -- and
		why. Then terminate his command.

				WILLARD
		Terminate ?

				CIVILIAN
		Terminate with extreme prejudice.


	12  FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA

	A waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and
	divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms.

	A Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area.
	This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily
	armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple
	military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle-
	dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet,
	M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard.


	13  MED. VIEW

	We hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE.
			
				WILLARD (V.O.)
		I met the P.B.R. crew; they were
		pretty much all kids, except for
		Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's
		Mate Third Class L. Johnson --
		Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate
		Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef --
		Radio Operator Second Class T.
		Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.

				WILLARD
		Chief, try to keep out of where
		we're going -- Why we're goin' and
		what's gonna be the big surprise.

				CHIEF
		All right with me, I used to drive
		a taxi.

				WILLARD
		Let's go.

	The Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard
	and otherwise go about their work.

	The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from
	the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward
	twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards
	on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads
	to the ocean.

	14  FULL VIEW - STORMY SEA

	The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the
	top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another.


	15  MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF

	Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale.
	Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The
	Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs
	back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just
	stares ahead into space, swallowing.

	16  LONG SHOT - BOAT DUSK

	The dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds --
	the sea is calm again.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	17  VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST

	The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him.

				CHIEF
		The Delta closes off to us about
		ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll
		be able to pick up some supplies --
		bit I think there are only two
		points we can draw enough water
		to get into the Nung River. It's
		all Charlie's turf from there on
		out.

				WILLARD
		We're gonna have some help to
		get in the river. You know
		these waters, Chief ?

				CHIEF
		'Bout six months ago I took a man
		up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was
		regular Army too. Shot himself
		in the head. I brought his body 
		back down.

				WILLARD
		Shot himself. What for ?

				CHIEF
		Beats me -- the sun was too much
		for him, or the mud. Who knows ?

	Pause, looking at Willard.


	18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD

	Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow
	buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out
	and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There
	is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All
	the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up
	and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills
	beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all
	stand silently -- suddenly it stops.

				WILLARD
		Arch light.

				CHEF
		I hate that -- Every time I hear
		that noise something terrible 
		happens.

				CHIEF
		Anybody see some smoke ?

				CLEAN
		Too far inland.

				LANCE
		There they are.

	He points up to the sky.


	19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY

	Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE
	the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor
	trails streaming white against the dark blue sky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not
		till it's too late -- don't have
		to hit you neither, concussion'll
		do it for a quarter mile or better.
		Burst your ears -- suck the air
		outta your lungs.


	20  FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW

	They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned.
	He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He
	flips through the letters and other documents.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier on A detachment had
		letters from Kurtz' wife and the
		wives and families of his men.
		All asking where to send future
		mail, understanding the necessery
		silence due to the nature of
		their work -- None of the men had
		written home in half a year.

	Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting

	studying, examining a report.


	22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ

	Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his
	career as represented in the pictures in the dossier,
	as Willard reads :

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a
		dedicated and well-disciplined
		spirit. He is a fine officer,
		combining military efficiency --
		with a broad background in the
		Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ...

	Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the
	161st Petroleum Supply Group sign.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... He views his military career
		as the dedication of his talents
		to bringing our values and way of
		life to those darker, less
		fortunate areas in the world.

	A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... I feel Captain Kurtz' request
		for Special Forces training is
		highly unusual in regard to his
		past humanitarian concerns, and
		his somewhat liberal politics,
		though I can see no reason to
		deny it.

	A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam
	jungle. His face is blank and vacant.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... We feel Major Kurtz' need to
		bring a sense of Western culture
		to the backward peoples of these
		areas will be of use in
		accordance with our 'Vietnamization'
		programs ...

	MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just
	a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS.

	23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		One day later we came to an
		advanced staging area along the
		coast. This was our last chance
		to pick up supplies before
		approaching the mouth of the
		Nung River.
		 
	The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load-
	ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera-
	tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist."

	Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers --
	helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds
	advanced staging areas like the Americans.

	As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices
	something.

				LANCE
		Hey.

	They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water-
	skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at
	one another.


	24  VIEW ON THE DOCK

	The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings.

				CHIEF
		Lance -- I want you to go with the
		Captain an' get three extra drums
		of fuel and maybe scrounge some
		more 50 caliber.

				LANCE
		Yeah -- look at those uniforms.


	25  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and
	pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the
	airplane.

				CHIEF
		Poor bastards, have a long year
		to go.

	The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of
	Advanced Infantry Training to back them up.


	26  FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW

	They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill-
	ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard.

				SERGEANT
		I don't know anything about these
		papers, sir.

				WILLARD
		They're in order -- it's perfectly
		clean -- just check with ComSec-
		Intel like I said.

				SERGEANT
		Well, you know I don't have the
		priority to do that, sir. It
		says here not to contact Com-Sec-
		Int. Who's your commanding 
		officer ?

				WILLARD
		Right now -- I am.

				SERGEANT
		Well who the hell verifies that ?

				WILLARD
		I do.

	He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused.

				CHIEF
		No shit -- what's all the activity
		for around here ?

				SERGEANT
		The show --

				WILLARD
		What show ?

				SERGEANT
		Big show in the parade grounds
		this noon -- some boss stuff --

				WILLARD
		This -- Bob Hope or the like --

				SERGEANT
		No sir, I think -- this'll be a
		little bit different --

				CHIEF
		Where's it gonna be ?

	He points --


	27  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL

	A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is
	surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and
	garnished with concertina wire. It is empty --

							DISSOLVE TO :


	28  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the
	wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some
	of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in
	the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to
	see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far
	surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,
	or child-molester. To counter their need of course are
	the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing
	this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the
	lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep-
	herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so
	armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire.


	29 FORWARD AREA

	jammed in the crowd

				CHEF
		It's really too much -- I mean
		I've collected every picture of
		her since she was Miss December.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- you can really get hung
		up on them like the cat in the
		Delta.

				CHIEF
		What cat  ?

				CLEAN
		One that went up for murder -- he
		was an Army Sergeant.

				CHIEF
		I never heard about that.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy
		mag, man -- I mean like he was there
		when it arrived -- He just knew.

				CHEF
		So what happened ?

				CLEAN
		He was working A.R.V.N. patrols
		and had one a them little cocky
		gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,
		the Lieutenant took his new Playboy
		one day, sat on the end of the dock,
		and wouldn't give it back.

				CHEF
		Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

				CLEAN
		Then went too far -- he sat
		there and starts mutilating the
		centerfold. Poking pins in her an'
		all that. Sergeant says, don't do
		her like that. You leave your
		shitty little hands off that girl.
		Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in
		Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't
		do that again. You'll wish you
		hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked
		his iron to rock and roll and gave
		the little zero a long burst
		through the Playboy mag. Man, it
		blew him clean off the dock --
		Hell, just the magazine was floatin'
		there all full of holes.

				CHIEF
		They nail him for it bad ?

				CLEAN
		He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't
		give him no medals or nothing --

	In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND
	MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching.
	All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the
	pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment.
	On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large
	Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a
	strange silence descends over the men. The door of the
	copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets
	step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this
	abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He
	is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed
	impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal
	but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his
	presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely
	quiet the man.

	He walks over to the microphone.

				AGENT
		I'd like to say hello from all of
		us up here, to all of you out there.
		All of you who've worked so hard
		during Operation Brute Force --
		Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen
		-- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.
		And I want you to know that we feel
		proud of you and know how hard your
		job is. To prove it -- we've brought
		some entertainment we think you're
		gonna like: The Playmate of the Year
		and her two runners up !

	He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful
	sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start
	dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing
	"Suzy Q."


	30  MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN

	VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic
	manner -- smiling.

	The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some
	look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean
	cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental
	tenderness.

	Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement
	their need increases by the square.


	31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN

	They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the
	wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget
	-- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges
	forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,
	which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he
	has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke
	grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,
	then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black
	Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach
	it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The
	Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below.

	Such are the ways of war.

							CUT TO:


	32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY

	The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline.
	There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no
	boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days out of Hau Fat, there was
		nothing but us and the coastline.
		I felt like I had set off for
		the center of the earth...

	Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead.

				CHIEF
		Smoke !

				WILLARD
		Where ?

	They all turn. Chief points up the coast.


	33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE

	A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle.

				WILLARD
		Black smoke ... secondary burning.

	The Chief grabs field glasses.

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- fishing village --
		helicopters over there. Hueys,
		lots of 'em.

				WILLARD
		First Air Cavalry. They're the
		ones gonna get us into the River.


	34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE

	A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm
	trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts
	-- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the
	surf.


	35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW

	They wade through the water to the beach where they are
	met by a heavily armed group of men.

	Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning
	out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men.

	We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the
	Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it.


	36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with
	machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out-
	side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising
	a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters
	pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump
	from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,
	strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and
	neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE
	-- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.

	He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It
	is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He
	walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and
	with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle.
	His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line
		back about a hundred yards -- give
		me some room to breathe.

	A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off.


	37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	He was not quite prepared for this.


	38  VIEW ON KILGORE

	turning to his GUARDS

				KILGORE
		Bring me some cards.

				GUARD
		Sir ?

				KILGORE
		Body cards, you damn fool --
		cards !

	The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new
	packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other
	soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are
	well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual
	about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks
	up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance.

				WILLARD
			(formally)
		Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th
		Recon Group -- I carry priority
		papers from Com-Sec Intelligence
		11 Corp -- I believe you understand
		the nature of my mission.

				KILGORE
			(not looking up)
		Yeah -- Na Trang told me to
		expect you -- we'll see what we
		can do. Just stay out of my way
		till this is done, Captain.

	He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the
	deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides
	right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The
	others follow,


	39  TRACKING VIEW

	The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of
	devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore
	comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on
	it -- carefully picking out which card he uses.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		Six a spades -- eight a hearts --
		Isn't one worth a Jack in this
		whole place.

	The Colonel goes on about this business.


	40  TRACKING ON KILGORE

	moving through the corpses, dropping the cards.

	On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers
	something to him. He stops.

				KILGORE
		What ? Here. You sure?

	The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down
	the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the
	young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t
	Willard.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's your name, sailor ?

				LANCE
		Gunner's Mate, Third Class --
		L. Johnson, sir.

				KILGORE
		Lance Johnson? The surfer?

				LANCE
		That's right, sir.

	Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand.

				KILGORE
		It's an honor to meet you Lance.
		I've admired your nose-riding for
		years -- I like your cutback, too.
		I think you have the best cutback
		there is.

				LANCE
		Thank you, sir.

				KILGORE
		You can cut out the sir, Lance --
		I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy
		foot.


	41 VIEW ON WILLARD

	His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the
	background.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
		This is Mike from San Diego and
		Johnny from Malibu -- they're good
		solid surfers -- none of us are
		anywhere near your class, though.

	Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks.

				WILLARD
		My orders are from Com-Sec
		Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --

				KILGORE
		Just hold up a second, Captain --
		I'll get to you soon enough --
		We've got things to do here.

	Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on
	Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in-
	discriminately on the bodies as they talk.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we do a lot of surfing around
		here. Like to finish up operations
		early and fly down to Vung Tau for
		the evening glass. Have you ever
		surfed the point at Vung Tau? I
		liked the beach breaks around Na
		Trang a lot -- good lefts.

	He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five
	bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we keep three boards in my
		Command Huey at all times. You
		never can tell when you're gonna
		run into something good. I got a
		guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict
		a swell two days in advance. We
		try to work it in.

	He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who
	has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in
	horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw
		one.

	He puts the card in the gaping mouth.


	42  CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG

	We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead
	Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card
	has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above
	it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE.

				KILGORE
		Where've you been riding, Lance?

				LANCE
		I haven't surfed since I got here.

				KILGORE
		That's terrible -- we'll change 
		that -- I'd like to see you work --
		I've always liked your cutback;
		got a hell of a left turn, too.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	43  EXT. THE HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT

	Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by
	a table set up in front of the command copter.

	Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil
	drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY
	BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell you wanna go up
		to Nu Mung Ba for?

				WILLARD
		I got bored in Saigon.

				KILGORE
		What's the furthest you been
		in?

				WILLARD
		Haiphong.

				KILGORE
		Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?

				WILLARD
		No. Walked.

				KILGORE
		What'd you do for supplies?

				WILLARD
			(he shrugs)
		Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --
		they put out caches.

				KILGORE
		Can you trust them?

				WILLARD
		No. They put out two or three
		for every one I needed. When
		you get to the one you'll use,
		you just stake it out. If
		something feels wrong, you just
		pass it up. On one mission, I
		had to pass up three and ended
		up living on rats and chocolate
		 bars.

				KILGORE
		Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter
		Kurtz commanded a Green Beret
		detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

				WILLARD
		When did you hear?

				KILGORE
		'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz
		still alive?

				WILLARD
		Who knows.

				KILGORE
		Seems to me he got himself
		fragged. i heard some grunt
		rolled a grenade in his tent.
		Maybe a rumor. Helluva man --
		remarkable officer. Walter
		Kurtz woulda been a General
		some day. General of the Army.
		Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs
		of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		Don't you agree?

				WILLARD
		He musta changed !
			(pointing to the map)
		I got to get into the Nung
		River, here or here.

				KILGORE
		That village you're pointing at
		is kinda hairy.

				WILLARD
		Hairy ?

				KILGORE
		I mean it's hairy -- they got some
		pretty heavy ordnance, boy --
		I've lost a few recon ships in
		there now and again.

				WILLARD
		So? I heard you had a good bunch
		of killers here.

				KILGORE
		And I don't intend to get some of
		them chewed up just to get your
		tub put in the mouth of the
		goddman Nung River. You say you
		don't know Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		You talk like him. I don't
		mind taking casualties,
		Captain, but I like to keep
		my ratio ten to one in this
		unit -- ten Cong to one.

				WILLARD
		You'll find enough Cong up there.

				KILGORE
		What about this point here?

	He puts his finger on the map.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's the name of that goddamn
		village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook
		names all sound the same.

	He motions to one of his surfers.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Mike, you know anything about
		the point at Vin Drip Drop?

				MIKE
		Boss left.

				KILGORE
		What do you mean?

				MIKE
		It's really long left slide,
		breaks on the short side of the
		point -- catches a south swell.

				LANCE
		Nice.

	Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell didn't you tell me
		about that place -- a good left.
			(to Willard)
		There aren't any good left slides
		in this whole, shitty country.
		It's all goddamn beach break.

				MIKE
		It's hairy ,though. That's
		where we lost McDonnel -- they
		shot the hell out of us. It's
		Charlie's point.

				KILGORE
		How big it is?

				MIKE
		Six to eight feet.

	Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		A six-foot left.

	Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea.

				LANCE
		Boss. What's the wind like.

				MIKE
		Light off shore -- really hollow.

				WILLARD
		We could go in tomorrow at dawn
		-- there's always off-shore wind
		in the morning.

				CHIEF
		The draft of that river might be
		too shallow on the point.

				KILGORE
		Hell, we'll pick your boat up and
		lay it down like a baby, right
		where you want it. This is the
		Cav boy -- airmobile. I can
		take that point and hold it as
		long as I like -- and you can
		get anywhere you want up that
		river that suits you, Captain.
		Hell, a six foot left.
			(he turns to an advisor)
		You take a gunship back to division
		-- Mike, take Lance with you -- let
		him pick out a board, and bring me
		my Yater Spoon -- the eight six.

				TOM
		I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's --

				KILGORE
			(hard)
		What is it?

				TOM
		Well, I mean it's hairy in there
		-- it's Charlie's point.

	Kilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated.

				WILLARD
		Charlie don't surf.

	CLOSE SHOTS of the three surfboards strapped below the

	And finally, CLOSE SHOTS of the men -- nervous, excited
	very few of them really scared -- they fondle their

	claymore mines; plastic explosives cord; flame-throwers;
	M-60 machine guns; expandable rocket launchers; mortars
	and bayonets.


	50  INT. COMMAND COPTER

		We'll come in low out of the rising

	Sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being

	Suddenly we HEAR the distant MUSIC -- Everyone stops;

	COPTERS almost drown them out. The gunner FIRES
	frantically -- COPTERS are ROARING over -- GUNFIRE
	rips around. The gunner is blown away.


	62  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	as the ship he is in swoops down, its MACHINE GUNS
	FIRING into the village.


	63  MED. SHOT - SWOOPING COPTER

	The Pilot leans out and SHOOTS a charging V.C. in the
	head with his .38, then ducks back in.

				CO-PILOT
		We're down, Eagle Thrust -- we're
		hit. We got a hot L.Z. here.

	BULLETS RIP through the plexiglass. The Pilot FIRES
	back.

				CO-PILOT
			(continuing)
		Hell of a hot L.Z. Need immediate
		air strike on the tree line, Eagle
		Thrust.


	64  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, KILGORE,
	       OTHERS

	Kilgore has R.T. equipment -- he leans out near the
	door gunner.

				KILGORE
		Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels Four
		-- bring it in on along tree line
		and huts.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke
		Six -- we'll need green smoke --
		suggest you have the FAC mark it.

				KILGORE
		Haven't got time, Hell's Angels --
		lay it right up the tree line.


	65  FULL SHOT - JET SQUADRON

	Four F-4H Phantoms peel off and streak toward the
	coast.


	66  INT. COMMAND COPTER - VIEW ON WILLARD AND KILGORE

				KILGORE
		Fucking savages.
			
				WILLARD
		Who?
	
				KILGORE
		The enemy. Who else?


	67  HELICOPTER'S POV - THE JETS

	The jets streak by below laying in huge gobs of orange
	napalm along the trees.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
			(on radio)
		Very good, Hell's Angels -- suggest
		you follow with cannon fire.


	68  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT

	They circle the battle.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		This is Baker Delta Four --
		Captain hit bad -- need dust-off.
		Receiving heavy automatic weapons
		fire from huts about thirty yards
		to our left.

				KILGORE
		Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four
		-- hold -- we're right over you.

	He turns to door gunner.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Right along the doors, boy.

	The gunner FIRES leaning out --

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Fine... fine... little higher.
		Through the roof; yeah, that's
		good.

	He leans back in.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Didn't anybody bring me any
		bombs, grenades, claymores or
		anything?

				LIEUTENANT
		You didn't tell me to, sir.

				KILGORE
			(grumbling)
		You shoulda known.

	Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass
	SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore
	is thrown down where he hangs on.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?

				WILLARD
		Automatic weapons flashes along
		those trees -- probably eleven
		millimeter guns and AK-47's.

				KILGORE
		The trees, eh...

	He grabs the R.T.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke
		Six. Join me in sparaying some
		trees.

				RADIO (V.O.)
		Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're
		even got some rockets left.

				KILGORE
		Take her in low, Lieutenant.


	69  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, HELICOPTERS

	The two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast
	the trees with ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS and GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

	Other copters join -- The V.C. break and run through
	the rice paddies in the f.g. -- BULLETS EXPLODING around
	them -- they scream and fall FIRING back.


	70 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

	Kilgore looks out as three V.C. break and run through
	the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows
	them -- the door gunner swings out and BLASTS two of
	them into the mud. He takes a bead on the third.

				KILGORE
		Hold it, boy.

	He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings
	back inside.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Take her up to 300 feet,
		Lieutenant.

	They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for
	all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who
	steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's
	harness.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Rifle.

	A hand passes him a M-16.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; hard)
		My rifle, soldier.

	There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300
	Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl
	inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and
	opens the bolt.


	71  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Amazed at these proceedings.


	72  VIEW ON KILGORE

	as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets
	into the sling and slams the bolt shut.


	73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C.

	He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud.
	The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him
	on the mud. He turns and FIRES with a pistol.


	74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

	Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes
	careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy.
	Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent
	cartridge out the door. He hands Weatherby back
	into the copter.


	75  VIEW ON WILLARD

	The gaudy rifle passed by him.

				SOLDIER  (O.S.)
		That's 27, sir.

				WILLARD
		Anyone got a card?

	Somebody hands Willard the deck. He takes a card and
	flips it out of the copter, never lifting his gaze from
	Kilgore.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	76  FULL SHOT - BATTLEFIELD - THE CAV, V.C.

	Americans run through the hooches FIRING and throwing
	GRENADES. Helicopters swoop overhead -- JETS ROAR by
	-- Uniformed N.V.A. regulars burst from a tunnel en-
	trance and charge the Americans. The SHOOTING is at
	point blank range -- automatic, as the V.C. are cut
	down.


	77  INT. COMMAND COPTER - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE, ETC.

	Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle-
	field. He has the R.T.

	He leans back, deliberately avoiding Willard to speak
	to Lance.

				KILGORE
		The L.Z.'s cooling off fast --
		we'll move in another company
		an' then we'll own it.
			(he laughs to himself)
		Charlie's point.

	He looks out toward the ocean.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Good swell.

				LANCE
		What, sir?

				KILGORE
		I said it's a good swell -- hell
		of a good swell 'bout six feet.
		Let's get a look at it.

	Lance looks at Willard and then agrees.


	78  FULL SHOT - COPTER, SURF

	The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply
	and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in  low
	over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up
	green wall as if surfing it. They tip up over and up
	at the last minute as the wave breaks.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	79  FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS

	Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A.
	regular troops outside a burning hut. GUNFIRE is
	DISTANT and sporadic -- an occasional MORTAR round
	SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a
	southern accent and the prisoners are marched away.
	Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons
	emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three
	Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind.
	The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM
	over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another
	Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's. The
	doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and
	out steps Kilgore and Lance. From the other copter
	are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the
	P.B.R. crew. Willard follows.


	80  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	They stride out across the debris-strewn beach. Kilgore
	stands majestically on the point watching the waves. A
	SHELL SCREAMS overhead.

				SOLDIER
		Incoming !

	They all dive, except Kilgore. He is watching a big set
	-- the SHELL EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards
	away, sending up a huge geyser of spray. Kilgore is
	unmoved.

				KILGORE
		Look at that.

	They look.

				LANCE
		This  L.Z. is still pretty hot,
		sir, maybe we oughta stand
		somewhere else.

	Kilgore pays him no mention.

				WILLARD
		I'm waiting for the fucking boat,
		Colonel.

				KILGORE
			(without looking)
		It'll get here, soldier.

	He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the
	sand.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Change.

				MIKE
		Wh -- what?

				KILGORE
		Change -- get out there -- I
		want'a see if it's ridable --
		change.

				MIKE
		It's still pretty hairy, sir.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		You want'a surf, soldier?

	He nods yes meakly.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		That's good, boy, because it's
		either surf or fight.

	They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an M-1 from
	one of the guards. They all think he's going to
	shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's
		all.

	He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The
	Colonel walks over.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		You think that section on the
		 point is ridable, Lance?

				LANCE
		I think we ought to wait for
		the tide to come in.

	A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except
	for Kilgore. It EXPLODES throwing sand through the
	air. Kilgore leans down yelling over the NOISE.

				KILGORE
		Doesn't happen for six hours.

	Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto
	his helmet.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The tide -- doesn't come in for
		six hours.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	81  FULL SHOT - SURF - MIKE AND JOHNNY

	They walk through shallows carrying brightly
	colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM
	overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by
	carrying out wounded.

	They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's
	shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned
	on the boards along the word "Airmobile". They edge
	into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak.


	82  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the
	beautiful waves breaking beyond them.

	83  CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE

	They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing
	hard and constantly looking around scared out of their
	minds.


	84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE

	Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance
	kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole.

				KILGORE
		They far enough?

				LANCE
		Sure -- fine --

	Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from
	a waiting lackey.

				KILGORE
			(through megaphone)
		That's far enough -- pick one
		up and come on in --


	85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS

	They line themselves up on the point. A good set is
	building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off
	-- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a
	tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking
	around frantically.


	86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE

	Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach.
	Lance looks over at Willard.

				LANCE
			(to himself)
		Maybe he'll get tubed.

				WILLARD
		What?

				LANCE
		Maybe he'll get inside the tube --
		where -- where they can't see him.

	A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in.
	
				WILLARD
		Incoming !

	Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS
	SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore
	looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water
	are HEARD.

				KILGORE
		Son of a bitch.

	Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror.


	87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down
	on the waves.


	88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE

				LANCE
			(to himself)
		The tragedy of this war is a
		dead surfer.

	Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy,
	too.

				WILLARD
		What's that?

				LANCE
		Just something I read in the
		Free Press.

				KILGORE
		They just missed a good set --
		the chicken shits !

	Lance looks up.


	89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS

	They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke
	hangs over the water.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
			(megaphone)
		Try it again, you little bastards.


	90  BACK TO SCENE

	He turns to Willard.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		I´m not afraid to surf this place.
		I'll surf this place.


	91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE

	He turns, glowering to his lackeys.

				KILGORE
		Bring that R.T., soldier.

	He grabs it.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels --
		Goddamit, I want that treeline
		bombed -- yeah -- napalm --
		gimme some napalm -- son of a
		bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z.
		or C.B.U.'s if you got any of
		them -- just bomb 'em into the
		Stone Age, boy.

	He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO
	WHISTLES over -- everyone drops.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Son of a bitch.

	As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore
	raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the
	general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un-
	intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his
	rifle turning to Lance --

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		We'll have this place cleaned up
		and ready for us in a jiffy, boy.
		Don't you worry.

	He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead.



	92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS

	A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us --
	The P.B.R. hangs below it.

	The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight
	alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending
	copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows.
	The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists
	-- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still
	going on around them. They all look up as a wadge
	of PHANTOMS streak over low and peel off one by one to
	begin their bombing run.


	93  FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE

	Phantoms RAKE the trees with 20 mm CANNONS -- FIRE five
	inch ROCKETS in salvo -- "Bull Pup" MISSILES -- drop
	H.E. (high explosives) and C.B.U's (Cluster Bomb Units)
	and finally an immense amount of NAPALM.


	94  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean
	and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so-
	often when an EXPLOSION hits nearby. The boat begins
	to back out of the shallows. The EXPLOSIONS of NAPALM
	are reflected on their faces; the ROAR of the FIRE drowns
	out almost everything.

				CHIEF
		Forget that extra drum -- it's
		too damn hot.

				CLEAN
		Clear on starboard -- Where's
		Lance an' the Captain?

				CHIEF
		I saw that Colonel's Huey on the
		point --

	Two HELICOPTERS SCREAM over FIRING ROCKETS.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		Let's just get outta here.


	95  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - KILGORE, WILLARD , LANCE,
	       OTHERS

	Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses --
	smoke drifts over.

	Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another
	direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is
	drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the
	deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the
	tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are
	making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-
	ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance
	goes further downriver through the black smoke and there
	merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.

				WILLARD
			(to Lance)
		Look. There it is; the boat.

	Lance looks over --  a tremendous relief on his face. But
	still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark
	against the sky. Willard silently motions Lance toward
	the boat.

				LANCE
			(whispers)
		He'll kill us.

				WILLARD
		He can't kill us.
			(realizing as he says it)
		We're on his side.

	Kilgore FIRES another clip at the tree line, and then
	strides back without looking at them.

				KILGORE
			(almost to himself)
		You smell that.
			(louder)
		You smell that?

				LANCE
		What?

				KILGORE
		Napalm, boy -- nothing else in
		the world smells like that --

	They reflect the glow from the burning trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; nostalgically)
		I love the smell of napalm in
		the morning. 

		One time we had a hill bombed
		for 12 hours. I walked up it
		when it was all over; we didn't
		find one of 'em ... not one
		stinking gook body. They
		slipped out in the night -- but
		the smell -- that gasoline smell
		-- the whole hill -- it smelled
		like ...
			(pause)
		victory...

	He looks off nostalgically.

				WILLARD
		You know, some day this war's
		gonna end..

				KILGORE
			(sadly)
		Yes, I know.

	Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his
	hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts
	them up in the air.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The wind --

				LANCE
		What?

	Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases.

				KILGORE
			(rising maniacally)
		Feel it -- it's the wind -- it's
		blowing on shore -- It's on shore !

	He leans down and practically grabs Lance.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; screaming)
		It's gonna blow this place out.
		It's gonna ruin it ...

				WILLARD
		The kid can't ride sloppy waves.

	They turn and stare out to sea.


	96  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back
	over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange
	wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing
	the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their
	boards, overjoyed.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		The kid can't stand sloppy waves.


	97  MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD

				WILLARD
		You don't expect this kid to
		ride that crap, do you? He's
		a goddamn artist, he needs
		something to work with...

	Slapping Lance on the shoulder.

				LANCE
		Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !

				KILGORE
			(apologetically)
		Yeah -- yeah, I can understand
		how you feel.

	He turns toward the trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		It's the napalm -- it's causing
		the wind -- ruining my perfect
		left.

	He staggers off toward the trees followed by his
	guards and other lackeys.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; mumbling)
		The napalm -- ruin -- napalm
		my perfect left -- my perfect
		left point break -- napalm --

	Lance motions with his eyes to Willard.


	98  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and
	crew waiting and yelling.


	99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE

				WILLARD
		Are you finished surfing?

				LANCE
		Yeah... thanks.

				WILLARD
		Want to say goodbye to the
		Colonel?

				LANCE
		Nah.

				WILLARD
		Then let's get the hell out of
		here.

	They break and run like hell toward the boat in the
	distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are
	cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some-
	thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of
	equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards
	-- Willard looks at them.

				LANCE
		No -- no, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Which one's the Colonel's?

				LANCE
		The Yater -- the clear one
		with the thin stringer.

	Willard glances over to it with determination. There
	is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the
	board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		Incoming ! Incoming -- son of
		a bitch.

	The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach
	toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the
	surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand.
	Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips 
	a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the
	board.

				WILLARD
			(calm)
		This one , Lance?

				LANCE
		Yeah, Jesus Christ !

	Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the
	board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat,
	through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr.
	Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and
	relieved.

				CLEAN
		What'd you that for?

				WILLARD
		When I was a kid I, never had
		a Yater spoon.

	Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount.
	The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF
	toward the deeper water of the river -- the board
	clearly visible on the stern.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R

	The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed.
	It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy
	fire.


	101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW

	They all are in full battle positions -- their twin
	fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled
	banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches
	against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready.
	Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back
	from his forward turret.

				LANCE
			(yelling)
		Maybe we better stay in under
		the trees till dark -- we got
		his Yater.

				WILLARD
		He didn't look like he'd take
		that sitting down.

	They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Let's put some distance between
		us and Charlie.

	The Chief nods.

				CHIEF
		Lance ---
	
				LANCE
		Yeah.

				CHIEF
		Why don't you roll us a big
		joint? I think the Captain'd
		like that.

	They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful
	pause, Willard smiles:

				WILLARD
		Take one a mine --

	He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge
	cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights
	up.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	102  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R.

	It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT

	The boat is hidden under some trees along the river
	bank. The men wait tensely listening --

				LANCE
		You hear it again?

				WILLARD
		No -- I don't think so. But
		it'll be back. They were
		circling. It'll be back.

				LANCE
		You think he'd of shot us?

				WILLARD
		When?

				LANCE
		Any time -- us -- Americans.

	Lance looks over at Willard.

				WILLARD
		I don't think he´d of shot us on
		the beach but -- he'd of shot us
		if he saw me taking the board --

				LANCE
		A Yater spoon is hard to get --
		especially here.

				WILLARD
		He's a man who knows what he 
		wants -- he does know what he wants.

				CHEF
		Can I go get those mangos now?

				CHIEF
		I'll go with you in a while --
		judt hold tight awhile --

				LANCE
		Captain -- that was all true
		about the rats and chocolate
		and stuff?

				WILLARD
		Sure.

				LANCE
		And you could just tell when
		the supplies were booby trapped?

				WILLARD
		It's a feeling you get in the
		jungle. When you get good, you
		can find a track and tell not
		only how many they are, but
		their morale, how far they're
		going, whether they're near
		their camp, the weapons they're
		carrying.

				CLEAN
		How can you tell their weapons..
		an' how far they're going?

	Willard smiles.

				WILLARD
		Mostly from the imprints when they
		put them down to rest. their morale
		from the way they drag their feet,
		or the joints that may be lying
		around. If they're near a base
		camp, they wouldn't be conserving
		food; they'll be throwing it away
		half-eaten. If the branches aren't
		broken, their weapons are slung.
		But all this is just technique..
		There's a feeling you get after a
		while, that's what's important.
		I was going through a village once.
		I was looking for a certain party.
		I took off my boots, and walked
		into each hut. It was midnight.
		I went into three like that and
		suddenly I realized I´d gone into
		each hut the same way -- standing
		up -- so the next one I went in on
		my belly. An RPD burst took out
		the door a bit above my head.
			(he shrugs)
		Things like that.

	A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted --
	They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the
	distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable
	language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the
	ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead.

		I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,
		boy -- I just want the board
		back -- You can understand --
		It was one of my best -- You
		know how hard it is to get a
		board you like, boy. I'm not
		gonna hurt or harm you --
		Just leave it where I can find
		it --

	The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same
	speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise
	ceases.

				CLEAN
		Jesus -- that guy's too damn
		much.

				CHIEF
		I wonder if that was the same
		copter.

				WILLARD
		He's probably got 'em all over
		the river with that recording.
		We better move now while it's
		dark.

	Chef steps forward with a plastic basket.

				CHIEF
		Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take
		Lance with you --

				WILLARD
		I'll go with him --

	They all look at him.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I wanta get my feet on solid land
		once in awhile --

	He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side.


	104  MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT

	They cautiously walk through the underbrush.

				WILLARD
		Chef.

				CHEF
		Yes, sir --

				WILLARD
		Why they call you that?

				CHEF
		Call me what, sir?

				WILLARD
		Chef -- is that 'cause you like
		mangoes an' stuff?

				CHEF
		No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir
		-- I'm a sauciere --

				WILLARD
		A sauciere --
	
				CHEF
		That's right, sir -- I come from
		New Orleans -- I was raised to
		be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.
		We specialize in sauces; my whole
		family. It's what we do. I was
		supposed to go to Paris and study
		at the Escoffier School; I was
		saving the money. They called
		me for my physical so I figured
		the Navy had better food.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing out here?

				CHEF
		Cook school -- that did it.

				WILLARD
		How?

				CHEF
		They lined us all up in front of
		a hundred yards of prime rib --
		magnificent meat, beautifully
		marbled.. Then they started
		throwing it in these big
		cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
		I looked in, an' it was turning
		gray. I couldn't stand it. I
		went into radio school.

	They move into a slight clearing.

				WILLARD
			(whispering)
		-- quiet --

	Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges-
	tures that he heard something; he points.


	105  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE

	PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef.

				WILLARD
			(silent)
		There...

	He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover
	the spot. A few yards from them they hear something
	move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They
	walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns
	at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is
	cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There
	is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles.  He
	and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking
	the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand
	gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move
	stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the
	hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,
	and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket
	noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges
	out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to
	point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he
	wants. He makes another command and they rush the
	trapped enemy.


	106  MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF

	Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds
	down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and
	from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats
	FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds
	almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at
	them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly,
	emptying their clips.

				CHEF
		It's a motherfucking tiger --
		goddamn...

	He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a
	man can be.

				CHEF
			(continuing; screaming)
		Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger --
		motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh --

	Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of
	the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared
	out of his head as well.


	107  FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW

	They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into
	the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws
	his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it.

				CHEF
			(hysterical)
		Ohhhh -- tiger ! Oh goddamn !
		It's a tiger ! Jesus Christ !
		Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh.

	The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is
	unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around
	the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the
	jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night.

				LANCE
		What's this tiger shit?

				WILLARD
		No shit... I think I shot the
		hell out of him.

				LANCE
		You think?

				WILLARD
		I wasn´t looking.. I was running.

				CLEAN
		Was a big tiger -- no shit?

				WILLARD
		Who stopped to measure him -- let's
		get the hell out of here.

				CHEF
		A motherfucking tiger -- I could've
		been killed.

	The ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great
	speed.

				CHIEF
		You forgot the mangoes, didn't
		you?

				CHEF
		Mangoes? There as a fucking
		tiger in the woods -- I could've
		been eaten alive. I'm never
		going into that jungle again.
		I gotta remember never get out of
		the boat; never get outta the boat.

	They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE 
	NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		He was right, the Chef -- never
		go into the jungle, unless you're
		ready to go all the way.

	108  EXT. THE BOAT IN MARINA DEL RAY - NIGHT

	Willard, thinking, his BACK TO US. Suddenly, he turns
	around, and we SEE his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		What was in the jungle? What was
		there, waiting for me?

	He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating
	his face momentarily. There is something different about
	him; a maturity, a cool inner peace.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;
		was it Kurtz? He was just a name
		to me now; I couldn't remember a
		face, a voice -- he just didn't
		add up to me. all his liberal
		bullshit about the end of savagery
		-- and the role of our culture,
		our way of life...

	Willard looks toward the group of people on the boat --
	there is still some MUSIC. They talk and drink and laugh.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Our way of life -- I really
		started to look forward to
		meeting Kurtz again.

	114  VIEW ON WILLARD

	 Willard opens a letter from the packet.

	We can SEE it is a private correspondence -- feminine
	writing on the envelope.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier of A Dtachment
		contained letters from the families
		and wives of Kurtz' men There
		were letters from Kurtz' wife as
		well.


	115  CLOSE SHOT - ON THE LETTER

	It is addressed to Colonel Walter Kurtz -- in the corner
	is the return addess of Mrs. Colonel Walter Kurtz --
	Willard's hand fushes through the packet and comes up
	with apicture of a very attractive, thirty-five year
	old American Beauty... She is classically American.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Dearest Walt -- I have to confess
		something. I know how you feel
		about this, but I had to ask Bob

		just couldn't stand it anymore,
		not knowing where you are, whether
		you're alive or dead. I'm sorry
		Walt, I'm sorry I said that. Bob
		didn't tell me anything -- he said
		he couldn't -- I can't stand it

		stand it.

	Willard looks out at the jungle.

	Deep imppenetrable jungle -- dark and primeval forests
	pass by. The Rolling Stones CHANT on in the b.g.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		I have to take the kids to school
		every morning now -- carpools just
		never work out.

		Jeff came home with a black eye

		He wouldn't tell me what the fight

	117  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	He folds the letter up, files through some others quickly
	and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with
	a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was
	the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is
	addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is
	written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic-
	ular. It reads:

					Sell the house
					Sell the car
					Sell the kids
					Find someone else
					Forget it
					I'm never coming back
					Forget it --

	Various helicopters pads are SEEN, but only one heli-
	copter -- the H-34 painted with Playboy rabbits that
	brought the girls to Hau Fat. Several soldiers in rain-
	coats come out the dock as the P.B.R. pulls up.


	120  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, SOLDIERS

	Willard looks into some empty tents -- looks around the
	dreary muddy camp. Two soldiers pass.

				WILLARD 
		Soldier -- where'´s your C.O.?

				SOLDIER
		Stepped on a booby trap, sir --
		got blown all to hell --

				WILLARD 
		Well , who's in command here?

				VOICE (O.S.)
			(continuing)
		Over here, Captain --

	He turns to see the Hollywood Agent under the flap of a
	large tent so that he won't get wet. He wears the same
	clothes as before, but is much dirtier. He motions
	Willard into the tent.


	122  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, AGENT

	They duck inside -- it is dark and damp.

	On cots around astove sit the three playmates and the
	pilot. The nearest one, CATHY, a blonde, picks leeches
	out of her feet. The other two, TERRI and LYNDA, play
	cards with the helicopter pilot. Willard looks over 
	the situation.

				AGENT
		You came in on that boat, didn't
		you?

				WILLARD
		Yeah --

				AGENT
		Where are you headed?

				WILLARD 
		What's it matter? Get to the

		Oh -- I see -- Well, girls, this

				WILLARD 
		Captain Willard -- go ahead.

				AGENT
		Look -- we got in a little trouble
		-- they rudely took our helicopter
		for MedEvac work on this -- uh
		Operation Brute Force -- They just
		brought it back this morning.

				WILLARD 
		Yeah.

				AGENT
		Well I mean like they also took
		our fuel -- We've been here two
		days.

				WILLARD 
		Dreadful.

				AGENT
		Look -- the girls could get
		killed -- we're not supposed to
		be this close combat, I mean
		real combat.

				WILLARD 
		Well --

				AGENT
		We could use some fuel -- just a
		half drum -- just enough to get
		us out a here.

				WILLARD 
		We need all our fuel.

	He turns and starts to leave.

				AGENT
		But, Captain, think what these
		girls have done for the boys --
		think of how they've risked --

	Willard is almost out of the tent.

				TERRI
		Captain --

	He turns around.

				TERRI
			(continuing)
		It's really rough here -- Captain
		-- we're just not built for it --

	The Pilot laughs.

				PILOT
		That's rich --

				TERRI
		Do us a favor -- I'd do one for
		you -- if I could --

	Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans
	and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent
	takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others.

				AGENT
		Look -- you know who that is,
		Captain -- you know what she's
		saying -- you'll never see stuff
		that good outside of a magazine
		for the rest of your life.

				WILLARD 
		I'm not that fond of blondes --
		maybe I like brunettes --

				AGENT
		Take your pick -- they all like
		you -- I can tell --

				WILLARD
		I like all of them --

				AGENT
		Good -- like I said, take your 
		pick.

				WILLARD
		I said I like all of them.

				AGENT
		Now just a second -- I'm doing
		you a favor, buddy -- what're you
		trying to pull?

	Willard turns to leave again.

				WILLARD
		We need all our fuel anyway.

				AGENT
		Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight
		-- what I meant was we'd need a
		whole drum for that --

				WILLARD
		Sit down -- we'll talk about it.

	Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent
	to do likewise.

				AGENT
		What's there to talk about -- this
		whole thing disgusts me.

				WILLARD
		My men --

				AGENT
		What !

				WILLARD
		That's what there is to talk 
		about -- my man -- I take a good
		care of my men --

	The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening --
	the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself.

				AGENT
		You're out of your skull --

				WILLARD
		We have a lot of pride in our

				AGENT
		How far do you think you can

	         NIGHT

	The boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the
	distance. Along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations
	with U.S. soldiers in them. There is a bright fire
	burning uncontrolled in the distance; the sparks and white
	light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the
	night.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days and nights later, we
		approach the Do Lung Bridge.


	128  VIEW ON THE FACES OF THE P.B.R. CREW

	watching. Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks
	sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the
	banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and
	rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip
	through the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere --
	scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge
	or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light
	automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R.
	edges in under the span of the old bridge. Soldiers run
	up through the water. They are obscured in the darkness.

				SOLDIER
		I gotta get out a here -- I´ll pay
		-- I got money.

				CHIEF
		Get away from this boat.

				WILLARD
		Who's your C.O., soldier?

	The Soldier ducks back and runs away.

				SOLDIER
		Fuck you, you'll get what's coming 
		to you.

	Other men approach the boat. A young LIEUTENANT steps
	forward.

				LIEUTENANT
		Captain Willard?

				WILLARD
		That's me.

				LIEUTENANT
		Captain Willard -- we got these
		from Nha Thrang two days ago --
		they expected you here then --

	He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings,
	Willard takes it.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		You don't know how happy that makes
		me, sir.

				WILLARD
		Why?

				LIEUTENANT
		Now I can get out a here -- if
		I can find a way out.

				WILLARD
		We'll be needing some supplies
		and fuel -- do you know anybody
		who can give me a hand?

				LIEUTENANT
		I'd just clear out as soon as I
		could if I were you, sir. They're
		gonna start working on the bridge
		with torches again. Charlie will
		start throwing it in hard --

				WILLARD
		What is this bridge?

				LIEUTENANT
		It's of strategic importance for
		keeping the highway into Bat Shan
		open -- the generals don't like to
		admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

	He points to the men getting ready to work.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		Every night we build it and by
		0800 they've blown it up -- it
		and a lot of good men -- But the
		generals like to say the road is
		open -- ha ! Nobody uses that
		road except Charlie.

	He turns and splashes off into the darkness.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		This is the cesspool of hell.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Incoming.

	SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM
	in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous.

			(yelling)
		All right -- Lance, go with the
		Captain an' see what you can
		scrounge --

	Willard climbs out with Lance.

				CHIEF
			(continuing; to Willard)
		Better make it fast, sir -- we
		don't really need much anyway.

	Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the
	bridge.


	129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE

	They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire
	on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they
	don't know where to run.

	They dive towards the voice.


	130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH

	They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his

				SOLDIER
		You came right to it, son of

		Son of a bitch, sir.

	The Soldier doesn't respond.

				WILLARD

		Where's your chief supply officer?

				SOLDIER
		Beverly Hills --

				WILLARD
		What?

				SOLDIER
		Straight up the road -- a concrete
		bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where
		else you think he'd be?

				WILLARD
		C'mon --

	There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the
	road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP
	from a sandbagged emplacement.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Get your asses down, buddy.

	They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the
	emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a
	sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner.
	Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard
	trips.

				VOICE
		Watch your feet, asshole --

	Willard looks down.

				VOICE
			(continuing)
		You stepped on my face.

				LANCE
		We thought you were dead.

				VOICE
		The whole world loves a smart ass.

	They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away
	into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three
	feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to
	himself.

				WILLARD
		What're you shooting at, soldier?

				GUNNER
		Gooks.

	He turns and sees it's an officer.

				GUNNER
			(continuing)
		I´m sorry, sir.

				WILLARD
		It's all right, sergeant -- what's
		out there?

				GUNNER
		They were tryin' to cut through
		the wire -- I got 'em all I think.

				OTHER SOLDIER
		Oh yeah -- listen.

	There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it
	stops for aminute then continues hideously.

				GUNNER
		He's trying to call his friends --
		send up a flare.

	The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie
	light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST.

				SPOTTER
		Those are all dead, stupid, he's
		obviously underneath 'em --

	They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING
	gets more intense.

				GUNNER
		Wake up the Roach.

	The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is
	leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several
	times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are
	the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."

				ROACH
		Yeah, man.

				SPOTTER
		Slope in the wire -- hear him.

	He listens, he does, he nods.

				SPOTTER
			(continuing)
		Bust him.

	Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters
	up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley
	designs all over it.

				GUNNER
		Hear him?

				ROACH
		Sure , yeah.

				GUNNER
		You need a flare --
			
				ROACH
		No, it´s cool.

	He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks
	the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it
	across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the
	SCREAM, calculating.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		He's close -- real close.

	He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into
	the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE
	WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION
	that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or
	pieces of bodies coming down around them.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		Muhhh Fuhhh ...
	
	He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep.


	131  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - BRIDGE - CLEAN, CHEF

	They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance.
	Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his M-16. SHELLS
	WHISTLE by and CRASH in the distance.

				CHEF
		Geez, I wish they'd hurry.

	A SOLDIER comes up on his way with some others to start
	building the bridge.

				SOLDIER
		Hey, buddy, that boat still runs,
		eh?

				CLEAN
		Yeah, it still runs.

				SOLDIER
		Do me a favor buddy, please.

				CLEAN
		What is it?

	He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes.

				SOLDIER
		Send these out when you get back
		to the world.

	He puts them in Clean's hand.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		It's to everyone I really knew --
		the first girl I screwed -- my
		brother -- best friend -- I wanted
		to tell 'em how much I enjoyed
		knowing 'em -- it's been a great
		twenty years. I gotta let 'em
		know.

				CLEAN
		What're you askin' me for -- put
		'em in the first helicopter comes
		in tomorrow.

				SOLDIER
		Nobody comes in here.

	He points up at the mountain ridges.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		The N.V.A. 312th -- over there
		the 307th -- on that hill we
		counted fourteen different guns
		in one minute -- they got rockets
		mortars, snipers in those trees,
		there's a million of those shitty
		little bastards out there -- we're
		all gonna die.

	He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna be dead.

	Clean takes the letters.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		You got a chance in that boat --
		by morning you could be five miles
		down the river.

				CLEAN
		We ain't goin' down the river.

	The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking.

				CLEAN
			(continuing)
		What's up river from here anyhow --

	The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded.

				SOLDIER
		Spooky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie?

				SOLDIER
		No, it'd be spooky without the war
		-- give 'em back.

	He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and
	disgusted. Willard and Lance come back down the beach
	carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra
	M-16's.

				CHIEF
		Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?

				WILLARD
		We found some bodies -- let's get
		out a here.


	132  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - P.B.R.

	They edge through the shallows as the men light up their
	welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge --
	then pull away and accelerate fast.


	133  MED. SHOT - THE P.B.R. CREW

	The Chief is at the helm --  they all look back in the
	distance where the bridge was -- the hills flash with
	artillery discharges -- there is a fiery glow from the
	bridge area and the CONCUSSION of heavy EXPLOSIONS.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	134  EXT. FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW - RAIN

	The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical
	downpour. Mr. Clean is in thef.g., oiling and cleaning
	his 50-cal, his M-11 and M-79 -- the rest of the crew are
	forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas
	canopy. Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was
	set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount.


	135  EXT. THE RUSHING RIVER - NEW VIEW - RAIN

	The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de-
	bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R.

				CHIEF
			(to Willard)
		I can't see a fucking thing.

	There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of
	tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard
	climbs forward, and looks down.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		We hit a big enough one this
		hull will shatter like a Corvette.
		Fucking plastic boat.

	Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole,
	warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean
	joins him, helping.

				WILLARD
			(shouting to Chief)
		What about ducking into one of
		those tributaries till this river
		slows down?

				CHIEF
		Who knows what's up there?

				WILLARD
		Can't be any worse than this.
		What do you think?

				CHIEF
		I think this river wants to take
		us home fast. I'm practically
		goin' in reverse.

	Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth
	of a tributary.

				WILLARD
		Well, get in there.

				CHIEF
		This whole area is lousy with
		V.C. -- We don't stand a chance.
		Lemme turn around and we'll be
		in Hau Fat in six minutes.

	There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard
	really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks.

				WILLARD
		Get in there !

				CHIEF
		This is my crew and my fucking
		boat, and I'm the responsible
		party.

				WILLARD
		Get in there now or I'll bury
		you in this river.

	It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't
	do as he says.

				CHIEF
			(finally relents, 
			  turns the helm)
		You're fucking crazy. You're
		going to get us all killed.

	The P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth
	of the tributary.

				WILLARD
		That we're dumber than we look.

	Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the
	darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of
	it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them.
	It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later.

	Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck
	fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is
	removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon.

				CHIEF
		Lance -- 'bout twenty meters
		starboard.

	Lance leaps down to his position. Willard, Clean and Chef
	cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free.

	Everything is confusion -- yelling -- GUNFIRE -- the THUD
	of heavy BULLETS ripping inti the P.B.R.'s fibreglass hull.

	143  CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN


	144  POV BEHIND CLEAN

	He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting
	it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction
	-- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield
	and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy
	burst at the jungle -- trees crumble.

				CLEAN
		I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a-
		bitch, it's jammed, oh God,
		it's jammed.

	Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE.

	Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead.
	He looks angrily to Willard.

	Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps
	up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward
	the cockpit.

				WILLARD
		Throw me that ordnance.

	Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard
	opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over
	the edge of the cockpit.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Give me some kind a field a fire --

	BULLETS rip by.

				CHEF

		Oh, God --

	He jams his gun up as he sees a flash and FIRES -- there
	is a low POP and a WHISTLE as the GRENADE arches into the
	jungle.


	145  POV. - BEHIND THEM

	He FIRES another burst as the GRENADE EXPLODES brightly.
	There is another POP and WHISTLE , another BLAST. A large
	tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin-
	ning growth. We HEAR strange SCREAMING from the trees and
	jungle, hideous MOANS and terror-filled CRIES.


	146  CLOSE SHOT ON THE CHIEF

	He jams the throttle forward -- the boat surges ahead.
	Willard FIRES another GRENADE from his M-79.


	147  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	149  MED. VIEW

	The men sit around, exhausted, brutalized, wounded.
	They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be-
	cause they know they're too far from the banks to
	be shot at.

	They smoke pot and eat silently. Lance smokes a
	joint and looks at his gun. Splotches of paint
	have been blown away from the armor shield -- pieces
	of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount.
	The boat is a floating wreck.

	Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack
	by Chief. All of the men are silent.

	Chef comes up from below; he has been wounded in the
	shoulder.

				CHEF
		There's some bad holes, man,

				FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
		Vous pouvez approcher mais

				CHEF
		Take her in slow.


	160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK

	The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are
	a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save
	for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left
	eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a
	tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para-
	troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear-
	ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle-
	aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons
	and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the
	dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the
	head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli-
	cate, with a strength about him.

				PHILIPPE
		Hands on the heads.

				CHIEF
		I can't steer with my goddamn
		feet.

				CHEF
		Hey, they speak American.

				GASTON
		Who is the commanding officer?

				CHIEF
		I --

				WILLARD
		I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.
		This is Chief Warrant Officer
		Phillips -- it's his boat. We
		were shot up bad downriver and
		need repairs and food -- we can
		pay you in gold.

				GASTON
		Philippe --

	Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope
	from the deck and ties it to the dock.

				LANCE
		I'll help you with --

				PHILIPPE
		Do not move --

	Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly.

				GASTON
		Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --

				WILLARD
		As I said, we can pay you in
		gold.

				GASTON
		Entirely unnecessary, Captain.

	He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise --

				GASTON
		We share a common enemy -- you
		are our guests.
			(he steps back)
		I am Gaston de marais -- this is
		my family's plantation. It has
		been such for 121 years. It will
		be such after I die.
		This is my son, Philippe -- he
		has fought in Algeria and held
		the rank of Captain. And Henry
		LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was
		at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
		servant, Tran Van Kac ---

	Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit
	and three women come forward from different positions --
	all wear bush clothing and bear weapons.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		My youngest son -- Christian --


	161  CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN

	He carries an M-60 machine gun in his hand -- a belt of
	ammunition trailing off behind him.

	They stand there, exhausted and amazed. Philippe yells
	in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits,
	heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them.
	They look the Americans over warily and assemble at
	Philippe's command.

				WILLARD
		American weapons?

				GASTON
		We took them from the dead.
			(smiles)
		Now -- I assume you want to rest,
		to shower. We'll attend to your

				CHEF
		Shower.

	Willard's men look at one another, dazed.

				WILLARD
		We don't want to bother you any,
		we --

				GASTON
		A man of war is never bothered to 
		aid an ally -- you will follow me,
		Captain.

	Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks
	up his M-16 by the stock.

				WILLARD
		A habit of men of war, sir --
		you understand.

				GASTON
		Of course, Captain -- an
		unfortunate necessity.

	The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and
	follow.

				CHIEF
		What about the boat?

				PHILIPPE
		My men will keep it for you --

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the
		boat.

				WILLARD
		Chief.
			(pause)
		Come with us.

	They look at each other a moment. The Chief shrugs
	and follows.


	164  FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS

	Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc-
	ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the
	many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire.

				GASTON
		A suitable accomodation for
		your men, captain -- you will,
		of course, be quartered with us --

	He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The
	Chief is hesitant.

				WILLARD
		Go ahead --

	Philippe leads them on, muttering.

				GASTON
		Captain, this way.

	Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward
	the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and
	about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and
	young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the
	opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns.
	Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Magnificent, eh, Captain?

	Willard looks.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		It is very good -- there is no
		current -- It is very good. I
		have never seen one like it in
		all Indochina. I was in Paris
		when it arrived -- do you know
		what might have caused --

				WILLARD
		Looks like a two thousand pound
		to me. Yeah, a two thousand
		pound bomb.

				GASTON
		No, I've seen those in Normandy.
		This is much better.
			(pause)
		My country -- my country could
		never originate this. Magnificent.

	Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard
	looks between him and this big hole in the ground in
	amezement.


	165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING

	A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The
	Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted.
	Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy,
	caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just
	stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened,
	reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him.

				CHEF
		A hot shower, hot damn.

	He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and
	caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and
	he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a
	shower is.

	elegantly furnished, although old and decaying.

	Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of
	the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with
	its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His
	battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and
	burns.

	TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food.
	The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group.
	The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights
	up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

				CHEF
		This food is wonderful ! I can't
		believe the chef is a slope.
		    (turning to Clean)
		Some more?

	Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance
	reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands.

				CHEF

		Hey -- Lance.

				LANCE
		Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..
		wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,

	And then he looks to his friends for approval.

	Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain
	there is another, more elaborate table, where the
	De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES
	through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the
	group.

	The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room.
	Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair
	next to him.

				GASTON
		Roxanne, I hope you are feeling
		better.

				ROXANNE
		Je vais bien maintenant.

				GASTON
		May I present Captain Willard?
		He is of a paratroop regiment.
		You know the difference between a
		paratrooper and a regular soldier,
		don't you , my dear?

				ROXANNE
			(smiling and taking
			  Willard's hand)
		Yes, they come from the sky.

	She sits -- there's an uneasy silence.

	Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of
	him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is
	forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne.

				WILLARD
		I would like to know more about
		the .. uh, plaque...

	Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted
	wooden plaque with various tallies on it.

				GASTON
		Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.
			(hard)
		This is only  for this war, Captain.
		Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese
		regular forces -- 15; South
		Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular
		forces and otherwise.
			(pause)
		Americain -- 6. Of course, they
		were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Of course. I -- Once we make
		our repairs, we could send word,
		we could have you evacuated
		from here.

				GASTON
		Captain?

				WILLARD
		You'll get blown outta here some
		day.

				GASTON
		We will never 'evacuate', Captain
		-- this is our home. Indochina is
		ours; it has been so for a hundred
		and twenty-one years, there is
		something to say for that.

				WILLARD
		The Vietnamese think it's theirs
		-- I guess the Americans do,
		too.

				GASTON
		But we civilized it. A place
		belongs to those who bring light
		to it, don't you agree.

				WILLARD
		I always thought the French came
		here to get the rubber.

				PHILIPPE
		Excuse me, I must attend to my
		men.

	He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife.

				ROXANNE
		May I ask where the Captain is
		going in his little boat?

				WILLARD
		We were going upriver when we
		got caught in a storm, ma'am.

				GASTON
		Upriver? Why upriver? There is
		nothing there, only jungle.

				WILLARD
		Do you know that jungle?

				GASTON
		When I was a boy, my father would
		take me there, to hunt. There
		are a few savages, but no man
		can live there, no white man.

				WILLARD
		What about an American named
		Kurtz?

	There is a pause.

				GASTON
		We have never heard of him.

	Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,
		Captain.

	Willard turns.

				WILLARD
		Good night.

	Gaston leaves. Willard and Roxanne are left alone. The
	servants clear the table.

				ROXANNE
		You must realize, Captain -- we
		have lost much here -- I, my
		husband. Gaston -- his wife and
		son.

				WILLARD
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				ROXANNE
			(rising)
		Cognac?

				WILLARD
		I should be checking on the
		boat.

				ROXANNE
		The war will still be here
		tomorrow.

	She walks out of the room.

				WILLARD
			(thinking)
		I guess so.

	He follows.


	175  INT. SITTING ROOM - FULL SHOT - WILLARD AND ROXANNE

	Roxanne sits, pouring a brandy, while Willard stands.

				ROXANNE
		Do you miss your home, Captain?
		Have you someone there?

				WILLARD
		No. Not really.
	
		I was discharged from the army
		four years ago. I went home,
		wasted some time, bought a Mustang
		Mach 1, drove it a week. Then
		I re-upped for another tour. No,
		everything I love is here.

				ROXANNE
		Then you are like us.

	She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What will you do after the war?

				WILLARD
		I just follow my footsteps, one
		at a time, trying to answer the
		little questions and staying away
		from the big ones.

				ROXANNE
		What's a big question?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz.
			(pause)
		I know you've heard of him.

				ROXANNE
		Yes.

				WILLARD
		What did you hear?

				ROXANNE
		That strange things.. terrible
		things have occured around this
		American, Kurtz.

				WILLARD
		What things?

				ROXANNE
		Gaston would never tell me. It
		was asubject not to be spoken of,
		Captain.

				WILLARD
		Yes.

				ROXANNE
		Did you know -- deeper in the
		jungle, upriver -- there are
		savages?

				WILLARD
		I know.

				ROXANNE
		But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.

	A long pause. Then she looks at the cognac she poured for
	him.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What a pity, you don't drink.
		Since my husband died, there
		are so many things I must do
		alone.

	She takes a sip.

	Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left
	partly open to let a breeze in. He steps onto a terrace
	overlooking the river.


	176  EXT. THE TERRACE - MED. VIEW - WILLARD - NIGHT

	A machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover-
	ing the front of house, from the river.

				ROXANNE
			(from the sitting room)
		Are you warm, Captain?

				WILLARD
		The river is beautiful.

	In fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat.


	177  WILLARD'S POV.

	The P.B.R. is under guard by a couple of Gaston's
	Vietnamese.


	176  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	She, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes
	up behind him.

				ROXANNE
		I spend hours watching that
		river from my bedroom window.
		It fascinates me.

	She moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is
	kissing her.

	179  CLOSE ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	One eye steals another look at the P.B.R.


	180  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	Two of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready
	for the long night.


	181  VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE - ON THE TERRACE

	His hands wander over her body as she clings to him. Then
	she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting
	room, and up the stairs.


	182  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - FULL VIEW

	It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the
	door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a
	large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over
	it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire --
	there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one.
	He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns
	down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and
	stands there facing him.

	He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays
	down on the bed and watches him.

				ROXANNE
		I have been lonely here, Captain.

	He moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is
	leaning against the wall in his reach.

							FADE OUT.


	183  EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT

	We can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently
	slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure
	kneeling in final preparations for going out in the
	night.

	Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and
	scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing
	into the darkness.


	184  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - NIGHT

	Two Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first,
	the first disappears into the thicket.


	185  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with
	a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick
	work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently,
	he drags the body out of sight.


	186  MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears
	into the hold.


	187  NEW VIEW

	He lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly,
	with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his
	best work alone, and at night.

							CUT TO.


	188  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD - MORNING

	He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE
	moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL
	BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up
	her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles.

				ROXANNE
		I will fix you breakfast.

	He starts to get up.

				WILLARD
		I'm afraid I won't have time --
		I gotta --

				ROXANNE
		Whe you reach the boat you will
		find that half your fifty calibre
		stores -- a case of grenades, a
		mortar and two M-16's and a
		case of clips are being
		transfered to us by your order.

	He stops -- seemingly stunned.

				WILLARD
		So that's it.

				ROXANNE
		You may think what you wish,
		Captain, but I like you very
		much.

	She turns to go.

				WILLARD
		What if I say no.

				ROXANNE
		Then Philippe will have to kill
		all of you.

	She leaves.


	189  EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS

	He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring
	ammunition boxes.

	Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the
	Chief and crew with M-16's.

				GASTON
		Two of my men deserted last
		night. It happens from time
		to time. I assume my daughter
		told you of our conditions.

				WILLARD
		Your daughter.

				CHIEF
		They taking half our ammo,
		Captain -- said it was your orders.

	He pauses for a second.

				WILLARD
		That's right -- I did.

	The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the
	engines. Willard looks hard at Gaston.

				WILLARD
		I guess this is whAt men of war
		do -- eh?

				GASTON
		We endure, captain -- you can
		blow up the house and we will
		live in the cellar -- destroy
		that and we'll dig a hole in the
		jungle and sleep on it. Burn
		the forest and we'll hide in
		the swamp. all the while, we
		do but one thing -- clean the
		blood off our bayonets.
			(pause)
		Au revoir, Captain.


	190  LONG SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R.

	Willard climbs on board and it pulls away.


	191  EXT. P.B.R. - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, CHIEF

	The BOAT ROARS out across the river. The Chief looks over
	at Willard. They stare at each other for a moment.

				CHIEF
		Next time we  get in a good fire
		fight -- I'd like to know how
		she was, Captain.

	Willard just smiles at the Chief. he leans over and pulls
	up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains
	the contents of all those ammo boxes.  .50 calibre; clips;
	grenades.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.

				CLEAN
		What did you put in all those
		ammo boxes?

				WILLARD
		Rocks, sand -- those two men
		who deserted.

				CHIEF
		When'd you do it?

				WILLARD
		While you were sleeping.

	He lets the board drop.

	Willard moves to the back of the boat.


	192  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER , CREW

	The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark
	and deep. The trees are higher in this area and much of
	the river is shaded on one side. There is no undergrowth,
	just the tall trees and ferms. They move ahead at half
	speed, alert, ready for anything.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		We moved deeper and deeper into
		the jungle. It was very quiet
		there. It was like wandering on
		a prehistoric planet, an unknown
		world ... where the men thought
		they crawled to, I don't know.
		For me, we crawled toward Kurtz --
		exclusively.

	Willard looks out ahead and points.

	They all turn their guns in that direction. We PAN TO
	REVEAL a small village of huts along the bank.


	193  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - VILLAGE


	194  POV. OF THE P.B.R.

	They pass in front of the village which is rundown and
	completely deserted. The huts are on stilts to avoid the
	flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what
	they once were.

				CHEF (O.S.)
		Flood.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		No -- most of 'em are still
		standing -- might've been
		disease.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		I don't know -- there'd still
		be some sign -- it's just like
		the one this morning.

	195  POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE

	The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across
	the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown
	darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange
	birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge
	snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the
	jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.


	196  FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE

	Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh
	and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
	upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
	vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
	the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
	dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
	up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
	once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
	gateway to paradise.

	The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
	seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
	orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
	The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
	were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
	and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
	peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
	it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-
	being.

	Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
	cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into
	hell.

	Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.
	The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of
	the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a
	darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this
	hole.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	197  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER - DAWN

	The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back
	about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on
	the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls
	on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet.

				CHIEF
		-- All right, Lance --

	Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into
	the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a
	tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle
	as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from CLAYMORE
	MINES obviously set to cover the mound of skulls. The
	smoke clears.

				LANCE
		The other one --

				WILLARD
		No -- leave it --

				CHIEF
		Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --

				WILLARD
		Thta's not Charlie's work --

	There is silence.

				WILLARD
		Whoever put'em there didn't do it
		to kill people -- They put 'em up
		as signs -- 

				CHIEF
		Signs?

				WILLARD
		Yeah -- like keep out --

	Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead
	past the smoking mound.


	198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY

	The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist
	swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into
	an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Toward the night of the fifth
		day out of Do Lung Bridge, we
		judged ourselves about eight
		miles from Kurtz' base.
		Everything was still, the trees,
		the creepers, even the brush
		seemed like it had been changed
		into some kind of stone. It was
		unnatural, like a trance. Not
		a sound could be heard. I began
		to think I was deaf -- then the
		fog came suddenly, and I was
		blind too.

	The boat disappears in the thick fog.


	199  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	We catch glimpses of him, even though we are close.

				WILLARD
		Listen.

				CHIEF
		What is it?

				WILLARD
		Listen.

	They are silent. We can HEAR the most ominous SOUND
	COMING FROM THE BANKS. The GROANING, OR WAILING .. of
	HUNDREDS OF MEN.

				CHIEF
		They're on the banks of the
		river.


	200  VIEW ON LANCE

	Frantically, he swings the twin fifties around.

				LANCE
		Jesus !


	201  VIEW ON CHIEF

	We can barely SEE him -- in and out of the fog.

				CHIEF
		No, Lance. Not while you can't 
		see.


	202  VIEW ON WILLARD

	listening. The SOUND IS TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING.

				CHIEF
		Will they attack?

				WILLARD
		If they have boats ... or
		canoes... they'd get lost in
		the fog. We can't move either --
		we'll end up on the shore.

				CHEF
		God...

				LANCE
		Sounds like hundreds of them.

				WILLARD
		Shhhhhh.

	The CHORUS OF GROANS in unbearable. But it is not ahostile
	cahnt; or a war chant, but rather the SOUND OF HUMAN
	ANGUISH.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		It doesn't sound hostile --
		it sounds like they've seen us
		coming and it sounds like --
		I don't know, a funeral. I
		don't understand.


	203  VIEW ON LANCE

	A glimpse of him, almost in tears. We then SEE glimpses,
	fog moving, of all the men on the P.B.R.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	204  MED. VIEW - THE P.B.R.

	MOVING THROUGH the thinning mist. The Navy craft proceeds
	cautiously.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two hours after the fog lifted,
		we moved slowly to a spot we
		thought was roughly a mile and
		a half below Kurtz's camp. We
		approached a long sand-bank
		stretching down the middle of
		the river.

				CHIEF
		Which way? Right or left?

				WILLARD
		Who knows? Right.

				CHIEF
		Looks pretty shallow.

	The P.B.R. moves toard the right-most channel. Chef
	takes a long pole and begins sounding depth.


	205  VIEW ON WILLARD

	The men are really tense now -- Lances swivels his gun from
	bank to bank. Chief keeps his fingers on an M-16. Willard
	takes out the TOP SECRET packet he received at Do Lung.
	Tears it open. We MOVE IN ON him.

				WILLARD
			(reading)
		Upon reaching objective. Target

		Com-Sec Command code Strong Arm --

			(pause)
		Purgative air strike ! Purgative !
		They'd kill me too !

	Suddenly Chef lays out flat on the bow. Hundreds
	and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the P.B.R.
	rattling against the boat.

				CHIEF
		Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They're
		shooting fucking arrows at us.


	206  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	looking toward the banks.


	207  WILLARD'S POV

	Frags of men -- naked limbs, arms, breasts, glaring eyes
	entangled in the dense jungle gloom. And hundreds of
	pathetic wooden arrows flying out toward them.


	208 VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	crazily zig-zagging up the river in the midst of the
	childish assault.

				WILLARD
		Steer her right.


	209  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	arrows hitting the deck. The men open up everything
	they've got. Lance is FIRING the two fifties wildly.
	
				WILLARD
		Keep going.. keep going.
		They're just fucking sticks !
		Chief, stay at the helm.

	But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his
	M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands,
	and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having
	caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in
	horror.


	210  VIEW ON CHIEF

	laying at Willard's feet -- the long spear through him,
	bleeding onto Willard's boots. He looks up at Willard,
	about to say something.

				CHIEF
		A spear?

	He dies.


	211 MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The men are still crazily FIRING into the empty jungle
	long after those who attacked beat their retreat.

				WILLARD
		Stop it. Stop it !

	Slowly he pulls his boots from under Chief. They are
	absolutely soaked in blood. He is stunned -- sits down
	and begins to unlace the bloody boots, and take them off.

				LANCE
		Chief's dead.

	Willard unlaces the other boot, and holds the bloody boot
	in his hand.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		It was the strangest thing --
		I don't know that I can explain
		it. Two of my men dead, and all
		I could think of was whether
		Kurtz was dead too. That's all
		I wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear
		Kurtz.

	He starts to wipe the blood off the boot.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Somehow, in the middle of this ...
		carnival, Kurtz had grown into
		something -- a gifted officer;
		a great man.
		Somehow, he was the only light
		in this hopeless, hopeless
		darkness.
		And now I was too late --
		he was probably gone, disappeared...
		by a grenade rolled into his
		tent -- or by some spear on the head.
		Christ, I felt like howling like
		those animals in the fog.


	212  EXT. THE BOAT AT MARINA DEL REY - NIGHT

	The people at Charlie's cocktail party on the boat.
	Some flashbulbs are going off. Some people are dancing
	to the MUSIC. OUR VIEW MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD Willard, on
	the edge of the party.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Here they are in Los Angeles.
		Everything is safe. There's a
		supermarket around the corner,
		the police station around the
		other. It would seem ridiculous
		to them that I was shot to hell
		because I had lost the privilege
		of listening to the mysterious
		Colonel Kurtz.

	213  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. DAY

	The P.B.R. moving up the river. The men are practically
	in a trance now, looking at the banks of the river. They
	don´t even make an effort to touch their weapons.


	214  WHAT THEY SEE

	Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed
	in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts
	of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face
	paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity
	about them, men and boys, standing passively watching
	the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,
	white and blue.


	215  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The men of the crew are not the same men who began this
	voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance.
	The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
	picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
	savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a
	hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with
	mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He
	wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.
	Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the
	difficult journey. They start to move to their gun
	positions.

				WILLARD
		Just stand here with me where
		they can see us. Do nothing.


	216  VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.

	MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers
	and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The
	men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly
	without weapons. The natives standing across the river
	make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept
	the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-
	tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of
	feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in
	almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little
	boat to penetrate.


	217  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms
	of some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks
	something like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition
	was right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass.


	218  FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER

	Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river
	now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping
	pace with the P.B.R. There is no hostility in these
	faces, only curiosity and a sort of grief.


	219  VIEW ON WILLARD, THE CREW

	They look up toward the bank.


	220  THEIR POV

	The temple at NU MUNG BA, a fortified encampment, built
	around the ruins of a former Cambodian civilization.
	Stone walls, barbed wire, cracked pyramids and rows and
	rows of Escher-like sandbags arranged in an endless maze
	around the fortress.

	He picks up his field glasses and looks through.


	222  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH GLASSES

	A sign entangled in the barbed wire -- its lettering
	strict and military:

				MISSION F-82
				NU MUNG BA

	The GLASSES POV MOVES REVEALING another sign written in
	a wild psychedelic hand.

				OUR MOTTO: APOCALYPSE NOW !

	The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE once again and come upon an
	astonished sight, a black man dressed in a tatter of
	colored fabrics, feathers, and an Australian bush hat.
	He looks something like a multi-colored harlequin waving
	frantically to the P.B.R. The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE
	OFF of him.

				AUSTRALIAN

		I know, I know, it's all right.
		Come in this way. It's mined
		over there. This way. It's

	Willard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and
	they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the
	water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina
	wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding
	them safely in.

	A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the
	fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near
	the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-
	merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some
	of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the
	ground. Chef nods at the bodies.

				CHEF
		Charlie?

				WILLARD
		Looks that way.

		Who's he?

				WILLARD
		God knows.

	The boat pulls up. The Australian harlequin hops on
	board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat-
	tered with mud and blood.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Who the hell are you?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby. Got any Winstons?

				WILLARD
		Moonby what?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal
		Australian Regiment, Task Force.
		Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.

				WILLARD
		    (incredulously, indicating
			 the hundreds of natives)
		What is this?

				MOONBY
		Oh, they're simple enough people.
		It's good to see you, baby.
		Nobody has any Winstons?

	Chef automatically offers Moonby a Winston.

				MOONBY
		This boat's a mess.

				WILLARD
		Where's Kurtz? I want to talk
		to him.

				MOONBY
		Oh, you don't talk to Colonel
		Kurtz.
			(he puffs, then smiles)
		You listen to him. God, these
		are good. I kept these people
		off you, you know. It wasn't
		easy.

				WILLARD
		Why did they attack us?

				MOONBY
		Simple. They don't want him to
		go.

				WILLARD
		You're Australian?

				MOONBY
		Pre-Australian, actually. But
		I'd dig goin' to California.
		I'm California dreamin'.

				WILLARD
			 (almost to himself)
		So Kurtz is alive.

				MOONBY
		Kurtz. I tell you, that man
		has enlarged my mind.

	He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his
	mind's expansion.

				MOONBY
			(continuing)
		But lemme tell you, he is the
		most dangerous thing in every
		way that I've come on so far.
		He wanted to shoot me. The
		first thing he said is, 'I'm
		going to shoot you because you
		are a deserter.' I said I
		didn't desert from your army,
		I deserted from my army. He
		said, 'I'm going to shoot you
		just the same.'

				WILLARD
		Why didn't he shoot you?

				MOONBY
		I've asked myself that question.
		I said to myself, why didn't he
		shoot me? He didn't shoot me,
		because I had a stash like you
		wouldn't believe. I hid it in
		the jungle; the wealth of the
		Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish
		-- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut
		Heroin; the Gold of the Golden
		Triangle. and Acid -- I make
		Koolaid that makes purple Owsley
		come on like piss. Now I'm
		Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen
		he talks. About everything !
		Everything. I forgot there's
		such a thing as sleep. Everything.
		Of love, too.

				CHEF
		Love?

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, not what you think...
		Cosmic love. He made me see
		things -- things, you know.

	The whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has
	picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress.


	226  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH THE FIELD GLASSES

	Men in small groups, huddled over food.
	Now he settles on the entrance in the temple. There
	are stakes in front, and on top of them are horrible
	shrunken heads.


	227  BACK TO SCENE

				WILLARD
		Sounds like he's gone crazy.

				MOONBY
		No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be
		crazy -- if you heard him talk,
		just last week, you'd never think
		he was crazy.

				WILLARD
		Is that where he is? By the 
		shrunken heads.

				MOONBY
		Those heads, yes. Well, the
		rebels...

				WILLARD
			(to his men)
		We're going ashore. Tie her up
		-- and leave your guns up, Lance.

				LANCE
		What?

				WILLARD
		Bring your rifles, that's all.
			(looking at Moonby)
		Take us to him.

				MOONBY
		Right on -- he's been waiting
		for --

				WILLARD
		And shut up.

	Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard
	and the men follow.


	228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW

	As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear
	where a moment before there was only jungle.

	They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
	than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
	and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
	in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
	AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
	emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
	equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
	are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
	of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
	if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
	the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
	where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
	the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
	primitive and more savage than any since the time
	of Captain Cook.

	They encounter, in the center of the group, what once
	appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
	wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
	loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
	strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
	long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47
	decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches
	this beast, who seems shy and retiring.

				WILLARD
		Who are you?

				MOONBY
			(breaking in)
		His name is...

				WILLARD
		I'm not ever goin' to tell you
		to shut up again.

	Moonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing
	comes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they
	are to see him.

				MAN
		Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team...
		Special Forces. F-82 -- Col.
		Walter Kurtz, commanding.

				WILLARD
		What happened here?

				COLBY
		What -- happened here.

				WILLARD
		Charlie?

				COLBY
		NVA regulars. They're coming
		again tonight. Tet -- their
		big -- assault.

	Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what
	to say to this man, but he understands the forces that
	pounded him. He takes his arm.


	229  REVERSE ON COLBY

	looks at Willard, not understanding.


	230  REVERSE ON WILLARD

	Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand.

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, don´t say that.

				COLBY
		Take us back. Take us back !
		But, the operation -- the team.
		Colonel Kurtz has such plans for
		-- the team.

				WILLARD
		Take me to him, Major.

	Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on
	poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard:

				COLBY
		I had nothing to do with these
		operations -- I did not do the
		planning -- none of us did.
		It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he
		was the genius. You'll see --
		the genius of our Colonel. He
		should be made a General, don't
		you think? A General? It's...

	Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard
	knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

	Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is
	a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly
	attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,
	though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with
	primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
	well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,
	with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes
	almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what
	seems to be a serious wound.


	232  VIEW ON WILLARD

	This is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then,
	automatically, he comes to an attention.

				WILLARD
		Colonel Kurtz, I guess.

				KURTZ
		I'm Kurtz.

				WILLARD
			(he salutes)
		Captain B.L. Willard reporting
		his presence, sir.


	233  VIEW ON KURTZ

	looking at him a long time. Then he returns the salute,
	and simply:

				KURTZ
		At ease...
			(pause, as he regards him)
		Sit down.


	234  MED. VIEW

	There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair.
	But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on
	the ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well.
	Then Kurtz does.

	Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to
	Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from
	man to man, ritualistically.

				KURTZ
			(slowly)
		Why did you come to ... my province.

				WILLARD
		We were attacked -- down river.
		We need supplies and medical 
		help.

				KURTZ
		You were not coming here, to
		see me?

				WILLARD
			(finding it more and 
			 more difficult to go
			 on with this lie)
		No -- no, sir.

				KURTZ
		You came up my river -- in that
		small boat. So simple. I
		always thought the final justice
		would come from the sky, like
		we did.
			(pause)
		You are the final justice,
		aren't you?

				WILLARD
		What do you mean, Colonel?

				KURTZ
			(gently)
		What other reason could you
		have come? A Captain. Ranger.
		Paratrooper. Graduate of the
		Recondo School. Am I right
		about these things?

				WILLARD
		You know you're right.

	There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.

				KURTZ
		Then the Agency approached you.
		Maybe in a bar in Quinon or
		Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay
		for one life. Perhaps a village
		elder, or a tax collector.
		Nobody's orders but your own.
		Exciting work.


	235  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	He remains silent.


	236  CLOSE ON KURTZ

	He smiles.

				KURTZ
		You've spent tome at the Royal
		Tracking School of Malaysia.
		I can tell from the way the
		laces on your boots are tied.
		I understand you, Captain. We
		understand each other.

	There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other.
	Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws
	it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act
	assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

				WILLARD
		Do you know me?

				KURTZ
		Yes.

	Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another
	word or gesture, shoots and kills a man.

				KURTZ
				(continuing)
		Do you know me ?

	He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks
	back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
	heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful
	distance behind. Even Willard is stunned.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.


	237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT

	Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like
	a primitive civilization.


	238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL

	Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall
	next to him. He is exhausted.

	Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef
	approaches, crouches down.

				CHEF
		Captain -- they've been probed
		all this week -- Cong and NVA
		regulars. There's gonna be a
		big offense any time.

				WILLARD
		I know.

	Lance stirs; starts to wake up.

				CHEF
		What are we doing here?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,
		just like he said.

				KURTZ
		Yeah, I can see that. He's 
		fuckin nuts --

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				CHEF
		He killed that guy without feeling
		anything.

				WILLARD
		Not a thing.

				CHEF
		When you kill Cong, don't you
		feel something.

				WILLARD
		Sure.
			(thinking)
		Recoil... I feel the recoil of
		my rifle.

	Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened.


	239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE

	Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged
	and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar
	emplacement.

	Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow
	to Willard as he passes.

				WILLARD
		This is good -- triple overlapping
		fields of fire -- walls so thick
		ordinary artillery just cleans
		the moss off their surfaces.

	A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then
	runs off to her bunker.

	WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups
	of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and
	children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from
	every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried
	scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on
	a big piece of almost raw meat.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I've done things, when I was
		alone in the jungle -- that I
		never told anyone about.

	They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
	half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and
	fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck
	lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted
	there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is
	built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
	fire into the jungle beyond.

	Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their
	beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several
	Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
	bayonets.

				CHEF
		This is evil -- evil, Captain.
		We're all gonna die here.

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I know.

				CHEF
		I don't get it -- You said your
		mission was to kill him. Let's
		do it, an' get our asses outta
		here. This  Kurtz is ruining the
		war; I mean, this don't look
		good for America !

				WILLARD
			(lost in his thoughts)
		... he's an amazing officer.

				CHEF
		You got to kill this sonuvabitch
		-- Lance and me, we don'´t
		understand none of this -- Jesus,
		Captain -- I don't wanna die here
		-- Do it quick.

	Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of
	nods, sucking a joint.

				WILLARD
		Yeah. I know.

	He thinks.


	240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with
	the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard
	steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.


	241  WILLARD'S VIEW

	An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-
	quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the
	ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other
	military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,
	but have now fallen into decayed disuse.

	There are other indications of the modern headquarters
	this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-
	tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.
	There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with
	maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically
	garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil
	spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging
	fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche
	"Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."

	Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to
	Willard.

				MOONBY
		He's asleep -- don't bother him.

				KURTZ
		I'm awake.

	Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		You. Get out.

	Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with
	Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; suddenly)
		I said get the fuck out !
			(to himself)
		I'm going to kill the little
		weirdo myself tomorrow.
			(he shows some pain
			  when moving his
			  midsection)
		He´s only stayed alive this long
		because he's a good orderly and
		medic. He knows how to use a
		hypodermic.

				WILLARD
		You're gonna get hit tonight,
		bad -- a whole regiment of NVA
		regulars.

				KURTZ
		That's right, the little gook-
		pricks. But they are noble
		little gook-pricks, noble.
		Because they fight with their 
		guts, like animals. And for an
		idea ! That's rich. We fight
		with ingenious machines and
		fire, like Gods, and for nothing.
		But I'll call in a major blotto
		airstrike tonight. We'll have
		ourselves a helluva airstrike
		tonight, a lightshow. How do
		you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby
		Light My Fire...'

	Willard shrugs.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Do you?

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I like it...

				KURTZ
		I love it.

	He rests back, grinning.

				WILLARD
		You've gone crazy.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		No. My thinking is clear.
			(calmly)
		But my soul has gone mad.

	Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his
	stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He
	literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !

	Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the
	wound.


	242  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in,
	witnessing the proceedings inside.

				CHEF
			(muttering)
		Kill him -- come on, why don't
		you kill him


	243  INT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED, VIEW - KURTZ AND WILLARD -
	         NIGHT

	Willard examining the wound.

				KURTZ
			(in pain)
		Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.

	Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He
	takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing
	Kurtz and injects him with the drug.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; looking
			  up in pain)
		You see how stupid it would have
		been to blow out my brains? I'm
		dying from the gut anyway.

	Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly
	frightened, holds up his hand.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		No -- I don't want to sleep.
		I want to think. Water. Give
		me water.

				WILLARD
		You can't have water after
		morphine.

				KURTZ
		Still playing by the rules.
			(almost
			  affectionately)
		You're a damn good kiler.

				WILLARD
			(still holding the
			  second morphine)
		How's the pain?

				KURTZ
		How's yours?

				WILLARD
		I can handle it.

				KURTZ
		Pain is easy to handle -- but
		nobility.. the nobility of a
		man is judged by how much Truth
		he can handle.

				WILLARD
		What Truth?

				KURTZ
		The truth that you were sent
		here to murder me, ans so far
		you haven't done it. And do
		you know why?
			(looks at him)
		Yes, you know why.
			(he looks)
		Your mission makes about as much
		sense as those idiots who sent
		you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! 
		How long does it take you to
		figure out that nobody knows
		what they're doing here.
			(coldly)
		Except me.

	He rests back. The drug is beginning to take effect.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Gimme water.

				WILLARD
		No water.

				KURTZ
		You know what you're doing?
		You are interfering with my
		plans !

	He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches
	him impassively.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		This water's got Moonby's acid
		in it --

	He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all
	over. Then he throws the canteen to Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Drink it -- drink it for tonight.
		Think of it. A whole regiment
		of those shitty little Cong --
		War. Total war -- war like you've
		never known it. It's beautiful
		-- you'll love it. Trust me.


	244  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED. VIEW - LANCE AND CHEF - NIGHT

	We can SEE into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen
	to Willard. Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out.

				CHEF
		Lance -- the fucker's not gonna
		do it.

				KURTZ
		Goddamn -- You've gotta dig
		napalm on Speed, too. It's
		spectacular, you'll see.

	Lance stands up holding his M-16, looks into the cavern
	with Chef.


	245  INT. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his
	hand.

				KURTZ
		Look into the jungle. You can't --
		it's too terrible. You have to
		smear yourself with warpaint to
		look at it -- you have to be a
		cannibal.
			(whispered)
		That's why warpaint was invented.
		Then it becomes your jungle.

	Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine.

				WILLARD
		How did we get here?

				KURTZ
		Because of all the things we do,
		the thing we do best -- is lie.

				WILLARD
		I think think a lie stinks.

				KURTZ
		Oh Captain, that is so true.

				WILLARD
		Stinks. I could never figure --
			(he drinks from
			  the canteen)
		I could never figure how they
		can teach boys how to bomb villages
		with napalm -- and not let them
		write the word 'fuck' on their
		airplanes.

	Willard drinks more of the LSD water.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		You could never figure it because
		it doesn't make sense.

				WILLARD
		Fuck no.

				KURTZ
		I'll tell you what makes sense !
		Air strikes ! White Phosphorus !
		Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out
		of them if they don't do what
		we want.

				WILLARD
		We'll exterminate the fuckers !

	Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified.
	He draws his bayonet.

				CHEF
		Captain -- kill him.

				KURTZ
		Think of it -- for years, millions
		of years, savages with pathetic
		painted faces were scared shitless
		that fire would rain down from
		the sky. And goddamn, we made
		it happen. God  bless  Dow  !

				CHEF
		Kill him !

	Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively,
	Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic
	FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets.


	246  VIEW ON LANCE

	He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort
	of mindless, programmed killer.

				LANCE
			(FIRING)
		Hot damn !

	Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an
	instant of silence, then:


	247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT

	The DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming,
	as illuminating flares light up the blackness.


	248  MED. CLOSE VIEW

	of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of
	razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted
	out to the enemy, poised to attack.


	249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER

	Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay-
	onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting
	speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish
	in water pipes. One looks up to the sky.


	250  EIS VIEW

	A rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche-

				SOLDIER
		Wow...

	Another behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t
	himself.


	252  MED. VIEW ON THE GATE

	Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions
	around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior --
	Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans,
	even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow,
	salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates
	around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and
	purple.

	We SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of
	teeth around his neck, his face painted.

	and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some
	sort of cosmic flower.


	256  CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK)

	Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a

		Mini-gun. Colby. Sergeant.
		Mini-gun.


	262  MED. SHOT - MINI-GUN

	A SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted
	operates the mini-gun with several native helpers. SHELLS
	BURST  around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly
	loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid
	stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as
	7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of
	the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-
	geant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally
	as the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is
	blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell.

				KURTZ
		Claymores, claymores.

	The SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS
	penetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another.
	Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these. His face
	seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to
	another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv-
	ing in front of us.

	The SCREAMS of maimed and dismembered men almost pene-
	trates the INCREDIBLY LOUD MUSIC and we HEAR Kurtz's men
	LAUGHING and SCREAMING in delight.

	Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter.


	265  FULL SHOT - NVA CHARGE

	through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more
	extreme. They burn in the pools of luminescent napalm
	but press relentlessly on. SHELL BURSTS overhead. They
	chant to themselves as they advance. NVA have reached
	the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up.
	Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce
	weird psychedelic light. Blared out at tremendous vol-
	ume over and above the DIN OF BATTLE is LIGHT MY FIRE.


	266  FULL SHOT - WALL - EVERYBODY

	The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming.
	Spurred by MUSIC, they charge up. M-16's in both hands,
	blasting, kicking, bayoneting, gouging, splittin throats,
	biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most
	horrible savagery.


	267  MED. SHOT - WILLARD

	standing on the wall BLASTING as bodies fall around him;
	he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker, removes it with
	a foot and stabs another. From him he takes his AK47 and
	BLASTS more as they come.


	268  MED. SHOT - LANCE

	The VC rush his position. Willard trips a claymore that
	BLASTS most of them to shreads. More fill in. Lance
	opens up FULL AUTOMATIC . Willard and Lance move down to
	the nest wall, FIRING , bodies tumbling over.

	Lance is caught in a CROSSFIRE and hit several times.
	He pulls himself up -- FIRES a final BURST and then falls
	under the enemy's feet.


	269  VIEW ON MOONBY

	madly to himself.


	270  MED. VIEW - WILLARD AT THE R.T.

	shouting into the radio

				WILLARD
		Code -- Street Gang -- Street
		Gang ! Purgative air strike;
		Street Gang !

	He turns and runs back through the compound with the
	receding Montagnards. SHELLS are EXPLODING everywhere.
	The light patterns are fantastic. Men fall, Viets break
	over the walls and charge. They crouch and rip into
	them FULL AUTOMATIC. They break the charge and continue
	cutting their way through the NVA masses like torches 
	through metal.


	271  FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ

	Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain. Women
	and children rush upon him now. Kurtz flicks some switch-
	es and the whole north wall EXPLODES in overwhelming FIRE.
	The gates are uprooted. The stone lions tumble, crushing
	men below. Kurtz cocks an M-16 and walks off the bunker.


	272  VIEW ON WILLARD

	watching this spectacle.


	273  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - KURTZ

	He rounds  the shadow wall.

	Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a
	machine gun mount. They don't see him. He braces the gun
	at his side and steps out.

				KURTZ
			(yelling)
		Charles !

	They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one
	who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his
	gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his
	holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz
	beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He
	moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding
	it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls
	and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and
	rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly
	encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The
	machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty
	and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.


	274  MED. SHOT - LOW ANGLE - KURTZ

	taking swings with his rifle, standing atop the
	wall and battering the oncoming enemy like Davy Crockett
	at the Alamo.


	275  FULL VIEW - THE FORTRESS

	The air strike hits with all its force. Balls and rain
	of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything.
	It is the biggest firework show in history.

	The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it.
	Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the
	air strike continues. All around us is a spectacle of
	MUSIC and light and fire and overwhelming color.


	276  TRACKING SHOT ON WILLARD

	following Kurtz's trail in the mud. He has crawled on
	all fours back into the jungle to die. He stalks Kurtz
	into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the
	crawling Kurtz

				KURTZ
		Go away -- hide yourself.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing?

				KURTZ
		Going back  - to the jungle to
		die.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back. You can 
		still live.

				KURTZ
		I had immense plans.

				WILLARD
		I'm gonna get you out of here.

				KURTZ
		I was on threshold of great 
		things.

	Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck,
	holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The
	spectacle continues in the b.g.


	277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER

	This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls
	out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages
	to get him onto the boat.


	278  EXTREME FULL SHOT

	The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of
	Nu Mung Ba.

							FADE OUT.

	FADE IN.


	279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING

	The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds
	circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere
	is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and
	some Montagnards sit near them.

	Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and
	they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the
	field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something.
	Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the
	f.g. below is Lance, dead.

	Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair.

				COLBY
		Who is he?

				WILLARD
		He was the tragedy -- the tragedy
		of this war.

							CUT TO:


	280  THE P.B.R.

	battered, moving slowly down the river.


	281  TIGHTER VIEW

	Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious.
	Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those
	left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks.
	Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air.
	Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him.
	The battle is not over.

				KURTZ
		Don't. Don't frighten them away.

	Willard looks down at him.

				WILLARD
		So you understand this?

	Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his
	eyes. There is a slight smile.

				KURTZ
		Do I not?


	282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW

	The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river.

				KURTZ
		My river... my people... my jungle...
		my ideas... my country... 		
		my wife...
			(he looks at Willard)
		... my death.

				WILLARD
		You had immense plans... immense plans...

				KURTZ
		Yes...

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming
	intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper
	at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry
	that is no more than a breath.

				KURTZ
		The horror, the horror.

	We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching.
	The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up,
	craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.

				COLBY
		There.

	Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC
	helicopters hooping toward them.

				COLBY
			(continuing)
		How did they know?

				WILLARD
		They must have seen the fire.

	The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of
	them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US.

				COLBY
		They're coming to rescue us.
		They're Medevac.


	283  CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	He stares up at the sky.

				WILLARD
					(to himself)
		They're coming to take us back.

	Copters directly overhead.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Yeah.

				COLBY
		Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

	He raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap-
	proaching rescue helicopter.


	284  FULL SHOT - THE COPTER

	It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the
	sky.


	285  FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

	Colby takes his rifle and joins Willard in FIRING at
	the retreating American helicopters.


	286  HELICOPTER'S POV - ON THE BOAT

	The men in the boat FIRING AT US as we fly further into
	the air, the boat getting smaller and smaller.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		... Don't remember a lot about my
		rehabilitation... but I was sent
		back to the world before the fall
		of Saigon...


	287  EXT. MARINA DEL RAY - EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

	MOVING DOWN back to the pleasure boat at the Marina.

	Pause. Willard is very silent.

				WILLARD
		I never answered questions about
		Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his
		unimportant papers -- but for the
		most part I saved everything.
		There were other letters, personal
		ones written earlier to his wife.
		I brought them to het. I watched
		the fall of Saigon on television
		in a bar in Alameda...


	289  EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

	A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh-
	borhood. Some kids are playing in the street.

	Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past
	the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under
	his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working
	on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy
	looks back.

				WILLARD
		Hi.

	Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the
	door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in
	mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a
	sense of purity about her, though she is not young.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Come in, Captain Willard.

	He enters.


	289  INT. KURTZ'S HOME - DAY

	Everything good and secure and desirable about America.

	She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Can I get anything for you?

	There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many... but he is
	there in the various stages of his career.

	Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
			(continuing)
		Did you know him very well?

				WILLARD
		You get to know each other pretty
		well out there.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		And you admired him?

				WILLARD
		He was a remarkable man. It was
		impossible not to --

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Love him... Yes, it is true.
		That's the hard part for me... I
		knew him better than anyone ... I
		knew him best.

				WILLARD
		You knew him best.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		You were his friend... You must
		have been, if he had given you
		this...
			(the packet)
		If he sent you to his home. He
		was the best this country had --
		he was --

				WILLARD
		Yes, I know...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		I'll never get over it -- But
		I'll always remember him...

				WILLARD
		Both of us...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Men looked up to him...
			(she loses herself
			  in a thought)
		He died as he lived...

				WILLARD
		His death was -- yes, he died as
		he lived.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Were you with him, when...

				WILLARD
		Yes I was... He said his last
		words to me.

	Pause.


	290  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	A little of the madness is still with him. He knows what
	she will ask.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		What were they?


	291  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON KURTZ'S WIFE

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Tell me.


	292  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	remembering that incredible day moving down the river.

	Our VIEW LOOSENS

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Tell me what he said.

				KURTZ (V.O.)
		The horror ! The horror !

				WILLARD
		He spoke of you, ma'am.

	He sits there looking at her.


	293  EXT. TIGHT HIGH ANGLE ON THE MARINA DEL REY BOAT

	The cocktail party is breaking up. Willard is one of
	the few guests left.

	We MOVE FROM Willard standing alone on the deck of the
	boat. Moving back through the departing guests. Charlie
	is getting ready to leave himself. We MOVE CLOSER to
	Willard.

							DISSOLVE TO:


	294  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. - DAY

	the boat floating down the river. Kurtz's body; an exhaust-

	1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN

	It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through 
	the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the 
	trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.

	Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to 
	the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
	then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to 
	emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set 
	of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, 
	in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." 
	The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier 
	beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no 
	shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
	painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the 
	right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
	slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.

	Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though 
	unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
	We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
	swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
	in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
	As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow 
	and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
	in a paisley design.

	Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
	the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
	ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
	ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
	pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
	Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
	no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
	eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.

	The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
	AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
	about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
	and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
	casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
	laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
	US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out 
	with AUTOMATIC FIRE.

	Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
	screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
	appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
	we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
	Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
	feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
	savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
	they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
	They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
	bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
	They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
	as they move.

	The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
	mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.

	We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
	running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
	only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
	painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
	FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
	and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
	around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
	are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
	frightened.

	An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
	on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
	TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
	dead.

	OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
	Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
	stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
	with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
	and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
	and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
	bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
	electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :


		MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW


	2  TITLE SEQUENCE

	The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, 
	growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
	transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
	look at, like the sun itself.

	Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
	again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
	is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
	cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
	distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
	stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
	MUSIC  now.

	We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
	as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.

	We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
	close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
	CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
	Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like
	shapes of :


	3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY

	The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
	cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

	It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
	bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
	cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
	head of a large American Corporation, and this is his
	party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
	catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
	smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
	paint. Charlie is going on and on :

				CHARLIE
		... It's crazy -- sugar is up to
		200 dollars a ton -- sugar !

				LAWYER
		What about oil ?

				CHARLIE
		Food, oil --look, let me show you
		something. This is the economy of
		the United States in two years --

	He takes a newspaper, draws a circle.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		This is West Germany.
			(he draws another,
			 bigger circle)
		This is Japan.
			(another , bigger)
		This is Italy.
			(a dot)
		This is Iran.
			(a very big circle)
		And this is Saudi Arabia... In
		two years ?
			(a gigantic circle)
		Do you understand ?

				ACCOUNTANT
		What's to prevent it ?

				CHARLIE
		Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you,
		I didn't build a two-billion-dollar
		company in the last twenty years
		by doing nothing. We can protect
		our interests.
			(pause, for a drink)
		We are still the most powerful
		nation in the world. Militarily.

	He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		You know bodyguard; he was a
		captain in Viet Nam. You talk to
		him, except he won't talk. This
		kind of man can kill you with his
		pinky. A nice quiet fella, though.

	The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.

				CHARLIE
			(continuing)
		Carries a attache case at all
		times. You know what's in it ?
			(another sip)
		An Ingram Machine pistol.

	Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a
	NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

		CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.)
	I don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit. You can kill
	neither should this country.			with the ridge of your

	The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :
	Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the
	good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The attache case has been empty
		for three years, but it makes him
		safe to think there's a machine
		pistol in it.

		I don't like automatic weapons.
		They jam.

		I saw a friend of mine get
		ripped open because he flicked his
		M-16 to automatic, and it jammed.
		How much money did the contractors
		make on the M-16 ?

	Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some
	reading, flirting, drinking.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		He likes to hear stories about Nam.
		I tell him I can't; they're not
		cleared. The truth is he wouldn't
		understand.

	We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the
	opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We 
	MOVE CLOSER.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There's no way I can tell them...
		what really happened over there.

		I wouldn't've believed it if
		someone'd told me.

	We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips
	from a beer, but we cannot see his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		There was only one part that
		mattered -- for me, anyway. I
		don't even know if I remember
		all of it. I can't remember
		how it ended, exactly -- because
		when it ended I was insane.

							DISSOLVE TO :

	4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY

	A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and
	shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.
	Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.
	WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed
	by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his
	shoes and sell him things.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		But I know how it started
		for me -- I was on R. and R.
		in Saigon; my first time south
		of the DMZ in three months. I
		wasn't sure, but I thought this
		guy was following me.

	Willard looks back.


	5  HIS VIEW

	an American CIVILIAN.


	6  MED. VIEW

	Willard ducks into a bar.


	7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY

	Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few
	tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly
	crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly
	past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching
	sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

	An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of
	drinks and approaches Willard's table.

				CAPTAIN
		How about a drink ?

				WILLARD
		Sure, thanks.

	He sits down at the table with the drinks.

				CAPTAIN
		Winning the war by yourself.

				WILLARD
			(he calls for the waiter)
		Part.

				CAPTAIN
		Which part is that ?

				WILLARD
		My part.
			(TO THE WAITER)
		Beer, with ice and water.

	   
				CAPTAIN
		That's good gin.

				WILLARD
		I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.

				CAPTAIN
		Delta ?

				WILLARD
		No.

				CAPTAIN
		North ?

				WILLARD
		Yeah. Way north.

				CAPTAIN
		What unit were you with ?

				WILLARD
		None.

				CAPTAIN
		Rangers, eh?

				WILLARD
		Sort of.

	The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over
	his shoulder.

				CAPTAIN
		Were you Longe Range Recon --

				WILLARD
		No -- I worked too far north for
		LRRP.

	He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the
	Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard
	notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,
	then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.

				CAPTAIN
		That's quite an array of ribbons...

				WILLARD
		Let's talk about you.

				CAPTAIN
		I was an FO for the 25th.

				WILLARD
		Tracks ?

				CAPTAIN
		Yeah.

				WILLARD
		Fat. That's real fat.

				CAPTAIN
		Sometimes.

				WILLARD
		At least you always have enough
		water. How many gallons does
		each one of those damn things
		carry ?

				CAPTAIN
		Thirty -- sometimes fifty.

				WILLARD
		You know, I can remember once,
		getting back below the DMZ -- and
		the first Americans we ran into
		were a track squadron. I just
		couldn't believe how much water
		they had. We'd been chewing
		bamboo shoots for almost a week,
		and before that, for two weeks,
		we'd been drinking anything --
		rain water, river shit, stuff
		right out of the paddies. And
		there were these guys standing
		by their trucks spilling water
		all over. I could've killed them.
			(solemnly)
		I swear to God I would have, too,
		if ...

				CAPTAIN
		I didn't know we had units up
		there in North Vietnam.

				WILLARD
		We do.

				CAPTAIN
		How long were you up there ?

				WILLARD
		A long time.

				CAPTAIN
		A year ? Waiter another beer.

				WILLARD
		I go up on missions. Listen
		Captain, buy me all the beer
		you want, but you better tell
		that asshole over there you're
		not going to find out anymore
		about me.

	Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the
	Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.
	He rises and comes over to the bar.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		What do you want ?

				CIVILIAN
			(indicating the Army jeep)
		If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon
		Group, we'd like you to come with
		us.

				WILLARD
		Whose orders ?

				CAPTAIN
		Headquarters 11 Corps -- 405th
		A.S.A Battalion -- S-2 --
		Com-Sec -- Intelligence --
		Nha Trang.

				WILLARD
		Who are you ?

				CIVILIAN
		The agency.

	Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks
	roght out toward the jeep without saying another word.
	The Civilian follows.


	8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

	A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle
	before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed
	wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily
	fortified, concealed compound.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		They took me to some place outside
		Nha Trang... Intelligence Headquarters
		for all operations in South East Asia.
		I'd worked for Intelligence before --

	Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A
	large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground
	corridor -- they enter.


	9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM

	A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to
	attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange
	reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic
	maps and filled with smoke.

	The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself
	and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly
	reclaiming it.

				WILLARD
		Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters,
		reporting as ordered, sir.

				COLONEL (O.S.)
		Okay, Willard, sit down.

	Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a
	bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks
	and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL
	puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind
	him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.

				COLONEL
		Have you ever seen this officer
		before, Captain Willard ?

	He points to the Major.

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		This gentleman or myself ?

				WILLARD
		No, sir.

				COLONEL
		I believe on your last job you
		executed a tax collector in Kontum,
		is that right ?

				WILLARD
		I am not presently disposed to
		discuss that, sir.

				MAJOR
		Very good.

	He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The
	Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.

				COLONEL
		You know much about about Special Forces;
		Green Berets, Captain ?

				WILLARD
		I've worked with them on occasions
		and I saw the movie , sir.

	The officer smiles at this.

				COLONEL
		Then you can appreciate Command's
		concern over their -- shall we say
		'erratic' methods of operation.
			(pause)
		I have never favored elite units,
		Captain, including your paratroopers
		or whatever. Just because a man
		jumps out of an airplane or wears
		a silly hat doesn't give him any
		priviliges in my book -- not in
		this man's army.

				MAJOR
		We didn't need 'em in Korea --
		no sir, give me an Ohio farm boy
		and an M-1 Garand, none of this
		fancy crap -- no sir.

				CIVILIAN
			(stopping him)
		Major.

				COLONEL
		We have Special Forces A
		detachments all along the
		Cambodian border. Two here and
		another one here -- twelve or
		fourteen Americans -- pretty
		much on their own; they train
		and motivate Montagnard natives;
		pick their own operations. If
		they need something, they call 
		for it, and get it within
		reason. What we're concerned
		with is here.


	10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP

				COLONEL
		The A detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
		It was originally a larger base,
		built up along the river in an
		old Cambodian fortress.
	
		The area has been relatively
		quiet for the past two years --
		but --


	11  MED VIEW

				COLONEL
		... Captain, we know something's
		going on up there -- Major --

	The Major looks at some papers in front of him.

				MAJOR
		Communications naturally dwindled
		with the lack of V.C. activity,
		this is routine, expected ... but
		six months ago communication
		virtually stopped.

				COLONEL
		About the same time -- large numbers
		of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent
		began leaving the area -- this in
		itself is not unusual since these
		people have fought with the Rhade
		Tribe that lived in the area for
		centuries. But what is unusual is
		that we began to find Rhade refugees
		too -- in the same sampans as the
		M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid
		of V.C. They've put up with war
		for twenty years -- but something
		is driving them out.

				MAJOR
		We communicate with the base
		infrequently. What they call for
		are air strikes, immediate --
		always at night. And we don't
		know what or who the air strikes
		are called on.

				WILLARD
		Who ?

				MAJOR
		You see, no one has really gone
		into this area and come back alive.

				WILLARD
		Why me ?

				MAJOR
		Walter Kurtz, Lieutenant Colonel,
		Special Forces. We understand
		you knew him.

	He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				COLONEL
		He's commanding the detachment
		at Nu Mung Ba.

	The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,
	flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the
	AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target
	coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military.
	Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like
	someone dumb, except very fast.

				VOICE (ON TAPE)
		Up 2 -- 0 -- give it to me quick --
		Mark flare -- affirmative damn --
		Immediate receive -- hearing
		automatic weapons fire man ...

	GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background.

				SECOND VOICE
		Blue Delta five
		This Big Rhine -- three
		Need that ordinance immediately
		Goddamn give it to me immediate
		Christ -- Big Rhino --
		Blue God -- Delta damn -- goddamn.

	A heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER
	-- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK
	MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE
	peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words.

				THIRD VOICE
		This is Big Rhino six -- Blue Delta.

				MAJOR
		That's Colonel Kurtz.

				KURTZ (V.O.)
		I want that napalm dropped in the
		trees -- spread it among the
		branches.

		We'll give you a flare -- an
		orange one -- bright orange.
			(STATIC)
		We'd also like some white phosporous,
		Blue Delta. White phosporous, give
		it to me.

	STATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off.

				WILLARD
		I only met Kurtz once.

				CIVILIAN
		Would he remember you ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				COLONEL
		What was your impression of him ?

	Willard shrugs.

				CIVILIAN
		You didn't like him.

				WILLARD
		Anyone got a cigarette.

	The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I thought he was a lame.

				COLONEL
		A lame ?

				WILLARD
		This is years ago, before he
		joined Special Forces, I guess.
		We had an argument.

				COLONEL
		About what ?

				WILLARD
		I don't know. He was a lame,
		that's all.

				COLONEL
		But why ?

				WILLARD
		He couldn't get through a
		sentence without all these
		big words; about why we kill.

				COLONEL
		Well, he's killing now.

				WILLARD
		Maybe.

				CIVILIAN
		What does that mean ?

				WILLARD
		Maybe it's not Kurtz. I don't
		believe he's capable of that.
		I just don't believe it.

				COLONEL
		It's got to be Kurtz.

				CIVILIAN
		The point is that Kurtz or
		somebody attacked a South
		Vietnamese Ranger Platoon three
		days ago. Last week a Recon
		helicopter was lost in the area --
		another took heavy damage --
		direct fire from their base
		camp.

				WILLARD
		Our Recon flight ?

				CIVILIAN
		Ours.

				WILLARD
		Touchy.

				CIVILIAN
		You can see, of course, the
		implications, if any of this --
		even rumours leaked out.

				WILLARD
		You want me to clean it up --
		simple and quiet.

				CIVILIAN
		Exactly -- you'll go up the
		Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. --
		appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by
		accident, re-establish your
		acquintance with Colonel Kurtz,
		find out what's happened -- and
		why. Then terminate his command.

				WILLARD
		Terminate ?

				CIVILIAN
		Terminate with extreme prejudice.


	12  FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA

	A waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and
	divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms.

	A Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area.
	This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily
	armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple
	military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle-
	dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet,
	M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard.


	13  MED. VIEW

	We hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE.
			
				WILLARD (V.O.)
		I met the P.B.R. crew; they were
		pretty much all kids, except for
		Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's
		Mate Third Class L. Johnson --
		Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate
		Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef --
		Radio Operator Second Class T.
		Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.

				WILLARD
		Chief, try to keep out of where
		we're going -- Why we're goin' and
		what's gonna be the big surprise.

				CHIEF
		All right with me, I used to drive
		a taxi.

				WILLARD
		Let's go.

	The Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard
	and otherwise go about their work.

	The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from
	the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward
	twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards
	on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads
	to the ocean.

							DISSOLVE TO :



	14  FULL VIEW - STORMY SEA

	The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the
	top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another.


	15  MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF

	Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale.
	Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The
	Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs
	back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just
	stares ahead into space, swallowing.

							DISSOLVE TO :



	16  LONG SHOT - BOAT DUSK

	The dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds --
	the sea is calm again.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	17  VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST

	The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him.

				CHIEF
		The Delta closes off to us about
		ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll
		be able to pick up some supplies --
		bit I think there are only two
		points we can draw enough water
		to get into the Nung River. It's
		all Charlie's turf from there on
		out.

				WILLARD
		We're gonna have some help to
		get in the river. You know
		these waters, Chief ?

				CHIEF
		'Bout six months ago I took a man
		up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was
		regular Army too. Shot himself
		in the head. I brought his body 
		back down.

				WILLARD
		Shot himself. What for ?

				CHIEF
		Beats me -- the sun was too much
		for him, or the mud. Who knows ?

	Pause, looking at Willard.


	18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD

	Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow
	buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out
	and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There
	is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All
	the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up
	and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills
	beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all
	stand silently -- suddenly it stops.

				WILLARD
		Arch light.

				CHEF
		I hate that -- Every time I hear
		that noise something terrible 
		happens.

				CHIEF
		Anybody see some smoke ?

				CLEAN
		Too far inland.

				LANCE
		There they are.

	He points up to the sky.


	19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY

	Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE
	the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor
	trails streaming white against the dark blue sky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not
		till it's too late -- don't have
		to hit you neither, concussion'll
		do it for a quarter mile or better.
		Burst your ears -- suck the air
		outta your lungs.


	20  FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW

	They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned.
	He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He
	flips through the letters and other documents.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier on A detachment had
		letters from Kurtz' wife and the
		wives and families of his men.
		All asking where to send future
		mail, understanding the necessery
		silence due to the nature of
		their work -- None of the men had
		written home in half a year.

	Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting
	of the distant B-52 BOMBING.


	21  CLOSE - ON WILLARD

	studying, examining a report.


	22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ

	Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his
	career as represented in the pictures in the dossier,
	as Willard reads :

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a
		dedicated and well-disciplined
		spirit. He is a fine officer,
		combining military efficiency --
		with a broad background in the
		Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ...

	Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the
	161st Petroleum Supply Group sign.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... He views his military career
		as the dedication of his talents
		to bringing our values and way of
		life to those darker, less
		fortunate areas in the world.

	A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... I feel Captain Kurtz' request
		for Special Forces training is
		highly unusual in regard to his
		past humanitarian concerns, and
		his somewhat liberal politics,
		though I can see no reason to
		deny it.

	A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam
	jungle. His face is blank and vacant.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... We feel Major Kurtz' need to
		bring a sense of Western culture
		to the backward peoples of these
		areas will be of use in
		accordance with our 'Vietnamization'
		programs ...

	MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just
	a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		One day later we came to an
		advanced staging area along the
		coast. This was our last chance
		to pick up supplies before
		approaching the mouth of the
		Nung River.
		 
	The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load-
	ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera-
	tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist."

	Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers --
	helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds
	advanced staging areas like the Americans.

	As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices
	something.

				LANCE
		Hey.

	They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water-
	skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at
	one another.


	24  VIEW ON THE DOCK

	The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings.

				CHIEF
		Lance -- I want you to go with the
		Captain an' get three extra drums
		of fuel and maybe scrounge some
		more 50 caliber.

				LANCE
		Yeah -- look at those uniforms.


	25  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and
	pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the
	airplane.

				CHIEF
		Poor bastards, have a long year
		to go.

	The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of
	Advanced Infantry Training to back them up.


	26  FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW

	They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill-
	ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard.

				SERGEANT
		I don't know anything about these
		papers, sir.

				WILLARD
		They're in order -- it's perfectly
		clean -- just check with ComSec-
		Intel like I said.

				SERGEANT
		Well, you know I don't have the
		priority to do that, sir. It
		says here not to contact Com-Sec-
		Int. Who's your commanding 
		officer ?

				WILLARD
		Right now -- I am.

				SERGEANT
		Well who the hell verifies that ?

				WILLARD
		I do.

	He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused.

				CHIEF
		No shit -- what's all the activity
		for around here ?

				SERGEANT
		The show --

				WILLARD
		What show ?

				SERGEANT
		Big show in the parade grounds
		this noon -- some boss stuff --

				WILLARD
		This -- Bob Hope or the like --

				SERGEANT
		No sir, I think -- this'll be a
		little bit different --

				CHIEF
		Where's it gonna be ?

	He points --


	27  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL

	A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is
	surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and
	garnished with concertina wire. It is empty --

							DISSOLVE TO :


	28  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

	The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the
	wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some
	of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in
	the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to
	see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far
	surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,
	or child-molester. To counter their need of course are
	the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing
	this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the
	lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep-
	herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so
	armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire.


	29 FORWARD AREA

	jammed in the crowd

				CHEF
		It's really too much -- I mean
		I've collected every picture of
		her since she was Miss December.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- you can really get hung
		up on them like the cat in the
		Delta.

				CHIEF
		What cat  ?

				CLEAN
		One that went up for murder -- he
		was an Army Sergeant.

				CHIEF
		I never heard about that.

				CLEAN
		Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy
		mag, man -- I mean like he was there
		when it arrived -- He just knew.

				CHEF
		So what happened ?

				CLEAN
		He was working A.R.V.N. patrols
		and had one a them little cocky
		gook asshole Lieutenants -- anyhow,
		the Lieutenant took his new Playboy
		one day, sat on the end of the dock,
		and wouldn't give it back.

				CHEF
		Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.

				CLEAN
		Then went too far -- he sat
		there and starts mutilating the
		centerfold. Poking pins in her an'
		all that. Sergeant says, don't do
		her like that. You leave your
		shitty little hands off that girl.
		Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in
		Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't
		do that again. You'll wish you
		hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked
		his iron to rock and roll and gave
		the little zero a long burst
		through the Playboy mag. Man, it
		blew him clean off the dock --
		Hell, just the magazine was floatin'
		there all full of holes.

				CHIEF
		They nail him for it bad ?

				CLEAN
		He's in the L.B.J. -- didn't
		give him no medals or nothing --

	In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND
	MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching.
	All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the
	pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment.
	On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large
	Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a
	strange silence descends over the men. The door of the
	copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets
	step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this
	abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He
	is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed
	impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal
	but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his
	presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely
	quiet the man.

	He walks over to the microphone.

				AGENT
		I'd like to say hello from all of
		us up here, to all of you out there.
		All of you who've worked so hard
		during Operation Brute Force --
		Paratroopers -- Infantry -- Airmen
		-- Medics -- Marines -- and Sailors.
		And I want you to know that we feel
		proud of you and know how hard your
		job is. To prove it -- we've brought
		some entertainment we think you're
		gonna like: The Playmate of the Year
		and her two runners up !

	He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful
	sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start
	dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing
	"Suzy Q."


	30  MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN

	VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic
	manner -- smiling.

	The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some
	look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean
	cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental
	tenderness.

	Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement
	their need increases by the square.


	31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN

	They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the
	wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget
	-- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges
	forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,
	which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he
	has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke
	grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,
	then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black
	Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach
	it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The
	Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below.

	Such are the ways of war.

							CUT TO:


	32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY

	The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline.
	There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no
	boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days out of Hau Fat, there was
		nothing but us and the coastline.
		I felt like I had set off for
		the center of the earth...

	Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead.

				CHIEF
		Smoke !

				WILLARD
		Where ?

	They all turn. Chief points up the coast.


	33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE

	A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle.

				WILLARD
		Black smoke ... secondary burning.

	The Chief grabs field glasses.

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- fishing village --
		helicopters over there. Hueys,
		lots of 'em.

				WILLARD
		First Air Cavalry. They're the
		ones gonna get us into the River.


	34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE

	A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm
	trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts
	-- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the
	surf.


	35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW

	They wade through the water to the beach where they are
	met by a heavily armed group of men.

	Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning
	out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men.

	We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the
	Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it.


	36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with
	machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out-
	side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising
	a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters
	pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump
	from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,
	strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and
	neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE
	-- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.

	He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It
	is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He
	walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and
	with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle.
	His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line
		back about a hundred yards -- give
		me some room to breathe.

	A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off.


	37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	He was not quite prepared for this.


	38  VIEW ON KILGORE

	turning to his GUARDS

				KILGORE
		Bring me some cards.

				GUARD
		Sir ?

				KILGORE
		Body cards, you damn fool --
		cards !

	The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new
	packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other
	soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are
	well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual
	about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks
	up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance.

				WILLARD
			(formally)
		Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th
		Recon Group -- I carry priority
		papers from Com-Sec Intelligence
		11 Corp -- I believe you understand
		the nature of my mission.

				KILGORE
			(not looking up)
		Yeah -- Na Trang told me to
		expect you -- we'll see what we
		can do. Just stay out of my way
		till this is done, Captain.

	He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the
	deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides
	right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The
	others follow,


	39  TRACKING VIEW

	The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of
	devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore
	comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on
	it -- carefully picking out which card he uses.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		Six a spades -- eight a hearts --
		Isn't one worth a Jack in this
		whole place.

	The Colonel goes on about this business.


	40  TRACKING ON KILGORE

	moving through the corpses, dropping the cards.

	On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers
	something to him. He stops.

				KILGORE
		What ? Here. You sure?

	The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down
	the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the
	young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t
	Willard.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's your name, sailor ?

		Gunner's Mate, Third Class --
		L. Johnson, sir.

				KILGORE
		Lance Johnson? The surfer?

				LANCE
		That's right, sir.

	Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand.

				KILGORE
		It's an honor to meet you Lance.
		I've admired your nose-riding for
		years -- I like your cutback, too.
		I think you have the best cutback
		there is.

				LANCE
		Thank you, sir.

				KILGORE
		You can cut out the sir, Lance --
		I'm Bill kilgore -- I'm a goofy
		foot.


	41 VIEW ON WILLARD

	His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the
	background.

				KILGORE (O.S.)
		This is Mike from San Diego and
		Johnny from Malibu -- they're good
		solid surfers -- none of us are
		anywhere near your class, though.

	Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks.

				WILLARD
		My orders are from Com-Sec
		Intel -- B.L. Willard, 4th Recon --

				KILGORE
		Just hold up a second, Captain --
		I'll get to you soon enough --
		We've got things to do here.

	Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on
	Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in-
	discriminately on the bodies as they talk.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we do a lot of surfing around
		here. Like to finish up operations
		early and fly down to Vung Tau for
		the evening glass. Have you ever
		surfed the point at Vung Tau? I
		liked the beach breaks around Na
		Trang a lot -- good lefts.

	He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five
	bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		... we keep three boards in my
		Command Huey at all times. You
		never can tell when you're gonna
		run into something good. I got a
		guy in Cam Rau Bay that can predict
		a swell two days in advance. We
		try to work it in.

	He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who
	has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in
	horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Hell, that's an Ace if I ever saw
		one.

	He puts the card in the gaping mouth.


	42  CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG

	We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead
	Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card
	has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above
	it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE.

				KILGORE
		Where've you been riding, Lance?

				LANCE
		I haven't surfed since I got here.

				KILGORE
		That's terrible -- we'll change 
		that -- I'd like to see you work --
		I've always liked your cutback;
		got a hell of a left turn, too.

	43  EXT. THE HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT

	Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by
	a table set up in front of the command copter.

	Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil
	drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY
	BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell you wanna go up
		to Nu Mung Ba for?

				WILLARD
		I got bored in Saigon.

				KILGORE
		What's the furthest you been
		in?

				WILLARD
		Haiphong.

				KILGORE
		Haiphong? Shit, you jump in ?

				WILLARD
		No. Walked.

				KILGORE
		What'd you do for supplies?

				WILLARD
			(he shrugs)
		Mercenaries -- agents, traitors --
		they put out caches.

				KILGORE
		Can you trust them?

				WILLARD
		No. They put out two or three
		for every one I needed. When
		you get to the one you'll use,
		you just stake it out. If
		something feels wrong, you just
		pass it up. On one mission, I
		had to pass up three and ended
		up living on rats and chocolate
		 bars.

				KILGORE
		Nu Mung Ba. Last I heard, Walter
		Kurtz commanded a Green Beret
		detachment at Nu Mung Ba.

				WILLARD
		When did you hear?

				KILGORE
		'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz
		still alive?

				WILLARD
		Who knows.

				KILGORE
		Seems to me he got himself
		fragged. i heard some grunt
		rolled a grenade in his tent.
		Maybe a rumor. Helluva man --
		remarkable officer. Walter
		Kurtz woulda been a General
		some day. General of the Army.
		Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs
		of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		Don't you agree?

				WILLARD
		He musta changed !
			(pointing to the map)
		I got to get into the Nung
		River, here or here.

				KILGORE
		That village you're pointing at
		is kinda hairy.

				WILLARD
		Hairy ?

				KILGORE
		I mean it's hairy -- they got some
		pretty heavy ordnance, boy --
		I've lost a few recon ships in
		there now and again.

				WILLARD
		So? I heard you had a good bunch
		of killers here.

				KILGORE
		And I don't intend to get some of
		them chewed up just to get your
		tub put in the mouth of the
		goddman Nung River. You say you
		don't know Kurtz?

				WILLARD
		I met him.

				KILGORE
		You talk like him. I don't
		mind taking casualties,
		Captain, but I like to keep
		my ratio ten to one in this
		unit -- ten Cong to one.

				WILLARD
		You'll find enough Cong up there.

				KILGORE
		What about this point here?

	He puts his finger on the map.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		What's the name of that goddamn
		village -- Vin Drin Dop or Lop; damn gook
		names all sound the same.

	He motions to one of his surfers.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Mike, you know anything about
		the point at Vin Drip Drop?

				MIKE
		Boss left.

				KILGORE
		What do you mean?

				MIKE
		It's really long left slide,
		breaks on the short side of the
		point -- catches a south swell.

				LANCE
		Nice.

	Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore.

				KILGORE
		Why the hell didn't you tell me
		about that place -- a good left.
			(to Willard)
		There aren't any good left slides
		in this whole, shitty country.
		It's all goddamn beach break.

				MIKE
		It's hairy ,though. That's
		where we lost McDonnel -- they
		shot the hell out of us. It's
		Charlie's point.

				KILGORE
		How big it is?

				MIKE
		Six to eight feet.

	Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters.

				KILGORE
			(to himself)
		A six-foot left.

	Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea.

				LANCE
		Boss. What's the wind like.

				MIKE
		Light off shore -- really hollow.

				WILLARD
		We could go in tomorrow at dawn
		-- there's always off-shore wind
		in the morning.

				CHIEF
		The draft of that river might be
		too shallow on the point.

				KILGORE
		Hell, we'll pick your boat up and
		lay it down like a baby, right
		where you want it. This is the
		Cav boy -- airmobile. I can
		take that point and hold it as
		long as I like -- and you can
		get anywhere you want up that
		river that suits you, Captain.
		Hell, a six foot left.
			(he turns to an advisor)
		You take a gunship back to division
		-- Mike, take Lance with you -- let
		him pick out a board, and bring me
		my Yater Spoon -- the eight six.

				TOM
		I don't know, sir -- it's -- it's --

				KILGORE
			(hard)
		What is it?

				TOM
		Well, I mean it's hairy in there
		-- it's Charlie's point.

	Kilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated.

				WILLARD
		Charlie don't surf.


	44  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS - DAWN

	What seems like hundreds of Hueys standing, their rotors
	churning a great wind -- Inside, the men of the 1st

	CLOSE SHOTS of the three surfboards strapped below the

	And finally, CLOSE SHOTS of the men -- nervous, excited
	very few of them really scared -- they fondle their

	50  INT. COMMAND COPTER

	Kilgore cranes his neck and almost leans out to watch

				KILGORE
			(to Willard)
		We'll come in low out of the rising

		Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares

	Sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being
	unloaded. We SEE bunkers with N.V.A. regulars ambling
	about.

	Suddenly we HEAR the distant MUSIC -- Everyone stops;

	from huts bearing ammunition and rifles -- Everywhere
	there is activity to prepare for the defense of the

	60  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

	POV behind lead gunship. They ROAR in over the beach
	streaming FIRE from doors, pods and nose -- The ground

	61  MED. SHOT - ANTI-AIRCRAFT EMPLACEMENT

	EXPLOSIONS crash around -- the MUSIC and SOUND of the

		Fine... fine... little higher.
		Through the roof; yeah, that's

				LIEUTENANT
		You didn't tell me to, sir.

	Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass
	SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore
	is thrown down where he hangs on.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt?

				WILLARD
		Automatic weapons flashes along

				KILGORE
		Hold it, boy.

	He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings
	back inside.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Take her up to 300 feet,
		Lieutenant.

	They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for
	all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who
	steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's
	harness.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Rifle.

	A hand passes him a M-16.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; hard)
		My rifle, soldier.

	There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300
	Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl
	inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and
	opens the bolt.


	71  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Amazed at these proceedings.


	72  VIEW ON KILGORE

	as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets

	73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C.

	He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud.
	The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him

	74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

	Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes
	careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy.

				SOLDIER  (O.S.)
		That's 27, sir.

	trance and charge the Americans. The SHOOTING is at
	point blank range -- automatic, as the V.C. are cut
	down.


	77  INT. COMMAND COPTER - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE, ETC.

	Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle-
	field. He has the R.T.

	He leans back, deliberately avoiding Willard to speak
	to Lance.

				KILGORE
		The L.Z.'s cooling off fast --
		we'll move in another company
		an' then we'll own it.
			(he laughs to himself)
		Charlie's point.

	He looks out toward the ocean.

		Good swell.

				LANCE
		What, sir?

				KILGORE
		I said it's a good swell -- hell
		of a good swell 'bout six feet.
		Let's get a look at it.

	Lance looks at Willard and then agrees.


	78  FULL SHOT - COPTER, SURF

	The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply
	and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in  low
	over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up
	green wall as if surfing it. They tip up over and up
	at the last minute as the wave breaks.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	79  FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS

	Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A.
	regular troops outside a burning hut. GUNFIRE is
	DISTANT and sporadic -- an occasional MORTAR round
	SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a
	southern accent and the prisoners are marched away.
	Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons
	emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three
	Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind.
	The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM
	over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another
	Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's. The
	doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and
	out steps Kilgore and Lance. From the other copter
	are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the
	P.B.R. crew. Willard follows.


	80  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	They stride out across the debris-strewn beach. Kilgore
	stands majestically on the point watching the waves. A
	SHELL SCREAMS overhead.

				SOLDIER
		Incoming !

	They all dive, except Kilgore. He is watching a big set
	-- the SHELL EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards
	away, sending up a huge geyser of spray. Kilgore is
	unmoved.

				KILGORE
		Look at that.

	They look.

				LANCE
		This  L.Z. is still pretty hot,
		sir, maybe we oughta stand
		somewhere else.

	Kilgore pays him no mention.

				WILLARD
		I'm waiting for the fucking boat,
		Colonel.

				KILGORE
			(without looking)
		It'll get here, soldier.

	He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the
	sand.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		Change.

				MIKE
		Wh -- what?

				KILGORE
		Change -- get out there -- I
		want'a see if it's ridable --
		change.

				MIKE
		It's still pretty hairy, sir.

				KILGORE
			(bellowing)
		You want'a surf, soldier?

	He nods yes meakly.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		That's good, boy, because it's
		either surf or fight.

	They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an M-1 from
	one of the guards. They all think he's going to
	shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna cover for 'em -- that's
		all.

	He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The
	Colonel walks over.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		You think that section on the
		 point is ridable, Lance?

				LANCE
		I think we ought to wait for
		the tide to come in.

	A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except
	for Kilgore. It EXPLODES throwing sand through the
	air. Kilgore leans down yelling over the NOISE.

				KILGORE
		Doesn't happen for six hours.

	Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto
	his helmet.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The tide -- doesn't come in for
		six hours.

	81  FULL SHOT - SURF - MIKE AND JOHNNY

	They walk through shallows carrying brightly
	colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM
	overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by
	carrying out wounded.

	They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's
	shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned
	on the boards along the word "Airmobile". They edge
	into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak.


	82  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the
	beautiful waves breaking beyond them.

	83  CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE

	They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing
	hard and constantly looking around scared out of their
	minds.


	84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE

	Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance
	kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole.

				KILGORE
		They far enough?

				LANCE
		Sure -- fine --

	Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from
	a waiting lackey.

				KILGORE
			(through megaphone)
		That's far enough -- pick one
		up and come on in --


	85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS

	They line themselves up on the point. A good set is
	building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off
	-- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a
	tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking
	around frantically.


	86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE

	Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach.
	Lance looks over at Willard.

		What?

				LANCE
		Maybe he'll get inside the tube --
		where -- where they can't see him.

	A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in.
	
				WILLARD
		Incoming !

	Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS
	SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore
	looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water
	are HEARD.

				KILGORE
		Son of a bitch.

	Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror.


	87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

	Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down
	on the waves.


	88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE

				LANCE

		The tragedy of this war is a

	Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy,
	too.

				WILLARD
		What's that?

				LANCE
		Just something I read in the
		Free Press.

				KILGORE
		They just missed a good set --
		the chicken shits !

	Lance looks up.


	89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS

	They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke
	hangs over the water.

				KILGORE (O.S.)

		Try it again, you little bastards.


	90  BACK TO SCENE

	He turns to Willard.

				KILGORE

		I´m not afraid to surf this place.
		I'll surf this place.


	91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE

	He turns, glowering to his lackeys.

			(continuing)
		Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels --
		Goddamit, I want that treeline
		bombed -- yeah -- napalm --
		gimme some napalm -- son of a
		bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z.
		or C.B.U.'s if you got any of
		them -- just bomb 'em into the
		Stone Age, boy.

	He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO
	WHISTLES over -- everyone drops.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; to himself)
		Son of a bitch.

	As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore
	raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the
	general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un-
	intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his
	rifle turning to Lance --

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		We'll have this place cleaned up
		and ready for us in a jiffy, boy.
		Don't you worry.

	He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead.



	92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS

	A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us --
	The P.B.R. hangs below it.

	The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight
	alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending
	copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows.
	The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists
	-- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still
	going on around them. They all look up as a wadge
	of PHANTOMS streak over low and peel off one by one to
	begin their bombing run.


	93  FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE

	Phantoms RAKE the trees with 20 mm CANNONS -- FIRE five
	inch ROCKETS in salvo -- "Bull Pup" MISSILES -- drop
	H.E. (high explosives) and C.B.U's (Cluster Bomb Units)
	and finally an immense amount of NAPALM.


	94  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean
	and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so-
	often when an EXPLOSION hits nearby. The boat begins
	to back out of the shallows. The EXPLOSIONS of NAPALM
	are reflected on their faces; the ROAR of the FIRE drowns
	out almost everything.

				CHIEF
		Forget that extra drum -- it's
		too damn hot.

				CLEAN
		Clear on starboard -- Where's
		Lance an' the Captain?

				CHIEF
		I saw that Colonel's Huey on the
		point --

	Two HELICOPTERS SCREAM over FIRING ROCKETS.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		Let's just get outta here.


	95  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - KILGORE, WILLARD , LANCE,
	       OTHERS

	Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses --
	smoke drifts over.

	Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another
	direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is
	drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the
	deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the
	tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are
	making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-
	ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance
	goes further downriver through the black smoke and there
	merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.

				WILLARD
			(to Lance)
		Look. There it is; the boat.

	Lance looks over --  a tremendous relief on his face. But
	still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark
	against the sky. Willard silently motions Lance toward
	the boat.

				LANCE
			(whispers)
		He'll kill us.

				WILLARD
		He can't kill us.
			(realizing as he says it)
		We're on his side.

	Kilgore FIRES another clip at the tree line, and then
	strides back without looking at them.

				KILGORE
			(almost to himself)
		You smell that.
			(louder)
		You smell that?

				LANCE
		What?

				KILGORE
		Napalm, boy -- nothing else in
		the world smells like that --

	They reflect the glow from the burning trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; nostalgically)
		I love the smell of napalm in
		the morning. 

		One time we had a hill bombed
		for 12 hours. I walked up it
		when it was all over; we didn't
		find one of 'em ... not one
		stinking gook body. They
		slipped out in the night -- but
		the smell -- that gasoline smell
		-- the whole hill -- it smelled
		like ...
			(pause)
		victory...

	He looks off nostalgically.

				WILLARD
		You know, some day this war's
		gonna end..

				KILGORE
			(sadly)
		Yes, I know.

	Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his
	hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts
	them up in the air.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		The wind --

				LANCE
		What?

	Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases.

				KILGORE
			(rising maniacally)
		Feel it -- it's the wind -- it's
		blowing on shore -- It's on shore !

	He leans down and practically grabs Lance.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; screaming)
		It's gonna blow this place out.
		It's gonna ruin it ...

				WILLARD
		The kid can't ride sloppy waves.

	They turn and stare out to sea.


	96  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

	The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back
	over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange
	wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing
	the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their
	boards, overjoyed.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		The kid can't stand sloppy waves.


	97  MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD

				WILLARD
		You don't expect this kid to
		ride that crap, do you? He's
		a goddamn artist, he needs
		something to work with...

	Slapping Lance on the shoulder.

				LANCE
		Yeah, I'm an artist, goddamit !

				KILGORE
			(apologetically)
		Yeah -- yeah, I can understand
		how you feel.

	He turns toward the trees.

				KILGORE
			(continuing)
		It's the napalm -- it's causing
		the wind -- ruining my perfect
		left.

	He staggers off toward the trees followed by his
	guards and other lackeys.

				KILGORE
			(continuing; mumbling)
		The napalm -- ruin -- napalm
		my perfect left -- my perfect
		left point break -- napalm --

	Lance motions with his eyes to Willard.


	98  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

	The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and
	crew waiting and yelling.


	99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE

				WILLARD
		Are you finished surfing?

				LANCE
		Yeah... thanks.

				WILLARD
		Want to say goodbye to the
		Colonel?

				LANCE
		Nah.

				WILLARD
		Then let's get the hell out of
		here.

	They break and run like hell toward the boat in the
	distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are
	cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some-
	thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of
	equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards
	-- Willard looks at them.

				LANCE
		No -- no, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Which one's the Colonel's?

				LANCE
		The Yater -- the clear one
		with the thin stringer.

	Willard glances over to it with determination. There
	is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the
	board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		Incoming ! Incoming -- son of
		a bitch.

	The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach
	toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the
	surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand.
	Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips 
	a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the
	board.

				WILLARD
			(calm)
		This one , Lance?

				LANCE
		Yeah, Jesus Christ !

	Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the
	board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat,
	through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr.
	Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and
	relieved.

				CLEAN
		What'd you that for?

				WILLARD
		When I was a kid I, never had
		a Yater spoon.

	Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount.
	The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF
	toward the deeper water of the river -- the board
	clearly visible on the stern.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R

	The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed.
	It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy
	fire.


	101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW

	They all are in full battle positions -- their twin
	fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled
	banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches
	against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready.
	Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back
	from his forward turret.

				LANCE
			(yelling)
		Maybe we better stay in under
		the trees till dark -- we got
		his Yater.

				WILLARD
		He didn't look like he'd take
		that sitting down.

	They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Let's put some distance between
		us and Charlie.

	The Chief nods.

				CHIEF
		Lance ---
	
				LANCE
		Yeah.

				CHIEF
		Why don't you roll us a big
		joint? I think the Captain'd
		like that.

	They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful
	pause, Willard smiles:

				WILLARD
		Take one a mine --

	He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge
	cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights
	up.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	102  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R.

	It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT

	The boat is hidden under some trees along the river
	bank. The men wait tensely listening --

				LANCE
		You hear it again?

				WILLARD
		No -- I don't think so. But
		it'll be back. They were
		circling. It'll be back.

				LANCE
		You think he'd of shot us?

				WILLARD
		When?

				LANCE
		Any time -- us -- Americans.

	Lance looks over at Willard.

				WILLARD
		I don't think he´d of shot us on
		the beach but -- he'd of shot us
		if he saw me taking the board --

				LANCE
		A Yater spoon is hard to get --
		especially here.

				WILLARD
		He's a man who knows what he 
		wants -- he does know what he wants.

				CHEF
		Can I go get those mangos now?

				CHIEF
		I'll go with you in a while --
		judt hold tight awhile --

				LANCE
		Captain -- that was all true
		about the rats and chocolate
		and stuff?

				WILLARD
		Sure.

				LANCE
		And you could just tell when
		the supplies were booby trapped?

				WILLARD
		It's a feeling you get in the
		jungle. When you get good, you
		can find a track and tell not
		only how many they are, but
		their morale, how far they're
		going, whether they're near
		their camp, the weapons they're
		carrying.

				CLEAN
		How can you tell their weapons..
		an' how far they're going?

	Willard smiles.

				WILLARD
		Mostly from the imprints when they
		put them down to rest. their morale
		from the way they drag their feet,
		or the joints that may be lying
		around. If they're near a base
		camp, they wouldn't be conserving
		food; they'll be throwing it away
		half-eaten. If the branches aren't
		broken, their weapons are slung.
		But all this is just technique..
		There's a feeling you get after a
		while, that's what's important.
		I was going through a village once.
		I was looking for a certain party.
		I took off my boots, and walked
		into each hut. It was midnight.
		I went into three like that and
		suddenly I realized I´d gone into
		each hut the same way -- standing
		up -- so the next one I went in on
		my belly. An RPD burst took out
		the door a bit above my head.
			(he shrugs)
		Things like that.

	A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted --
	They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the
	distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable
	language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the
	ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead.

				KILGORE (V.O.)
			(over a loudspeaker)
		I'm not gonna hurt or harm you,
		boy -- I just want the board
		back -- You can understand --
		It was one of my best -- You
		know how hard it is to get a
		board you like, boy. I'm not
		gonna hurt or harm you --
		Just leave it where I can find
		it --

	The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same
	speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise
	ceases.

				CLEAN
		Jesus -- that guy's too damn
		much.

				CHIEF
		I wonder if that was the same
		copter.

				WILLARD
		He's probably got 'em all over
		the river with that recording.
		We better move now while it's
		dark.

	Chef steps forward with a plastic basket.

				CHIEF
		Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take
		Lance with you --

				WILLARD
		I'll go with him --

	They all look at him.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I wanta get my feet on solid land
		once in awhile --

	He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side.


	104  MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT

	They cautiously walk through the underbrush.

				WILLARD
		Chef.

				CHEF
		Yes, sir --

				WILLARD
		Why they call you that?

				CHEF
		Call me what, sir?

				WILLARD
		Chef -- is that 'cause you like
		mangoes an' stuff?

				CHEF
		No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir
		-- I'm a sauciere --

				WILLARD
		A sauciere --
	
				CHEF
		That's right, sir -- I come from
		New Orleans -- I was raised to
		be a sauciere.. a great sauciere.
		We specialize in sauces; my whole
		family. It's what we do. I was
		supposed to go to Paris and study
		at the Escoffier School; I was
		saving the money. They called
		me for my physical so I figured
		the Navy had better food.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing out here?

				CHEF
		Cook school -- that did it.

				WILLARD
		How?

				CHEF
		They lined us all up in front of
		a hundred yards of prime rib --
		magnificent meat, beautifully
		marbled.. Then they started
		throwing it in these big
		cauldrons, all of it -- boiling.
		I looked in, an' it was turning
		gray. I couldn't stand it. I
		went into radio school.

	They move into a slight clearing.

				WILLARD
			(whispering)
		-- quiet --

	Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges-
	tures that he heard something; he points.


	105  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE

	PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef.

				WILLARD
			(silent)
		There...

	He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover
	the spot. A few yards from them they hear something
	move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They
	walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns
	at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is
	cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There
	is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles.  He
	and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking
	the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand
	gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move
	stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the
	hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,
	and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket
	noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges
	out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to
	point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he
	wants. He makes another command and they rush the
	trapped enemy.


	106  MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF

	Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds
	down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and
	from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats
	FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds
	almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at
	them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly,
	emptying their clips.

				CHEF
		It's a motherfucking tiger --
		goddamn...

	He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a
	man can be.

				CHEF
			(continuing; screaming)
		Goddamn -- Jesus Christ tiger --
		motherfucking tiger -- ohhhhhhhhh --

	Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of
	the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared
	out of his head as well.


	107  FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW

	They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into
	the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws
	his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it.

				CHEF
			(hysterical)
		Ohhhh -- tiger ! Oh goddamn !
		It's a tiger ! Jesus Christ !
		Goddamn, a tiger ! Ohhhhhhhh.

	The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is
	unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around
	the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the
	jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night.

				LANCE
		What's this tiger shit?

				WILLARD
		No shit... I think I shot the
		hell out of him.

				LANCE
		You think?

				WILLARD
		I wasn´t looking.. I was running.

				CLEAN
		Was a big tiger -- no shit?

				WILLARD
		Who stopped to measure him -- let's
		get the hell out of here.

				CHEF
		A motherfucking tiger -- I could've
		been killed.

	The ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great
	speed.

				CHIEF
		You forgot the mangoes, didn't
		you?

				CHEF
		Mangoes? There as a fucking
		tiger in the woods -- I could've
		been eaten alive. I'm never
		going into that jungle again.
		I gotta remember never get out of
		the boat; never get outta the boat.

	They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE 
	NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		He was right, the Chef -- never
		go into the jungle, unless you're
		ready to go all the way.

	108  EXT. THE BOAT IN MARINA DEL RAY - NIGHT

	Willard, thinking, his BACK TO US. Suddenly, he turns
	around, and we SEE his face.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		What was in the jungle? What was
		there, waiting for me?

	He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating
	his face momentarily. There is something different about
	him; a maturity, a cool inner peace.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		... Kurtz was in there. Or was he;
		was it Kurtz? He was just a name
		to me now; I couldn't remember a
		face, a voice -- he just didn't
		add up to me. all his liberal
		bullshit about the end of savagery
		-- and the role of our culture,
		our way of life...

	Willard looks toward the group of people on the boat --
	there is still some MUSIC. They talk and drink and laugh.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Our way of life -- I really
		started to look forward to
		meeting Kurtz again.

	114  VIEW ON WILLARD

	 Willard opens a letter from the packet.

	We can SEE it is a private correspondence -- feminine
	writing on the envelope.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		The dossier of A Dtachment
		contained letters from the families
		and wives of Kurtz' men There
		were letters from Kurtz' wife as
		well.


	115  CLOSE SHOT - ON THE LETTER

	It is addressed to Colonel Walter Kurtz -- in the corner

	Deep imppenetrable jungle -- dark and primeval forests
	pass by. The Rolling Stones CHANT on in the b.g.

				WILLARD (V.O.)

	and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with
	a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was
	the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is
	addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is
	written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic-
	ular. It reads:

					Sell the house
					Sell the car
					Sell the kids
					Find someone else
					Forget it
					I'm never coming back

		killed -- we're not supposed to
		be this close combat, I mean
		real combat.

				WILLARD 
		Well --

				AGENT
		We could use some fuel -- just a
		half drum -- just enough to get
		us out a here.

				WILLARD 
		We need all our fuel.

	He turns and starts to leave.

				AGENT
		But, Captain, think what these
		girls have done for the boys --
		think of how they've risked --

	Willard is almost out of the tent.

				TERRI
		Captain --

	He turns around.

				TERRI
			(continuing)
		It's really rough here -- Captain
		-- we're just not built for it --

	The Pilot laughs.

				PILOT
		That's rich --

				TERRI
		Do us a favor -- I'd do one for
		you -- if I could --

	Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans
	and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent
	takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others.

				AGENT
		Look -- you know who that is,
		Captain -- you know what she's
		saying -- you'll never see stuff
		that good outside of a magazine
		for the rest of your life.

				WILLARD 
		I'm not that fond of blondes --
		maybe I like brunettes --

				AGENT
		Take your pick -- they all like
		you -- I can tell --

				WILLARD
		I like all of them --

				AGENT
		Good -- like I said, take your 
		pick.

				WILLARD
		I said I like all of them.

				AGENT
		Now just a second -- I'm doing
		you a favor, buddy -- what're you
		trying to pull?

	Willard turns to leave again.

				WILLARD
		We need all our fuel anyway.

				AGENT
		Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight
		-- what I meant was we'd need a
		whole drum for that --

				WILLARD
		Sit down -- we'll talk about it.

	Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent
	to do likewise.

				AGENT
		What's there to talk about -- this
		whole thing disgusts me.

				WILLARD
		My men --

				AGENT
		What !

				WILLARD
		That's what there is to talk 
		about -- my man -- I take a good
		care of my men --

	The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening --
	the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself.

				AGENT
		You're out of your skull --

				WILLARD
		We have a lot of pride in our
		unit --

				AGENT
		How far do you think you can
		push -- what kind of people do
		you think --

				WILLARD
		Esprit de corps --
	
				AGENT
		No -- absolutely not --

				WILLARD
		One for all -- all for one --

				AGENT
		You can keep your fucking fuel --

	Willard gets up.

				WILLARD
		You make some of your closest
		friends in the army -- war has a
		way of bringing men together.

				AGENT
		Get out --

				WILLARD
		Men of all races -- nationalities --

	He gets up and starts out.

				AGENT
		Two drums --

	Willard turns around slowly.

				AGENT
			(continuing)
		Two whole drums --

				WILLARD
		We can use some fifty caliber and
		a 16 too --

				AGENT
		I don't know what you're talking
		about -- Get fucked --

				WILLARD
		I will -- I assure you that --
		You got a fifty on that H-34 --
		leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll
		get my men to bring the first drum
		with 'em --

	He turns to go under the tent flap.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Have the girls freshen up a bit --
		comb their hair -- put on
		something -- you know what I mean --

	He leaves.


	123  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW

	They are all working on patching the boat and cleaning
	it up in general. Mr. Clean sits in f.g., cleaning an M-16.

				CLEAN
		You keep this thing in this
		condition an' it's gonna jam,
		Lance -- mark my words.

				LANCE
		Why don't you go pet the water
		buffaloes -- get off my back.

	Behins them on the beach stand several water buffaloes
	eating mud or whatever they do. They are painted jungle
	brown and green camouflage with grey bottoms -- on their
	sides the words have been stenciled in black:
			
				1 Each --
				Buffalo, Water B-1A
				U.S. Army No. 15239

	Willard walks through them down to the boat.

				CHIEF
		Careful,  Captain, they've been
		known to charge.

				WILLARD
		All right I got a little surprise
		for you --

	They all look up.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I've arranged with those people
		we saw at Hau Fat to give us some
		50 caliber in trade for a couple
		a drums of fuel --

				CHEF
		No shit.

				WILLARD
		Chef -- since you're such a fan
		of Miss December's I think you
		should be detailed with Lance and
		Clean to take the first drum up
		there.

				CHEF
		I don't believe you --

				CHIEF

				WILLARD
		You'll see soon enough -- get going,

				CHIEF
		No shit -- hot damn --

				LANCE
		Well -- uh thanks -- see you around.

				CATHY
		Yeah.

	The SHOE CLANGS off his helmet.

							CUT TO:


	127  EXT. THE P.B.R. APPROACHING DO LUNG BRIDGE - FULL SHOT -
	         NIGHT

	The boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the
	distance. Along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations
	with U.S. soldiers in them. There is a bright fire
	burning uncontrolled in the distance; the sparks and white
	light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the
	night.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two days and nights later, we
		approach the Do Lung Bridge.


	128  VIEW ON THE FACES OF THE P.B.R. CREW

	watching. Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks
	sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the
	banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and
	rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip
	through the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere --
	scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge
	or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light
	automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R.
	edges in under the span of the old bridge. Soldiers run
	up through the water. They are obscured in the darkness.

				SOLDIER
		I gotta get out a here -- I´ll pay
		-- I got money.

				CHIEF
		Get away from this boat.

				WILLARD
		Who's your C.O., soldier?

	The Soldier ducks back and runs away.

				SOLDIER
		Fuck you, you'll get what's coming 
		to you.

	Other men approach the boat. A young LIEUTENANT steps
	forward.

				LIEUTENANT
		Captain Willard?

				WILLARD
		That's me.

				LIEUTENANT
		Captain Willard -- we got these
		from Nha Thrang two days ago --
		they expected you here then --

	He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings,
	Willard takes it.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		You don't know how happy that makes
		me, sir.

				WILLARD
		Why?

				LIEUTENANT
		Now I can get out a here -- if
		I can find a way out.

				WILLARD
		We'll be needing some supplies
		and fuel -- do you know anybody
		who can give me a hand?

				LIEUTENANT
		I'd just clear out as soon as I
		could if I were you, sir. They're
		gonna start working on the bridge
		with torches again. Charlie will
		start throwing it in hard --

				WILLARD
		What is this bridge?

				LIEUTENANT
		It's of strategic importance for
		keeping the highway into Bat Shan
		open -- the generals don't like to
		admit that Bat Shan is surrounded.

	He points to the men getting ready to work.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		Every night we build it and by
		0800 they've blown it up -- it
		and a lot of good men -- But the
		generals like to say the road is
		open -- ha ! Nobody uses that
		road except Charlie.

	He turns and splashes off into the darkness.

				LIEUTENANT
			(continuing)
		This is the cesspool of hell.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Incoming.

	SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM
	in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous.

				CHIEF
			(yelling)
		All right -- Lance, go with the
		Captain an' see what you can
		scrounge --

	Willard climbs out with Lance.

				CHIEF
			(continuing; to Willard)
		Better make it fast, sir -- we
		don't really need much anyway.

	Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the
	bridge.


	129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE

	They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire
	on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they
	don't know where to run.

				VOICE
		Straight ahead, son of a bitch.

	They dive towards the voice.


	130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH

	They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his
	buddy who is crying uncontrollably.

				SOLDIER
		You came right to it, son of
		a bitch --

				WILLARD
		Son of a bitch, sir.

	The Soldier doesn't respond.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Where's your chief supply officer?

				SOLDIER
		Beverly Hills --

				WILLARD
		What?

				SOLDIER
		Straight up the road -- a concrete
		bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where
		else you think he'd be?

				WILLARD
		C'mon --

	There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the
	road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP
	from a sandbagged emplacement.

				SOLDIER (O.S.)
		Get your asses down, buddy.

	They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the
	emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a
	sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner.
	Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard
	trips.

				VOICE
		Watch your feet, asshole --

	Willard looks down.

				VOICE
			(continuing)
		You stepped on my face.

				LANCE
		We thought you were dead.

				VOICE
		The whole world loves a smart ass.

	They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away
	into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three
	feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to
	himself.

				WILLARD
		What're you shooting at, soldier?

				GUNNER
		Gooks.

	He turns and sees it's an officer.

				GUNNER
			(continuing)
		I´m sorry, sir.

				WILLARD
		It's all right, sergeant -- what's
		out there?

				GUNNER
		They were tryin' to cut through
		the wire -- I got 'em all I think.

				OTHER SOLDIER
		Oh yeah -- listen.

	There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it
	stops for aminute then continues hideously.

				GUNNER
		He's trying to call his friends --
		send up a flare.

	The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie
	light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST.

				SPOTTER
		Those are all dead, stupid, he's
		obviously underneath 'em --

	They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING
	gets more intense.

				GUNNER
		Wake up the Roach.

	The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is
	leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several
	times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are
	the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."

				ROACH
		Yeah, man.

				SPOTTER
		Slope in the wire -- hear him.

	He listens, he does, he nods.

				SPOTTER
			(continuing)
		Bust him.

	Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters
	up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley
	designs all over it.

				GUNNER
		Hear him?

				ROACH
		Sure , yeah.

				GUNNER
		You need a flare --
			
				ROACH
		No, it´s cool.

	He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks
	the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it
	across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the
	SCREAM, calculating.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		He's close -- real close.

	He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into
	the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE
	WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION
	that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or
	pieces of bodies coming down around them.

				ROACH
			(continuing)
		Muhhh Fuhhh ...
	
	He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep.


	131  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - BRIDGE - CLEAN, CHEF

	They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance.
	Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his M-16. SHELLS
	WHISTLE by and CRASH in the distance.

				CHEF
		Geez, I wish they'd hurry.

	A SOLDIER comes up on his way with some others to start
	building the bridge.

				SOLDIER
		Hey, buddy, that boat still runs,
		eh?

				CLEAN
		Yeah, it still runs.

				SOLDIER
		Do me a favor buddy, please.

				CLEAN
		What is it?

	He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes.

				SOLDIER
		Send these out when you get back
		to the world.

	He puts them in Clean's hand.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		It's to everyone I really knew --
		the first girl I screwed -- my
		brother -- best friend -- I wanted
		to tell 'em how much I enjoyed
		knowing 'em -- it's been a great
		twenty years. I gotta let 'em
		know.

				CLEAN
		What're you askin' me for -- put
		'em in the first helicopter comes
		in tomorrow.

				SOLDIER
		Nobody comes in here.

	He points up at the mountain ridges.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		The N.V.A. 312th -- over there
		the 307th -- on that hill we
		counted fourteen different guns
		in one minute -- they got rockets
		mortars, snipers in those trees,
		there's a million of those shitty
		little bastards out there -- we're
		all gonna die.

	He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		I'm gonna be dead.

	Clean takes the letters.

				SOLDIER
			(continuing)
		You got a chance in that boat --
		by morning you could be five miles
		down the river.

				CLEAN
		We ain't goin' down the river.

	The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking.

				CLEAN
			(continuing)
		What's up river from here anyhow --

	The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded.

				SOLDIER
		Spooky.

				CLEAN
		Charlie?

				SOLDIER
		No, it'd be spooky without the war
		-- give 'em back.

	He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and
	disgusted. Willard and Lance come back down the beach
	carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra
	M-16's.

				CHIEF
		Wow, you must a found the C.O., eh?

				WILLARD
		We found some bodies -- let's get
		out a here.


	132  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - P.B.R.

	They edge through the shallows as the men light up their
	welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge --
	then pull away and accelerate fast.


	133  MED. SHOT - THE P.B.R. CREW

	The Chief is at the helm --  they all look back in the
	distance where the bridge was -- the hills flash with
	artillery discharges -- there is a fiery glow from the
	bridge area and the CONCUSSION of heavy EXPLOSIONS.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	134  EXT. FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW - RAIN

	The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical
	downpour. Mr. Clean is in thef.g., oiling and cleaning
	his 50-cal, his M-11 and M-79 -- the rest of the crew are
	forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas
	canopy. Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was
	set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount.


	135  EXT. THE RUSHING RIVER - NEW VIEW - RAIN

	The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de-
	bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R.

				CHIEF
			(to Willard)
		I can't see a fucking thing.

	There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of
	tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard
	climbs forward, and looks down.

				CHIEF
			(continuing)
		We hit a big enough one this
		hull will shatter like a Corvette.
		Fucking plastic boat.

	Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole,
	warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean
	joins him, helping.

				WILLARD
			(shouting to Chief)
		What about ducking into one of
		those tributaries till this river
		slows down?

				CHIEF
		Who knows what's up there?

				WILLARD
		Can't be any worse than this.
		What do you think?

				CHIEF
		I think this river wants to take
		us home fast. I'm practically
		goin' in reverse.

	Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth
	of a tributary.

				WILLARD
		Well, get in there.

				CHIEF
		This whole area is lousy with
		V.C. -- We don't stand a chance.
		Lemme turn around and we'll be
		in Hau Fat in six minutes.

	There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard
	really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks.

				WILLARD
		Get in there !

				CHIEF
		This is my crew and my fucking
		boat, and I'm the responsible
		party.

				WILLARD
		Get in there now or I'll bury
		you in this river.

	It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't
	do as he says.

				CHIEF
			(finally relents, 
			  turns the helm)
		You're fucking crazy. You're
		going to get us all killed.

	The P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth
	of the tributary.

				WILLARD
		That we're dumber than we look.

	Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the
	darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of
	it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them.
	It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later.

	Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck
	fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is
	removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon.

	143  CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN


	144  POV BEHIND CLEAN

	He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting
	it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction
	-- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield
	and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy
	burst at the jungle -- trees crumble.

				CLEAN
		I'm ripping 'em, man, son-of-a-
		bitch, it's jammed, oh God,
		it's jammed.

	Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE.

	Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead.
	He looks angrily to Willard.

	Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps
	up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward
	the cockpit.

				WILLARD
		Throw me that ordnance.

	Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard
	opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over
	the edge of the cockpit.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Give me some kind a field a fire --

	BULLETS rip by.

				CHEF

		We're through.

		Oh, God --

	is a low POP and a WHISTLE as the GRENADE arches into the
	jungle.


	145  POV. - BEHIND THEM

	He FIRES another burst as the GRENADE EXPLODES brightly.
	There is another POP and WHISTLE , another BLAST. A large
	tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin-
	ning growth. We HEAR strange SCREAMING from the trees and
	jungle, hideous MOANS and terror-filled CRIES.

	Willard FIRES another GRENADE from his M-79.

	They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be-

	The boat is a floating wreck.

	Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack

	They all look over.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		That's a light down there --

				CHEF
		Yeah, it is.

				CHIEF
		What the hell is it?

				WILLARD
		In the middle of the jungle --
		a goddamn light.


	153  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R. - THE TWILIGHT

	The P.B.R. approaches the distant light -- which seems
	to be on the dock of an overgrown plantation building.


	154  VIEW ON WILLARD, CHIEF

	straining to see; he uses field glasses.


	155  POV - THROUGH THE GLASSES

	Seems to be some figures standing on the dock. The
	figures pull back behind some drums.


	156  BACK TO SCENE

				WILLARD
		Watch it !

	They duck as SHOTS RING OUT from the dock, stitching the
	water across the P.B.R.'s bow. The crew crouches, guns
	trained on the dock as the boat still approaches.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		They're not Cong.

				CHIEF
			(over the loud-hailer)
		We're Americans.

	Another BURST, closer.

				CHEF
		Maybe you shouldn't say we're
		Americans?

	Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure
	it out.

				WILLARD
		Chef, try your French.

	Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts:

				CHEF
		Nous sommes Americains --

	Silence.

				CHEF
			(continuing)
		Nous ne voulon pas vous agresser.


	157  VIEW ON WILLARD

	He looks through the glasses.


	158  POV THROUGH THE GLASSES

	Gradually, a small group appears from behind the drums
	on the dock.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		French Nationals -- they may not
		be too friendly, though.


	159  BACK TO SCENE

	We drift closer to the dock. The Chef starts enjoying
	speaking French.

				CHEF
		Nous sommes Americains -- nous
		sommes des amis --

	There is silence as the boat drifts closer. Then:

				FRENCHMAN
			(shouting out)
		Vous parlez Francais comme une vache
		espanole.

				CHEF
			(to himself)
		I thought it was pretty good,
		myself.

				CHIEF
		What'd he say?

				CHEF
		Said I speak French like a
		Spanish cow.

				FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
		Laisser tomber vos armes --

				CHEF
		Put the guns straight up -- stand
		away from the mounts.

				WILLARD
		Do it.

	They do.

				FRENCHMAN (O.S.)
		Vous pouvez approcher mais
		doucement --

				CHEF
		Take her in slow.


	160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK

	The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are
	a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save
	for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left
	eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a
	tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para-
	troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear-
	ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle-
	aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons
	and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the
	dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the
	head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli-
	cate, with a strength about him.

				PHILIPPE
		Hands on the heads.

				CHIEF
		I can't steer with my goddamn
		feet.

				CHEF
		Hey, they speak American.

				GASTON
		Who is the commanding officer?

				CHIEF
		I --

				WILLARD
		I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard.
		This is Chief Warrant Officer
		Phillips -- it's his boat. We
		were shot up bad downriver and
		need repairs and food -- we can
		pay you in gold.

				GASTON
		Philippe --

	Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope
	from the deck and ties it to the dock.

				LANCE
		I'll help you with --

				PHILIPPE
		Do not move --

	Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly.

				GASTON
		Fifty calibers, eh, Captain --

				WILLARD
		As I said, we can pay you in
		gold.

				GASTON
		Entirely unnecessary, Captain.

	He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise --

				GASTON
		We share a common enemy -- you
		are our guests.
			(he steps back)
		I am Gaston de marais -- this is
		my family's plantation. It has
		been such for 121 years. It will
		be such after I die.
		This is my son, Philippe -- he
		has fought in Algeria and held
		the rank of Captain. And Henry
		LeFevre -- a sergeant; he was
		at Dien Bien Phu. My personal
		servant, Tran Van Kac ---

	Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit
	and three women come forward from different positions --
	all wear bush clothing and bear weapons.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		My youngest son -- Christian --


	161  CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN

	He carries an M-60 machine gun in his hand -- a belt of
	ammunition trailing off behind him.

				GASTON
		Christian's wife -- Ann-Marie --

	A tall girl, goodlooking, but severe -- she carries an
	M-16.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		And my youngest daughter --
		Claudine.


	162  CLOSE ON CLAUDINE

	an attractive girl about eighteen. She wears a red
	paratrooper beret and a well-fitted bush suit. She carries
	an M-79 grenade launcher and plenty of ammunition.


	163  FULL VIEW - P.B.R. - CREW, GASTON, OTHERS

	They stand there, exhausted and amazed. Philippe yells
	in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits,
	heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them.
	They look the Americans over warily and assemble at
	Philippe's command.

				WILLARD
		American weapons?

				GASTON
		We took them from the dead.
			(smiles)
		Now -- I assume you want to rest,
		to shower. We'll attend to your
		repairs after dinner.

				CHEF
		Shower.

	Willard's men look at one another, dazed.

				WILLARD
		We don't want to bother you any,
		we --

				GASTON
		A man of war is never bothered to 
		aid an ally -- you will follow me,
		Captain.

	Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks
	up his M-16 by the stock.

				WILLARD
		A habit of men of war, sir --
		you understand.

				GASTON
		Of course, Captain -- an
		unfortunate necessity.

	The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and
	follow.

				CHIEF
		What about the boat?

				PHILIPPE
		My men will keep it for you --

				CHIEF
		Yeah -- well, I'll stay with the
		boat.

				WILLARD
		Chief.
			(pause)
		Come with us.

	They look at each other a moment. The Chief shrugs
	and follows.


	164  FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS

	Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc-
	ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the
	many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire.

				GASTON
		A suitable accomodation for
		your men, captain -- you will,
		of course, be quartered with us --

	He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The
	Chief is hesitant.

				WILLARD
		Go ahead --

	Philippe leads them on, muttering.

				GASTON
		Captain, this way.

	Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward
	the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and
	about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and
	young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the
	opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns.
	Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Magnificent, eh, Captain?

	Willard looks.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		It is very good -- there is no
		current -- It is very good. I
		have never seen one like it in
		all Indochina. I was in Paris
		when it arrived -- do you know
		what might have caused --

				WILLARD
		Looks like a two thousand pound
		to me. Yeah, a two thousand
		pound bomb.

				GASTON
		No, I've seen those in Normandy.
		This is much better.
			(pause)
		My country -- my country could
		never originate this. Magnificent.

	Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard
	looks between him and this big hole in the ground in
	amezement.


	165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING

	A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The
	Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted.
	Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy,
	caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just
	stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened,
	reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him.

				CHEF
		A hot shower, hot damn.

	He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and
	caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and
	he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a
	shower is.


	166  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - EVENING

	battered and torn -- a few of Philippe's Vietnamese
	guard at the boat.


	167  INT. WILLARD'S QUARTERS - EVENING

	A beautiful European room with tall ceilings. Still
	elegantly furnished, although old and decaying.

	Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of
	the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with
	its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His
	battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and
	burns.

	He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above
	which is a large mirror. There is an album on the
	marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random.


	168  VIEW ON WILLARD

	haggard, looking down at the album.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		I wondered -- how long has this room
		been like this; how long has the
		furniture been standing in these
		places?


	169  VIEW ON THE ALBUM

	Some old photographs of people standing around a car
	in the 20's in front of the plantation. Another picture
	shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the
	plantation.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Was it like this sixty years ago?
		Eighty years? But here, even
		eighty years is nothing.

	He turns the page,

	The plantation being built. Pictures of the framing,
	skeletal against the sky and jungle.


	170  VIEW ON WILLARD

	fascinated

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		It was jungle, once; and it will
		be jungle, again...


	171  VIEW ON THE ALBUM

	Onlu the very beginnings of the house; the first struc-
	tures. Then another picture of the jungle site where
	it was to be built.


	172  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	He looks up and sees his own face, reflected in the garish
	mirror. He barely recognizes himself.


	173  MED. VIEW

	Willard looks at himself in the mirror, in this odd, out-
	of-time room.


	174  INT. DINING ROOM GROUP - TRACKING SHOT

	TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food.
	The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group.
	The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights
	up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

				CHEF
		This food is wonderful ! I can't
		believe the chef is a slope.
		    (turning to Clean)
		Some more?

	Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance
	reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands.

				CHEF
			(continuing)
		Hey -- Lance.

				LANCE
		Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya ..
		wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni,
		please.

	And then he looks to his friends for approval.

	Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain
	there is another, more elaborate table, where the
	De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES
	through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the
	group.

	The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room.
	Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair
	next to him.

				GASTON
		Roxanne, I hope you are feeling
		better.

				ROXANNE
		Je vais bien maintenant.

				GASTON
		May I present Captain Willard?
		He is of a paratroop regiment.
		You know the difference between a
		paratrooper and a regular soldier,
		don't you , my dear?

				ROXANNE
			(smiling and taking
			  Willard's hand)
		Yes, they come from the sky.

	She sits -- there's an uneasy silence.

	Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of
	him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is
	forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne.

				WILLARD
		I would like to know more about
		the .. uh, plaque...

	Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted
	wooden plaque with various tallies on it.

				GASTON
		Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.
			(hard)
		This is only  for this war, Captain.
		Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese
		regular forces -- 15; South
		Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular
		forces and otherwise.
			(pause)
		Americain -- 6. Of course, they
		were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.

				WILLARD
		Of course. I -- Once we make
		our repairs, we could send word,
		we could have you evacuated
		from here.

				GASTON
		Captain?

				WILLARD
		You'll get blown outta here some
		day.

				GASTON
		We will never 'evacuate', Captain
		-- this is our home. Indochina is
		ours; it has been so for a hundred
		and twenty-one years, there is
		something to say for that.

				WILLARD
		The Vietnamese think it's theirs
		-- I guess the Americans do,
		too.

				GASTON
		But we civilized it. A place
		belongs to those who bring light
		to it, don't you agree.

				WILLARD
		I always thought the French came
		here to get the rubber.

				PHILIPPE
		Excuse me, I must attend to my
		men.

	He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife.

				ROXANNE
		May I ask where the Captain is
		going in his little boat?

				WILLARD
		We were going upriver when we
		got caught in a storm, ma'am.

				GASTON
		Upriver? Why upriver? There is
		nothing there, only jungle.

				WILLARD
		Do you know that jungle?

				GASTON
		When I was a boy, my father would
		take me there, to hunt. There
		are a few savages, but no man
		can live there, no white man.

				WILLARD
		What about an American named
		Kurtz?

	There is a pause.

				GASTON
		We have never heard of him.

	Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand.

				GASTON
			(continuing)
		Bon nuit, Roxanne -- bon nuit,
		Captain.

	Willard turns.

				WILLARD
		Good night.

	Gaston leaves. Willard and Roxanne are left alone. The
	servants clear the table.

				ROXANNE
		You must realize, Captain -- we
		have lost much here -- I, my
		husband. Gaston -- his wife and
		son.

				WILLARD
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				ROXANNE
			(rising)
		Cognac?

				WILLARD
		I should be checking on the
		boat.

				ROXANNE
		The war will still be here
		tomorrow.

	She walks out of the room.

				WILLARD
			(thinking)
		I guess so.

	He follows.


	175  INT. SITTING ROOM - FULL SHOT - WILLARD AND ROXANNE

	Roxanne sits, pouring a brandy, while Willard stands.

				ROXANNE
		Do you miss your home, Captain?
		Have you someone there?

				WILLARD
		No. Not really.
	
		I was discharged from the army
		four years ago. I went home,
		wasted some time, bought a Mustang
		Mach 1, drove it a week. Then
		I re-upped for another tour. No,
		everything I love is here.

				ROXANNE
		Then you are like us.

	She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What will you do after the war?

				WILLARD
		I just follow my footsteps, one
		at a time, trying to answer the
		little questions and staying away
		from the big ones.

				ROXANNE
		What's a big question?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz.
			(pause)
		I know you've heard of him.

				ROXANNE
		Yes.

				WILLARD
		What did you hear?

				ROXANNE
		That strange things.. terrible
		things have occured around this
		American, Kurtz.

				WILLARD
		What things?

				ROXANNE
		Gaston would never tell me. It
		was asubject not to be spoken of,
		Captain.

				WILLARD
		Yes.

				ROXANNE
		Did you know -- deeper in the
		jungle, upriver -- there are
		savages?

				WILLARD
		I know.

				ROXANNE
		But Captain, I mean -- cannibals.

	A long pause. Then she looks at the cognac she poured for
	him.

				ROXANNE
			(continuing)
		What a pity, you don't drink.
		Since my husband died, there
		are so many things I must do
		alone.

	She takes a sip.

	Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left
	partly open to let a breeze in. He steps onto a terrace
	overlooking the river.


	176  EXT. THE TERRACE - MED. VIEW - WILLARD - NIGHT

	A machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover-
	ing the front of house, from the river.

				ROXANNE
			(from the sitting room)
		Are you warm, Captain?

				WILLARD
		The river is beautiful.

	In fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat.


	177  WILLARD'S POV.

	The P.B.R. is under guard by a couple of Gaston's
	Vietnamese.


	176  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	She, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes
	up behind him.

				ROXANNE
		I spend hours watching that
		river from my bedroom window.
		It fascinates me.

	She moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is
	kissing her.

	179  CLOSE ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

	One eye steals another look at the P.B.R.


	180  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	Two of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready
	for the long night.


	181  VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE - ON THE TERRACE

	His hands wander over her body as she clings to him. Then
	she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting
	room, and up the stairs.


	182  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - FULL VIEW

	It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the
	door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a
	large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over
	it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire --
	there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one.
	He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns
	down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and
	stands there facing him.

	He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays
	down on the bed and watches him.

				ROXANNE
		I have been lonely here, Captain.

	He moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is
	leaning against the wall in his reach.

							FADE OUT.


	183  EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT

	We can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently
	slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure
	kneeling in final preparations for going out in the
	night.

	Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and
	scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing
	into the darkness.


	184  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - NIGHT

	Two Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first,
	the first disappears into the thicket.


	185  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

	in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with
	a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick
	work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently,
	he drags the body out of sight.


	186  MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears
	into the hold.


	187  NEW VIEW

	He lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly,
	with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his
	best work alone, and at night.

							CUT TO.


	188  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD - MORNING

	He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE
	moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL
	BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up
	her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles.

				ROXANNE
		I will fix you breakfast.

	He starts to get up.

				WILLARD
		I'm afraid I won't have time --
		I gotta --

				ROXANNE
		Whe you reach the boat you will
		find that half your fifty calibre
		stores -- a case of grenades, a
		mortar and two M-16's and a
		case of clips are being
		transfered to us by your order.

	He stops -- seemingly stunned.

				WILLARD
		So that's it.

				ROXANNE
		You may think what you wish,
		Captain, but I like you very
		much.

	She turns to go.

				WILLARD
		What if I say no.

				ROXANNE
		Then Philippe will have to kill
		all of you.

	She leaves.


	189  EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS

	He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring
	ammunition boxes.

	Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the
	Chief and crew with M-16's.

				GASTON
		Two of my men deserted last
		night. It happens from time
		to time. I assume my daughter
		told you of our conditions.

				WILLARD
		Your daughter.

				CHIEF
		They taking half our ammo,
		Captain -- said it was your orders.

	He pauses for a second.

				WILLARD
		That's right -- I did.

	The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the
	engines. Willard looks hard at Gaston.

				WILLARD
		I guess this is whAt men of war
		do -- eh?

				GASTON
		We endure, captain -- you can
		blow up the house and we will
		live in the cellar -- destroy
		that and we'll dig a hole in the
		jungle and sleep on it. Burn
		the forest and we'll hide in
		the swamp. all the while, we
		do but one thing -- clean the
		blood off our bayonets.
			(pause)
		Au revoir, Captain.


	190  LONG SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R.

	Willard climbs on board and it pulls away.


	191  EXT. P.B.R. - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, CHIEF

	The BOAT ROARS out across the river. The Chief looks over
	at Willard. They stare at each other for a moment.

				CHIEF
		Next time we  get in a good fire
		fight -- I'd like to know how
		she was, Captain.

	Willard just smiles at the Chief. he leans over and pulls
	up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains
	the contents of all those ammo boxes.  .50 calibre; clips;
	grenades.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.

				CLEAN
		What did you put in all those
		ammo boxes?

				WILLARD
		Rocks, sand -- those two men
		who deserted.

				CHIEF
		When'd you do it?

				WILLARD
		While you were sleeping.

	He lets the board drop.

	Willard moves to the back of the boat.


	192  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER , CREW

	The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark
	and deep. The trees are higher in this area and much of
	the river is shaded on one side. There is no undergrowth,
	just the tall trees and ferms. They move ahead at half
	speed, alert, ready for anything.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		We moved deeper and deeper into
		the jungle. It was very quiet
		there. It was like wandering on
		a prehistoric planet, an unknown
		world ... where the men thought
		they crawled to, I don't know.
		For me, we crawled toward Kurtz --
		exclusively.

	Willard looks out ahead and points.

	They all turn their guns in that direction. We PAN TO
	REVEAL a small village of huts along the bank.


	193  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - VILLAGE


	194  POV. OF THE P.B.R.

	They pass in front of the village which is rundown and
	completely deserted. The huts are on stilts to avoid the
	flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what
	they once were.

				CHEF (O.S.)
		Flood.

				CHIEF (O.S.)
		No -- most of 'em are still
		standing -- might've been
		disease.

				WILLARD (O.S.)
		I don't know -- there'd still
		be some sign -- it's just like
		the one this morning.

							DISSOLVE TO :


	195  POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE

	The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across
	the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown
	darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange
	birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge
	snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the
	jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.


	196  FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE

	Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh
	and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
	upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
	vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
	the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
	dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
	up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
	once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
	gateway to paradise.

	The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
	seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
	orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
	The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
	were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
	and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
	peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
	it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-
	being.

	Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
	cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into
	hell.

	Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.
	The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of
	the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a
	darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this
	hole.

	197  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER - DAWN

	The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back
	about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on
	the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls
	on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet.

				CHIEF
		-- All right, Lance --

	Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into
	the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a
	tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle
	as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from CLAYMORE
	MINES obviously set to cover the mound of skulls. The
	smoke clears.

				LANCE
		The other one --

				WILLARD
		No -- leave it --

				CHIEF
		Why -- Charlie put it there to kill --

				WILLARD
		Thta's not Charlie's work --

	There is silence.

				WILLARD
		Whoever put'em there didn't do it
		to kill people -- They put 'em up
		as signs -- 

				CHIEF
		Signs?

				WILLARD
		Yeah -- like keep out --

	Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead
	past the smoking mound.


	198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY

	The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist
	swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into
	an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Toward the night of the fifth
		day out of Do Lung Bridge, we
		judged ourselves about eight
		miles from Kurtz' base.
		Everything was still, the trees,
		the creepers, even the brush
		seemed like it had been changed
		into some kind of stone. It was
		unnatural, like a trance. Not
		a sound could be heard. I began
		to think I was deaf -- then the
		fog came suddenly, and I was
		blind too.

	The boat disappears in the thick fog.


	199  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	We catch glimpses of him, even though we are close.

				WILLARD
		Listen.

				CHIEF
		What is it?

				WILLARD
		Listen.

	They are silent. We can HEAR the most ominous SOUND
	COMING FROM THE BANKS. The GROANING, OR WAILING .. of
	HUNDREDS OF MEN.

				CHIEF
		They're on the banks of the
		river.

	Frantically, he swings the twin fifties around.

				LANCE

	201  VIEW ON CHIEF

	We can barely SEE him -- in and out of the fog.

				CHIEF
		No, Lance. Not while you can't 
		see.


	202  VIEW ON WILLARD

	listening. The SOUND IS TERRIBLE, HORRIFYING.

				CHIEF
		Will they attack?

				WILLARD
		If they have boats ... or
		canoes... they'd get lost in
		the fog. We can't move either --
		we'll end up on the shore.

				CHEF
		God...

				LANCE
		Sounds like hundreds of them.

				WILLARD
		Shhhhhh.

	The CHORUS OF GROANS in unbearable. But it is not ahostile
	cahnt; or a war chant, but rather the SOUND OF HUMAN
	ANGUISH.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		It doesn't sound hostile --
		it sounds like they've seen us
		coming and it sounds like --
		I don't know, a funeral. I
		don't understand.


	203  VIEW ON LANCE

	A glimpse of him, almost in tears. We then SEE glimpses,
	fog moving, of all the men on the P.B.R.

	204  MED. VIEW - THE P.B.R.

	MOVING THROUGH the thinning mist. The Navy craft proceeds
	cautiously.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Two hours after the fog lifted,
		we moved slowly to a spot we
		thought was roughly a mile and
		a half below Kurtz's camp. We
		approached a long sand-bank
		stretching down the middle of
		the river.

				CHIEF
		Which way? Right or left?

				WILLARD
		Who knows? Right.

				CHIEF
		Looks pretty shallow.

	The P.B.R. moves toard the right-most channel. Chef
	takes a long pole and begins sounding depth.


	205  VIEW ON WILLARD

	The men are really tense now -- Lances swivels his gun from
	bank to bank. Chief keeps his fingers on an M-16. Willard
	takes out the TOP SECRET packet he received at Do Lung.
	Tears it open. We MOVE IN ON him.

				WILLARD
			(reading)
		Upon reaching objective. Target
		key personnel and commence
		operation. Should difficulty

		impossible, break radio silence
		Com-Sec Command code Strong Arm --
		indicate purgative air strike --

			(pause)
		Purgative air strike ! Purgative !
		They'd kill me too !

	Suddenly Chef lays out flat on the bow. Hundreds
	and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the P.B.R.
	rattling against the boat.

				CHIEF
		Shit ! Fucking arrows ! They're
		shooting fucking arrows at us.


	206  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	looking toward the banks.


	207  WILLARD'S POV

	Frags of men -- naked limbs, arms, breasts, glaring eyes
	entangled in the dense jungle gloom. And hundreds of
	pathetic wooden arrows flying out toward them.


	208 VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	crazily zig-zagging up the river in the midst of the
	childish assault.

				WILLARD
		Steer her right.


	209  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	arrows hitting the deck. The men open up everything
	they've got. Lance is FIRING the two fifties wildly.
	
				WILLARD
		Keep going.. keep going.
		They're just fucking sticks !
		Chief, stay at the helm.

	But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his
	M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands,
	and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having
	caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in
	horror.


	210  VIEW ON CHIEF

	laying at Willard's feet -- the long spear through him,
	bleeding onto Willard's boots. He looks up at Willard,
	about to say something.

				CHIEF
		A spear?

	He dies.


	211 MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The men are still crazily FIRING into the empty jungle
	long after those who attacked beat their retreat.

				WILLARD
		Stop it. Stop it !

	Slowly he pulls his boots from under Chief. They are
	absolutely soaked in blood. He is stunned -- sits down
	and begins to unlace the bloody boots, and take them off.

				LANCE
		Chief's dead.

	Willard unlaces the other boot, and holds the bloody boot
	in his hand.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		It was the strangest thing --
		I don't know that I can explain
		it. Two of my men dead, and all
		I could think of was whether
		Kurtz was dead too. That's all
		I wanted: to see Kurtz, to hear
		Kurtz.

	He starts to wipe the blood off the boot.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
			(continuing)
		Somehow, in the middle of this ...
		carnival, Kurtz had grown into
		something -- a gifted officer;
		a great man.
		Somehow, he was the only light
		in this hopeless, hopeless
		darkness.
		And now I was too late --
		he was probably gone, disappeared...
		by a grenade rolled into his
		tent -- or by some spear on the head.
		Christ, I felt like howling like
		those animals in the fog.


	212  EXT. THE BOAT AT MARINA DEL REY - NIGHT

	The people at Charlie's cocktail party on the boat.
	Some flashbulbs are going off. Some people are dancing
	to the MUSIC. OUR VIEW MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD Willard, on
	the edge of the party.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		Here they are in Los Angeles.
		Everything is safe. There's a
		supermarket around the corner,
		the police station around the
		other. It would seem ridiculous
		to them that I was shot to hell
		because I had lost the privilege
		of listening to the mysterious
		Colonel Kurtz.
			(pause)
		Of course I was wrong. He was
		waiting for me. Kurtz was alive
		and he was waiting for me.

	213  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. DAY

	The P.B.R. moving up the river. The men are practically
	in a trance now, looking at the banks of the river. They
	don´t even make an effort to touch their weapons.


	214  WHAT THEY SEE

	Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed
	in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts
	of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face
	paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity
	about them, men and boys, standing passively watching
	the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,
	white and blue.


	215  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	The men of the crew are not the same men who began this
	voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance.
	The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
	picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
	savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a
	hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with
	mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He
	wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.
	Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the
	difficult journey. They start to move to their gun
	positions.

				WILLARD
		Just stand here with me where
		they can see us. Do nothing.


	216  VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.

	MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers
	and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The
	men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly
	without weapons. The natives standing across the river
	make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept
	the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-
	tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of
	feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in
	almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little
	boat to penetrate.


	217  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms
	of some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks
	something like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition
	was right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass.


	218  FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER

	Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river
	now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping
	pace with the P.B.R. There is no hostility in these
	faces, only curiosity and a sort of grief.


	219  VIEW ON WILLARD, THE CREW

	They look up toward the bank.


	220  THEIR POV

	The temple at NU MUNG BA, a fortified encampment, built
	around the ruins of a former Cambodian civilization.
	Stone walls, barbed wire, cracked pyramids and rows and
	rows of Escher-like sandbags arranged in an endless maze
	around the fortress.


	221  VIEW ON WILLARD

	He picks up his field glasses and looks through.


	222  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH GLASSES

	A sign entangled in the barbed wire -- its lettering
	strict and military:

				FOURTH SPECIAL FORCES
				MISSION F-82
				NU MUNG BA

	The GLASSES POV MOVES REVEALING another sign written in
	a wild psychedelic hand.

				OUR MOTTO: APOCALYPSE NOW !

	The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE once again and come upon an
	astonished sight, a black man dressed in a tatter of
	colored fabrics, feathers, and an Australian bush hat.
	He looks something like a multi-colored harlequin waving
	frantically to the P.B.R. The POV OF THE GLASSES MOVE
	OFF of him.


	223  VIEW ON WILLARD

	not believing what he's just seen.


	224  THE GLASSES POV

	Once again the young black man is now waving his
	Australian hat.


	225  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

	Willard shouts out to the starnge greeter.

				WILLARD
		We've been attacked.

				AUSTRALIAN
			(shouting back)
		I know, I know, it's all right.
		Come in this way. It's mined
		over there. This way. It's
		all right.

	Willard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and
	they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the
	water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina
	wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding
	them safely in.

	A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the
	fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near
	the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-
	merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some
	of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the
	ground. Chef nods at the bodies.

				CHEF
		Charlie?

				WILLARD
		Looks that way.

				CHEF
			(looking at the Australian)
		Who's he?

				WILLARD
		God knows.

	The boat pulls up. The Australian harlequin hops on
	board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat-
	tered with mud and blood.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Who the hell are you?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby. Got any Winstons?

				WILLARD
		Moonby what?

				AUSTRALIAN
		Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal
		Australian Regiment, Task Force.
		Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted.

				WILLARD
		    (incredulously, indicating
			 the hundreds of natives)
		What is this?

				MOONBY
		Oh, they're simple enough people.
		It's good to see you, baby.
		Nobody has any Winstons?

	Chef automatically offers Moonby a Winston.

				MOONBY
		This boat's a mess.

				WILLARD
		Where's Kurtz? I want to talk
		to him.

				MOONBY
		Oh, you don't talk to Colonel
		Kurtz.
			(he puffs, then smiles)
		You listen to him. God, these
		are good. I kept these people
		off you, you know. It wasn't
		easy.

				WILLARD
		Why did they attack us?

				MOONBY
		Simple. They don't want him to
		go.

				WILLARD
		You're Australian?

				MOONBY
		Pre-Australian, actually. But
		I'd dig goin' to California.
		I'm California dreamin'.

				WILLARD
			 (almost to himself)
		So Kurtz is alive.

				MOONBY
		Kurtz. I tell you, that man
		has enlarged my mind.

	He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his
	mind's expansion.

				MOONBY
			(continuing)
		But lemme tell you, he is the
		most dangerous thing in every
		way that I've come on so far.
		He wanted to shoot me. The
		first thing he said is, 'I'm
		going to shoot you because you
		are a deserter.' I said I
		didn't desert from your army,
		I deserted from my army. He
		said, 'I'm going to shoot you
		just the same.'

				WILLARD
		Why didn't he shoot you?

				MOONBY
		I've asked myself that question.
		I said to myself, why didn't he
		shoot me? He didn't shoot me,
		because I had a stash like you
		wouldn't believe. I hid it in
		the jungle; the wealth of the
		Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish
		-- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut
		Heroin; the Gold of the Golden
		Triangle. and Acid -- I make
		Koolaid that makes purple Owsley
		come on like piss. Now I'm
		Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen
		he talks. About everything !
		Everything. I forgot there's
		such a thing as sleep. Everything.
		Of love, too.

				CHEF
		Love?

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, not what you think...
		Cosmic love. He made me see
		things -- things, you know.

	The whole time Moonby is chattering on, Willard has
	picked up his field glasses and scans the fortress.


	226  WILLARD'S POV - THROUGH THE FIELD GLASSES

	Men in small groups, huddled over food.
	Now he settles on the entrance in the temple. There
	are stakes in front, and on top of them are horrible
	shrunken heads.


	227  BACK TO SCENE

				WILLARD
		Sounds like he's gone crazy.

				MOONBY
		No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be
		crazy -- if you heard him talk,
		just last week, you'd never think
		he was crazy.

				WILLARD
		Is that where he is? By the 
		shrunken heads.

				MOONBY
		Those heads, yes. Well, the
		rebels...

				WILLARD
			(to his men)
		We're going ashore. Tie her up
		-- and leave your guns up, Lance.

				LANCE
		What?

				WILLARD
		Bring your rifles, that's all.
			(looking at Moonby)
		Take us to him.

				MOONBY
		Right on -- he's been waiting
		for --

				WILLARD
		And shut up.

	Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard
	and the men follow.


	228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW

	As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear
	where a moment before there was only jungle.

	They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
	than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
	and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
	in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
	AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
	emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
	equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
	are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
	of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
	if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
	the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
	where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
	the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
	primitive and more savage than any since the time
	of Captain Cook.

	They encounter, in the center of the group, what once
	appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
	wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
	loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
	strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
	long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47
	decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches
	this beast, who seems shy and retiring.

				WILLARD
		Who are you?

				MOONBY
			(breaking in)
		His name is...

				WILLARD
		I'm not ever goin' to tell you
		to shut up again.

	Moonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing
	comes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they
	are to see him.

				MAN
		Colby. Exec. officer, A-Team...
		Special Forces. F-82 -- Col.
		Walter Kurtz, commanding.

				WILLARD
		What happened here?

				COLBY
		What -- happened here.

				WILLARD
		Charlie?

				COLBY
		NVA regulars. They're coming
		again tonight. Tet -- their
		big -- assault.

	Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what
	to say to this man, but he understands the forces that
	pounded him. He takes his arm.


	229  REVERSE ON COLBY

	looks at Willard, not understanding.


	230  REVERSE ON WILLARD

	Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand.

				MOONBY
		Oh, no, don´t say that.

				COLBY
		Take us back. Take us back !
		But, the operation -- the team.
		Colonel Kurtz has such plans for
		-- the team.

				WILLARD
		Take me to him, Major.

	Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on
	poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard:

				COLBY
		I had nothing to do with these
		operations -- I did not do the
		planning -- none of us did.
		It was all Colonel Kurtz -- he
		was the genius. You'll see --
		the genius of our Colonel. He
		should be made a General, don't
		you think? A General? It's...

	Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard
	knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

	Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is
	a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly
	attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,
	though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with
	primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
	well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,
	with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes
	almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what
	seems to be a serious wound.


	232  VIEW ON WILLARD

	This is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then,
	automatically, he comes to an attention.

				WILLARD
		Colonel Kurtz, I guess.

				KURTZ
		I'm Kurtz.

				WILLARD
			(he salutes)
		Captain B.L. Willard reporting
		his presence, sir.


	233  VIEW ON KURTZ

	looking at him a long time. Then he returns the salute,
	and simply:

				KURTZ
		At ease...
			(pause, as he regards him)
		Sit down.


	234  MED. VIEW

	There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair.
	But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on
	the ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well.
	Then Kurtz does.

	Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to
	Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from
	man to man, ritualistically.

				KURTZ
			(slowly)
		Why did you come to ... my province.

				WILLARD
		We were attacked -- down river.
		We need supplies and medical 
		help.

				KURTZ
		You were not coming here, to
		see me?

				WILLARD
			(finding it more and 
			 more difficult to go
			 on with this lie)
		No -- no, sir.

				KURTZ
		You came up my river -- in that
		small boat. So simple. I
		always thought the final justice
		would come from the sky, like
		we did.
			(pause)
		You are the final justice,
		aren't you?

				WILLARD
		What do you mean, Colonel?

				KURTZ
			(gently)
		What other reason could you
		have come? A Captain. Ranger.
		Paratrooper. Graduate of the
		Recondo School. Am I right
		about these things?

				WILLARD
		You know you're right.

	There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.

				KURTZ
		Then the Agency approached you.
		Maybe in a bar in Quinon or
		Pleiku. Simple. A year's pay
		for one life. Perhaps a village
		elder, or a tax collector.
		Nobody's orders but your own.
		Exciting work.


	235  CLOSE ON WILLARD

	He remains silent.


	236  CLOSE ON KURTZ

	He smiles.

				KURTZ
		You've spent tome at the Royal
		Tracking School of Malaysia.
		I can tell from the way the
		laces on your boots are tied.
		I understand you, Captain. We
		understand each other.

	There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other.
	Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws
	it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act
	assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

				WILLARD
		Do you know me?

				KURTZ
		Yes.

	Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another
	word or gesture, shoots and kills a man.

				KURTZ
				(continuing)
		Do you know me ?

	He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks
	back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken
	heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful
	distance behind. Even Willard is stunned.

				CHEF
		Holy shit.


	237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT

	Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like
	a primitive civilization.


	238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL

	Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall
	next to him. He is exhausted.

	Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef
	approaches, crouches down.

				CHEF
		Captain -- they've been probed
		all this week -- Cong and NVA
		regulars. There's gonna be a
		big offense any time.

				WILLARD
		I know.

	Lance stirs; starts to wake up.

				CHEF
		What are we doing here?

				WILLARD
		Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him,
		just like he said.

				KURTZ
		Yeah, I can see that. He's 
		fuckin nuts --

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

				CHEF
		He killed that guy without feeling
		anything.

				WILLARD
		Not a thing.

				CHEF
		When you kill Cong, don't you
		feel something.

				WILLARD
		Sure.
			(thinking)
		Recoil... I feel the recoil of
		my rifle.

	Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened.


	239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE

	Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged
	and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar
	emplacement.

	Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow
	to Willard as he passes.

				WILLARD
		This is good -- triple overlapping
		fields of fire -- walls so thick
		ordinary artillery just cleans
		the moss off their surfaces.

	A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then
	runs off to her bunker.

	WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups
	of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and
	children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from
	every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried
	scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on
	a big piece of almost raw meat.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		I've done things, when I was
		alone in the jungle -- that I
		never told anyone about.

	They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of
	half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and
	fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck
	lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted
	there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is
	built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of
	fire into the jungle beyond.

	Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their
	beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several
	Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with
	bayonets.

				CHEF
		This is evil -- evil, Captain.
		We're all gonna die here.

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I know.

				CHEF
		I don't get it -- You said your
		mission was to kill him. Let's
		do it, an' get our asses outta
		here. This  Kurtz is ruining the
		war; I mean, this don't look
		good for America !

				WILLARD
			(lost in his thoughts)
		... he's an amazing officer.

				CHEF
		You got to kill this sonuvabitch
		-- Lance and me, we don'´t
		understand none of this -- Jesus,
		Captain -- I don't wanna die here
		-- Do it quick.

	Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of
	nods, sucking a joint.

				WILLARD
		Yeah. I know.

	He thinks.


	240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with
	the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard
	steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.


	241  WILLARD'S VIEW

	An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-
	quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the
	ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other
	military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,
	but have now fallen into decayed disuse.

	There are other indications of the modern headquarters
	this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-
	tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.
	There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with
	maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically
	garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil
	spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging
	fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche
	"Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."

	Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to
	Willard.

				MOONBY
		He's asleep -- don't bother him.

				KURTZ
		I'm awake.

	Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		You. Get out.

	Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with
	Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; suddenly)
		I said get the fuck out !
			(to himself)
		I'm going to kill the little
		weirdo myself tomorrow.
			(he shows some pain
			  when moving his
			  midsection)
		He´s only stayed alive this long
		because he's a good orderly and
		medic. He knows how to use a
		hypodermic.

				WILLARD
		You're gonna get hit tonight,
		bad -- a whole regiment of NVA
		regulars.

				KURTZ
		That's right, the little gook-
		pricks. But they are noble
		little gook-pricks, noble.
		Because they fight with their 
		guts, like animals. And for an
		idea ! That's rich. We fight
		with ingenious machines and
		fire, like Gods, and for nothing.
		But I'll call in a major blotto
		airstrike tonight. We'll have
		ourselves a helluva airstrike
		tonight, a lightshow. How do
		you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby
		Light My Fire...'

	Willard shrugs.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Do you?

				WILLARD
		Yeah, I like it...

				KURTZ
		I love it.

	He rests back, grinning.

				WILLARD
		You've gone crazy.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		No. My thinking is clear.
			(calmly)
		But my soul has gone mad.

	Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his
	stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He
	literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		My gut -- Oh, Christ, my gut !

	Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the
	wound.


	242  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in,
	witnessing the proceedings inside.

				CHEF
			(muttering)
		Kill him -- come on, why don't
		you kill him


	243  INT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED, VIEW - KURTZ AND WILLARD -
	         NIGHT

	Willard examining the wound.

				KURTZ
			(in pain)
		Oh shit -- on the table; morphine.

	Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He
	takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing
	Kurtz and injects him with the drug.

				KURTZ
			(continuing; looking
			  up in pain)
		You see how stupid it would have
		been to blow out my brains? I'm
		dying from the gut anyway.

	Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly
	frightened, holds up his hand.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		No -- I don't want to sleep.
		I want to think. Water. Give
		me water.

				WILLARD
		You can't have water after
		morphine.

				KURTZ
		Still playing by the rules.
			(almost
			  affectionately)
		You're a damn good kiler.

				WILLARD
			(still holding the
			  second morphine)
		How's the pain?

				KURTZ
		How's yours?

				WILLARD
		I can handle it.

				KURTZ
		Pain is easy to handle -- but
		nobility.. the nobility of a
		man is judged by how much Truth
		he can handle.

				WILLARD
		What Truth?

				KURTZ
		The truth that you were sent
		here to murder me, ans so far
		you haven't done it. And do
		you know why?
			(looks at him)
		Yes, you know why.
			(he looks)
		Your mission makes about as much
		sense as those idiots who sent
		you on it. Asshole ! Schmuck ! 
		How long does it take you to
		figure out that nobody knows
		what they're doing here.
			(coldly)
		Except me.

	He rests back. The drug is beginning to take effect.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Gimme water.

				WILLARD
		No water.

				KURTZ
		You know what you're doing?
		You are interfering with my
		plans !

	He crawls in pain toward the canteen Willard watches
	him impassively.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		This water's got Moonby's acid
		in it --

	He drinks sloppily from the canteen, water spilling all
	over. Then he throws the canteen to Willard.

				KURTZ
			(continuing)
		Drink it -- drink it for tonight.
		Think of it. A whole regiment
		of those shitty little Cong --
		War. Total war -- war like you've
		never known it. It's beautiful
		-- you'll love it. Trust me.


	244  EXT. THE HEADQUARTERS - MED. VIEW - LANCE AND CHEF - NIGHT

	We can SEE into the headquarters: Kurtz offers the canteen
	to Willard. Chef is terrified -- Lance is stoned out.

				CHEF
		Lance -- the fucker's not gonna
		do it.

				KURTZ
		Goddamn -- You've gotta dig
		napalm on Speed, too. It's
		spectacular, you'll see.

	Lance stands up holding his M-16, looks into the cavern
	with Chef.


	245  INT. HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

	Willard stands there, holding the morphine needle in his
	hand.

				KURTZ
		Look into the jungle. You can't --
		it's too terrible. You have to
		smear yourself with warpaint to
		look at it -- you have to be a
		cannibal.
			(whispered)
		That's why warpaint was invented.
		Then it becomes your jungle.

	Willard shoots himself in the arm with the morphine.

				WILLARD
		How did we get here?

				KURTZ
		Because of all the things we do,
		the thing we do best -- is lie.

				WILLARD
		I think think a lie stinks.

				KURTZ
		Oh Captain, that is so true.

				WILLARD
		Stinks. I could never figure --
			(he drinks from
			  the canteen)
		I could never figure how they
		can teach boys how to bomb villages
		with napalm -- and not let them
		write the word 'fuck' on their
		airplanes.

	Willard drinks more of the LSD water.

				KURTZ
			(angrily)
		You could never figure it because
		it doesn't make sense.

				WILLARD
		Fuck no.

				KURTZ
		I'll tell you what makes sense !
		Air strikes ! White Phosphorus !
		Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out
		of them if they don't do what
		we want.

				WILLARD
		We'll exterminate the fuckers !

	Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified.
	He draws his bayonet.

				CHEF
		Captain -- kill him.

				KURTZ
		Think of it -- for years, millions
		of years, savages with pathetic
		painted faces were scared shitless
		that fire would rain down from
		the sky. And goddamn, we made
		it happen. God  bless  Dow  !

				CHEF
		Kill him !

	Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively,
	Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic
	FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets.


	246  VIEW ON LANCE

	He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort
	of mindless, programmed killer.

				LANCE
			(FIRING)
		Hot damn !

	Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an
	instant of silence, then:


	247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT

	The DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming,
	as illuminating flares light up the blackness.


	248  MED. CLOSE VIEW

	of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of
	razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted
	out to the enemy, poised to attack.


	249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER

	Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay-
	onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting
	speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish
	in water pipes. One looks up to the sky.


	250  EIS VIEW

	A rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche-
	delic hallucination.

	251  VIEW ON THE SOLDIER

				SOLDIER
		Wow...

	Another behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t
	himself.


	252  MED. VIEW ON THE GATE

	Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions
	around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior --
	Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans,
	even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow,
	salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates
	around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and
	purple.

	We SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of
	teeth around his neck, his face painted.


	253  FULL VIEW - MONTAGE

	Enemy ARTILLERY BLASTING away at the fortress.


	254  CLOSE SHOT - A MORTAR

	A hand drops a shell and it FIRES.


	255  CLOSE SHOT - ROCKET LAUNCHER

	It FIRES. EXPLOSIONS around the fort, red and orange
	and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some
	sort of cosmic flower.


	256  CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK)

	Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a
	death ray gun, radiating outward with ice-blue energy.


	257  SHOT ON LOUDSPEAKERS

	blasting out music.


	258  MED. CLOSE VIEW ON YOUNG SOLDIERS

	With the MUSIC, like those people you see listening to
	radios in their cars.


	259  SHOT ON THE COMMAND BUNKER - WILLARD , KURTZ , OTHERS

	(In SLOW MOTION) Shells WHISTLE in and EXPLODE on the
	walls in the compound. The men behind them are setting
	up rocket launcher (missile) . Everywhere metal and rock
	and flame fly and it is beautiful to see.

	Willard looks through the infra-red sniper scope.


	260  WILLARD - INFRA-RED POV

	Strange, luminescent images of North Vietnamese approach-
	ing the outer perimeters. Thousands of them.


	261  FULL SHOT ON KURTZ

				KURTZ
		Mini-gun. Colby. Sergeant.
		Mini-gun.


	262  MED. SHOT - MINI-GUN

	A SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted
	operates the mini-gun with several native helpers. SHELLS
	BURST  around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly
	loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid
	stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as
	7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of
	the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-
	geant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally
	as the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is
	blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell.


	263  VIEW ON WILLARD

	Exhilarated, and moving with the MUSIC.

				WILLARD
		Napalm.

	Colby pushes a row of plungers: Advancing NVAs il-
	luminated by napalm drums, phosphorescent napalm EXPLODES
	beautiful, like a magnificent firework.


	264  VIEW ON KURTZ

				KURTZ
		Claymores, claymores.

	The SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS
	penetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another.
	Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these. His face
	seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to
	another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv-
	ing in front of us.

	The SCREAMS of maimed and dismembered men almost pene-
	trates the INCREDIBLY LOUD MUSIC and we HEAR Kurtz's men
	LAUGHING and SCREAMING in delight.

	Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter.


	265  FULL SHOT - NVA CHARGE

	through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more
	extreme. They burn in the pools of luminescent napalm
	but press relentlessly on. SHELL BURSTS overhead. They
	chant to themselves as they advance. NVA have reached
	the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up.
	Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce
	weird psychedelic light. Blared out at tremendous vol-
	ume over and above the DIN OF BATTLE is LIGHT MY FIRE.


	266  FULL SHOT - WALL - EVERYBODY

	The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming.
	Spurred by MUSIC, they charge up. M-16's in both hands,
	blasting, kicking, bayoneting, gouging, splittin throats,
	biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most
	horrible savagery.


	267  MED. SHOT - WILLARD

	standing on the wall BLASTING as bodies fall around him;
	he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker, removes it with
	a foot and stabs another. From him he takes his AK47 and
	BLASTS more as they come.


	268  MED. SHOT - LANCE

	The VC rush his position. Willard trips a claymore that
	BLASTS most of them to shreads. More fill in. Lance
	opens up FULL AUTOMATIC . Willard and Lance move down to
	the nest wall, FIRING , bodies tumbling over.

	Lance is caught in a CROSSFIRE and hit several times.
	He pulls himself up -- FIRES a final BURST and then falls
	under the enemy's feet.


	269  VIEW ON MOONBY

	sees this and scampers off into the jungle, muttering
	madly to himself.


	270  MED. VIEW - WILLARD AT THE R.T.

	shouting into the radio

				WILLARD
		Code -- Street Gang -- Street
		Gang ! Purgative air strike;
		Street Gang !

	He turns and runs back through the compound with the
	receding Montagnards. SHELLS are EXPLODING everywhere.
	The light patterns are fantastic. Men fall, Viets break
	over the walls and charge. They crouch and rip into
	them FULL AUTOMATIC. They break the charge and continue
	cutting their way through the NVA masses like torches 
	through metal.


	271  FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ

	Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain. Women
	and children rush upon him now. Kurtz flicks some switch-
	es and the whole north wall EXPLODES in overwhelming FIRE.
	The gates are uprooted. The stone lions tumble, crushing
	men below. Kurtz cocks an M-16 and walks off the bunker.


	272  VIEW ON WILLARD

	watching this spectacle.


	273  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - KURTZ

	He rounds  the shadow wall.

	Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a
	machine gun mount. They don't see him. He braces the gun
	at his side and steps out.

				KURTZ
			(yelling)
		Charles !

	They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one
	who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his
	gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his
	holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz
	beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He
	moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding
	it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls
	and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and
	rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly
	encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The
	machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty
	and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.


	274  MED. SHOT - LOW ANGLE - KURTZ

	taking swings with his rifle, standing atop the
	wall and battering the oncoming enemy like Davy Crockett
	at the Alamo.


	275  FULL VIEW - THE FORTRESS

	The air strike hits with all its force. Balls and rain
	of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything.
	It is the biggest firework show in history.

	The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it.
	Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the
	air strike continues. All around us is a spectacle of
	MUSIC and light and fire and overwhelming color.


	276  TRACKING SHOT ON WILLARD

	following Kurtz's trail in the mud. He has crawled on
	all fours back into the jungle to die. He stalks Kurtz
	into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the
	crawling Kurtz

				KURTZ
		Go away -- hide yourself.

				WILLARD
		What are you doing?

				KURTZ
		Going back  - to the jungle to
		die.

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back. You can 
		still live.

				KURTZ
		I had immense plans.

				WILLARD
		I'm gonna get you out of here.

				KURTZ
		I was on threshold of great 
		things.

	Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck,
	holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The
	spectacle continues in the b.g.


	277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER

	This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls
	out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages
	to get him onto the boat.


	278  EXTREME FULL SHOT

	The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of
	Nu Mung Ba.

							FADE OUT.

	FADE IN.


	279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING

	The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds
	circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere
	is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and
	some Montagnards sit near them.

	Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and
	they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the
	field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something.
	Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the
	f.g. below is Lance, dead.

	Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair.

				COLBY
		Who is he?

				WILLARD
		He was the tragedy -- the tragedy
		of this war.

							CUT TO:


	280  THE P.B.R.

	battered, moving slowly down the river.


	281  TIGHTER VIEW

	Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious.
	Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those
	left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks.
	Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air.
	Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him.
	The battle is not over.

				KURTZ
		Don't. Don't frighten them away.

	Willard looks down at him.

				WILLARD
		So you understand this?

	Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his
	eyes. There is a slight smile.

				KURTZ
		Do I not?


	282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW

	The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river.

				KURTZ
		My river... my people... my jungle...
		my ideas... my country... 		
		my wife...
			(he looks at Willard)
		... my death.

				WILLARD
		You had immense plans... immense plans...

				KURTZ
		Yes...

				WILLARD
		I'm taking you back.

	Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming
	intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper
	at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry
	that is no more than a breath.

				KURTZ
		The horror, the horror.

	We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching.
	The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up,
	craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.

				COLBY
		There.

	Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC
	helicopters hooping toward them.

				COLBY
			(continuing)
		How did they know?

				WILLARD
		They must have seen the fire.

	The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of
	them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US.

				COLBY
		They're coming to rescue us.
		They're Medevac.


	283  CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	He stares up at the sky.

				WILLARD
					(to himself)
		They're coming to take us back.

	Copters directly overhead.

				WILLARD
			(continuing)
		Yeah.

				COLBY
		Colonel Kurtz, he's dead.

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

	He raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap-
	proaching rescue helicopter.


	284  FULL SHOT - THE COPTER

	It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the
	sky.


	285  FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY

				WILLARD
		Yeah.

	Colby takes his rifle and joins Willard in FIRING at
	the retreating American helicopters.


	286  HELICOPTER'S POV - ON THE BOAT

	The men in the boat FIRING AT US as we fly further into
	the air, the boat getting smaller and smaller.

				WILLARD (V.O.)
		... Don't remember a lot about my
		rehabilitation... but I was sent
		back to the world before the fall
		of Saigon...


	287  EXT. MARINA DEL RAY - EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

	MOVING DOWN back to the pleasure boat at the Marina.

	Pause. Willard is very silent.

				WILLARD
		I never answered questions about
		Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his
		unimportant papers -- but for the
		most part I saved everything.
		There were other letters, personal
		ones written earlier to his wife.
		I brought them to het. I watched
		the fall of Saigon on television
		in a bar in Alameda...


	289  EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

	A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh-
	borhood. Some kids are playing in the street.

	Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past
	the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under
	his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working
	on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy
	looks back.

				WILLARD
		Hi.

	Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the
	door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in
	mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a
	sense of purity about her, though she is not young.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Come in, Captain Willard.

	He enters.


	289  INT. KURTZ'S HOME - DAY

	Everything good and secure and desirable about America.

	She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Can I get anything for you?

	There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many... but he is
	there in the various stages of his career.

	Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
			(continuing)
		Did you know him very well?

				WILLARD
		You get to know each other pretty
		well out there.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		And you admired him?

				WILLARD
		He was a remarkable man. It was
		impossible not to --

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Love him... Yes, it is true.
		That's the hard part for me... I
		knew him better than anyone ... I
		knew him best.

				WILLARD
		You knew him best.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		You were his friend... You must
		have been, if he had given you
		this...
			(the packet)
		If he sent you to his home. He
		was the best this country had --
		he was --

				WILLARD
		Yes, I know...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		I'll never get over it -- But
		I'll always remember him...

				WILLARD
		Both of us...

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Men looked up to him...
			(she loses herself
			  in a thought)
		He died as he lived...

				WILLARD
		His death was -- yes, he died as
		he lived.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Were you with him, when...

				WILLARD
		Yes I was... He said his last
		words to me.

	Pause.


	290  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

	A little of the madness is still with him. He knows what
	she will ask.

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		What were they?


	291  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON KURTZ'S WIFE

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Tell me.


	292  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

	remembering that incredible day moving down the river.

	Our VIEW LOOSENS

				KURTZ'S WIFE
		Tell me what he said.

				KURTZ (V.O.)
		The horror ! The horror !

				WILLARD
		He spoke of you, ma'am.

	He sits there looking at her.


	293  EXT. TIGHT HIGH ANGLE ON THE MARINA DEL REY BOAT

	The cocktail party is breaking up. Willard is one of
	the few guests left.

	We MOVE FROM Willard standing alone on the deck of the
	boat. Moving back through the departing guests. Charlie
	is getting ready to leave himself. We MOVE CLOSER to
	Willard.

							DISSOLVE TO:


	294  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. - DAY

	the boat floating down the river. Kurtz's body; an exhaust-
	ed, half-dead Colby. And HOLDING Kurtz, Willard. We HEAR
	THE DOORS' "THE END" as we present the END TITLES.

FADE IN:

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Brief shot of duel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My father, who was well-known to the
	best circles in this kingdom under
	the name of roaring Harry James, was
	killed in a duel, when I was fifteen
	years old.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Mrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a
distance.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother, after her husband's
	death, and her retirement, lived in
	such a way as to defy slander.  She
	refused all offers of marriage,
	declaring that she lived now for her
	son only, and for the memory of her
	departed saint.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Mother and son walking together.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the most beautiful
	women of her day.  But if she was
	proud of her beauty, to do her
	justice, she was still more proud of
	her son, and has said a thousand
	times to me that I was the
	handsomest fellow in the world.

EXT.  CHURCH - DAY

Mother and son entering church.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The good soul's pleasure was to
	dress me; and on Sundays and
	Holidays, I turned out in a velvet
	coat with a silver-hilted sword by
	my side, and a gold garter at my
	knee as fine as any lord in the
	land.  As we walked to church on
	Sundays, even the most envious souls
	would allow that there was not a
	prettier pair in the kingdom.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My uncle's family consisted of ten
	children, and one of them was the
	cause of all my early troubles; this
	was the belle of the family, my
	cousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,
stables, barn and farm.

Idealized images of Dorothy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  That first affair, how well one
	remembers it!  What a noble
	discovery it is that the boy makes
	when he finds himself actually and
	truly in love with some one!  A lady
	who is skilled in dancing or singing
	never can perfect herself without a
	deal of study in private.  So it is
	with the dear creatures who are
	skilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for
	instance, was always practicing, and
	she would take poor me to rehearse
	her accomplishments upon...

Dorothy talking with the exciseman.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the exciseman, when he came
	his rounds.

Dorothy talking to the steward.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the steward.

Dorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a
book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the poor curate.

Dorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the young apothecary's lad
	from Dugan's Town whom I recollect
	beating once for that very reason.

Roderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The torments of jealousy she made me
	endure were horrible.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of
confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,
runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,
returning every moment to Roderick.

She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then
laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless
and staring at her.

After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she
challenges Roderick to a race.

			RODERICK
	I accept, but I insist on a wager.
	The loser must do whatever the
	winner pleases.

			DOROTHY
	Agreed.

			RODERICK
	Do you see the gate at the end of
	the field?  The first to touch it
	will be the winner.

They line up together and start on a count of three.
Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,
and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was certain to win, but I meant to
	lose to see what she would order me
	to do.

Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then
she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes
out and says:

			DOROTHY
	Your penalty is to find a cherry-
	colored ribbon which I have hidden
	somewhere on my person.  You are
	free to look for it anywhere you
	will, and I will think very little
	of you if you do not find it.

They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her
pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then
her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and
circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears
upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he
draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The
tickling makes her laugh.

			RODERICK
	I feel the ribbon.

			DOROTHY
	Then you must get it.

Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty
breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.

			DOROTHY
	Why are you shaking?

			RODERICK
	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Military review.  One hundred English troops, a few
mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local
people.

The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best
and Grogan.

Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	About this time, the United Kingdom
	was in a state of great excitement
	from the threat generally credited
	of a French invasion.  The noblemen
	and people of condition in that and
	all other parts of the kingdom
	showed their loyalty by raising
	regiments of horse and foot to
	resist the invaders.  How I envied
	them.  The whole country was alive
	with war's alarums; the three
	kingdoms ringing with military
	music, while poor I was obliged to
	stay at home in my fustian jacket
	and sigh for fame in secret.

INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT

Dorothy and Roderick entering.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Once, the officers of the Kilwangen
	regiment gave a grand ball to which
	Dorothy persuaded my to take her.

Several cuts depicting the evening.

Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks
punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.

Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss
Clancy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I have endured torments in my life,
	but none like that.  Some of the
	prettiest girls there offered to
	console me, for I was the best
	dancer in the room, but I was too
	wretched, and so remained alone all
	night in a state of agony.  I did
	not care for drink, or know the
	dreadful comfort of it in those
	days; but I thought of killing
	myself and Dorothy, and most
	certainly of making away with
	Captain Best.

EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN

The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, and at morning, the ball
	was over.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together.

			DOROTHY
	Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick
	dear, and you'll catch cold without
	a handkerchief to your neck.

To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle
made no reply.

			DOROTHY
	Did you and Miss Clancy have a
	pleasant evening, Roderick?  You
	were together, I saw, all night.

To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,
and giving a lash to Daisy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and
	throw me, you careless creature,
	you.

The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's
waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.

			RODERICK
	I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!
	And I only danced with her because
	-- because -- the person with whom I
	intended to dance chose to be
	engaged the whole night.

			DOROTHY
	I had not been in the room five
	minutes before I was engaged for
	every single set.

			RODERICK
	Were you obliged to dance five times
	with Captain Best, and then stroll
	out with him into the garden?

			DOROTHY
	I don't care a fig for Captain Best;
	he dances prettily to be sure, and
	is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He
	looks well in his regimentals, too;
	and if he chose to ask me to dance,
	how could I refuse him?

			RODERICK
	But you refused me, Dorothy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  I can dance with you any day,
	and to dance with your own cousin at
	a ball as if you could find no other
	partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain
	Best's a man, and you are only a
	boy, and you haven't a guinea in the
	world.

			RODERICK
	If ever I meet him again, you shall
	see which is the best man of the
	two.  I'll fight him with sword or
	with pistol, captain as he is.

			DOROTHY
	But Captain Best is already known as
	a valiant soldier, and is famous as
	a man of fashion in London.  It is
	mighty well of you to fight farmers'
	boys, but to fight an Englishman is
	a very different matter.

Roderick falls silent.

EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN

They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,
sufficiently deep and rocky.

			DOROTHY
	Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are
	such a hero, was passing over the
	bridge and the enemy on the other
	side.

			RODERICK
	I'd draw my sword, and cut my way
	through them.

			DOROTHY
	What, with me on the pillion?  Would
	you kill poor me?

			RODERICK
	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd
	do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,
	and swim you both across, where no
	enemy could follow us.

			DOROTHY
	Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare
	to do any such thing on Daisy.
	There's the captain's horse, Black
	George, I've heard say that Captain
	Bes --

She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual
recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:

			RODERICK
	Hold tight to my waist!

And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the
parapet, into the deeper water below.

The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she
sinks, and screams as she rises.

Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Various cuts showing illness and convalescence.

Roderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.

Mother brings a tray of food.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I went home, and was ill speedily of
	a fever, which kept me to my bed for
	a week.

Dorothy visiting him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dorothy visited me only once, but I
	quitted my couch still more
	violently in love than I had been
	ever before.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud
amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs
down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.

He encounters an orderly whistling "Roast Beef of Old
England," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.

			RODERICK
	Whose horse, fellow, is that?

			ORDERLY
	Feller, indeed!  The horse belongs
	to my captain, and he's a better
	fellow nor you any day.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I did not stop to break his bones,
	as I would on another occasion, for
	a horrible suspicion had come across
	me, and I made for the garden as
	quickly as I could.

Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path
together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and
squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling
against his arm.

Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying
court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The fact is that, during the week of
	my illness, no other than Captain
	Best was staying at Castle Dugan,
	and making love to Miss Dorothy in
	form.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	No, Dorothy, except for you and four
	others, I vow before all the gods,
	my heart had never felt the soft
	flame.

			DOROTHY
	Ah, you men, you men, John, your
	passion is not equal to ours.  We
	are like -- like some plant I've
	read of -- we bear but one flower,
	and then we die!

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Do you mean you never felt an
	inclination for another?

			DOROTHY
	Never, my John, but for thee!  How
	can you ask me such a question?

Raising her hand to his lips.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Darling Dorothea!

Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I pulled out a knot of cherry-
	colored ribbons, which she had given
	me out of her breast, and which
	somehow I always wore upon me, and
	flung them in Captain Best's face,
	and rushed out with my little sword
	drawn.

			RODERICK
	She's a liar -- she's a liar,
	Captain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend
	yourself, if you are a man!

Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while
Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.

Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.

Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small
by the side of the enormous English captain.

Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back
clutching at his sword.

Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,
screaming:

			DOROTHY
	Captain Best, for Heaven's sake,
	spare the child -- he is but an
	infant.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	And ought to be whipped for his
	impudence, but never fear, Miss
	Dugan, I shall not touch him, your
	favorite is safe from me.

So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of
ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and
handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:

			CAPTAIN BEST
	When ladies make presents to
	gentlemen, it is time for other
	gentlemen to retire...

			DOROTHY
	Good heavens, Best!  He is but a boy
	and don't signify any more than my
	parrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a
	bit of ribbon to my own cousin?

			RODERICK
		   (roaring)
	I'm a man, and will prove it.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	You are perfectly welcome, miss, as
	many yards as you like.

			DOROTHY
	Monster!  Your father was a tailor,
	and you are always thinking of the
	shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I
	will!  Roddy, will you see me
	insulted?

			RODERICK
	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to
	have his blood as sure as my name's
	Roderick.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll send for the usher to cane you,
	little boy, but as for you, miss, I
	have the honor to wish you a good
	day.

Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low
bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's
cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by
the scream.

			MICHAEL
	Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the
	matter here?

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.
	I have had enough of Miss Dugan here
	and your Irish ways.  I ain't used
	to 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
		   (good-humoredly)
	Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make
	you used to our ways, or adopt
	English ones.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	It's not the English way, for ladies
	to have two lovers, and, so, Mr.
	Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the
	sum you owe me, and I resign all
	claims to this young lady.  If she
	has a fancy for school-boys, let her
	take 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
	Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I never was more in earnest.

Best exits.

			MICHAEL
		   (in a towering rage)
	You -- you!  Hang you for a meddling
	brat, your hand is in everybody's
	pie.  What business had you to come
	brawling and quarreling here, with
	a gentleman who has fifteen hundred
	a-year?

Michael runs after Best.

			DOROTHY
		   (gasps)
	Oh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I
	shall never leave this spot.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (whisper to Dorothy)
	The Captain is gone.

Dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks
towards the house.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (in a soothing tone
		    to Roderick)
	This is a pretty way to recommend
	yourself to the family.

			RODERICK
		   (shouts after
		    Michael)
	The man that marries Dorothy Dugan
	must first kill me -- do you mind
	that?

			MICHAEL
		   (shouting back from
		    a distance)
	Pooh, sir.  Kill you -- flog you,
	you mean!  I'll send for Nick the
	huntsman to do it.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	You are a gallant lad, and I like
	your spirit.  But what Dugan says is
	true.  It's a hard thing to give a
	lad counsel who is in such a far-
	gone state as you; but, believe me,
	I know the world, and if you will
	but follow my advice, you won't
	regret having taken it.  Dorothy
	Dugan has not a penny; you are not a
	whit richer.  And, my poor boy,
	don't you see -- though it's a hard
	matter to see -- that she's a flirt,
	and does not care a pin for you or
	Best either?

			RODERICK
	Dorothy might love me or not, as she
	likes, but Best will have to fight
	me before he marries her!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Faith, I think you are a lad that's
	likely to keep your word.

He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he
walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he
goes through the old gate out of the garden.

When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he
flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made
believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and
bursts into a passion of tears.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I must have sat for some hours
	bemoaning myself on the garden-bench,
	for the dinner-bell clanged as usual
	at three o'clock, which wakened me
	from my reverie.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

As Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's
saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious
red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the
scullion-girls and kitchen people.

			MAID
	The Englishman's still there, Master
	Roderick.  He's there in the parlor.
	Go in, and don't let 'im browbeat
	you, Master Roderick.

INT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the
big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.

			UNCLE
	Hello, Roddy, my boy!  Up and well?
	That's right.

			AUNT
	He'd better be home with his mother.

			UNCLE
	Don't mind her.  It's the cold goose
	she ate for breakfast -- didn't
	agree with her.  Take a glass of
	spirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's
	health.

It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what
happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,
and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his
side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and
Roderick looks on as cold as stone.

His uncle is in high good-humor.

			UNCLE
	Dorothy, divide that merry thought
	with the captain!  See who'll be
	married first.  Jack Best, my dear
	boy, never mind a clean glass for
	the claret, we're short of crystal
	at Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and
	the wine will taste none the worse.
	Mrs. Dugan and ladies, if you
	please; this is a sort of toast that
	is drunk a great deal too seldom in
	my family, and you'll please to
	receive it with all the honors.
	Here's to Captain and Mrs. John
	Best, and long life to them.  Kiss
	her, Jack, you rogue; for faith,
	you've got a treasure.

			RODERICK
		   (spring up)
	His already?!

			HARRY
	Hold your tongue, you fool -- hold
	your tongue!

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	He has already been slapped in the
	face this morning, Captain John
	Best; he's already been called a
	coward, Captain John Best; and this
	is the way I'll drink his health.
	Here's your health, Captain John
	Best.

Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next
moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who
hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he
hardly has time to hear the general screaming and
scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully
occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which
Harry is belaboring him.

			HARRY
	You fool!  You great blundering
	marplot -- you silly beggarly
	brat --
		   (a thump at each)
	Hold your tongue!

When Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are
all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the
captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut
across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.

			UNCLE
	In Heaven's name, what does all the
	row mean?  Is the boy in fever
	again?

			HARRY
		   (turning to his
		    father)
	The fact is, sir, that the young
	monkey has fallen in love with
	Dorothy, and finding her and the
	captain mighty sweet in the garden
	today, he was for murdering Jack
	Best.

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (bristling up)
	And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan,
	I've been insulted grossly in this
	house.  I ain't at all satisfied
	with these here ways of going on.
	I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man
	of property; and I -- I --

			HARRY
	If you're insulted, and not
	satisfied, remember there's two of
	us, Best.

On which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,
and answering never a word.

			RODERICK
		   (in dignified tone)
	Mr. Best may also have satisfaction
	any time he pleases, by calling on
	Roderick James, Esquire, of
	Jamesville.

His uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain
Grogan joins.

			RODERICK
	Captain Grogan, I beg you to
	understand that, for my cousin
	Harry, who has been my best friend
	through life, I could put up with
	rough treatment from him; yet, even
	that sort of treatment I will bear
	from him no longer; and any other
	person who ventures on the like will
	not like the cost.  Mr. Best knows
	that fact very well; and, if he's
	man, he'll know where to find me.

			UNCLE
	It is getting late, and your mother
	will be anxious about you.  One of
	you had better go home with him.
		   (turning to his sons)
	Or the lad may be playing more
	pranks.

			HARRY
	Both of us ride home with Best here.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My
	man is armed, and so am I.

			HARRY
	You know the use of arms very well,
	Best, and no one can doubt your
	courage; but Michael and I will see
	you home for all that.

			UNCLE
	Why, you'll not be home till
	morning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good
	ten miles from here.

			HARRY
	We'll sleep in Best's quarters.
	We're going to stop a week there.
	And, in another week, my boy.

And here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I'll go home with the boy.

EXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY

Grogan walks with Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A pretty day's work of it you have
	made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your
	uncle to be distressed for money,
	and try and break off a match which
	will bring fifteen hundred a-year
	into the family?  Best has promised
	to pay off the four thousand pounds
	which is bothering your uncle so.
	He takes a girl without a penny -- a
	girl that has been flinging herself
	at the head of every man in these
	parts these ten years past, and
	missing them all, and a boy who
	ought to be attached to your uncle
	as to your father.

			RODERICK
	And so I am.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And this is the return you make for
	his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you
	in his house when your father died,
	and hasn't he given you and your
	mother, rent-free, your fine house
	of Jamesville yonder?

			RODERICK
	Mark this, come what will of it, I
	swear I will fight the man who
	pretends to the hand of Dorothy
	Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into
	the church, and meet him there.
	I'll have his blood, or he shall
	have mine.  Will you take my message
	to him, and arrange the meeting?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Well, if it must be, it must.  For a
	young fellow, you are the most
	bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No
	officer, bearing His Majesty's
	commission, can receive a glass of
	wine on his nose, without resenting
	it -- fight you must, and Best is a
	huge, strong fellow.

			RODERICK
	He'll give the better mark.  I am
	not afraid of him.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	In faith, I believe you are not; for
	a lad I never saw more game in my
	life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy.
	You're after my own soul.  As long
	as Jack Grogan lives, you shall
	never want a friend or a second.

They embrace.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Poor fellow!  He was shot six months
	afterwards, at Minden, and I lost
	thereby a kind friend.  But we don't
	know what is in store for us, and
	that's a blessing.

EXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY

Mother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In spite of my precautions to
	secrecy, I half-suspected that my
	mother knew all from the manner in
	which she embraced me on my arrival,
	and received our guest, Captain
	Grogan.

His mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every
now and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But she would not say a word about
	the quarrel, for she had a noble
	spirit, and would as lief have seen
	any one of her kindred hanged as
	shirking from the field of honor.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick waking up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never slept sounder in my life,
	though I woke a little earlier than
	usual, and you may be sure my first
	thought was of the event of the day,
	for which I was fully prepared.

Roderick at table with paper and ink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And now I sat down and wrote a
	couple of letters; they might be the
	last, thought I, that I should ever
	write in my life.

See him write:  "Dearest Mother."

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then I went down to breakfast, where
	my mother was waiting for me, you
	may be sure.  We did not say a
	single word about what was taking
	place.

Roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in
helping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother
starts up with a scream.

			MOTHER
	Thank God, it's fallen towards me!

And then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  They have their faults, those
	mothers; but are there any other
	women like them?

There is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on
the mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late
father.

A pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture.

Roderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are
bright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and
gunpowder.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Captain Grogan and Orderly arrive.

			RODERICK
	Have you taken my message to him?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	The meeting is arranged.  Captain
	Best is waiting for you now.

			RODERICK
	My mare is saddled and ready; who's
	the captain's second?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Your cousins go out with him.

Roderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I didn't take leave of Mrs. James.
	The curtains of her bedroom-windows
	were down, and they didn't move as
	we mounted and trotted off.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

They ride their horses at a leisurely pace.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	That's a very handsome sword you
	have there.

			RODERICK
	It was with this sword that my late
	father, Harry James, God rest his
	soul, met Sir Huddelstone
	Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet,
	and was fatally run through the
	neck.  He was quite in the wrong,
	having insulted Lady Fuddelstone,
	when in liquor, at the Brentford
	Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he
	scorned to apologize.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And now you risk the same fate.  If
	you are killed, your mother is all
	alone in the world.

			RODERICK
	I am Harry James' son, and will act
	as becomes my name and quality.

EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY

Harry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best,
flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a
grenadier company.  The party are laughing together.

			RODERICK
		   (to Captain Grogan)
	I hope to spoil this sport, and
	trust to see this sword of mine in
	that big bully's body.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You
	are no match for Best with the
	sword.

			RODERICK
	I'll match any man with the sword.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	But swords are today impossible;
	Captain Best is -- is lame.  He
	knocked his knee against the
	swinging park gate last night, as he
	was riding home, and can scarce move
	it now.

			RODERICK
	Not against Castle Dugan gate, that
	has been off the hinges these ten
	years.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	It must have been some other gate.

They alight from their horses, and join and salute the
other gentlemen.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I have just explained to Mister
	James that Captain Best is lame, and
	that swords are impossible.

			HARRY
	Oh, yes!  Dead lame.

Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while
Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.

			HARRY
	And very lucky for you, Roderick, my
	boy.  You were a dead man else, for
	he is a devil of a fellow -- isn't
	he, Grogan?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A regular Turk.  I never yet knew
	the man who stood to Captain Best.

			HARRY
	Hang the business.  I hate it.  I'm
	ashamed of it.  Say you're sorry,
	Roderick.  You can easily say that.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	If the young feller will go to
	Dublin, as proposed...

			RODERICK
	I'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize
	-- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as
	to hell!

Grogan takes him aside.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is
	silly business.  The girl will marry
	Best, mark my words; and as sure as
	she does, you'll forget her.  You
	are but a boy.  Best is willing to
	consider you as such.  Dublin's a
	fine place, and if you have a mind
	to take a ride thither and see the
	town for a month, here are twenty
	guineas at your service.  Make Best
	an apology, and be off.

			RODERICK
	A man of honor dies, but never
	apologizes.  I'll see the captain
	hanged before I apologize.

			HARRY
		   (with a laugh to
		    Grogan)
	There's nothing else for it.  Take
	your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces,
	I suppose?

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (in a big voice)
	Ten, sir, and make them short ones,
	do you hear, Captain Grogan?

			HARRY
	Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the
	pistols.
		   (with some emotion
		    to Roderick)
	God bless you, my boy; and when I
	count three, fire.

			RODERICK
	This is not one of my pistols.

			HARRY
	They are all right, never fear.
	It's one of mine.  Yours will serve,
	if they are needed, for the next
	round.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Roderick, fire at his neck -- hit
	him there under the gorget; see how
	the fool shows himself open.

Michael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain
retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.

It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover
his man well.

Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are
given.

At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most
horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.

			THE SECONDS
		   (crying out)
	He's down!  He's down!

Running towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes
his head.

			MICHAEL
	He's hit here, in the neck.

Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under
his gorget.

			HARRY
	How is it with you?

The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support
of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once
more and falls backwards.

			MICHAEL
		   (with a scowl)
	The young fellow has begun well.
	You had better ride off, young sir,
	before the police are up.  They had
	wind of the business before we left
	Kilwangan.

			RODERICK
	Is he quite dead?

			MICHAEL
	Quite dead.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Then the world's rid of a coward.
	It's all over with him, Roddy -- he
	doesn't stir.

He gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his
foot.

			HARRY
	We are not cowards, Grogan, whatever
	he was!  Let's get the boy off as
	quick as we may.  Your man shall go
	for a cart, and take away the body
	of this unhappy gentleman.  This has
	been a sad day's work for our
	family, Roderick James, and you have
	robbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year.

			RODERICK
	It was Dorothy did it.

Roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his
waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the
body of Captain Best.

			RODERICK
	There!  Take her those ribbons.
	She'll know what they mean; that's
	all that's left of her of two lovers
	she had and ruined.

			MICHAEL
	And now, in Heaven's name, get the
	youngster out of the way.

			HARRY
	I'll go with you.

They mount up and gallop off.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Upon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who
has been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild
screams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I need not tell you how great was my
	mother's pride and exultation when
	she heard from Harry's lips the
	account of my behavior at the duel.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY

Still much excitement and hustle and bustle.

			HARRY
	The boy must go into hiding, for a
	short time anyway.  Dublin is the
	best place for him to go, and there
	wait until matters are blown over.

			MOTHER
	Dublin?  But the poor lad has never
	been away from home.  He will be as
	safe here as in Dublin.

			HARRY
	I wish that were true, Auntie dear,
	but I'm afraid the bailiffs may
	already be on their way from
	Kilwangan.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother is rushing about and packing a valise.  Harry
sits on the bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Harry persisted in the necessity of
	instant departure, in which
	argument, as I was anxious to see
	the world, I must confess, I sided
	with him; and my mother was brought
	to see that, in our small house, in
	the midst of a village, escape would
	be impossible, and capture would be
	impossible to avoid.

INT.  MOTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire, and
gives Roderick twenty golden guineas.

			MOTHER
		   (gravely)
	Roderick, my darling, my wild boy, I
	have forebodings that our separation
	is to be a long one.  I spent most
	of all night consulting the cards
	regarding your fate in the duel, and
	all signs betoke a separation.  Here
	is twenty guineas -- all that I have
	in the world -- and I want you to
	keep your father's sword and
	pistols, which you have known to use
	so like a man.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Roderick's departure.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She hurried my departure now, though
	her heart, I know, was full, and
	almost in half-an-hour from my
	arrival at home, I was once more on
	the road again, with the wide world,
	as it were, before me.

Roderick waves.  His mother cries.

EXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	No lad of seventeen is very sad who
	has liberty for the first time, and
	twenty guineas in his pocket; and I
	rode away, thinking, I confess, not
	so much of the kind of mother left
	alone, and of the home behind me, as
	of tomorrow, and all the wonders it
	would bring.

Roderick happily riding down the road.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had no doubts of the future;
	thinking that a man of my person,
	parts, and courage, could make his
	way anywhere.  So I rode on, singing
	to myself, or chatting with the
	passersby; and all the girls along
	the road said, "God save me, for a
	clever gentleman."

Farm girls in the fields flirting with him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan,
	there seemed to be a gap of a half-
	a-score of years.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,
with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts
his horse alongside.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Good day to you, young sir.

			RODERICK
	Good morning.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Where are you bound for?

			RODERICK
		   (after a long look at
		    his companion)
	That is none of your business.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Is your mother not afraid on account
	of the highwayman to let one so
	young as you travel?

			RODERICK
		   (pulling out a
		    pistol)
	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of
	good pistols that have already done
	execution, and are ready to do it
	again.

At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed
gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A little later on, as I rode towards
	Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant
	people assembled round a one-horse
	chair, and my friend in green, as I
	thought, making off half-a-mile up
	the hill.

A footman howls, at the top of his voice.

			FOOTMAN
	Stop thief!

But the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and
make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just
befallen.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, you might have kept him off
	with your blunderbush!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	O the coward!  To let the Captain
	bate you, and he only one eye!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #3
	The next time my lady travels, she'd
	better leave you at home!

			RODERICK
	What is this noise, fellows?

Roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the
carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his
whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off.

Pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance
to the chair-window.

			RODERICK
	What has happened, madam, to annoy
	your ladyship?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am
	the wife of Captain O'Reilly
	hastening to join him at Dublin.  My
	chair was stopped by a highwayman;
	this great oaf of a servant-man fell
	down on his knees, armed as he was,
	and though there were thirty people
	in the next field, working, when the
	ruffian attacked, not one of them
	would help but, on the contrary,
	wished him "good luck."

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, he's the friend of the poor,
	and good luck to him.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	Was it any business of ours?

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	Be off to your work, you pack of
	rascals, or you will have a good
	taste of my thong.
		   (to Mrs. O'Reilly)
	Have you lost much?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Everything -- my purse, containing
	upwards of a hundred guineas, my
	jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches.
	And all because this blundering
	coward fell to his knees...

			FOOTMAN
	Be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much.
	Didn't he return you the thirteen
	pence in copper, and the watch,
	saying it was only pinchbeck?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Don't be insolent, or I'll report
	you to the Captain.

			FOOTMAN
	Sorry, ma'am.

He shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction
that the Captain has vanished.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	That fool didn't know what was the
	meaning of a hundred-pound bill,
	which was in the pocket-book that
	the fellow took from me.

			RODERICK
	I am riding to Dublin myself, and if
	your ladyship will allow me the
	honor of riding with you, I shall do
	my best to protect you from further
	mishap.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	But I shouldn't like to put you to
	such trouble, Mister...?

			RODERICK
	O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

EXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY

They stop at the inn.

			RODERICK
		   (very gallantly)
	As you have been robbed of your
	purse, may I have permission to lend
	your ladyship a couple of pieces to
	pay any expenses which you might
	incur before reaching your home?

			MRS. O'REILLY
		   (smiling)
	That's very kind of you, Mr.
	O'Higgins.

He gives her two gold pieces.

INT.  INN - DAY

Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal.

We will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How different was her lively rattle
	to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan
	assemblies.  In every sentence, she
	mentioned a lord or a person of
	quality.  To the lady's question
	about my birth and parentage, I
	replied that I was a young gentleman
	of large fortune, that I was going
	to Dublin for my studies, and that
	my mother allowed me five hundred
	per annum.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	You must be very cautious with
	regard to the company you should
	meet in Dublin, where rogues and
	adventurers of all countries abound.
	I hope you will do me the honor of
	accepting lodgings in my own house,
	where Captain O'Reilly will welcome
	with delight, my gallant young
	preserver.

Paying the bill.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Perhaps had I been a little older in
	the world's experience, I should
	have begun to see that Madame
	O'Reilly was not the person of
	fashion she pretended to be; but, as
	it was, I took all her stories for
	truth, and, when the landlord
	brought the bill for dinner, paid it
	with the air of a lord.  Indeed, she
	made no motion to produce the two
	pieces I had lent her.

EXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT

They ride by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so we rode on slowly towards
	Dublin, into which city we made our
	entrance at nightfall.  The rattle
	and splendor of the coaches, the
	flare of the linkboys, the number
	and magnificence of the houses,
	struck me with the greatest wonder;
	though I was careful to disguise
	this feeling.

EXT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DUBLIN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We stopped at length at a house of
	rather mean appearance, and were let
	into a passage which had a great
	smell of supper and punch.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Captain O'Reilly, a stout red-faced man, without a
periwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap.
Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how
	grateful I am for your timely
	assistance to my wife.

			RODERICK
	I am only sorry that I was unable to
	prevent the villain from carrying
	off all her ladyship's money and
	pearls.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt,
	and rest assured, sir, you have
	friends in this house whenever you
	are in Dublin.
		   (pours a glass)
	Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know
	your good father?

			RODERICK
	Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I
	have never heard your name mentioned
	in my family.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins
	of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins
	was a close friend of my wife's dear
	father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

			RODERICK
	Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine
	are the O'Higgins of Watertown.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I have heard of them.

There are relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a
cracked dish before them.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	My love, I wish I had known of your
	coming, for Bob Moriaty and I just
	finished the most delicious venison
	pasty, which His Grace the Lord
	Lieutenant, sent us, with a flash of
	sillery from his own cellar.  You
	know the wine, my dear?  But as
	bygones are bygones, and no help for
	them, what say ye to a fine lobster
	and a bottle of as good claret as
	any in Ireland?  Betty, clear these
	things from the table, and make the
	mistress and our young friend
	welcome to our home.

Captain O'Reilly searches his pockets for some money to
give to Betty.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I'm sorry, Mr. O'Higgins, but I
	don't seem to have any small change.
	May I borrow a ten-penny piece to
	give to the girl?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	I have some money, my dear.  Here,
	Betty, go to the fishmonger and
	bring back our supper, and mind you
	get the right change.

She takes out one of the golden guineas Roderick gave to
her.

INT.  DINNING ROOM - LATER

They are eating.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our supper was seasoned, if not by
	any great elegance, at least by a
	plentiful store of anecdotes,
	concerning the highest personages of
	the city, with whom, according to
	himself, the captain lived on terms
	of the utmost intimacy.  Not to be
	behind hand with him, I spoke of my
	own estates and property as if I was
	as rich as a duke.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The couple wishing Roderick goodnight.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Had I been an English lad, the
	appearance of the chamber I occupied
	might, indeed, have aroused
	instantly my suspicion and distrust.
	But we are not particular in Ireland
	on the score of neatness, hence the
	disorder of my bed-chamber did not
	strike me so much.

Broken door.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was there a lock to the door, or a
	hasp to fasten it to?

Dress lying over bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Though my counterpane was evidently
	a greased brocade dress of Mrs.
	O'Reilly.

Cracked mirror.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And my cracked toilet-glass not much
	bigger than a half-crown, yet I was
	used to these sort of ways in Irish
	houses, and still thought myself to
	be in that of a man of fashion.

Drawers, full of junk.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was no lock to the drawers,
	which, when they did open, were full
	of my hostess' rouge-pots, shoes,
	stays, and rags.

INT.  BEDROOM - O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

In the middle of the night, Mrs. O'Reilly comes to
Roderick's room on a flimsy pretext, and in the course of
events, he has his first woman.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I needn't ask whether you had a
	comfortable bed.  Young Fred
	Pimpleton slept in it for seven
	months, during which he did me the
	honor to stay with me, and if he was
	satisfied, I don't know who else
	wouldn't be.

EXT.  PROMENADE - PHOENIX PARK - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly, their friends.
Various cuts.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After breakfast, we drove out to
	Phoenix Park, where numbers of the
	young gentry were known to Mrs.
	O'Reilly, to all of whom she
	presented me in such a complimentary
	way that, before half an hour, I had
	got to be considered as a gentleman
	of great expectations and large
	property.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had little notion then that I had
	got amongst a set of impostors --
	that Captain O'Reilly was only an
	adventurer, and his lady a person of
	no credit.  The fact was, a young
	man could hardly have fallen into
	worse hands than those in which I
	now found myself.

An evening of gambling.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Their friends were always welcome on
	payment of a certain moderate sum
	for their dinner after which, you
	may be sure, that cards were not
	wanting, and that the company who
	played did not play for love merely.

Various cuts of the characters present.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What could happen to a man but
	misfortune from associating with
	such company?  And in a very, very
	short time I became their prey.

Roderick loses two hundred guineas to Captain O'Reilly in
a single hand.

We see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not.

He pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum
his mother gave him.

			RODERICK
	I shall have to write out a note for
	the rest of it, Captain O'Reilly.

EXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN

Roderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling
can still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by
Councillor Mulligan.

			COUNCILLOR MULLIGAN
	Master Roderick, you appear a young
	fellow of birth and fortune; let me
	whisper in your ear that you have
	fallen into very bad hands -- it's a
	regular gang of swindlers; and a
	gentleman of your rank and quality
	should never be seen in such
	company.  The captain has been a
	gentleman's gentleman, and his lady
	of no higher rank.  Go home, pack
	your valise, pay the little trifle
	you owe me, mount your mare, and
	ride back again to your parents --
	it's the very best thing you can do.

Roderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him
down the street.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Roderick enters.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Into a pretty nest of villains,
	indeed, was I plunged!  When I
	returned to my bed-chamber, a few
	hours later, it seemed as if all my
	misfortunes were to break on me at
	once.

Valise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's
keys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Whom have I been harboring in my
	house?  Who are you, sirrah?

			RODERICK
	Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a
	gentleman as any in Ireland!

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	You're an impostor, young man, a
	schemer, a deceiver!

			RODERICK
	Repeat the words again, and I run
	you through the body.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as
	well as you, Mr. Roderick James.
	Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your
	secret is known, is it?  You come
	like a viper into the bosom of
	innocent families; you represent
	yourself as the heir to my friends
	the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I
	introduce you to the nobility and
	gentry of this methropolis; I take
	you to my tradesmen, who give you
	credit.  I accept your note for near
	two hundred pounds, and what do I
	find?  A fraud.

He holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the
linen.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Not Master O'Higgins of Watertown,
	but Roderick James of the devil only
	knows where...

Captain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver
toilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, Mr. O'Reilly, I will tell
	you why I was obliged to alter my
	name, which is James and the best
	name in Ireland.  I changed it, sir,
	because, on the day before I came to
	Dublin, I killed a man in deadly
	combat -- an Englishman, sir, and a
	Captain in His Majesty's service;
	and if you offer to let or hinder me
	in the slightest way, the same arm
	which destroyed him is ready to
	punish you.

So saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and
giving a "ha, ha!" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it
within an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and
turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings
herself between them.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Dearest Roderick -- be pacified.
	O'Reilly, you don't want the poor
	child's blood.  Let him escape -- in
	Heaven's name, let him go.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
		   (sulkily)
	He may go hang for me, and he's
	better be off quickly, for I shall
	go to the magistrate if I see him
	again.

O'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins
to cry.

EXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY

Roderick riding down the street, with his valise.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Where was now a home for the
	descendant of the James?  I was
	expelled from Dublin by a
	persecution occasioned, I must
	confess, by my own imprudence.  I
	had no time to wait and choose.  No
	place of refuge to fly to.

INT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was a score of recruiting
	parties in the town beating up for
	men to join our gallant armies in
	America and Germany.

Roderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly
make him welcome.

			RODERICK
	I will tell you frankly, sir.  I am
	a young gentleman in difficulties; I
	have killed an officer in a duel,
	and I am anxious to get out of the
	country.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I needn't have troubled myself
	with any explanations; King George
	was in too much want of men to heed
	from whence they came -- and a
	fellow of my inches was always
	welcome.  Indeed, I could not have
	chosen my time better.  A transport
	was lying at Dunleary, waiting for a
	wind.

EXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never had a taste for any thing
	but genteel company, and hate all
	descriptions of low life.  Hence my
	account of the society in which I at
	present found myself must of
	necessity be short.  The
	reminiscences of the horrid black-
	hole of a place in which we soldiers
	were confined, of the wretched
	creatures with whom I was now forced
	to keep company, of the plowmen,
	poachers, pickpockets, who had taken
	refuge from poverty, or the law, as,
	in truth, I had done myself, is
	enough to make me ashamed even now.

Roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid
bacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess.
When it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is
served, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing
somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water.  The
beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning
round to the messman and saying:

			RODERICK
	Fellow, get me a glass!

At which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of
laughter, the very loudest among them being Mr. Toole, a
red-haired monster of a man.

			MR. TOOLE
	Get the gentleman a towel for his
	hands, and serve him a basin of
	turtle-soup.

Roars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on
the deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly
seizes Roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst
of another burst of applause.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	If you want to vex him, ask him
	about his wife, the washerwoman, who
	bates him.

			RODERICK
	Is it a towel of your wife's
	washing, Mr. Toole?  I'm told she
	wiped your face often with one.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	Ask him why he wouldn't see her
	yesterday, when she came to the
	ship.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so I put to him some other
	foolish jokes about soapsuds, hen-
	pecking, and flat-irons, which set
	the man into a fury, and succeeded
	in raising a quarrel between us.

Roderick and Toole fight with cudgels.  Roderick gives him
a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the
floor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	This victory over the cock of the
	vile dunghill obtained me respect
	among the wretches among whom I
	formed part.

EXT.  MILITARY DRILL FIELD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our passage was very favorable, and
	in two days we landed at Cuxhaven,
	and before I had been a month in the
	Electorate, I was transported into a
	tall and proper young soldier, and,
	having a natural aptitude for
	military exercise, was soon as
	accomplished at the drill as the
	oldest sergeant in the regiment.

Various cuts.

Roderick learning the soldierly arts, musket drill, manual
of arms, bayonet, marching.

EXT.  MILITARY COURTYARD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

The Cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new
regiment, arrived from England.

Roderick sees, marching at the head of his company, his
old friend, Captain Grogan, who gives him a wink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Six weeks after we arrived in
	Cuxhaven, we were reinforced by
	Gales regiment of foot from England,
	and I promise you the sight of
	Grogan's face was most welcome to
	me, for it assured me that a friend
	was near me.

INT.  GROGAN'S QUARTERS - DAY

Roderick and Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Grogan gave me a wink of
	recognition, but offered no public
	token of acquaintance and it was not
	until two days afterwards that he
	called me into his quarters, and
	then, shaking hands with me
	cordially, gave me news which I
	wanted, of my family.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith,
	you've begun early, like your
	father's son, but I think you could
	not do better than as you have done.
	But why did you not write home to
	your poor mother?  She has sent
	half-a-dozen letters to you in
	Dublin.

			RODERICK
	I suppose she addressed them to me
	in my real name, by which I never
	thought to ask for them at the post
	office.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	We must write to her today, and you
	can tell her that you are safe and
	married to "Brown Bess."

Roderick sighs when Grogan says the word "married," on
which Grogan says with a laugh:

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I see you are thinking of a certain
	young lady at Duganstown.

			RODERICK
	Is Miss Dugan well?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	There's only six Miss Dugans now...
	poor Dorothy.

			RODERICK
	Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she
	died of grief?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	She took on so at your going away
	that she was obliged to console
	herself with a husband.  She is now
	Mrs. John Best.

			RODERICK
	Mrs. John Best!  Was there another
	Mr. John Best?!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	No, the very same one, my boy.  He
	recovered from his wound.  The ball
	you hit him with was not likely to
	hurt him.  It was only made of tow.
	Do you think the Dugans would let
	you kill fifteen hundred a-year out
	of the family?  The plan of the duel
	was all arranged in order to get you
	out of the way, for the cowardly
	Englishman could never be brought to
	marry from fear of you.  But hit him
	you certainly did, Roderick, and
	with a fine thick plugget of tow,
	and the fellow was so frightened
	that he was an hour in coming to.
	We told your mother the story
	afterwards, and a pretty scene she
	made.

			RODERICK
	The coward!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	He has paid off your uncle's
	mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach-
	and-six.  That coward of a fellow
	has been making of your uncle's
	family.  Faith, the business was
	well done.  Your cousins, Michael
	and Harry, never let him out of
	their sight, though he was for
	deserting to England, until the
	marriage was completed, and the
	happy couple off on their road to
	Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my
	boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got
	a couple of hundred out of Master
	Best for my share and, while they
	last, you shall never want.

EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - BRITISH ON THE MARCH - DAY

Roderick on the march.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our regiment, which was quartered
	about Stade and Luneberg, speedily
	had got orders to march southwards
	towards the Rhine, where we would
	fight the famous battle of Minden.
	It would require a greater
	philosopher and historian than I am
	to explain the causes of the famous
	Seven Years' War in which Europe was
	engaged, and, indeed, its origin has
	always appeared to me to be so
	complicated, and the books written
	about it so amazingly hard to
	understand, that I have seldom been
	much wiser at the end of a chapter
	than at the beginning, and so shall
	not trouble you with any personal
	disquisitions concerning the matter.

Various cuts featuring Roderick; marching, cooking at open
fires, gambling, resting in a farm yard, officers riding
by; shivering in his blanket.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD OF MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENT - DAY

Roderick and his company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Were these memoirs not characterized
	by truth, I might easily make myself
	the hero of some strange and popular
	adventures.

EXT.  MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

Officers ride by in smoke.  Troops marching to the attack.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I saw no one of the higher ranks
	that day than my colonel and a
	couple of orderly officers riding by
	in the smoke -- no one on our side,
	that is.  A poor corporal is not
	generally invited into the company
	of commanders and the great.

Roderick advancing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But, in revenge, I saw, I promise
	you, some very good company on the
	French part, for their regiments of
	Lorraine and Royal Cravate were
	charging us all day; and in the sort
	of melee high and low are pretty
	equally received.  I hate bragging,
	but I cannot help saying that I made
	a very close acquaintance with the
	colonel of the Cravates.

Roderick firing his musket.  He bayonets a French colonel,
amidst shouts and curses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And finished off a poor little
	ensign, so young, slender, and
	small, that a blow from my pigtail
	would have dispatched him.

Roderick kills a French ensign with a blows from the butt
of his musket.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And in the poor ensign's pocket
	found a purse of fourteen louis
	d'or, and a silver box of sugar-
	plums, of which the former present
	was very agreeable to me.

Roderick taking money and the box of sugar-plums from the
ensign.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If people would tell their stories
	of battles in this simple way, I
	think the cause of truth would not
	suffer by it.  All I know of this
	famous fight of Minden, except from
	books, is told here above.

Captain Grogan is shot, cries out, and falls.

A brother captain turns to Lieutenant Lakenham.

			CAPTAIN
	Grogan's down; Lakenham, there's
	your company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	That was all the epitaph my brave
	patron got.

Roderick kneels above Grogan.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I should have left you a hundred
	guineas, Roderick, but for a cursed
	run of ill-luck last night at faro.

He gives Roderick a faint squeeze of the hand; and, as the
word is given to advance, Roderick leaves him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When we came back to our ground,
	which we presently did, he was lying
	still, but he was dead.  Some of our
	people had already torn off his
	epaulets, and, no doubt, had rifled
	his purse.

EXT.  VARIOUS ROUGH RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

Short cuts to voice over.

Roderick and British troops rape, pillage and burn.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After the death of my protector,
	Captain Grogan, I am forced to
	confess that I fell into the very
	worst of courses and company.  In a
	foreign country, with the enemy
	before us, and the people
	continually under contribution from
	one side or the other, numberless
	irregularities were permitted to the
	troops.  It is well for gentlemen to
	talk of the age of chivalry; but
	remember the starving brutes whom
	they lead -- men nursed in poverty,
	entirely ignorant, made to take
	pride in deeds of blood -- men who
	can have no amusement but in
	drunkenness, debauch, and plunder.
	It is with these shocking
	instruments that your great warriors
	and kings have been doing their
	murderous work in the world.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - WARBURG - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The year in which George II died,
	our regiment had the honor to be
	present at the Battle of Warburg,
	where Prince Ferdinand once more
	completely defeated the Frenchmen.

Lieutenant Lakenham is shot, falls, and cries for help.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	During the action, my lieutenant,
	Mr. Lakenham, of Lakenham, was
	struck by a musket-ball in the side.
	He had shown no want of courage in
	this or any other occasion where he
	had been called upon to act against
	the French; but this was his first
	wound, and the young gentleman was
	exceedingly frightened by it.

			LAKENHAM
	Here, you, Roderick James.  I will
	pay you five guineas if you will
	carry me into the town which is hard
	by those woods.

Roderick and another man take him up in a cloak, and carry
him towards the nearby town of Warburg.

EXT.  A FARMHOUSE - GERMAN STREET - WARBURG - DAY

In order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man
are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces,
which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the
door; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her
old, half-blinded father.

They are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but
Mr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a
couple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily
convinces the people that they have only to deal with a
person of honor.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

They carry Lieutenant Lakenham to bed and receive their
five guineas.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We put the patient to bed, and he
	paid me the stipulated reward.  A
	young surgeon, who desired nothing
	better than to take himself out of
	the fire of the musketry, came
	presently to dress the wound.

In his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved
compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking,
with no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be
billeted there.

EXT.  STREET - WARBURG - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DAY

He starts back to the regiment, with his comrade, when the
man interrupts his reverie by suggesting they divide the
five guineas.

			PRIVATE
	I should get half.

			RODERICK
	Your share is one guinea.

Roderick gives him one guinea.

			PRIVATE
	He gave you five guineas, and I
	bloody well expect half.

			RODERICK
	Go to the devil.

The private lifting his musket, hits Roderick a blow with
the butt-end of it, which sends him stunned to the ground,
allowing his comrade to take the other four guineas from
his pocket.

Recovering his senses, Roderick bleeding, with a large
wound in the head, has barely time to stagger back to the
house where he had just left the lieutenant, when he
falls fainting at the door, just as the surgeon exits.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is carried by the surgeon and the black-eyed
girl, into another bed in the room where the Lieutenant
has been laid.

			LAKENHAM
		   (languidly, in pain)
	Who are you putting into that bed?

			LISCHEN
	We have the Corporal, wounded, to
	you bringing.

			LAKENHAM
	A corporal?  Turn him out.  Schicken
	sie Herrn Koporal weg!

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT AND DAY

Lischen brings Roderick a refreshing drink; and, as he
takes it, he presses the kind hand that gave it to him;
nor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I found Lischen the tenderest of
	nurses.  Whenever any delicacy was
	to be provided for the wounded
	lieutenant, a share was always sent
	to the bed opposite his, and to the
	avaricious man's no small annoyance.

Lischen serving food.

Various cuts, representing different days.

Lakenham behaving as rottenly as Roderick describes:

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor was I the only person in the
	house to whom the worthy gentleman
	was uncivil.  He ordered the fair
	Lischen hither and thither, made
	impertinent love to her, abused her
	soups, quarreled with her
	omelettes, and grudged the money
	which was laid out for his
	maintenance, so that our hostess
	detested him as much as, I think,
	without vanity, as she regarded me.

Roderick making lover to Lischen while Lieutenant Lakenham
sulks in the next bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For if truth must be told, I had
	made very deep love to her during my
	stay under her roof, as is always my
	way with women, of whatever age or
	degree of beauty.  Do not think me
	very cruel and heartless, ladies;
	this heart of Lischen's was like
	many a town, which had been stormed
	and occupied several times before I
	came to invest it,

Roderick sitting up in bed.  Lischen has just served him
his supper.

Enter a British officer, an aide who carries a notebook,
and a surgeon.  In a brief scene to be written, we learn
that a sudden movement on the part of the French requires
the British army to follow them.  The town is to be
evacuated, except for some Prussian line-of-communication
troops, whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the
place; and, when they are well, they are to be drafted to
their regiments.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I began to reflect how pleasant my
	quarters were to me, and that I was
	much better here than crawling under
	an odious tent with a parcel of
	tipsy soldiers, or going the night-
	rounds, or rising long before
	daybreak for drill.  I determined
	that I never would join mine again.

EXT.  VIEW OUT OF WARBURG FARMHOUSE WINDOW - DAY

Roderick stands by the window, watching English troops and
wagons leaving the town.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick walks into Lakenham's room attired in his full
regimentals, and with his hat cocked over his left eye.

			RODERICK
	I'm promoted Lieutenant.  I've come
	to take my leave of you.  I intend
	to have your papers and purse.

			LAKENHAM
	You great scoundrel!  You mutinous
	dog!  What do you mean by dressing
	yourself in my regimentals?  As sure
	as my name's Lakenham, when we get
	back to the regiment, I'll have your
	soul cut out of your body.

With this, Roderick puts his hand under his pillow, at
which Lakenham gives a scream that might have called the
whole garrison about his ears.

Roderick threatens him with a knife at his throat.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, sir!  No more noise, or you
	are a dead man!

Roderick, taking his handkerchief, binds it tight round
his mouth, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt,
ties them in a knot together, and so leaves him, removing
the papers and the purse, and wishing him politely a good
day.

EXT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - STREET - DAY

Lischen, waiting outside the house, with a saddled horse,
throws her arms around him, and makes the tenderest adieu.

Roderick mounts his newly-purchased animal, waves his hat
gallantly, and, prances away down the street.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick happily riding along a wooded country road,
rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about
two hundred yards away, a company of Prussian infantry
resting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen
mounted dragoons.

A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed
than to turn back, and he rides into their midst,
approaching a group of officers.

He presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for
directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is
riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map.

During the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches
with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and
says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if
Roderick will honor him with his company.

To avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer,
and the two men mount up, and ride off together.

EXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick and Galgenstein riding together.

Dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My companion treated me with great
	civility, and asked me a thousand
	questions about England, which I
	answered as best I might.  But this
	best, I am bound to say, was bad
	enough.  I knew nothing about
	England, and I invented a thousand
	stories which I told him; described
	the king and the ministers to him,
	said the British ambassador in
	Berlin was my uncle, and promised my
	acquaintance a letter of
	recommendation to him.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What is your uncle's name?

			RODERICK
		   (slowly)
	O'Grady.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (with a laugh)
	Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador
	O'Grady...

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads
together, jogging on.

They pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a
red-coated Hanoverian sergeant.

He exchanges signs of recognition with Captain
Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It hurts my feelings to be obliged
	to commune with such wretches, but
	the stern necessities of war demand
	men continually, and hence these
	recruiters whom you see market in
	human flesh.  They get five-and-
	twenty thaler a man from our
	government for every man they bring
	in.  For fine men -- for men like
	you.
		   (he adds laughing)
	They would go as high as hundred.

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely-
looking place.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	This is a very good inn.  Shall we
	stop for dinner?

			RODERICK
	This may be a very good inn for
	Germany, but it would not pass in
	old Ireland.  Corbach is only a
	league off, let us push on for
	Corbach.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Do you want to see the loveliest
	woman in Europe?

Roderick smiles.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will
	influence you.

			RODERICK
	The place seems more a farm than an
	inn-yard.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The people are great farmers, as
	well as inn-keepers.

They enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and
at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place.

A couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their
horses are littered under a shed hard by.

Lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of
sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their
hats to the captain.

The inn has something foreboding about it, and the men
shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (explaining the gate)
	Parties of French horsemen are about
	the country, and one cannot take too
	many precautions against such
	villains.

The two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain
orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his
bedroom.

Roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his
pains.

They enter into supper.

INT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

A dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous
old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely
creature which had been expected; and the captain,
laughing, says:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Well, our meal is a frugal one, but
	a soldier has many a time a worse.

Taking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great
ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his
weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the
captain's is laid.

The hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine,
at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a
considerable ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (when she leaves)
	Where's the beauty you promised me?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (laughing and looking
		    hard at Roderick)
	It was my joke.  I was tired, and
	did not care to go farther.  There's
	not prettier woman here than that.
	If she won't suit your fancy, my
	friend, then you must wait awhile.

This increases Roderick's ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (sternly)
	Upon my word, sir, I think you have
	acted very coolly.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I have acted as I think fit.

			RODERICK
	Sir, I'm a British officer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It's a lie!  You're a deserter!
	You're an impostor, sir; Your lies
	and folly have confirmed this to me.
	You pretend to carry dispatches to a
	general who has been dead these ten
	months; you have an uncle who is an
	ambassador and whose name you don't
	know.  Will you join and take the
	bounty, sir, or will you be given
	up?

			RODERICK
	Neither!

Springing at him like a tiger.

But, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard.
He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off,
and says, from the other end of the table where he stands
dodging Roderick, as it were.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Advance a step, and I send this
	bullet into your brains!

The door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed
with musket and bayonet to aid their captain.

The game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which
he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the
wine, had removed his sword.

			RODERICK
	I volunteer.

EXT.  A ROAD - DAY

Prussian troops on the march.  Roderick is now one of
them.

Captain Galgenstein rides by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the close of the Seven Years' War,
	the Prussian army, so renowned for
	its disciplined valor, was
	officered and under-officered by
	native Prussians, it is true, but
	was composed for the most part of
	men hired or stolen, like myself,
	from almost every nation in Europe.
	The deserting to and fro was
	prodigious.

EXT.  A FIELD - DAY

Prussian punishment gauntlet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life the private soldier led was
	a frightful one to any but the men
	of iron courage and endurance.  The
	punishment was incessant.

EXT.  VARIOUS RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was not near so unhappy, in spite
	of all, as I had been on my first
	enlisting in Ireland.  At least,
	there will be no one of my
	acquaintance who will witness my
	shame, and that is the point which I
	have always cared for most.

Rape, pillage and burn.

Brief thematic repeat of British army version.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I reasoned with myself thus:  "Now
	you are caught, there is no use in
	repining -- make the best of your
	situation, and get all the pleasure
	you can out of it.  There are a
	thousand opportunities of plunder,
	offered to the soldier in war time,
	out of which he can get both
	pleasure and profit; make use of
	these, and be happy."

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - FRAGMENT

Prussians against Austrians, or French, or Saxons.

Roderick fighting.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I do not intend to make a history of
	battles in the Prussian any more
	than in the English service.  I did
	my duty in them as well as another,
	and there was not a braver,
	cleverer, handsomer, and, I must
	own, wickeder soldier in the
	Prussian army.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ACTION - DAY

			RODERICK
	I had formed myself to the condition
	of the proper fighting beast; on a
	day of action, I was savage and
	happy.

Roderick saves Captain Galgenstein's life.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Roderick is decorated by Colonel Bulow for his heroism in
saving Captain Galgenstein.

Colonel Bulow gives Roderick two Frederic d'or in front of
the regiment.

			COLONEL BULOW
	You are a gallant soldier, and have
	evidently come of good stock; but
	you are idle, dissolute, and
	unprincipled; you have done a deal
	of harm to the men; and, for all
	your talents and bravery, I am sure
	you will come to no good.

			RODERICK
	I hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken
	regarding my character.  I have
	fallen into bad company, it is true;
	but I have only done as other
	soldiers have done; and, above all,
	I have never had a kind friend and
	protector before, to whom I might
	show that I was worthy of better
	things.  The Colonel may say I am a
	ruined lad, and send me to the
	devil; but be sure of this, I would
	go to the devil to serve the
	regiment.

Captain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's
performance.

BERLIN - 1763

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Soon after the war ended, our
	regiment was garrisoned in the
	capital, the least dull, perhaps, of
	all the towns of Prussia; but that
	does not say much for its gaiety.

INT.  ANTE-ROOM - CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick enters and approaches the Captain's sergeant.

			RODERICK
	Private Roderick James.  First
	Hanoverian Guards.  Captain
	Galgenstein sent for me.

			PRUSSIAN SERGEANT
	You may wait.

			RODERICK
	Thank you, sir.

Roderick stands stiffly.  We can make out the sound of
loud talking behind the closed door.

Enter a private huffing and puffing.

			PRIVATE
	Sergeant, the wagon has arrived with
	the Captain's furniture, but the
	driver says he is not supposed to
	unload it.  Is it possible for you
	to talk to him?

Exit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the
office, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what
is being said.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN (O.S.)
	Give him his discharge!  Bon Dieu!
	You are a model of probity!  You'll
	never succeed to my place, my dear
	nephew, if you are no wiser than you
	are just now.  Make the fellow as
	useful to you as you please.  You
	say he has a good manner and a frank
	countenance, that he can lie with
	assurance, and fight, you say, on a
	pinch.  The scoundrel does not want
	for good qualities.  As long as you
	have the regiment in terrorem over
	him, you can do as you like with
	him.  Once let him loose, and the lad
	is likely to give you the slip.
	Keep on promising him; promise to
	make him a general, if you like.
	What the deuce do I care?  There are
	spies enough to be had in this town
	without him.

Roderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to
the door.

Then the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out,
sees Roderick, smiles and say:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Good morning, Private James.  Please
	come in.  I should like you to meet
	my uncle, Herr Minister of Police
	Galgenstein.

			RODERICK
	How do you do, sir?

The Minister nods.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The captain was the nephew and heir
	of the Minister of Police, Herr
	Galgenstein, a relationship which,
	no doubt, aided in the younger
	gentlemen's promotion.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Your loyalty to me and your service
	to the regiment has pleased me very
	well -- and now there is another
	occasion on which you may make
	yourself useful to us; if you
	succeed, depend on it, your reward
	will be your discharge from the
	army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.

			RODERICK
	What is the service, sir?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	There is lately come to Berlin a
	gentleman in the service of the
	Empress Queen, who calls himself the
	Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears
	the red riband and star of the
	pope's order of the Spur.  He is
	made for good society, polished,
	obliging, a libertine, without
	prejudices, fond of women, of good
	food, of high play, prudent and
	discreet.

The Captain smiles at Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	He speaks Italian and French
	indifferently; but we have some
	reason to fancy this Monsieur de
	Belle Fast is a native of your
	country of Ireland, and that he has
	come here as a spy.

The Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Naturally, your knowledge of English
	makes you an ideal choice to go into
	his service.  Of course, you will
	not know a word of English; and if
	the Chevalier asks as to the
	particularity of your accent, say
	you are Hungarian.  The servant who
	came with him will be turned away
	today, and the person to whom he has
	applied for a faithful fellow will
	recommend you.

Roderick nods.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You are a Hungarian; you served in
	the army, and left on account of
	weakness in the loins.  He gambles a
	great deal, and wins.  Do you know
	the cards well?

			RODERICK
	Only a very little, as soldiers do.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I had thought you more expert.  You
	must find out if the Chevalier
	cheats.  He sees the English and
	Austrian envoys continually, and the
	young men of either ministry sup
	repeatedly at his house.  Find out
	what they talk of, for how much each
	plays, especially if any of them
	play on parole.  If you are able to,
	read his private letters, though
	about those which go to the post,
	you need not trouble yourself -- we
	look at them there.  But never see
	him write a note without finding out
	to whom it goes, and by what channel
	or messenger.  He sleeps with the
	keys of his dispatch-box with a
	string around his neck -- twenty
	frederics, if you get an impression
	of the keys.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Does this assignment interest you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, Minister, I am interested in
	any work in which I can be of
	service to Captain Galgenstein.

The Minister studies Roderick, coldly.

EXT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, now dressed in civilian clothes, admires a
beautiful carriage, waiting at the door.  Then he enters.

INT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S APARTMENT - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	You are the young man who M. de
	Seebach recommended?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.

Roderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman,
with which the Captain had taken care to provide him.

As the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the
leisure to examine him.

He is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly,
wearing rings, diamonds and laces.

One of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears
a little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios,
which fall over his lip.

The Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read
the letter.

			CHEVALIER
	Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.

			CHEVALIER
	You come highly recommended by Herr
	Seebach.

			RODERICK
	Herr Seebach was a very kind
	employer.

			CHEVALIER
	For whom else have you worked?

			RODERICK
	No one, sir.  Before that I served
	in the army but had to leave due to
	weakness of the loins.

			CHEVALIER
	Who else can give me information
	about you?

			RODERICK
	Only the agency of servants.

The Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for
a few seconds, and then smiles.

			CHEVALIER
	You will do.  I will give you 30...
	a day.  I do not provide your
	clothing; you will sleep at home,
	and you will be at my orders every
	morning at seven o'clock.

He notices Roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar.

			CHEVALIER
	Is there something wrong?

He goes up to Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was very imprudent of me; but
	when I saw the splendor of his
	appearance, the nobleness of his
	manner, I felt it impossible to keep
	disguise with him.  You, who have
	never been out of your country know
	little what it is to hear a friendly
	voice in captivity; and there's a
	many a man that will understand the
	cause of the burst of feeling which
	was about to take place.

The Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder.

			RODERICK
		   (as he speaks,
		    bursting into tears)
	Sir, I have a confession to make.  I
	am an Irishman, and my name is
	Roderick James.  I was abducted into
	the Prussian army two years ago, and
	now I have been put into your
	service by my Captain and his uncle,
	the Minister of Police, to serve as
	a watch upon your actions, of which
	I am to give information to the same
	quarter.  For this odious service, I
	have been promised my discharge, and
	a hundred guineas.

Sobbing, Roderick falls into his arms.

			CHEVALIER
	The rascals!  They think to catch
	me, do they?  Why, young man, my
	chief conspiracy is a faro-bank.
	But the king is so jealous, that he
	will see a spy in every person who
	comes to his miserable capital, in
	the great sandy desert here.

EXT.  BERLIN - PARK - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And I think he was as much affected
	as I was at thus finding one of his
	kindred; for he, too, was an exile
	from home, and a friendly voice, a
	look, brought the old country back
	to his memory again, and the old
	days of his boyhood.

			CHEVALIER
	I'd give five years of my life to
	see the old country again, the
	greenfields, and the river, and the
	old round tower, and the burying
	place.

EXT.  BERLIN - STREET - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			CHEVALIER
	My lad, I have been in every
	service; and, between ourselves, owe
	money in every capital in Europe.  I
	have been a rolling stone.  Play --
	play has been my ruin!  That and
	beauty.  The women have made a fool
	of me, my dear boy.  I am a soft-
	hearted creature, and this minute,
	at sixty-two, have no more command
	of myself than when Peggy O'Dwyer
	made a fool of me at sixteen.

EXT.  BERLIN - LAKE WANNSEE - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking along the bank.

			CHEVALIER
	The cards are now my only
	livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck,
	and then I lay out my money in these
	trinkets you see.  It's property,
	look you, and the only way I have
	found of keeping a little about me.
	When the luck goes against me, why,
	my dear, my diamonds go to the
	pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do
	you understand the cards?

			RODERICK
	I can play as soldiers do, but have
	no great skill.

			CHEVALIER
	We will practice in the mornings, my
	boy, and I'll put you up to a thing
	or two worth knowing.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOMS - BERLIN - DAY

Quick cuts -- Roderick being taught the profession of
cards and the dice-box.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Minister Galgenstein, and Captain Galgenstein.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I carried my little reports to
	Captain Galgenstein at the Garden
	house outside the town where he gave
	me rendezvous.  These reports, of
	course, were arranged between me and
	the Chevalier beforehand.  I was
	instructed, and it is always the
	best way, to tell as much truth as
	my story would possible bear.

Dialogue comes up from under voice over.

			RODERICK
	He goes to church regularly -- he is
	very religious, and after hearing
	mass comes home to breakfast.  Then
	he takes an airing in his chariot
	till dinner, which is served at
	noon.  After dinner, he writes his
	letters, if he has any letters to
	write; but he has very little to do
	in this way.  His letters are to the
	Austrian envoy, with whom he
	corresponds, but who does not
	acknowledge him; and being written
	in English, or course, I look over
	his shoulder.  He generally writes
	for money.  He makes his party with
	Calsabigi, the lottery contractor,
	the Russian attaches, two from the
	English embassy, my lords Deuceace
	and Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer,
	and a few more.  He wins often, but
	not always.  Lord Deuceace is a very
	fine player.  The Chevalier Elliott,
	the English Minister, sometimes
	comes, on which occasion the
	secretaries do not play.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT

The Chevalier is at play against several gentlemen,
including the Prince of Turbingen, while Roderick signals
the cards.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was agreed that I should keep my
	character of valet, that in the
	presence of strangers I should not
	know a word of English, that I
	should keep good lookout on the
	trumps when I was serving the
	champagne and punch about; and,
	having a remarkably fine eyesight,
	and a great natural aptitude, I was
	speedily able to give my dear
	benefactor much assistance against
	his opponents at the green table.

Several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice
over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Simplicity was our secret.
	Everything successful is simple.
	If, for instance, I wiped the dust
	off a chair with my napkin, it was
	to show that the enemy was strong in
	diamonds; if I pushed it, he had an
	ace, king; if I said, "Punch or
	wine, my lord?" hearts was meant.
	If "Wine or punch?" clubs.  If I
	blew my nose, it was to indicate
	that there was another confederate
	employed by the adversary; and then,
	I warrant you, some pretty trials of
	skill would take place.  The Prince
	of Turbingen, although so young, had
	a very great skill and cleverness
	with the cards in every way; and it
	was only from hearing Ritter von
	Brandenburg, who came with him, yawn
	three times when the Chevalier had
	the ace of trumps, that I knew we
	were Greek to Greek, as it were.

The Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down
his cards.  He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, though I cannot say how,
	I believe you have cheated me.

			CHEVALIER
	I deny your Grace's accusations, and
	beg you to say how you have been
	cheated?

			PRINCE
		   (glaring at Roderick)
	I don't know.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace owes me seventy thousand
	frederics, which I have honorably
	won.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, if you will have your
	money now, you must fight for it.
	If you will be patient, maybe I will
	pay you something another time.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace, if I am so tame as to
	take this, then I must give up an
	honorable and lucrative occupation.

			PRINCE
	I have said all there is to be said.
	I am at your disposal for whatever
	purposes you wish.  Good night.

He exits.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Was he cheated?

			RODERICK
	In so far as I can tell these things
	-- no.  I believe the Chevalier won
	the money fairly.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Hmm-mmmm.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What are the Chevalier's intentions?

			RODERICK
	I am not sure.  The Prince told him
	quite clearly that if he wished to
	have the money, he would have to
	fight for it.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	A meeting with the Prince of
	Turbingen is impossible.

			RODERICK
	The Prince left him only that
	choice.

The Captain and the Minister walk a few steps away and
speak in whispers.

Then they return to Roderick.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Will you be able to return here
	tomorrow without arousing suspicion?

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	Tell them I intend to demand
	satisfaction from the Prince.

			RODERICK
	But they will prevent a meeting at
	whatever the cost.

			CHEVALIER
	Have no fear.  It will come out well
	for me.

			RODERICK
	I believe they will deport you.

			CHEVALIER
	I have faced that problem before.

			RODERICK
	But, if they send you away, then
	what is to become of me?

			CHEVALIER
		   (with a smile)
	Make your mind easy, you shall not
	be left behind, I warrant you.  Do
	take a last look at your barracks,
	make your mind easy, say a farewell
	to your friends in Berlin.  The dear
	souls, how they will weep when they
	hear you are out of the country,
	and, out of it, you shall go.

			RODERICK
	But how, sir?

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	The King has determined to send the
	Chevalier out of the country.

			RODERICK
	When is he to go?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Has he sent the challenge yet?

			RODERICK
	Not yet, but I believe he intends
	to.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Then this must be done tomorrow.

			RODERICK
	What is to be done?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You say he drives after breakfast
	and before dinner.  When he comes
	out to his carriage a couple of
	gendarmes will mount the box, and
	the coachman will get his orders to
	move on.

			RODERICK
	And his baggage?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I
	have a fancy to look into that red
	box which contains his papers, you
	say; and at noon, after parade,
	shall be at the inn.  You will not
	say a word to any one there
	regarding the affair, and will wait
	for me at the Chevalier's rooms
	until my arrival.  We must force
	that box.  You are a clumsy hound,
	or you would have got the key long
	ago.

EXT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At ten o'clock the next morning, the
	carriage of the Chevalier de Belle
	Fast drew up as usual at the door of
	his hotel, and the Chevalier came
	down the stairs in his usual stately
	manner.

Looking around and not finding his servant to open the
door.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my rascal, Lazlo?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (standing by the
		    carriage)
	I will let down the steps for your
	honor.

No sooner does the Chevalier enter than the officer jumps
in after him, another mounts the box by the coachman, and
the latter begins to drive.

			CHEVALIER
	Good gracious!  What is this?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (touching his hat)
	You are going to drive to the
	frontier.

			CHEVALIER
	It is shameful -- infamous!  I
	insist upon being put down at the
	Austrian ambassador's house.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	I have orders to gag your honor if
	you cry out, and to give you this
	purse containing ten thousand
	frederics if you do not.

			CHEVALIER
	Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel
	owes me seventy thousand.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Your honor must lower his voice.

			CHEVALIER
		   (whispering)
	All Europe shall hear of this!

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	As you please.

Both lapse into silence.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by.  Suddenly -- "boom," the alarm cannon
begins to roar.

INT.  COACH - DAY

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Do not be alarmed.  The alarm cannon
	only signals a deserter.

Chevalier nods.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by and action as described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Hearing the sound of the alarm
	cannon, the common people came out
	along the road, with fowling-pieces
	and pitch-forks, in hopes to catch
	the truant.  The gendarmes looked
	very anxious to be on the lookout
	for him too.  The price of a
	deserter was fifty crowns to those
	who brought him in.

EXT.  SAXON CUSTOM-HOUSE - DAY

The black and white barriers came in view at last hard by
Bruck, and opposite them the green and yellow of Saxony.
The Saxon custom-house officers came out.

			CHEVALIER
	I have no luggage.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	The gentleman has nothing
	contraband.

The Prussian officers, grinning, hand the Chevalier the
purse and take their leave of their prisoner with much
respect.

The Chevalier de Belle Fast gives them three frederic a-
piece.

			CHEVALIER
	Gentlemen, I wish you a good day.
	Will you please go to the house from
	whence we set out this morning, and
	tell my man there to send my baggage
	on to Three Kings at Dresden?

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then ordering fresh horses, the
	Chevalier set off on his journey for
	that capital.  I need not tell you
	that I was the Chevalier.

INT.  ROOM - HOTEL DES TROIS COURONNES - DAY

Roderick reading a letter over his breakfast in bed.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	From the Chevalier de Belle Fast to
	Roderick James, Esquire, Gentilhomme
	Anglais.  At the Hotel des trois
	Couronnes, Dresden, Saxe.  My dear
	Roderick -- This comes to you by a
	sure hand, no other than Mr. Lumpit,
	of the English mission, who is
	acquainted, as all Berlin will be
	directly, with our wonderful story.
	They only know half as yet; they
	only know that a deserter went off
	in my clothes, and all are in
	admiration of your cleverness and
	valor.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOM - DAY

Action as per description in letter.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	As I lay in my bed two and a half
	hours after your departure, in comes
	your ex-captain, Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (in his imperious
		    Dutch manner)
	Roderick!  Are you there?

No answer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The rogue is gone out.

Action as per voice over.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Straightaway he makes for the red
	box where I keep my love letters, my
	glass eye which I used to wear, my
	two sets of Paris teeth, and my
	other private matters that you know
	of.  He first tries a bunch of keys,
	but none of them fit the English
	lock.  Then he takes out of his
	pocket a chisel and hammer, and
	falls to work like a professional
	burglar, actually bursting open the
	little box!  Now was my time to act!
	I advance towards him armed with an
	immense water-jug.  I come
	noiselessly up to him just as he has
	broken the box, and, with all my
	might, I deal him such a blow over
	the head as smashes the water-jug to
	bits, and sends the captain with a
	snort lifeless to the ground.  Then
	I ring all the bells in the house;
	and shout, and swear, and scream,
	"Thieves! -- Thieves! -- Landlord!
	-- Murder! -- Fire!" until the whole
	household comes tumbling up the
	stairs.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my servant?  Who dares to
	rob me in open day?  Look at the
	villain whom I find in the act of
	breaking my chest open!  Send for
	the police, send for his Excellency
	the Austrian Minister!  All Europe
	shall know of this insult!

			LANDLORD
	Dear heaven!  We saw you go away
	three hours ago.

			CHEVALIER
	Me!  Why, man, I have been in bed
	all morning.  I am ill -- I have
	taken physic -- I have not left the
	house this morning!  Where is that
	scoundrel, Lazlo?  But, stop!  Where
	are my clothes and wig?

			CHAMBERMAID
	I have it -- I have it!  Lazlo is
	off in your honor's dress.

			CHEVALIER
	And my money -- my money!  Where is
	my purse with forty-eight frederics
	in it?  But we have one of the
	villains left, Officers, seize him.

			LANDLORD
		   (more and more
		    astonished)
	It's the young Herr Galgenstein.

			CHEVALIER
	What!  A gentleman breaking open my
	trunk with hammer and chisel --
	impossible!

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Herr Galgenstein was returning to
	life by this time, with a swelling
	on his skull as big as a saucepan;
	and the officers carried him off,
	and, to make a long story short,
	poor Galgenstein is now on his way
	to Spandau; and his uncle, the
	Minister of Police Galgenstein, has
	brought me five hundred louis, with
	a humble request that I would leave
	Berlin forthwith, and hush up this
	painful matter.

INT.  GERMAN PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, the Chevalier and the Duke of Wurttemberg.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The Chevalier de Belle Fast was in
	particularly good order with the
	Duke of Wurttemberg, whose court
	was, at this period, the most
	brilliant in all Europe.

The Duke of Wurttemberg chatting with ballet dancers, who
will perform at the party.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He spent fabulous sums on the
	ballets and operas.  All the
	ballerinas were pretty, and they all
	boasted that they had all at least
	once made their amorous sovereign
	happy.

Roderick and the Chevalier kissing hands, hobnobbing with
the nobility, and dancing minuets.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was not a party of the
	nobility to which the two Irish
	gentlemen were not invited, and
	admired, nor where we did not make
	the brave, the high-born and the
	beautiful talk to us.  There was no
	man in Europe more gay in spirits,
	more splendid in personal
	accomplishment, than young Roderick
	James.

EXT.  GERMAN STREET - DAWN

Roderick and the Chevalier in a comfortable coach, on
their way home to bed, pass troops marching out on early
parade.

INT.  COACH - DAWN

Roderick sinks back into the comfortable cushion and
yawns.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What a delightful life did we now
	lead!  I knew I was born a
	gentleman, from the kindly way in
	which I took to the business, as
	business certainly it is.

INT.  BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick in a tub, being washed by a servant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For though it seems all pleasure,
	yet I assure any low-bred persons
	who may chance to read this, that
	we, their betters, have to work as
	well as they; though I did not rise
	until noon, yet had I not been up at
	play until long past midnight?

INT.  ANOTHER BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

His hair being done.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I came into it at once, and as if I
	had never done anything else all my
	life.  I had a gentleman to wait
	upon me, a French friseur to dress
	my hair of a morning.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A candle-lit supper.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I knew the taste of chocolate as by
	intuition almost, and could
	distinguish between the right
	Spanish and the French before I had
	been a week in my new position.

INSERTS - JEWELRY

Action and cuts as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had rings on my fingers, watches
	in both my fobs, trinkets, and
	snuff-boxes, of all sorts, and each
	outvying the other in elegance.

INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

As described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had the finest natural taste for
	lace and china of any man I ever
	knew.

EXT.  STABLES - GERMANY - DAY

Buying horses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I could judge a horse as well as any
	dealer in Germany.  I could not
	spell, but I could speak German and
	French cleverly.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick being fitted for clothes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had at least twelve suits of
	clothes; three richly embroidered
	with gold, two laced with silver;
	one of French grey, silver-laced and
	lined with chinchilla.  I had damask
	morning robes, to which a peacock's
	tail is as sober as a Quaker's drab
	skirt.

INT.  ORANGERY - DAY

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I took lessons on the guitar, and
	sang French catches exquisitely.
	Where, in fact, was there a more
	accomplished gentleman than Roderick
	James?

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How have we had the best blood, and
	the brightest eyes, too, of Europe
	throbbing round the table as I and
	the Chevalier have held the cards
	and the bank against some terrible
	player, who was matching some
	thousands out of his millions
	against our all which was there on
	the baize!

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Roderick dealing a faro bank.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our principles were:  play grandly,
	honorably.  Be not, of course, cast
	down at losing; but, above all, be
	not eager at winning, as mean souls
	are.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When the Duke of Courland brought
	fourteen lackeys each with bags of
	florins, and challenged our bank to
	play against the sealed bags, what
	did we ask?

			CHEVALIER
	Sir, we have but eighty thousand
	florins in bank, or two hundred
	thousand at three months; if your
	highness' bags do not contain more
	than eight thousand, we will meet
	you.

Playing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we did, and after eleven hours
	play, in which our bank was at one
	time reduced to two hundred and
	three ducats, we won seventeen
	thousand florins off him.

Four crowned heads look on at the game, and an imperial
princess, when Roderick turns up the ace of hearts, bursts
into tears.

INT.  MASQUERADE BALL - NIGHT

Roderick and a girl.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor need I mention my successes
	among the fairer portion of the
	creation.  One of the most
	accomplished, the tallest, the most
	athletic, and the handsomest
	gentleman in Europe, as I was then,
	a young fellow of my figure could
	not fail of having advantages, which
	a person of my spirit knew very well
	how to us.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

Making love to a masked lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Charming Schuvaloff.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Black-eyed Sczortarska.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dark Valdez.

			RODERICK
	Do you expect me to believe that
	your lover brought you here tonight?

			VALDEZ
	Yes.  He brought me in his carriage,
	and he will call for me at midnight.

			RODERICK
	And he doesn't care about me?

			VALDEZ
	He is only curious to know who you
	are.

			RODERICK
	If his love were like mine, he would
	not permit you to come here.

			VALDEZ
	He loves me, as I love you.

			RODERICK
	Will he wish to know the details of
	this night?

			VALDEZ
	He will believe that it will please
	me if he asks about it, and I shall
	tell him everything except some
	circumstances which might humiliate
	him.

EXT.  GARDEN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Tender Hegenheim.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Brilliant Langeac.

Roderick takes from his portfolio a little jacket of very
fine transparent skin, eight inches long and closed at one
end, and which by way of a pouch string at its open end,
has a narrow pink ribbon.

He displays it to her, she looks at it, and laughs.

			LANGEAC
	I will put in on you myself.

She puts it on, out of shot.

			LANGEAC
	There you are, dressed by my hand.
	It is nearly the same thing; but
	despite the fineness and
	transparency of the skin, the little
	fellow pleases me less well in
	costume.  It seems that this
	covering degrades him, or degrades
	me -- one of the other.

			RODERICK
	Both, my angel.  It was Love who
	invented these little jackets:  for
	he had to ally himself with
	Precaution.

INT.  ROOM OFF A BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick making love to the Countess von Trotha.  Enter
the Count, in the uniform of a Colonel.

			COUNT
	I entered here, monsieur, at a bad
	moment for you; it seems that you
	love this lady.

			RODERICK
	Certainly, monseigneur, does not
	Your Excellency consider her worthy
	of love?

			COUNT
	Perfectly so; and what is more, I
	will tell you that I love her, and
	that I am not of a humor to put up
	with rivals.

			RODERICK
	Very well!  Now that I know it, I
	will no longer love her.

			COUNT
	Then you yield to me.

			RODERICK
	On the instant.  Everyone must yield
	to such a nobleman as you.

			COUNT
	Very well; but a man who yields
	takes to his legs.

			RODERICK
	That is a trifle strong.

			COUNT
	Take to your legs, low Irish dog.

Roderick smiles at him.

			RODERICK
	Your Excellency has wantonly
	insulted me.  That being so, I
	conclude that you hate me,
	Monseigneur, and that hence you
	would be glad to remove me from the
	number of the living.  In this wish,
	I can and will satisfy Your
	Excellency.

EXT.  BEAUTIFUL GARDEN - EARLY MORNING

Roderick's sword duel with the Count.

Details to be worked out.

INT.  BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian
officer, Lieutenant Dascher.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was my unrivaled skill with
	sword and pistol, and readiness to
	use them, that maintained the
	reputation of the firm.

Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is
losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker
tells him so to his face.

Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game,
takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in
his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's
adjurations, or to Roderick's.

Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard
cue and swings it at Dascher's face.

He wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and
runs at Roderick, who is unarmed.

The marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the
waist and prevents murder.

			DASCHER
	I see that you are without your
	sword, but I believe you are a man
	of mettle.  Will you give me
	satisfaction?

			RODERICK
	I shall be delighted; but you have
	lost and you must pay me the money
	before we meet, for, after all, you
	cannot pay me when you are dead.

			ANOTHER OFFICER
	I will undertake to pay you the 20
	louis, but only tomorrow morning at
	the meeting.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

On the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher,
and his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket
and hands them to Roderick, saying:

			DASCHER
	I may have been mistaken, but I mean
	to make you pay deadly for your
	brutality.

Roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the
utmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.

			RODERICK
		   (privately)
	It is distasteful to kill a
	scoundrel -- that should be work for
	a hangman.

			CHEVALIER
	To risk one's life against such
	people is an imposition.

			RODERICK
		   (laughs)
	I risk nothing, for I am certain to
	kill him.

			CHEVALIER
	Certain?

			RODERICK
	Perfectly certain, because I shall
	make him tremble.

He takes his station between two trees, about four paces
apart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.

			RODERICK
	You have only to pace yourself at
	ten paces difference, and fire
	first.  The space between these two
	trees is the place where I choose to
	walk back and forth.  You may walk
	too, if you wish, when it is my turn
	to fire.

No one could have explained his intentions more clearly or
spoken more calmly.

			DASCHER
	But we must decide who is to have
	the first shot.

			RODERICK
	There is no need of that.  I never
	fire first; and, in any case, you
	have that right.

Dascher places himself at the specified distance.

Roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees
without looking at him.

Dascher takes aim and fires, missing.

			RODERICK
		   (with the greatest
		    composure)
	You missed me, sir.  I was sure you
	would.  Try again.

The others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of
discussion between the parties, but not a bit of it.

Dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again
missing Roderick.

Without a word, but in a firm and confident manner,
Roderick fires his first shot into the air.

Dascher looks amazed.  Then, aiming at Dascher with his
second pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead
and stretches him out dead on the ground.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Chevalier traveling in their coach.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Thus is will be seen that our life,
	for all its splendor was one of
	extreme difficulty and danger,
	requiring high talents and courage
	for success, and sudden and
	unexpected departures.

They meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses,
carrying a master and a servant.

The driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's
driver to make way for him.

Roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset
his master in the ditch, but the other insists.

Roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and
asks him to order his driver to make way for him.

			RODERICK
	I am posting, monsieur, and
	furthermore I am a foreigner.

			STRANGER
	Monsieur, here in Saxony, the post
	has no special right, and if you are
	a foreigner, you must admit that you
	have no greater claim than mine,
	since I am in my own country.

At that, Roderick gets out and holding his drawn-sword
tells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him.

The stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword
and that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly
reason.

He tells Roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes
way for him.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and the Chevalier running a faro bank when an
important lady suffers a huge loss.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The ladies were passionately fond of
	play, and hence would often arise no
	small trouble to us; for the truth
	most be told, that the ladies loved
	to play, but not to pay.  The point
	of honor is not understood by the
	charming sex; and it was with the
	greatest difficulty that we could
	keep them from the table, could get
	their money if they lost or, if they
	paid, prevent them from using the
	most furious and extraordinary means
	of revenge.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	On this evening, the lady of high
	rank, after I had won a considerable
	sum in diamonds and pearls from her,
	sent her lover with a band of cut-
	throats to waylay me.

Roderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their
carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon
which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.

The Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in
his right arm, which he thinks is broken.

Their servant forces the door open to help them out,
telling them that the two postilions have fled.

Roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door,
which is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move
because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.

His piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the
strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.

From the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols,
and sword.

Roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for
armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.

The Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning
and in no condition to resist robbers.

Roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune
and his life at the highest price.

His carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the
horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a
circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons.

In this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the
poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a
seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when
a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her
empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing
to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,
and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the
strength to hold in.

The chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an
attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's
lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.

Some falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his
pistol.

The leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.
During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless
Chevalier and two of them are killed.

After they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who
utters some appropriate last words, then dies.

His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at
the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,
each with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten
or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready
to obey his orders.

EXT.  SPA - HOTEL - DAY

Roderick's carriage arrives.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After making suitable arrangements
	for the Chevalier's burial, in
	proper accord with his church, I
	traveled to Spa, which was now in
	season, alone, to continue my
	profession which formerly had the
	support of my friend and mentor.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Crowds surround Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was by this time one of the best-
	known characters in Europe; and the
	fame of my exploits, my duels, my
	courage at play, would bring crowds
	round me in any public society where
	I appeared.

INT.  CASINO - NIGHT

Attractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The passion for play is stronger
	than the passion for gallantry; the
	gamester at Spa has neither time to
	stop to consider the merits of a
	woman, nor the courage to make
	sacrifices for her.

EXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY

The Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir
William Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are
accompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two
servants.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In evoking the recollections of
	these days, I have nothing but
	pleasure.  I would if I could say as
	much of a lady who will henceforth
	play a considerable part in the
	drama of my life -- I mean the
	Countess of Cosgrove, whose fatal
	acquaintance I made at Spa, very
	soon after the tragic events which
	caused me to quit Germany.

Closer shot of the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Victoria, Countess of Cosgrove.  A
	Countess and a Viscountess in her
	own right.

Closer shot of Sir William Cosgrove.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the wife of her cousin, the
	Right Honorable Sir William Reginald
	Cosgrove, Knight of the Bath, and
	Minister to George II and George III
	of several of the smaller courts of
	Europe.

Closer shot of young Lord Brookside, walking behind them
in the care of his governor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the mother to Viscount
	Brookside -- a melancholy, deserted,
	little boy, about whom his father
	was more than indifferent, and whom
	his mother never saw.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Shots of Sir William Cosgrove being wheeled in, and at
play with Roderick, and some other gentlemen.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I made Sir William Cosgrove's
	acquaintance as usual at the play-
	table.  One could not but admire the
	spirit and gallantry with which he
	pursued his favorite pastime; for,
	though worn out with gout and a
	myriad of diseases, a cripple
	wheeled about in a chair, and
	suffering pangs of agony, yet you
	would see him every morning, and
	every evening at his post behind the
	delightful green cloth.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you
	have no more manners than a barber,
	and I think my black footman has
	been better educated than you; but
	you are a young fellow of
	originality and pluck, and I like
	you, sir.  because you seem
	determined to go to the devil by a
	way of your own.

Laughter at the table.

			RODERICK
	I am obliged to observe, Sir William
	Cosgrove, that since you are bound
	for the next world much sooner than
	I am, I will depend on you to get
	comfortable quarters arranged for
	me.

Laughter.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at
	me.  Marriage has added forty years
	to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out
	cripple, at the age of fifty.  When
	I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was
	no man of my years who looked so
	young as myself.  Fool that I was!
	I had enough with my pensions,
	perfect freedom, the best society in
	Europe -- and I gave up all these,
	and married and was miserable.  Take
	a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and
	stick to the trumps.  Do anything,
	but marry.

			RODERICK
	Would you have me spend my life all
	alone?

			SIR WILLIAM
	In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must
	marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

			RODERICK
		   (laughing)
	The milkmaid's daughter?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter?
	No man of sense need restrict
	himself or deny himself a single
	amusement for his wife's sake; on
	the contrary, if he selects the
	animal properly, he will choose such
	a one as shall be no bar to his
	pleasure, but a comfort in his hours
	of annoyance.  For instance, I have
	got the gout; who tends me?  A hired
	valet who robs me whenever he has
	the power.  My wife never comes near
	me.  What friend have I?  None in
	the wide world.  Men of the world,
	as you and I are, don't make
	friends, and we are fools for our
	pains.

Polite laughter at the table.

			SIR WILLIAM
	My lady is a weak woman, but she is
	my mistress.  She is a fool, but she
	has got the better of one of the
	best heads in Christendom.  She is
	enormously rich, but somehow I have
	never been so poor, as since I
	married her.  I thought to better
	myself, and she has made me
	miserable and killed me, and she
	will do as much for my successor
	when I'm gone.

There is a reflective silence at the table.

			RODERICK
	Has her ladyship a very large
	income?

This question causes Sir William to burst out into a
yelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes
Roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.

EXT.  ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - SPA - NIGHT

A beautiful scene, lit by the flambeaux, held by a dozen
footmen.  A small orchestra, playing in a Temple of Love,
some dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of
trees.

Roderick approaches the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite my friend's strong warning.
	I resolves to become acquainted with
	his lady.  Sir William Cosgrove was
	dying.  His widow would be a rich
	prize.  Why should I not win her,
	and, with her, the means of making
	in the world that figure which my
	genius and inclination desired?
	When I determine, I look upon the
	thing as done.

			RODERICK
	Charming lady, tell me the truth and
	earn my gratitude.  Have you a
	lover?

The countess laughs.

			COUNTESS
	No.

			RODERICK
	Have you had one?

			COUNTESS
	Never.

			RODERICK
	But, for a time... a passing fancy?

			COUNTESS
	Not even that.

			RODERICK
	How can I believe that there is not
	a man who has inspired desires in
	you?

			COUNTESS
	Not one.

			RODERICK
	Have you not a man whom you value?

			COUNTESS
	That man has, perhaps, not yet been
	born.

			RODERICK
	What!  You have not met a man worthy
	of your attention?

			COUNTESS
	Many worthy of attention; but
	valuing is something more.  I could
	value only someone whom I loved.

			RODERICK
	Then you have never loved?  Your
	heart is empty.

			COUNTESS
	Your word "empty" makes me laugh.
	Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If
	it is fortunate, I congratulate
	myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do
	not care, for I am not aware of it.

			RODERICK
	It is nonetheless a misfortune, and
	you will know it when you love.

			COUNTESS
	But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I
	will know that my empty heart was my
	good fortune.

			RODERICK
	That is true, but it seems to me
	impossible that you should be
	unhappy in love.

			COUNTESS
	It is only too possible.  Love
	requires a mutual harmony which is
	difficult, and it is even more
	difficult to make it last.

			RODERICK
	I agree; but God put us on earth to
	take that risk.

			COUNTESS
	A man may need to do that, and find
	it amusing; but a girl is bound by
	other laws.

			RODERICK
	I believe you, and I see I must
	hasten to leave, for otherwise I
	shall become the unhappiest of men.

			COUNTESS
	How so?

			RODERICK
	By loving you, with no hope of
	possessing you.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	You want my heart?

			RODERICK
	It is my only object.

			COUNTESS
	To make me wretched in two weeks.

			RODERICK
	To love you until death.  To
	subscribe to all your commands.

			COUNTESS
	The amusing thing is that you
	deceive me without knowing, if it is
	true that you love me.

			RODERICK
	Deceiving someone without knowing it
	is something new for me.  If I do
	not know it, I am innocent.

			COUNTESS
	But you deceive me nonetheless if I
	believe you, for it will not be in
	your power to love me when you love
	me no longer.

Roderick laughs and kisses her.

			COUNTESS
	Be so good as to tell me with whom
	you think you are?

			RODERICK
	With a woman who is completely
	charming, be she a princess or a
	woman of the lowest condition, and
	who, regardless of her rank, will
	show me some kindness, tonight.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	And if she does not choose to show
	you some kindness?

			RODERICK
	Then I will respectfully take leave
	of her.

			COUNTESS
	You will do as you please.  It seems
	to me that such a matter can hardly
	be discussed until after people know
	each other.  Do you not agree?

			RODERICK
	Yes -- but I am afraid of being
	deceived.

			COUNTESS
	Poor man.  And, for that reason, you
	want to begin where people end?

			RODERICK
	I ask only a payment on account
	today -- after that, you will find
	me undemanding, obedient and
	discreet.

She laughs.  He kisses her again.  They exit.

EXT.  ROAD - SPA - NIGHT

Coach and four moves slowly along.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

They kiss.  She gently struggles as he tries to undo her
dress.  He stops.

			RODERICK
	Will we always leave it at this?

			COUNTESS
	Always, my dear one, never any
	further.  Love is a child to be
	pacified with trifles.  A full diet
	can only kill it.

			RODERICK
	I know better than you do.  Love
	wants a more substantial fare, and
	if it is stubbornly withheld, it
	withers away.

			COUNTESS
	Our abstinence makes our love
	immortal.  If I loved you a quarter
	of an hour ago, now I should love
	you even more.  But I should love
	you less if you exhausted my joy by
	satisfying all my desires.

			RODERICK
	Let us give each other complete
	happiness, and let us be sure that
	as many times as we satisfy our
	desires, they will each time be born
	anew.

			COUNTESS
	My husband has convinced me of the
	contrary.

			RODERICK
	Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is
	dying, and yet I envy him more than
	any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a
	privilege of which I am deprived.
	He may take you in his arms whenever
	he pleases, and no veil keeps his
	senses, his eyes, his soul from
	enjoying your beauty.

She silences him with her fingertips.

			COUNTESS
	Shall I tell you something -- I
	believed what was called love came
	after the union -- and I was
	surprised when my husband, making me
	a woman, made me know it only by
	pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure.
	I saw that my imaginings had stood
	me in better stead.  And so we
	became only friends, seldom sleeping
	together and arousing no curiosity
	in each other, yet on good terms for
	a while, as whenever he wanted me, I
	was at his service, but since the
	offering was not seasoned with love,
	he found it tasteless, and seldom
	demanded it.

			RODERICK
	O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg
	you.  Stop believing in your
	experience.  You have never known
	love.  My very soul is leaving me!
	Catch it on your lips, and give me
	yours!

They kiss ardently.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	To make a long story short, her
	ladyship and I were in love six
	hours after we met; and after I once
	got into her ladyship's good graces,
	I found innumerable occasions to
	improve my intimacy, and was
	scarcely ever out of her company.

EXT.  COUNTESS' HOUSE - SPA - DUSK

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I shall never forget the
	astonishment of Sir William Cosgrove
	when, on one summer evening, as he
	was issuing out to the play-table,
	in his sedan-chair, her ladyship's
	barouche and four came driving into
	the courtyard of the house which
	they inhabited and, in that
	carriage, by her ladyship's side,
	sat no other than "the vulgar Irish
	adventurer," as she was pleased to
	call me.

Sir William makes the most courtly of bows and grins, and
waves his hat in as graceful a manner as his multiplicity
of illness permits, and her ladyship and Roderick reply to
the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on
their part.

INT.  RODERICK'S APARTMENT - SPA - NIGHT

Making ardent love.

			COUNTESS
	Without you, my dearest, I might
	have died without ever knowing love.
	Inexpressible love!  God of nature!
	Bitterness than which nothing is
	sweeter, sweetness than which
	nothing is more bitter.  Divine
	monster which can only be defined by
	paradoxes.

			RODERICK
	Let me give a thousand kisses to
	that heavenly mouth which has told
	me that I am happy.

			COUNTESS
	As soon as I saw you loved me, I was
	pleased, and I gave you every
	opportunity to fall more in love
	with me, being certain that, for my
	part, I would never love you.  But
	after our first kiss, I found that I
	had no power over myself.  I did not
	know that one kiss could matter so
	much.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We then spent an hour in the most
	eloquent silence except that, from
	time to time, her ladyship cried
	out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I
	am not dreaming?"

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick enters and approaches a table at which Sir
William Cosgrove, who is drunk, is at play with several
other jovial fellows.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Sir William Cosgrove, with his
	complication of ills, was dying
	before us by inches.  He was
	continually tinkered up by doctors,
	and, what with my usual luck, he
	might be restored to health and live
	I don't know how many years.  If
	Cosgrove would not die, where was
	the use of my pursing his lady?  But
	my fears were to prove groundless,
	for on that very night, patient
	nature would claim her account.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Good evening, Mr. James, have you
	done with my lady?

			RODERICK
	I beg your pardon?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Come, come, sir.  I am a man who
	would rather be known as a cuckold
	than a fool.

			RODERICK
	I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you
	have had too much drink.  Your
	chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me
	into the company of your lady to
	advise me on a religious matter, of
	which she is a considerable expert.

Sir William Cosgrove greets this line with a yell of
laughter.  His laugh is not jovial or agreeable, but
rather painful and sardonic, and ends in a violent fit of
coughing.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Gentlemen, see this amiable youth!
	He has been troubled by religious
	scruples, and has flown for refuge
	to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has
	asked for advise from my wife, Lady
	Cosgrove, and between them both,
	they are confirming my ingenious
	young friend in his faith.  Did you
	ever hear of such doctors and such a
	disciple?

			RODERICK
	Faith, sir, if I want to learn good
	principles, it's surely better I
	should apply for them to your lady,
	and your chaplin than to you?

			SIR WILLIAM
		   (laughing, but pretty
		    red)
	He wants to step into my shoes!  He
	wants to step into my shoes!

Roderick stares at him coldly.

			RODERICK
	Well, if my intentions are what you
	think they are -- if I do wish to
	step into your shoes, what then?  I
	have no other intentions than you
	had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's
	wealth may be great, but am I not of
	a generous nature enough to use it
	worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but
	not so lofty as my ambition.  I will
	be sworn to muster just as much
	regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you
	ever showed her; and if I win her,
	and wear her when you are dead and
	gone, corbleu, knight, do you think
	that it will be the fear of your
	ghost will deter me?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for
	me, as I am drawing near the goal,
	to find my home such a happy one; my
	wife so fond of me, that she is even
	now thinking of appointing a
	successor?  Isn't it a comfort to
	see her; like a prudent housewife,
	getting everything ready for her
	husband's departure?

			RODERICK
	I hope that you are not thinking of
	leaving us soon, knight?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Not so soon, my dear, as you may
	fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have
	been given over many times these
	four years, and there was always a
	candidate or two waiting to apply
	for the situation.  Who knows how
	long I may keep you waiting.

			RODERICK
	Sir, let those laugh that win.

			SIR WILLIAM
	I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm
	grieved to keep you or any gentleman
	waiting.  Had you not better to
	arrange with my doctor or get the
	cook to flavor my omelette with
	arsenic?  What are the odds,
	gentlemen, that I don't live to see
	Mr. James hang yet?

There is laughter around the table, and Sir William starts
dealing the cards.

			VOICE
	Dies at Spa, in the Kingdom of
	Belgium, the Right Honorable Sir
	William Cosgrove, Knight of the
	Bath, Member of Parliament for
	Cosgrove and Devonshire and many
	years His Majesty's representative
	at various European courts.  He hath
	left behind him a name which is
	endeared to all his friends for his
	manifold virtues and talents, a
	reputation justly acquired in the
	service of His Majesty, and an
	inconsolable widow to deplore his
	loss.

Sir Williams keels over dead.

INT.  CHURCH - DAY

The wedding of Roderick and the Countess.  The service is
preformed by Reverend Hunt, her ladyship's chaplain.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A year from that day, on the
	fifteenth of May, in the year 1773,
	I had the honor and happiness to
	lead to the altar Victoria, Countess
	of Cosgrove, widow of the late Right
	Honorable Sir William Cosgrove, K.B.
	I had procured His Majesty's
	gracious permission to add the name
	of my lovely lady to my own, and,
	henceforward, assumed the title of
	James Cosgrove.

EXT.  A GARDEN - LONDON - DAY

The Wedding reception.

Roderick and the Countess are approached by young Lord
Brookside, aged 12.

			COUNTESS
	My Lord Brookside, come and embrace
	your papa!

Brookside walks slowly towards them, and shakes his fist
in Roderick's face.

			BROOKSIDE
	He, my father!  I would as soon call
	one of your ladyship's footmen,
	papa!

Roderick laughs, as the Countess unsuccessfully tries to
get the boy to shake hands.

			COUNTESS
	Lord Brookside, you have offended
	your father.

			BROOKSIDE
	Mother, you have offended my father.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a declaration of war to me,
	as I saw at once; though I declare I
	was willing enough to have lived
	with him on terms of friendliness.
	But as men serve me, I serve them.
	Who can blame me for my after-
	quarrels with this young reprobate,
	or lay upon my shoulders the evils
	which afterwards befell?

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Three carriages, each with four horses, proceed along the
picturesque track.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After we had received the
	congratulations of our friends in
	London -- I and Victoria set off to
	visit our country estate, Castle
	Hackton, where I had never as yet
	set foot.

INT.  CARRIAGE - DAY

Roderick and his Lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The first days of a marriage are
	commonly very trying; and I have
	known couples, who lived together
	like turtle-doves for the rest of
	their lives, peck each other's eyes
	out almost during the honeymoon.  I
	did not escape the common lot.  In
	our journey westwards, my Lady
	Cosgrove chose to quarrel with me
	because I had pulled out a pipe of
	tobacco.  Lady Cosgrove was a
	haughty woman, and I hate pride, and
	I promise you that, in this instant,
	I overcame this vice in her.

Roderick blows smoke into the Countess' face.  She is
shocked into an apprehensive silence.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Young Lord Brookside with his governor, glowering and
petulant.  A parrot, in a cage, on his lap.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

As the carriages drive past, there is a band, floral
arches, flags, church bells ringing.  The parson and the
farmers assemble in their best by the roadside, and the
school-children and the laboring people are loud in their
"hurrahs" for her ladyship.

Roderick flings pennies among the cheering tenants, from
two bags of coppers, stored in the carriage for the
occasion.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Fifty, or so, servants have turned out to greet their
mistress, and their new master.  The land steward, who is
the senior servant, introduces the others -- the clerk of
the kitchen, clerk of the stables, head gardener, ladies
in waiting, butler, valet, chef, cook.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had not arrived at the pitch of
	prosperity, and having, at thirty
	years of age, by my own merits and
	energy, raised myself to one of the
	highest social positions that any
	man in England could occupy, I
	determined to enjoy myself as
	becomes a man of quality for the
	remainder of my life.

INT.  STABLES - DAY

Roderick and his beautiful horses.

EXT.  A STREAM - DAY

Roderick and some companions fishing.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and his friends riding.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and friends shooting.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick having his portrait painted by a miniaturist.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But it was not meant for me to
	finish my life as a man of quality
	and position.  Indeed, I am one of
	those born clever enough at gaining
	a fortune, but incapable of keeping
	one; for the qualities and energy,
	which lead a man to accept the
	first, are often the very causes of
	his ruin in the latter case; indeed,
	I know of no other reason for the
	misfortunes which finally befell me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the end of the year, Lady
	Cosgrove presented me with a son;
	Patrick Cosgrove, I called him, in
	compliment to my royal ancestry, but
	what more had I to leave him than a
	noble name?

EXT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Two coaches pull up, and the Countess and Roderick exit.
Servants remove their luggage and baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We spent the season in London at our
	house in Berkeley Square.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Countess alone and depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship and I lived, for a
	while, pretty separate when in
	London.  She preferred quiet, or, to
	say the truth, I preferred it, being
	a great friend to a modest, tranquil
	behavior in woman and a taste for
	the domestic pleasures.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Several cuts of the Countess, caring for the infant,
Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Besides, she was a mother, and had
	great comfort in the dressing,
	educating, and dandling of our
	little Patrick for whose sake it was
	fit that she should give up the
	pleasures and frivolities of the
	world; so she left that part of the
	duty of every family of distinction
	to be performed by me.

INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

Roderick arriving with a party of friends, escorting a
beautiful woman.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Countess crying and having an argument with Roderick.
Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship's conversations with me
	were characterized by a stupid
	despair, or a silly blundering
	attempt at forced cheerfulness,
	still more disagreeable; hence, our
	intercourse was but trifling, and my
	temptations to carry her into the
	world or to remain in her society of
	necessity exceedingly small.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT

A drunken Roderick rudely demands his lady to entertain
their guests.  She rushes from the room in tears.
Dialogue starts scene, goes under for voice over, then
ends scene.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She would try my temper, at home,
	too, in a thousand ways.  When
	requested by me to entertain the
	company with conversation, wit, and
	learning, of which she was a
	mistress; or music, of which she was
	an accomplished performer, she
	would, as often as not, begin to
	cry, and leave the room.  My company
	from this, of course, fancied I was
	a tyrant over her; whereas, I was
	only a severe and careful guardian
	of a silly, bad-tempered and weak-
	minded lady.

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Roderick strolling arm-in-arm with his Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite the utter distaste with
	which I now regarded Lady Cosgrove,
	and, although I took no particular
	pains to disguise my feelings in
	general, yet she was of such a mean
	spirit that she pursued me with her
	regard, and would kindle up at the
	smallest kind word I spoke to her.

INT.  COSGROVE STUDY - DAY

Roderick and accountant.  Her ladyship is signing various
documents, and orders for payment.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, in these fits of love, she was
	the most easy creature in the world
	to be persuaded, and would have
	signed away her whole property, had
	it been possible.  And, I must
	confess, it was with very little
	attention on my part that I could
	bring her into good humor, and, up
	to the very last day of our being
	together, would be reconciled to me,
	and fondle me, if I addressed her a
	single kind word.  Such is female
	inconsistency.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess fighting about her refusal to
sign some papers.  Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was luckily very fond of her
	youngest son, and through him I had
	a wholesome and effectual hold on
	her; for if in any of her tantrums
	or fits of haughtiness, she
	pretended to have the upper-hand, to
	assert her authority against mine,
	to refuse to sign such papers as I
	might think necessary for the
	distribution of our large and
	complicated property.

Roderick picks up baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I would have Master Patrick carried
	off to Chiswick for a couple of
	days; and I warrant me his lady-
	mother could hold out no longer and
	would agree to anything I proposed.

The Countess rushes to the window to see the child being
put into a carriage.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Another quarrel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove and I did not quarrel
	more than fashionable people do, and,
	for the first three years, I never
	struck my wife but when I was in
	liquor.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick throws a knife at young Brookside.  The knife
digs into an expensive antique chest, just missing the
young Brookside's head.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When I flung the carving-knife at
	Brookside, I was drunk, as
	everybody present can testify, but
	as for having any systematic scheme
	against the poor lad, I can declare
	solemnly that, beyond merely hating
	him, I am guilty of no evil towards
	him.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

The Countess discovers Roderick making love to the child's
nurse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Do what one would to please her, my
	lady would never be happy or in good
	humor.  And soon she added a mean,
	detestable jealousy to all her other
	faults, and would weep and wring her
	hands, and threaten to commit
	suicide, and I know not what.

She screams and shouts something about suicide.

Her son, Brookside, comes running in and consoles her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her death would have been no comfort
	to me, as I leave any person of
	common prudence to imagine; for that
	scoundrel of a young Brookside who
	was about to become my greatest
	plague and annoyance, would have
	inherited every penny of the
	property.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick, bored and distracted, sits before a stack of
bills and papers, with his accountant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Humble people envy us great men, and
	fancy that our lives are all
	pleasure.  But the troubles of
	poverty, the rascality of agents,
	the quibbles of lawyers are endless.
	My life at this period seemed to
	consist of nothing but drafts of
	letters and money-brokers relative
	to the raising of money, and the
	insuring of Lady Cosgrove's life,
	and innumerable correspondence with
	upholsterers, decorators, cooks,
	horsekeepers, bailiffs, and
	stewards.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Various cuts.

Birthday fete for Patrick who is now five years old.

Gaily colored tents, ponies, a puppet show, expensive
presents.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My own dear boy, Patrick, was now
	five years old, and was the most
	polite and engaging child ever seen;
	it was a pleasure to treat him with
	kindness and distinction; the little
	fellow was the pink of fashion,
	beauty, and good breeding.  In fact,
	he could not have been otherwise,
	with the care both his parents
	bestowed upon him, and the
	attentions which were lavished upon
	him in every way.

Brookside and Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Whereas, young Brookside had grown
	to be a very nasty and disrespectful
	fellow indeed.  In my company, he
	preserved the most rigid silence,
	and a haughty, scornful demeanor,
	which was so much the more
	disagreeable because there was
	nothing in his behavior I could
	actually take hold of to find fault
	with, although his whole conduct was
	insolent and supercilious to the
	highest degree.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LIBRARY - DAY

Brookside sitting alone reading a book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In addition to this, the lad was
	fond of spending the chief part of
	his time occupied with the musty old
	books, which he took out of the
	library, and which I hate to see a
	young man of spirit pouring over.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Brookside and the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The insubordination of that boy was
	dreadful.  He used to quote passages
	of "Hamlet" to his mother, which
	made her very angry.

Brookside quoting "Hamlet."

The Countess begins to cry and leaves the room.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY

Roderick caning young Brookside.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As it is best to nip vice in the
	bud, and for a master of a family to
	exercise his authority in such a
	manner as that there may be no
	question about it, I took every
	opportunity of coming to close
	quarters with Master Brookside.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Many guests around the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He always chose the days when
	company, or the clergy, or gentry of
	the neighborhood were present, to
	make violent, sarcastic, and
	insolent speeches.

Brookside begins to fondle and caress Patrick.

			BROOKSIDE
	Dear child, what a pity it is I am
	not dead for your sake!  The
	Cosgroves would then have a worthy
	representative, and enjoy all the
	benefits of the illustrious blood of
	the James' of Duganstown, would they
	not, Mr. James Cosgrove?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick caning Brookside again.  The boy bears the
punishment without crying.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick's reunion with his mother.

Present are the Countess, Patrick, Lord Brookside and
others.

Mrs. James flings herself into her son's arms with a
scream, and with transports of joy, which can only be
comprehended by women who have held, in their arms, an
only child, after a twelve-year absence from him.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and mother feeding Patrick.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and mother playing with Patrick in the garden.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Mother at dinner with the family, in a strained
atmosphere.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of
the sleeping Patrick.

			MOTHER
	Ah, Roderick, it's a blessing to see
	that my darling boy has attained a
	position I always knew was his due,
	and for which I pinched myself to
	educate him.  Little Patrick is a
	darling boy, and you live in great
	splendor, but how long will it last?
	Your lady-wife knows she has a
	treasure she couldn't have had, had
	she taken a duke to marry her, but
	if, one day, she should tire of my
	wild Roderick and his old-fashioned
	Irish ways, or if she should die,
	what future would there be for my
	son and grandson?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	You have not a penny of your own,
	and cannot transact any business
	without the Countess' signature.
	Upon her death, the entire estate
	would go to young Brookside, who
	bears you little affection.  You
	could be penniless tomorrow, and
	darling Patrick at the mercy of his
	stepbrother.

INT.  MOTHER'S ROOM - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	I shall tell you a secret -- I shall
	not rest until I see you Earl of
	Duganstown, and my grandson, a Lord
	Viscount.

She smooths down Roderick's hair.

			MOTHER
	This head would become a coronet.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and Mother slowly walking and talking.  Young
Patrick, ahead of them sitting in a small cart, pulled by
a lamb.

			MOTHER
	These things entail considerable
	expense, and you will need your
	lady's blessing, but the young boy
	forms the great bond of union
	between you and her ladyship, and
	there is no plan of ambition you
	could propose in which she would not
	join for the poor lad's benefit, and
	no expense she will not eagerly
	incur, if it might be any means be
	shown to tend to his advancement.
	You have important friends, and they
	can tell you how these things are
	done.

INT.  LONDON GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Standing away from the play tables, Roderick chats with
Lord West, a fat giant of a man.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, to be sure, I did know someone
	who knew precisely how these things
	were done, and this was the
	distinguished solicitor and former
	Government Minister, Lord West,
	whose acquaintance I made, as I had
	so many others, at the gaming table.

			LORD WEST
	Do you happen to know Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs?

			RODERICK
	By name only.

			LORD WEST
	Well, sir, this nobleman is one of
	the gentlemen of His Majesty's
	closet, and one with whom our
	revered monarch is on terms of
	considerable intimacy.  I should say
	you would be wise to fix upon this
	nobleman your chief reliance for the
	advancement of your claim to the
	Viscounty which you propose to get.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - DAY

Roderick having lunch with Lord West and the Earl of
Crabs.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And for a five-hundred guinea fee,
	paid to his City law-firm, Lord West
	kindly arranged a meeting with that
	old scamp and swindler, Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs.

			EARL OF CRABS
	Mr. Cosgrove, when I take up a
	person, he or she is safe.  There is
	no question about them any more.  My
	friends are the best people.  I
	don't mean the most virtuous, or,
	indeed, the least virtuous, or the
	cleverest, or the stupidest, or the
	richest, or the best born, but the
	"best" -- in a word, people about
	whom there is no question.  I cannot
	promise you how long it will take.
	You can appreciate it is not an easy
	matter.  But any gentlemen with an
	estate, and ten-thousand a-year
	should have a peerage.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - EARL OF CRABS - DAY

Roderick being introduced to three noblemen, including the
Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The striving after this peerage, I
	consider to have been one of the
	most unlucky dealings at this
	period.  I made unheard of
	sacrifices to bring it about.  I can
	tell you bribes were administered,
	and in high places too -- so near
	the royal person of His Majesty that
	you would be astonished were I to
	mention what great personages
	condescended to receive our loans.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick gives a beautiful diamond to a fat princess on
her birthday.  He is applauded by the other guests.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lavished money here, and diamonds
	there.

EXT.  FARMLAND - DAY

Roderick and the seller, riding over a prospective
property.  A broker shows them a survey map of the
property.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I bought lands at ten times there
	value.

INT.  SALON - LONDON - NIGHT

A musical evening.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I gave repeated entertainments to
	those friends to my claims who,
	being about the royal person, were
	likely to advance it.

INT.  STATELY HOME - DAY

Roderick buying pictures.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I purchased pictures and articles of
	vertu at ruinous prices.

EXT.  RACES - DAY

Roderick laughing and paying a bet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lost many a bet to the royal
	dukes, His Majesty's brothers.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Reviewing the company of troops.

Roderick, the Earl of Crabs, the Countess, Patrick and
Brookside, several princes and noblemen and the Duke of
Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One of the main causes of expense
	which this ambition of mine entailed
	upon me was the fitting out and
	arming of a company of infantry from
	the Hackton estates, which I offered
	to my gracious sovereign for the
	campaign against the American
	rebels.  These troops, superbly
	equipped and clothed, were embarked
	at Portsmouth in the year 1778.

INT.  ST. JAMES - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

George III meeting people and stopping to talk to
Roderick.  Present also is the Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And the patriotism of the gentlemen
	who raised them was so acceptable at
	court that, on being presented by my
	Lord Crabs, His Majesty condescended
	to notice me particularly and said:

			GEORGE III
	That's right, Mr. Cosgrove, raise
	another company, and go with them,
	too!

INT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Crabs was really one of the most
	entertaining fellows in the world,
	and I took a sincere pleasure in his
	company, besides the interest and
	desire I had in cultivating the
	society of the most important
	personages of the realm.

Roderick clumsily tries to engage in conversation with the
famed Dr. Johnson, on the subject of a book or play, of
the day, and is rebuffed for his trouble.

			JOHNSON
	If I were you, Mr. Cosgrove, I
	should mind my horses and tailors
	and not trouble myself about
	letters.

Laughter, Roderick bristles.

			RODERICK
	Dr. Johnson, I think you misbehave
	most grossly, treating my opinions
	with no more respect than those of a
	schoolboy.  You fancy, sir, you know
	a great deal more than me, because
	you quote your "Aristotle" and
	"Plato," but can you tell me which
	horse will win at Epsom Downs next
	week?  Can you shoot the ace of
	spades ten times without missing?
	If so, talk about Aristotle and
	Plato with me.

			BOSWELL
		   (roars)
	Do you know who you're speaking to?!

			JOHNSON
	Hold your tongue, Mr. Boswell, I had
	no right to brag of my Greek,
	gentlemen, and he has answered me
	very well.

			RODERICK
		   (pleased)
	Do you know ever a rhyme for
	Aristotle?

			GOLDSMITH
		   (laughing)
	Port, if you please.

			JOHNSON
	Waiter, bring on of Captain James'
	rhymes for Aristotle.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we had six rhymes for Aristotle
	before we left the coffee house that
	evening.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

			EARL OF CRABS
	Henri, this is Mr. James Cosgrove,
	who wishes to arrange a dinner party
	next week for sixty guests.

			HENRI
	I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove.
	How much do you wish to spend?

			RODERICK
	As much as possible.

			HENRI
	As much as possible?

			RODERICK
	Yes, for I wish to entertain
	splendidly.

			HENRI
	All the same, you must name an
	amount.

			RODERICK
	It is entirely up to you.  I want
	the best.

			EARL OF CRABS
	May I suggest five hundred guineas?

			RODERICK
	Will that be enough?

			HENRI
	Last month, the Duke of Suffolk
	spent no more.

			RODERICK
	All right, five hundred guineas.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick is seated at a large table, stacked high with
bills and letters; his accountant is seated next to him,
aided by a bookkeeper.  Roderick looks at each bill and
his accountant explains the charge.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life I was leading was that of a
	happy man, but I was not happy.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LONG GALLERY - DAY

Roderick, walking with big strides, leads Brookside by his
ear.  Little Patrick runs alongside, pleading for his
brother.

			PATRICK
	Papa, please don't flog Brookside
	today.  It wasn't his fault --
	really is wasn't.

Roderick ignores him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, young Brookside was of so
	wild, savage, and insubordinate a
	nature that I never had the least
	regard for him.  As he grew up to be
	a man, his hatred for me assumed an
	intensity quite wicked to think of
	and which, I promise you, I returned
	with interest.

He drags Brookside into his study, slamming the door
behind him.

INT.  LIBRARY - DAY

Roderick alone.  Brookside enters with a pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (grinding his teeth)
	Look you now, Mister Roderick James,
	from this moment on, I will submit
	to no further chastisement from you!
	Do you understand that?

			RODERICK
	Give me that pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
	Take heed, Mister James.  I will
	shoot you if you lay hands on me
	now, or ever again.  Is that
	entirely clear to you, sir?

Roderick stares hard at him, then he laughs and sits down.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I decided, at once, to give up that
	necessary part of his education.
	In truth, he then became the most
	violent, daring, disobedient,
	scapegrace, that ever caused an
	affectionate parent pain; he was
	certainly the most incorrigible.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BROOKSIDE'S ROOM - DAY

Brookside smashing a chair over the head of his governor,
Reverend Hunt.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Twice or thrice, Reverend Hunt
	attempted to punish my Lord
	Brookside; but I promise you the
	rogue was too strong for him, and
	leveled the Oxford man to the
	ground with a chair, greatly to the
	delight of little Patrick, who cried
	out:  "Bravo, Brooksy!  Thump him,
	thump him!"

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Brookside and Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	With the child, Brookside was,
	strange to say, pretty tractable.
	He took a liking to the little
	fellow -- I like him the more, he
	said, because he was "half a
	Cosgrove."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BALLROOM - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Another day, it was Patrick's
	birthday, we were giving a grand
	ball and gala at Hackton, and it was
	time for my Patrick to make his
	appearance among us.

There is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes
in, led by his half-brother, who walks into the dancing-
room in his stockinged feet, leading little Patrick by the
hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (very loudly)
	Don't you think he fits my shoes
	very well, Sir Richard Wargrave?

Upon which, the company begins to look at each other and
to titter, and his mother comes up to Lord Brookside with
great dignity, seizes the child to her breast, and says:

			COUNTESS
	From the manner in which I love this
	child, my lord, you ought to know
	how I would have loved his elder
	brother, had he proved worthy of any
	mother's affection.

Brookside is stunned by his mother's words.

			BROOKSIDE
	Madam, I have borne as long as
	mortal could endure the ill-
	treatment of the insolent Irish
	upstart, whom you have taken into
	your bed.  It is not only the
	lowness of his birth, and the
	general brutality of his manners
	which disgusts me, but the shameful
	nature of his conduct towards your
	ladyship, his brutal and
	ungentlemanlike behavior, his open
	infidelity, his habits of
	extravagance, intoxication, his
	shameless robberies and swindling of
	my property and yours.  It is these
	insults to you which shock and annoy
	me more than the ruffian's infamous
	conduct to myself.  I would have
	stood by your ladyship, as I
	promised, but you seem to have taken
	latterly your husband's part; and,
	as I cannot personally chastise this
	low-bred ruffian, who, to our shame
	be it spoken, is the husband of my
	mother, and as I cannot bear to
	witness his treatment of you, and
	loathe his horrible society as if it
	were the plague, I am determined to
	quit my native country, at least
	during his detested life, or during
	my own.

Bursting into tears, Lady Cosgrove leaves the room.
Roderick loses control, and rushes at Brookside, knocking
down Lords, Dukes and Generals, left and right, who try to
interfere.

The company is scandalizes by the entire incident.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.  Roderick is shunned.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If I had murdered my lord, I could
	scarcely have been received with
	more shameful obloquy and slander
	than now followed me in town and
	country.  My friends fell away from
	me, and a legend arose of my cruelty
	to my stepson.

INT.  ST. JAMES - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My reception at court was scarcely
	more cordial.  On paying my respects
	to my sovereign at St. James, His
	Majesty pointedly asked me when I
	had news of Lord Brookside.  On
	which I replied, with no ordinary
	presence of mind:

			RODERICK
	Sire, my Lord Brookside has set sail
	to fight the rebels against Your
	Majesty's crown in America.  Does
	Your Majesty desire that I should
	send another company to aid him?

The King stares at Roderick, turns on his heel and quickly
leaves the presence-chamber.

Roderick is approached by the Duke of Rutland, who takes
him aside into an alcove.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
		   (speaking very
		    quietly)
	Let me tell you, sir, that your
	conduct has been very odiously
	represented to the King, and has
	formed the subject of royal comment.
	The King has said, influenced by
	these representations, that you are
	the most disreputable man in the
	three kingdoms, and a dishonor to
	your name and country.

Roderick begins to sputter.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	Hear me out, please.  It has been
	intimated to His Majesty that you
	had raised the American Company for
	the sole purpose of getting the
	young Viscount to command it, and so
	get rid of him.  And, further, that
	you had paid the very man in the
	company, who was ordered to dispatch
	him in the first general action.

			RODERICK
	Thus it is that my loyalty is
	rewarded, and my sacrifices in favor
	of my country viewed!

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	As for your ambitious hopes
	regarding the Irish peerages, His
	Majesty has also let it be known
	that you have been led astray by
	that Lord Crabs, who likes to take
	money, but who has no more influence
	to get a coronet than to procure a
	Pope's tiara.  And, if you have it
	in mind to call upon Lord Crabs, you
	will be disappointed.  He left for
	the continent on Tuesday, and may be
	away for several months.

INT.  LORD WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick and Lord West.

			RODERICK
	I insist upon being allowed to
	appear before His Majesty and clear
	myself of the imputations against
	me, to point out my services to the
	government, and to ask when the
	reward, that had been promised me,
	the title held by my ancestors, is
	again to be revived in my person.

There is a sleepy coolness in the fat Lord West.  He hears
Roderick with half-shut eyes.  When he finishes his
violent speech, which he has made striding about the room,
Lord West opens one eye, smiles, and says:   

			LORD WEST
		   (gently)
	Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

			RODERICK
	Yes!

			LORD WEST
	Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you
	point by point.  The King is
	exceedingly averse to make peers, as
	you know.  Your claim, as you call
	them, have been laid before him, and
	His Majesty's gracious reply was,
	that you were the most impudent man
	in his dominions, and merited a
	halter, rather than a coronet.  As
	for withdrawing your support from
	us, you are perfectly welcome to
	carry yourself whithersoever you
	please.  And, now, as I have a great
	deal of occupation, perhaps you will
	do me the favor to retire, or tell
	me if there is anything else in the
	world in which I can oblige you.

So saying, Lord West raises his hand lazily to the bell,
and bows Roderick out.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant going over the bills which he
has heaped on the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The news of His Majesty's disregard
	were not long in getting around,
	and, in a very short time, all the
	bills came down upon me together --
	all the bills I had been contracting
	for the years of my marriage.  I
	won't cite their amount; it was
	frightful.  I was bound up in an
	inextricable toil of bills and
	debts, or mortgages and insurances,
	and all the horrible evils attendant
	upon them.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GROUNDS - DAY

Roderick walking alone.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was it my own want of style, or my
	want of a fortune?  I know not.  Now
	I was arrived at the height of my
	ambition, but both my skill and my
	luck seemed to be deserting me.
	Everything I touched, crumbled in my
	hands; every speculation I had,
	failed; every agent I trusted,
	deceived me.  My income was saddled
	with hundreds of annuities, and
	thousands of lawyers' charges, and I
	felt the net drawing closer and
	closer around me, and no means to
	extricate myself from its toils.
	All my schemes had turned out
	failures.

INT.  LONDON GAMING CLUB - NIGHT

Roderick at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My wife's moody despondency made my
	house and home not over-pleasant;
	hence, I was driven a good deal
	abroad, where as play was the
	fashion in every club, tavern, and
	assembly, I, of course, was obliged
	to resume my old habit, and to
	commence as an amateur those games
	at which I was once unrivaled in
	Europe.

Roderick loses a large amount of money.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had a run of ill-luck at play, and
	was forced to meet my losses by the
	most shameful sacrifices to the
	money-lenders, and was compelled to
	borrow largely upon my wife's
	annuities, ensuring her ladyship's
	life, which was the condition for
	every loan against her property.

INT.  LONDON OFFICE - INSURANCE BROKER - DAY

Roderick and the broker.

			BROKER
	Your wife's life is as well known
	among the insurance societies in
	London, as any woman in Christendom,
	and, I'm sorry to say there is not
	one of them willing to place another
	policy against her ladyship's life.
	One of them even had the impudence
	to suggest that your treatment of
	the Countess did not render her life
	worth a year's purchase.

EXT.  STUD FARM - DAY

Roderick buying a horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In the midst of my difficulties, I
	promised to buy a little horse for
	my dear little Patrick, which was to
	be a present for his eighth
	birthday, that was now coming on.  I
	may have had my faults, but no man
	shall dare to say of me that I was
	not a good and tender father.

Roderick admires the horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a beautiful little animal,
	and stood me in a good sum.  I never
	regarded money for that dear child.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The horse kicks off one of the horse-boys who tries to
ride him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But the horse was a bit wild, and he
	kicked off one of the horse-boys who
	rode him at first, and broke the
	lad's leg.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick riding the horse.  The horse-boy lies in the back
of a wagon.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But he was a beautiful animal and
	would make a fine horse for Patrick
	after he had a bit of breaking-in.

EXT.  ROAD - NEAR CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick dismounts and gives the horse to one of the
horse-boys.

			RODERICK
	Timmy, take the injured lad to see
	the doctor, and then bring the horse
	to Doolan's farm, and tell him to
	break him in thoroughly.  Tell him
	it's for little Patrick, and that
	I'll be over to see him next week.

			HORSE-BOY
	Yes, sir.

			RODERICK
	One more thing, and listen well, I
	don't want little Patrick to know
	where the horse is being kept.  It's
	going to be surprise for his
	birthday.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Patrick rushes out to greet his father.

			PATRICK
	Hello, papa!

Roderick picks him up in his arms, and kisses him.

			PATRICK
	Did you buy the horse, papa?

			RODERICK
	Now, just have a little patience, my
	boy.  Your birthday isn't until next
	week.

			PATRICK
	But I will have it on my birthday,
	won't I?

			RODERICK
	Well, we'll just have to wait and
	see, won't we?

He walks up the steps holding Patrick, who hugs and kisses
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My son, little Patrick Cosgrove, was
	a prince; his breeding and manners,
	even at his early age, showed him to
	be worthy of the two noble families
	from whom he was descended, and I
	don't know what high hopes I had for
	the boy, and indulged in a thousand
	fond anticipations as to his future
	success and figure in the world, but
	stern Fate had determined that I
	should leave none of my race behind
	me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick is drunk.  Patrick is brought in by his governor,
Hunt, to say good night.  His kisses his mother first,
then approaches Roderick.

			PATRICK
		   (kissing him)
	Good night, papa.

			RODERICK
	Good night, my little darling.

			PATRICK
	Papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			PATRICK
	One of the boys in the stable told
	Nelly that you've already bought my
	horse, and that it's at Doolan's
	farm, where Mick the groom is
	breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?

			RODERICK
		   (angered)
	What the devil?  What kind of fools
	do we have here?  Pottle, who told
	the lad this story?

			HUNT
	I don't know, sir.

			PATRICK
	Then it's true!  It's true!  Oh,
	thank you, papa!  Thank you!

He hugs his father.

			COUNTESS
	Promise me, Patrick, that you will
	not ride the horse except in the
	company of your father.

			PATRICK
		   (unconvincingly)
	I promise, mama.

			RODERICK
	I promise your lordship a good
	flogging if you even so much as go
	to Doolan's farm to see him.

			PATRICK
	Yes, papa.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is awakened by his valet and Hunt, the governor.

			RODERICK
	Yes...?

			VALET
	I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but
	Mr. Hunt has something important to
	tell you.

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			HUNT
	I think Master Patrick has disobeyed
	your orders and stolen off to
	Doolan's farm.  When I went to the
	lad's room this morning, his bed was
	empty.  One of the cooks said she
	saw him go away before daybreak.  He
	must have slipped through my room
	while I was asleep.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLES - DAY

Roderick, in a rage, taking a great horse-whip, gallops
off after the child.

EXT.  ROAD - CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick comes upon a sad procession of farmers, moaning
and howling, the black horse led by the hand, and, on a
door that some of them carry, little Patrick.  He lies in
his little boots and spurs, and his little coat of scarlet
and gold.  His face is quite white, and he smiles as he
holds a hand out to Roderick and says painfully:

			PATRICK
	You won't whip me, will you, papa?

Roderick bursts out into tears in reply.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Some doctors around the bed, Roderick and the Countess
anxiously waiting upon them.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The doctors were called, but what
	does a doctor avail in a contest
	with the grim, invincible enemy?
	Such as came could only confirm our
	despair by their account of the poor
	child's case.  His spine was
	injured, the lower half of him was
	dead when they laid him in bed at
	home.  The rest did not last long,
	God help me!  He remained yet for
	two days with us, and a sad comfort
	it was to think he was in no pain.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick, Countess and Patrick.

			PATRICK
		   (weakly)
	Papa, I beg you and mama to pardon
	me for any acts of disobedience I
	have been guilty of towards you.

			COUNTESS
		   (weeping)
	Oh, my little angel, you have done
	nothing for which you need pardon.

			PATRICK
	Where is Brooksy?  I would like to
	see him.

			RODERICK
	Your bother is in America fighting
	the rebels.

			PATRICK
	Is he all right, papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes, he's fine.

			PATRICK
	Brooksy was better than you, papa,
	he used not to swear so, and he
	taught me many good things while you
	were away.

Patrick takes a hand of his mother and of Roderick, in
each of his little clammy ones.

			PATRICK
	I beg you not to quarrel so, but to
	love each other, so that we might
	meet again in heaven where Brooksy
	told me quarrelsome people never go.

His mother is much affected by these admonitions, and
Roderick is too.

Patrick gives Roderick a ring from his finger, and a
locket to his mother.

He says that these gifts are so that they will not forget
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, after two days, he died.
	There he lay, the hope of my family,
	the pride of my manhood, the link
	which kept me and my Lady Cosgrove
	together.

EXT.  CHURCH - GRAVEYARD - DAY

Funeral.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I won't tell you with what splendor
	we buried him, but what avail are
	undertakers' feathers and heralds'
	trumpery.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLE - DAY

Roderick enters the stable and, after a few seconds, we
hear a pistol shot.  He exits rapidly, the smoking pistol
still in his hand.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

The Countess:  Praying.  Waking up screaming.  Fits of
crying.  Severely depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove, always vaporish and
	nervous, after our blessed boy's
	catastrophe, became more agitated
	than ever, and plunged into devotion
	with so much fervor that you would
	have fancied her almost distracted
	at times.

Countess sees visions.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She imagined she saw visions.  She
	said an angel from heaven told her
	that Patrick's death was a
	punishment to her for her neglect of
	her firstborn.  Then she would
	declare that Brookside was dead.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant.  Bills, bills, bills.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, my financial affairs were
	near to ruin.  I could not get a
	guinea from any money-dealer in
	London.  Our rents were in the hands
	of receivers by this time, and it
	was as much as I could do to get
	enough money from the rascals to pay
	my wine-merchants their bills.  Our
	property was hampered, and often as
	I applied to my lawyers and agents
	for money, would come a reply
	demanding money of me for debts and
	pretended claims which the rapacious
	rascals said they had on me.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother arrives.  Roderick greets her.  Servants unload her
bags.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the only person who,
	in my misfortune, remained faithful
	to me -- indeed, she has always
	spoken of me in my true light, as a
	martyr to the rascality of others,
	and a victim of my own generous and
	confiding temper.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother supervising kitchen staff.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was an invaluable person to me
	in my house, which would have been
	at rack and ruin before, but for her
	spirit of order and management and
	her excellent economy in the
	government of my rapidly dwindling
	household staff.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If anything could have saved me from
	the consequences of villainy in
	others, it would have been the
	admirable prudence of that worthy
	creature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She never went to bed until all the
	house was quiet and all the candles
	out; you may fancy that this was a
	matter of some difficulty with a man
	of my habits who had commonly a
	dozen of jovial fellows to drink
	with me every night, and who
	seldom, for my part, went to bed
	sober.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Actions as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Many and many a night, when I was
	unconscious of her attention, has
	that good soul pulled my boots off,
	and seen me laid by my servants snug
	in bed, and carried off the candle
	herself...

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... and been the first in the
	morning, too, to bring me my drink
	of small beer.  It was my mother's
	pride that I could drink more than
	any man in the country.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother holding a letter before a fire,
which slowly brings out the writing in lemon juice between
the widely-spaced lines of directions to her milliner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother discovered that always,
	before my lady-wife chose to write
	letters to her milliner, she had
	need of lemons to make her drink, as
	she said, and this fact, being
	mentioned to me, kind of set me
	a-thinking.

			RODERICK
		   (reading letter
		    aloud)
	"This day, three years ago, my last
	hope and pleasure in life was taken
	from me, and my dear child was
	called to Heaven.  Where is his
	neglected brother, whom I suffered
	to grow up unheeded by my side, and
	whom the tyranny of the monster to
	whom I am united drove to exile,
	and, perhaps to death?  I pray the
	child is still alive and safe.
	Charles Brookside!  Come to the aide
	of a wretched mother, who
	acknowledges her crime, her coldness
	towards you, and now bitterly pays
	for her error!  What sufferings,
	what humiliations have I had to
	endure!  I am a prisoner in my own
	halls.  I should fear poison, but
	then I know the wretch has a sordid
	interest in keeping me alive, and
	that my death would be the signal
	for his ruin.  But I dare not stir
	without my odious, hideous, vulgar
	gaoler, the horrid Irish woman, who
	purses my every step.  I am locked
	into my chamber at night, like a
	felon, and only suffered to leave it
	when ordered into the presence of my
	lord, to be present at his orgies
	with his boon-companions, and to
	hear his odious converse as he
	lapses into the disgusting madness
	of intoxication."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, and the Countess and mother, at a silent dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was not possible to recover the
	name for whom the note was intended,
	but it was clear that, to add to all
	my perplexities, three years after
	my poor child's death, my wife,
	whose vagaries of temper and wayward
	follies I had borne with for twelve
	years, wanted to leave me.  I
	decided it best not to reveal to her
	ladyship our discovery, that we
	might still intercept and uncover
	further schemes with might be afoot.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

A few cuts showing Mother keeping an eye on the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Yet I was bound to be on my guard
	that she should not give me the
	slip.  Had she left me, I was ruined
	the next day.  I set my mother to
	keep sharp watch over the moods of
	her ladyship, and you may be sure
	that her assistance and surveillance
	were invaluable to me.  If I had
	paid twenty spies to watch her lady,
	I should not have been half so well
	served as by the disinterested care
	and watchfulness of my excellent
	mother.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Roderick walking with the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with
	me was a singular one.  Her life was
	passed in a series of crack-brained
	sort of alternation between love and
	hatred for me.  We would quarrel for
	a fortnight, then we should be
	friends for a month together
	sometimes.  One day, I was joking
	her, and asking her whether she
	would take the water again, whether
	she had found another lover, and so
	forth.  She suddenly burst out into
	tears, and, after a while, said to
	me:

			COUNTESS
	Roderick, you know well enough that
	I have never loved but you!  Was I
	ever so wretched that a kind word
	from you did not make me happy?
	Ever so angry, but the least offer
	of good-will on your part did not
	bring me to your side?  Did I not
	give a sufficient proof of my
	affection for you in bestowing one
	of the finest fortunes of England
	upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked
	you for the way you have wasted it?
	No, I loved you too much and too
	fondly; I have always loved you.
	From the first moment I saw you, I
	saw your bad qualities, and trembled
	at your violence; but I could not
	help loving you.  I married you,
	though I knew I was sealing my own
	fate in doing so, and in spite of
	reason and duty.  What sacrifice do
	you want from me?  I am ready to
	make any, so you will but love me,
	or, if not, that at least, you will
	gently us me.

Roderick kisses her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was in a particularly good humor
	that day, and we had a sort of
	reconciliation.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, artful hussy has some
	other scheme in her head now.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The old lady was right, and I
	swallowed the bait which her
	ladyship had prepared to entrap me
	as simply as any gudgeon takes a
	hook.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Arrival of Mr. Newcombe, the money-broker.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had hired a money-broker
	especially to find some means of my
	making a loan.  After several months
	without success, it was with some
	considerable interest that I
	received his visit.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	I have good news for you, Mr.
	Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle
	and Chatwick, in the city of London,
	are prepared to lend you 20,000
	pounds, pledged against your
	interest in the Edric mines.  They
	will redeem the encumbrances against
	the property, which amount to some
	10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-
	year working lease on the mines.
	They will lend you the 20,000 pounds
	against the lease income,
	which they will apply to the loan as
	it comes in, and they will make a
	charge of 18% per annum interest on
	the outstanding loan balance.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some
	difficult loans during the past few
	years, at very onerous terms, but
	18% a year interest seems very stiff
	indeed.

			NEWCOMBE
	Considering your financial
	circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has
	been impossible to find anyone at
	all prepared to do any business with
	you.  I think you may count yourself
	lucky to have this opportunity.
	But, obviously, if you would reject
	this offer, I shall keep trying to
	find a better one.

			RODERICK
		   (after a pause)
	I am prepared to accept the terms,
	Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	There are a few other points we
	should discuss.  The loan agreement
	can only be executed by her
	ladyship's signature, and provided
	that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
	assured of her ladyship's freewill
	in giving her signature.

			RODERICK
	Provided that they can be assured of
	her ladyship's freewill?  Are you
	serious?

			NEWCOMBE
	May I be quite frank with you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, of course.

			NEWCOMBE
	Mister Bracegirdle said to me that
	he had heard her ladyship lives in
	some fear of her life, and meditated
	a separation, in which case, she
	might later repudiate any documents
	signed by herself while in durance,
	and subject them, at any rate, to a
	doubtful and expensive litigation.
	They were quite insistent on this
	point, and said they must have
	absolute assurance of her ladyship's
	perfect freewill in the transaction
	before they would advance a shilling
	of their capital.

			RODERICK
	I see.

			NEWCOMBE
	When I asked them in what form they
	would accept her ladyship's
	assurances, they said that they were
	only prepared to accept them if her
	ladyship confirms her written
	consent by word of mouth, in their
	presence, at their counting-house in
	Birchin Lane, London.  I requested
	they come here, and save her
	ladyship and yourself the
	inconvenience of the trip to London,
	but they declined, saying that they
	did not wish to incur the risk of a
	visit to Castle Hackton to
	negotiate, as they were aware of how
	other respectable parties, such as
	Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been
	treated here.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, there is some
	artifice.  When once you get into
	that wicked town, you are not safe.
	There are scores of writs out
	against you for debt.  If you are
	taken in London, and thrown into
	prison, your case is hopeless.

			RODERICK
	Mother dear, we are now living off
	our own beef and mutton.  We have to
	watch Lady Cosgrove within and the
	bailiffs without.  There are certain
	situations in which people cannot
	dictate their own terms; and faith,
	we are so pressed now for money,
	that I would sign a bond with old
	Nick himself, if he would provide a
	good round sum.  With this money, we
	can settle our principal debts and
	make a fresh start.

			MOTHER
	Roderick, you must listen to me.  As
	soon as they have you in London,
	they will get the better of my poor
	innocent lad; and the first thing
	that I shall hear of you will be
	that you are in trouble.  You will
	be a victim of your own generous and
	confiding nature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM

Roderick and the Countess.

			COUNTESS
	Why go, Roderick?  I am happy here,
	as long as you are kind to me, as
	you now are.  We can't appear in
	London as we ought; the little money
	you will get will be spent, like all
	the rest has been.  Let us stay here
	and be content.

She takes his hand and kisses it.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother and Roderick.

			MOTHER
	Humph!  I believe she is at the
	bottom of it -- the wicked schemer.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Roderick's carriage moving along.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We did not start in state, you may
	be sure.  We did not let the country
	know we were going, or leave notice
	of adieu with our neighbors.  The
	famous Mr. James Cosgrove and his
	noble wife traveled in a hack-
	chaise and pair.

INT.  COACH - DAY

The Countess lays her head on Roderick's shoulder and
smiles.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When a man is going to the devil,
	how easy and pleasant a journey it
	is!  The thought of the money quite
	put me in a good humor, and my wife,
	as she lay on my shoulder in the
	post-chaise, going to London, said
	it was the happiest ride she had
	taken since our marriage.

EXT.  INN - DUSK

The carriage stops and they disembark.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One night we stayed at Reading.

INT.  INN - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife at dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My lady and I agreed that, with the
	money, we would go to France, and
	wait there for better times, and
	that night, over our supper, formed
	a score of plans both for pleasure
	and retrenchment.  You would have
	thought it was Darby and Joan
	together over their supper.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife making love.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	O woman!  Woman!  When I recollect
	Lady Cosgrove's smiles and
	blandishments, how happy she seemed
	to be on that night!  What an air of
	innocent confidence appeared in her
	behavior, and what affectionate
	names she called me!  I am lost in
	wonder at the depth of her
	hypocrisy.  Who can be surprised
	that an unsuspecting person like
	myself should have been a victim to
	such a consummate deceiver?

EXT.  GRAY'S INN OFFICE - DAY

The coach drives up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We were in London at three o'clock,
	an half-an-hour before the time
	appointed.

INT.  STAIRCASE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess looking for the office.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I easily found out Mr. Tapewell's
	apartment:  a gloomy den it was, and
	in an unlucky hour, I entered it.

They climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and
the dim sky of a dismal London afternoon.

The Countess seems agitated and faint.

When they get to the door, she stops in front of it.

			COUNTESS
	Roderick -- don't go in.  I am sure
	there is danger.  There's time yet,
	let us go back -- anywhere!

The Countess has put herself before the door in a
theatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand.

He pushes her away to one side.

			RODERICK
	Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

			COUNTESS
	Old fool!

She jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a
moldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig.

			COUNTESS
	Say Lady Cosgrove is here!

She stalks down the passage, muttering:  "Old Fool."

INT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

Tapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his
parchments and tin boxes.

He advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and
points towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes,
rather wondering at the lawyer's insolence.

The lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back
in a moment.

In the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another
layer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons
and pistols, and Lord Brookside.

Lady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son,
crying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her
preserver, her gallant knight.

Then, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of
invective which quite astonishes him.

			COUNTESS
	Oh fool as I am, I have outwitted
	the most crafty and treacherous
	monster under the sun.  Yes, I was a
	fool when I married you, and gave up
	other and nobler hearts for your
	sake -- yes, I was a fool when I
	forgot my name and lineage to unite
	myself with a base-born adventurer
	-- a fool to bear, without repining,
	the most monstrous tyranny that ever
	woman suffered; to allow my property
	to be squandered; to see women as
	base and low-born as yourself...

			TAPEWELL
	For heaven's sake, be calm.

Tapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a
threatening look in Roderick's eye.

The Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury,
screaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and
always beginning and ending the sentence with the word
"fool."

			RODERICK
	You didn't tell all, my lady -- I
	said "old" fool.

			BROOKSIDE
	I have no doubt that you said and
	did, sir, everything that a
	blackguard could say or do.  This
	lady is now safe under the
	protection of her relations and the
	law, and need fear your infamous
	persecutions no longer.

			RODERICK
	But you are not safe, and as sure as
	I am a man of honor, I will have
	your heart's blood.

			TAPEWELL
	Take down his words, constables;
	swear the peace against him.

			BROOKSIDE
	I would not sully my sword with the
	blood of such a ruffian.  If the
	scoundrel remains in London another
	day, he will be seized as a common
	swindler.

			RODERICK
	Where's the man who will seize me?

He draws his sword, placing his back to the door.

			RODERICK
	Let the scoundrel come!  You -- you
	cowardly braggart, come first, if
	you have the soul of a man!

The Countess and the bailiffs move away.

			TAPEWELL
	We are not going to seize you!  My
	dear sir, we don't wish to seize
	you; we will give you a handsome sum
	to leave the country, only leave her
	ladyship in peace.

			BROOKSIDE
	And the country will be rid of such
	a villain.

As Brookside says this, he backs into the next room.

The lawyer follows him, leaving Roderick alone in the
company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was no longer the man I was at
	twenty, when I should have charged
	the ruffians, sword in hand, and
	sent at least one of them to his
	account.  I was broken in spirit,
	regularly caught in the toils,
	utterly baffled and beaten by that
	woman.  Was she relenting at the
	door, when she paused and begged me
	to turn back?  Had she not a
	lingering love for me still?  Her
	conduct showed it, as I came to
	reflect on it.  It was my only
	chance now left in the world, so I
	put down my sword upon the lawyers
	desk.

Roderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.

			RODERICK
	Gentlemen, I shall have no violence;
	you may tell Mr. Tapewell I am quite
	ready to speak with him when he is
	at leisure.

Roderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably.

EXT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NEAR GRAY'S INN - DAY

INT.  RODERICK'S ROOM IN COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was instructed to take a lodging
	for the night in a coffee house near
	Gray's Inn, and anxiously expected a
	visit from Mr. Tapewell.

Tapewell talking to Roderick.

			TAPEWELL
	I have been authorized by Lady
	Cosgrove and her advisors to pay you
	an annuity of 300 pounds a year,
	specifically on the condition of you
	remaining abroad out of the three
	kingdoms, and to be stopped on the
	instant of your return.  I advise
	you to accept it without delay for
	you know, as well as I do, that your
	stay in London will infallibly
	plunge you in gaol, as there are
	innumerable writs taken out against
	you here and in the west of England,
	and that your credit is so blown
	upon that you could not hope to
	raise a shilling.  I will leave you
	the night to consider this proposal,
	but if you refuse, the family will
	proceed against you in London, and
	have you arrested.  If you accede, a
	quarter salary will be paid to you
	at any foreign port you should
	prefer.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Tapewell, I do not require a
	night to consider this proposal.
	What other choice has a poor, lonely
	and broken-hearted man?  I shall
	take the annuity, and leave the
	country.

			MR. TAPEWELL
	I am very glad to hear that you have
	come to this decision, Mr. Cosgrove.
	I think you are very wise.

There is a knock at the door and Roderick opens it.
Brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols.

The dialogue for this scene has to be written.

Brookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to
have Roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out
against him for debt.

Mr. Tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that
Brookside is acting in bad faith.

Brookside brushes aside his objections.

Roderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair.

The following lines are read over Roderick being shackled
and led out of the room.

			NARRATOR
	Mr. James Cosgrove's personal
	narrative finishes here, for the
	hand of death interrupted the
	ingenious author soon after the
	period which this memoir was
	compiled, after he had lived
	nineteen years an inmate of the
	Fleet Prison, where the prison
	records state he died of delirium
	tremens.

EXT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

His mother, now very old and hobbled with arthritis,
enters the prison, carrying a basket on her arm.

			NARRATOR
	His faithful old mother joined him
	in his lonely exile, and had a
	bedroom in Fleet Market over the
	way.  She would come and stay the
	whole day with him in prison
	working.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' STUDY

Signing a payment draft, the Countess sighs and gazes out
of the large window.

			NARRATOR
	The Countess was never out of love
	with her husband, and, as long as
	she lived, James enjoyed his income
	of 300 pounds per year and was,
	perhaps, as happy in prison, as at
	any period of his existence.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STUDY - DAY

Brookside tearing up the payment draft presented to him by
his accountant.

			NARRATOR
	When her ladyship died, her son
	sternly cut off the annuity,
	devoting the sum to charities,
	which, he said, would make a nobler
	use of it than the scoundrel who had
	enjoyed it hitherto.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick, now grey-haired, blacking boots.

			NARRATOR
	When the famous character lost his
	income, his spirit entirely failed.
	He was removed into the pauper's
	ward, where he was known to black
	boots for wealthier prisoners, and
	where he was detected in stealing a
	tobacco box.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.  Action as per voice over.

			NARRATOR
	His mother attained a prodigious old
	age, and the inhabitants of the
	place in her time can record, with
	accuracy, the daily disputes which
	used to take place between mother
	and son, until the latter, from
	habits of intoxication, falling into
	a state of almost imbecility, was
	tended by his tough old parent as a
	baby almost, and would cry if
	deprived of his necessary glass of
	brandy.

TITLE CARD

FADE IN:

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Brief shot of duel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My father, who was well-known to the
	best circles in this kingdom under
	the name of roaring Harry James, was
	killed in a duel, when I was fifteen
	years old.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Mrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a
distance.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother, after her husband's
	death, and her retirement, lived in
	such a way as to defy slander.  She
	refused all offers of marriage,
	declaring that she lived now for her
	son only, and for the memory of her
	departed saint.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Mother and son walking together.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the most beautiful
	women of her day.  But if she was
	proud of her beauty, to do her
	justice, she was still more proud of
	her son, and has said a thousand
	times to me that I was the
	handsomest fellow in the world.

EXT.  CHURCH - DAY

Mother and son entering church.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The good soul's pleasure was to
	dress me; and on Sundays and
	Holidays, I turned out in a velvet
	coat with a silver-hilted sword by
	my side, and a gold garter at my
	knee as fine as any lord in the
	land.  As we walked to church on
	Sundays, even the most envious souls
	would allow that there was not a
	prettier pair in the kingdom.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My uncle's family consisted of ten
	children, and one of them was the
	cause of all my early troubles; this
	was the belle of the family, my
	cousin, Miss Dorothy Dugan, by name.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,
stables, barn and farm.

Idealized images of Dorothy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  That first affair, how well one
	remembers it!  What a noble
	discovery it is that the boy makes
	when he finds himself actually and
	truly in love with some one!  A lady
	who is skilled in dancing or singing
	never can perfect herself without a
	deal of study in private.  So it is
	with the dear creatures who are
	skilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for
	instance, was always practicing, and
	she would take poor me to rehearse
	her accomplishments upon...

Dorothy talking with the exciseman.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the exciseman, when he came
	his rounds.

Dorothy talking to the steward.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the steward.

Dorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a
book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the poor curate.

Dorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	... or the young apothecary's lad
	from Dugan's Town whom I recollect
	beating once for that very reason.

Roderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The torments of jealousy she made me
	endure were horrible.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of
confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,
runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,
returning every moment to Roderick.

She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then
laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless
and staring at her.

After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she
challenges Roderick to a race.

			RODERICK
	I accept, but I insist on a wager.
	The loser must do whatever the
	winner pleases.

			DOROTHY
	Agreed.

			RODERICK
	Do you see the gate at the end of
	the field?  The first to touch it
	will be the winner.

They line up together and start on a count of three.
Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,
and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was certain to win, but I meant to
	lose to see what she would order me
	to do.

Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then
she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes
out and says:

			DOROTHY
	Your penalty is to find a cherry-
	colored ribbon which I have hidden
	somewhere on my person.  You are
	free to look for it anywhere you
	will, and I will think very little
	of you if you do not find it.

They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her
pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then
her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and
circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears
upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he
draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The
tickling makes her laugh.

			RODERICK
	I feel the ribbon.

			DOROTHY
	Then you must get it.

Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty
breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.

			DOROTHY
	Why are you shaking?

			RODERICK
	With pleasure at finding the ribbon.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Military review.  One hundred English troops, a few
mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local
people.

The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best
and Grogan.

Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	About this time, the United Kingdom
	was in a state of great excitement
	from the threat generally credited
	of a French invasion.  The noblemen
	and people of condition in that and
	all other parts of the kingdom
	showed their loyalty by raising
	regiments of horse and foot to
	resist the invaders.  How I envied
	them.  The whole country was alive
	with war's alarums; the three
	kingdoms ringing with military
	music, while poor I was obliged to
	stay at home in my fustian jacket
	and sigh for fame in secret.

INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT

Dorothy and Roderick entering.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Once, the officers of the Kilwangen
	regiment gave a grand ball to which
	Dorothy persuaded my to take her.

Several cuts depicting the evening.

Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks
punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.

Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss
Clancy.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I have endured torments in my life,
	but none like that.  Some of the
	prettiest girls there offered to
	console me, for I was the best
	dancer in the room, but I was too
	wretched, and so remained alone all
	night in a state of agony.  I did
	not care for drink, or know the
	dreadful comfort of it in those
	days; but I thought of killing
	myself and Dorothy, and most
	certainly of making away with
	Captain Best.

EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN

The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, and at morning, the ball
	was over.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together.

			DOROTHY
	Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick
	dear, and you'll catch cold without
	a handkerchief to your neck.

To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle
made no reply.

			DOROTHY
	Did you and Miss Clancy have a
	pleasant evening, Roderick?  You
	were together, I saw, all night.

To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,
and giving a lash to Daisy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and
	throw me, you careless creature,
	you.

The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's
waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.

			RODERICK
	I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!
	And I only danced with her because
	-- because -- the person with whom I
	intended to dance chose to be
	engaged the whole night.

			DOROTHY
	I had not been in the room five
	minutes before I was engaged for
	every single set.

			RODERICK
	Were you obliged to dance five times
	with Captain Best, and then stroll
	out with him into the garden?

			DOROTHY
	I don't care a fig for Captain Best;
	he dances prettily to be sure, and
	is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He
	looks well in his regimentals, too;
	and if he chose to ask me to dance,
	how could I refuse him?

			RODERICK
	But you refused me, Dorothy.

			DOROTHY
	Oh!  I can dance with you any day,
	and to dance with your own cousin at
	a ball as if you could find no other
	partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain
	Best's a man, and you are only a
	boy, and you haven't a guinea in the
	world.

			RODERICK
	If ever I meet him again, you shall
	see which is the best man of the
	two.  I'll fight him with sword or
	with pistol, captain as he is.

			DOROTHY
	But Captain Best is already known as
	a valiant soldier, and is famous as
	a man of fashion in London.  It is
	mighty well of you to fight farmers'
	boys, but to fight an Englishman is
	a very different matter.

Roderick falls silent.

EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN

They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,
sufficiently deep and rocky.

			DOROTHY
	Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are
	such a hero, was passing over the
	bridge and the enemy on the other
	side.

			RODERICK
	I'd draw my sword, and cut my way
	through them.

			DOROTHY
	What, with me on the pillion?  Would
	you kill poor me?

			RODERICK
	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd
	do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,
	and swim you both across, where no
	enemy could follow us.

			DOROTHY
	Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare
	to do any such thing on Daisy.
	There's the captain's horse, Black
	George, I've heard say that Captain
	Bes --

She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual
recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:

			RODERICK
	Hold tight to my waist!

And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the
parapet, into the deeper water below.

The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she
sinks, and screams as she rises.

Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Various cuts showing illness and convalescence.

Roderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.

Mother brings a tray of food.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I went home, and was ill speedily of
	a fever, which kept me to my bed for
	a week.

Dorothy visiting him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dorothy visited me only once, but I
	quitted my couch still more
	violently in love than I had been
	ever before.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud
amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs
down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.

He encounters an orderly whistling "Roast Beef of Old
England," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.

			RODERICK
	Whose horse, fellow, is that?

			ORDERLY
	Feller, indeed!  The horse belongs
	to my captain, and he's a better
	fellow nor you any day.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I did not stop to break his bones,
	as I would on another occasion, for
	a horrible suspicion had come across
	me, and I made for the garden as
	quickly as I could.

Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path
together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and
squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling
against his arm.

Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying
court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The fact is that, during the week of
	my illness, no other than Captain
	Best was staying at Castle Dugan,
	and making love to Miss Dorothy in
	form.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	No, Dorothy, except for you and four
	others, I vow before all the gods,
	my heart had never felt the soft
	flame.

			DOROTHY
	Ah, you men, you men, John, your
	passion is not equal to ours.  We
	are like -- like some plant I've
	read of -- we bear but one flower,
	and then we die!

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Do you mean you never felt an
	inclination for another?

			DOROTHY
	Never, my John, but for thee!  How
	can you ask me such a question?

Raising her hand to his lips.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	Darling Dorothea!

Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I pulled out a knot of cherry-
	colored ribbons, which she had given
	me out of her breast, and which
	somehow I always wore upon me, and
	flung them in Captain Best's face,
	and rushed out with my little sword
	drawn.

			RODERICK
	She's a liar -- she's a liar,
	Captain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend
	yourself, if you are a man!

Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while
Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.

Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.

Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small
by the side of the enormous English captain.

Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back
clutching at his sword.

Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,
screaming:

			DOROTHY
	Captain Best, for Heaven's sake,
	spare the child -- he is but an
	infant.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	And ought to be whipped for his
	impudence, but never fear, Miss
	Dugan, I shall not touch him, your
	favorite is safe from me.

So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of
ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and
handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:

			CAPTAIN BEST
	When ladies make presents to
	gentlemen, it is time for other
	gentlemen to retire...

			DOROTHY
	Good heavens, Best!  He is but a boy
	and don't signify any more than my
	parrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a
	bit of ribbon to my own cousin?

			RODERICK
		   (roaring)
	I'm a man, and will prove it.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	You are perfectly welcome, miss, as
	many yards as you like.

			DOROTHY
	Monster!  Your father was a tailor,
	and you are always thinking of the
	shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I
	will!  Roddy, will you see me
	insulted?

			RODERICK
	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to
	have his blood as sure as my name's
	Roderick.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll send for the usher to cane you,
	little boy, but as for you, miss, I
	have the honor to wish you a good
	day.

Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low
bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's
cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by
the scream.

			MICHAEL
	Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the
	matter here?

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.
	I have had enough of Miss Dugan here
	and your Irish ways.  I ain't used
	to 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
		   (good-humoredly)
	Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make
	you used to our ways, or adopt
	English ones.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	It's not the English way, for ladies
	to have two lovers, and, so, Mr.
	Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the
	sum you owe me, and I resign all
	claims to this young lady.  If she
	has a fancy for school-boys, let her
	take 'em, sir.

			MICHAEL
	Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I never was more in earnest.

Best exits.

			MICHAEL
		   (in a towering rage)
	You -- you!  Hang you for a meddling
	brat, your hand is in everybody's
	pie.  What business had you to come
	brawling and quarreling here, with
	a gentleman who has fifteen hundred
	a-year?

Michael runs after Best.

			DOROTHY
		   (gasps)
	Oh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I
	shall never leave this spot.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (whisper to Dorothy)
	The Captain is gone.

Dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks
towards the house.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
		   (in a soothing tone
		    to Roderick)
	This is a pretty way to recommend
	yourself to the family.

			RODERICK
		   (shouts after
		    Michael)
	The man that marries Dorothy Dugan
	must first kill me -- do you mind
	that?

			MICHAEL
		   (shouting back from
		    a distance)
	Pooh, sir.  Kill you -- flog you,
	you mean!  I'll send for Nick the
	huntsman to do it.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	You are a gallant lad, and I like
	your spirit.  But what Dugan says is
	true.  It's a hard thing to give a
	lad counsel who is in such a far-
	gone state as you; but, believe me,
	I know the world, and if you will
	but follow my advice, you won't
	regret having taken it.  Dorothy
	Dugan has not a penny; you are not a
	whit richer.  And, my poor boy,
	don't you see -- though it's a hard
	matter to see -- that she's a flirt,
	and does not care a pin for you or
	Best either?

			RODERICK
	Dorothy might love me or not, as she
	likes, but Best will have to fight
	me before he marries her!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Faith, I think you are a lad that's
	likely to keep your word.

He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he
walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he
goes through the old gate out of the garden.

When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he
flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made
believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and
bursts into a passion of tears.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I must have sat for some hours
	bemoaning myself on the garden-bench,
	for the dinner-bell clanged as usual
	at three o'clock, which wakened me
	from my reverie.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

As Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's
saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious
red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the
scullion-girls and kitchen people.

			MAID
	The Englishman's still there, Master
	Roderick.  He's there in the parlor.
	Go in, and don't let 'im browbeat
	you, Master Roderick.

INT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the
big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.

			UNCLE
	Hello, Roddy, my boy!  Up and well?
	That's right.

			AUNT
	He'd better be home with his mother.

			UNCLE
	Don't mind her.  It's the cold goose
	she ate for breakfast -- didn't
	agree with her.  Take a glass of
	spirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's
	health.

It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what
happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,
and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his
side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and
Roderick looks on as cold as stone.

His uncle is in high good-humor.

			UNCLE
	Dorothy, divide that merry thought
	with the captain!  See who'll be
	married first.  Jack Best, my dear
	boy, never mind a clean glass for
	the claret, we're short of crystal
	at Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and
	the wine will taste none the worse.
	Mrs. Dugan and ladies, if you
	please; this is a sort of toast that
	is drunk a great deal too seldom in
	my family, and you'll please to
	receive it with all the honors.
	Here's to Captain and Mrs. John
	Best, and long life to them.  Kiss
	her, Jack, you rogue; for faith,
	you've got a treasure.

			RODERICK
		   (spring up)
	His already?!

			HARRY
	Hold your tongue, you fool -- hold
	your tongue!

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	He has already been slapped in the
	face this morning, Captain John
	Best; he's already been called a
	coward, Captain John Best; and this
	is the way I'll drink his health.
	Here's your health, Captain John
	Best.

Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next
moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who
hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he
hardly has time to hear the general screaming and
scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully
occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which
Harry is belaboring him.

			HARRY
	You fool!  You great blundering
	marplot -- you silly beggarly
	brat --
		   (a thump at each)
	Hold your tongue!

When Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are
all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the
captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut
across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.

			UNCLE
	In Heaven's name, what does all the
	row mean?  Is the boy in fever
	again?

			HARRY
		   (turning to his
		    father)
	The fact is, sir, that the young
	monkey has fallen in love with
	Dorothy, and finding her and the
	captain mighty sweet in the garden
	today, he was for murdering Jack
	Best.

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (bristling up)
	And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan,
	I've been insulted grossly in this
	house.  I ain't at all satisfied
	with these here ways of going on.
	I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man
	of property; and I -- I --

			HARRY
	If you're insulted, and not
	satisfied, remember there's two of
	us, Best.

On which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,
and answering never a word.

			RODERICK
		   (in dignified tone)
	Mr. Best may also have satisfaction
	any time he pleases, by calling on
	Roderick James, Esquire, of
	Jamesville.

His uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain
Grogan joins.

			RODERICK
	Captain Grogan, I beg you to
	understand that, for my cousin
	Harry, who has been my best friend
	through life, I could put up with
	rough treatment from him; yet, even
	that sort of treatment I will bear
	from him no longer; and any other
	person who ventures on the like will
	not like the cost.  Mr. Best knows
	that fact very well; and, if he's
	man, he'll know where to find me.

			UNCLE
	It is getting late, and your mother
	will be anxious about you.  One of
	you had better go home with him.
		   (turning to his sons)
	Or the lad may be playing more
	pranks.

			HARRY
	Both of us ride home with Best here.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My
	man is armed, and so am I.

			HARRY
	You know the use of arms very well,
	Best, and no one can doubt your
	courage; but Michael and I will see
	you home for all that.

			UNCLE
	Why, you'll not be home till
	morning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good
	ten miles from here.

			HARRY
	We'll sleep in Best's quarters.
	We're going to stop a week there.
	And, in another week, my boy.

And here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I'll go home with the boy.

EXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY

Grogan walks with Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A pretty day's work of it you have
	made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your
	uncle to be distressed for money,
	and try and break off a match which
	will bring fifteen hundred a-year
	into the family?  Best has promised
	to pay off the four thousand pounds
	which is bothering your uncle so.
	He takes a girl without a penny -- a
	girl that has been flinging herself
	at the head of every man in these
	parts these ten years past, and
	missing them all, and a boy who
	ought to be attached to your uncle
	as to your father.

			RODERICK
	And so I am.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And this is the return you make for
	his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you
	in his house when your father died,
	and hasn't he given you and your
	mother, rent-free, your fine house
	of Jamesville yonder?

			RODERICK
	Mark this, come what will of it, I
	swear I will fight the man who
	pretends to the hand of Dorothy
	Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into
	the church, and meet him there.
	I'll have his blood, or he shall
	have mine.  Will you take my message
	to him, and arrange the meeting?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Well, if it must be, it must.  For a
	young fellow, you are the most
	bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No
	officer, bearing His Majesty's
	commission, can receive a glass of
	wine on his nose, without resenting
	it -- fight you must, and Best is a
	huge, strong fellow.

			RODERICK
	He'll give the better mark.  I am
	not afraid of him.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	In faith, I believe you are not; for
	a lad I never saw more game in my
	life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy.
	You're after my own soul.  As long
	as Jack Grogan lives, you shall
	never want a friend or a second.

They embrace.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Poor fellow!  He was shot six months
	afterwards, at Minden, and I lost
	thereby a kind friend.  But we don't
	know what is in store for us, and
	that's a blessing.

EXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY

Mother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In spite of my precautions to
	secrecy, I half-suspected that my
	mother knew all from the manner in
	which she embraced me on my arrival,
	and received our guest, Captain
	Grogan.

His mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every
now and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But she would not say a word about
	the quarrel, for she had a noble
	spirit, and would as lief have seen
	any one of her kindred hanged as
	shirking from the field of honor.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick waking up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never slept sounder in my life,
	though I woke a little earlier than
	usual, and you may be sure my first
	thought was of the event of the day,
	for which I was fully prepared.

Roderick at table with paper and ink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And now I sat down and wrote a
	couple of letters; they might be the
	last, thought I, that I should ever
	write in my life.

See him write:  "Dearest Mother."

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then I went down to breakfast, where
	my mother was waiting for me, you
	may be sure.  We did not say a
	single word about what was taking
	place.

Roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in
helping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother
starts up with a scream.

			MOTHER
	Thank God, it's fallen towards me!

And then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Ah!  They have their faults, those
	mothers; but are there any other
	women like them?

There is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on
the mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late
father.

A pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture.

Roderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are
bright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and
gunpowder.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Captain Grogan and Orderly arrive.

			RODERICK
	Have you taken my message to him?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	The meeting is arranged.  Captain
	Best is waiting for you now.

			RODERICK
	My mare is saddled and ready; who's
	the captain's second?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Your cousins go out with him.

Roderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I didn't take leave of Mrs. James.
	The curtains of her bedroom-windows
	were down, and they didn't move as
	we mounted and trotted off.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

They ride their horses at a leisurely pace.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	That's a very handsome sword you
	have there.

			RODERICK
	It was with this sword that my late
	father, Harry James, God rest his
	soul, met Sir Huddelstone
	Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet,
	and was fatally run through the
	neck.  He was quite in the wrong,
	having insulted Lady Fuddelstone,
	when in liquor, at the Brentford
	Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he
	scorned to apologize.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	And now you risk the same fate.  If
	you are killed, your mother is all
	alone in the world.

			RODERICK
	I am Harry James' son, and will act
	as becomes my name and quality.

EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY

Harry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best,
flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a
grenadier company.  The party are laughing together.

			RODERICK
		   (to Captain Grogan)
	I hope to spoil this sport, and
	trust to see this sword of mine in
	that big bully's body.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You
	are no match for Best with the
	sword.

			RODERICK
	I'll match any man with the sword.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	But swords are today impossible;
	Captain Best is -- is lame.  He
	knocked his knee against the
	swinging park gate last night, as he
	was riding home, and can scarce move
	it now.

			RODERICK
	Not against Castle Dugan gate, that
	has been off the hinges these ten
	years.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	It must have been some other gate.

They alight from their horses, and join and salute the
other gentlemen.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I have just explained to Mister
	James that Captain Best is lame, and
	that swords are impossible.

			HARRY
	Oh, yes!  Dead lame.

Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while
Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.

			HARRY
	And very lucky for you, Roderick, my
	boy.  You were a dead man else, for
	he is a devil of a fellow -- isn't
	he, Grogan?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	A regular Turk.  I never yet knew
	the man who stood to Captain Best.

			HARRY
	Hang the business.  I hate it.  I'm
	ashamed of it.  Say you're sorry,
	Roderick.  You can easily say that.

			CAPTAIN BEST
	If the young feller will go to
	Dublin, as proposed...

			RODERICK
	I'm not sorry -- I'll not apologize
	-- and I'll as soon go to Dublin as
	to hell!

Grogan takes him aside.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is
	silly business.  The girl will marry
	Best, mark my words; and as sure as
	she does, you'll forget her.  You
	are but a boy.  Best is willing to
	consider you as such.  Dublin's a
	fine place, and if you have a mind
	to take a ride thither and see the
	town for a month, here are twenty
	guineas at your service.  Make Best
	an apology, and be off.

			RODERICK
	A man of honor dies, but never
	apologizes.  I'll see the captain
	hanged before I apologize.

			HARRY
		   (with a laugh to
		    Grogan)
	There's nothing else for it.  Take
	your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces,
	I suppose?

			CAPTAIN BEST
		   (in a big voice)
	Ten, sir, and make them short ones,
	do you hear, Captain Grogan?

			HARRY
	Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the
	pistols.
		   (with some emotion
		    to Roderick)
	God bless you, my boy; and when I
	count three, fire.

			RODERICK
	This is not one of my pistols.

			HARRY
	They are all right, never fear.
	It's one of mine.  Yours will serve,
	if they are needed, for the next
	round.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Roderick, fire at his neck -- hit
	him there under the gorget; see how
	the fool shows himself open.

Michael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain
retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.

It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover
his man well.

Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are
given.

At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most
horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.

			THE SECONDS
		   (crying out)
	He's down!  He's down!

Running towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes
his head.

			MICHAEL
	He's hit here, in the neck.

Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under
his gorget.

			HARRY
	How is it with you?

The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support
of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once
more and falls backwards.

			MICHAEL
		   (with a scowl)
	The young fellow has begun well.
	You had better ride off, young sir,
	before the police are up.  They had
	wind of the business before we left
	Kilwangan.

			RODERICK
	Is he quite dead?

			MICHAEL
	Quite dead.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	Then the world's rid of a coward.
	It's all over with him, Roddy -- he
	doesn't stir.

He gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his
foot.

			HARRY
	We are not cowards, Grogan, whatever
	he was!  Let's get the boy off as
	quick as we may.  Your man shall go
	for a cart, and take away the body
	of this unhappy gentleman.  This has
	been a sad day's work for our
	family, Roderick James, and you have
	robbed us of fifteen-hundred a-year.

			RODERICK
	It was Dorothy did it.

Roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his
waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the
body of Captain Best.

			RODERICK
	There!  Take her those ribbons.
	She'll know what they mean; that's
	all that's left of her of two lovers
	she had and ruined.

			MICHAEL
	And now, in Heaven's name, get the
	youngster out of the way.

			HARRY
	I'll go with you.

They mount up and gallop off.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Upon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who
has been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild
screams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I need not tell you how great was my
	mother's pride and exultation when
	she heard from Harry's lips the
	account of my behavior at the duel.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - PARLOR - DAY

Still much excitement and hustle and bustle.

			HARRY
	The boy must go into hiding, for a
	short time anyway.  Dublin is the
	best place for him to go, and there
	wait until matters are blown over.

			MOTHER
	Dublin?  But the poor lad has never
	been away from home.  He will be as
	safe here as in Dublin.

			HARRY
	I wish that were true, Auntie dear,
	but I'm afraid the bailiffs may
	already be on their way from
	Kilwangan.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother is rushing about and packing a valise.  Harry
sits on the bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Harry persisted in the necessity of
	instant departure, in which
	argument, as I was anxious to see
	the world, I must confess, I sided
	with him; and my mother was brought
	to see that, in our small house, in
	the midst of a village, escape would
	be impossible, and capture would be
	impossible to avoid.

INT.  MOTHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

His mother takes out a stocking from her escritoire, and
gives Roderick twenty golden guineas.

			MOTHER
		   (gravely)
	Roderick, my darling, my wild boy, I
	have forebodings that our separation
	is to be a long one.  I spent most
	of all night consulting the cards
	regarding your fate in the duel, and
	all signs betoke a separation.  Here
	is twenty guineas -- all that I have
	in the world -- and I want you to
	keep your father's sword and
	pistols, which you have known to use
	so like a man.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Roderick's departure.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She hurried my departure now, though
	her heart, I know, was full, and
	almost in half-an-hour from my
	arrival at home, I was once more on
	the road again, with the wide world,
	as it were, before me.

Roderick waves.  His mother cries.

EXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	No lad of seventeen is very sad who
	has liberty for the first time, and
	twenty guineas in his pocket; and I
	rode away, thinking, I confess, not
	so much of the kind of mother left
	alone, and of the home behind me, as
	of tomorrow, and all the wonders it
	would bring.

Roderick happily riding down the road.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had no doubts of the future;
	thinking that a man of my person,
	parts, and courage, could make his
	way anywhere.  So I rode on, singing
	to myself, or chatting with the
	passersby; and all the girls along
	the road said, "God save me, for a
	clever gentleman."

Farm girls in the fields flirting with him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As for thoughts of Dorothy Dugan,
	there seemed to be a gap of a half-
	a-score of years.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,
with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts
his horse alongside.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Good day to you, young sir.

			RODERICK
	Good morning.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Where are you bound for?

			RODERICK
		   (after a long look at
		    his companion)
	That is none of your business.

			ARMED GENTLEMAN
	Is your mother not afraid on account
	of the highwayman to let one so
	young as you travel?

			RODERICK
		   (pulling out a
		    pistol)
	Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of
	good pistols that have already done
	execution, and are ready to do it
	again.

At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed
gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A little later on, as I rode towards
	Kilcullen, I saw a crowd of peasant
	people assembled round a one-horse
	chair, and my friend in green, as I
	thought, making off half-a-mile up
	the hill.

A footman howls, at the top of his voice.

			FOOTMAN
	Stop thief!

But the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and
make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just
befallen.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, you might have kept him off
	with your blunderbush!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	O the coward!  To let the Captain
	bate you, and he only one eye!

			COUNTRY FELLOW #3
	The next time my lady travels, she'd
	better leave you at home!

			RODERICK
	What is this noise, fellows?

Roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the
carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his
whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off.

Pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance
to the chair-window.

			RODERICK
	What has happened, madam, to annoy
	your ladyship?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am
	the wife of Captain O'Reilly
	hastening to join him at Dublin.  My
	chair was stopped by a highwayman;
	this great oaf of a servant-man fell
	down on his knees, armed as he was,
	and though there were thirty people
	in the next field, working, when the
	ruffian attacked, not one of them
	would help but, on the contrary,
	wished him "good luck."

			COUNTRY FELLOW #1
	Sure, he's the friend of the poor,
	and good luck to him.

			COUNTRY FELLOW #2
	Was it any business of ours?

			RODERICK
		   (shouting)
	Be off to your work, you pack of
	rascals, or you will have a good
	taste of my thong.
		   (to Mrs. O'Reilly)
	Have you lost much?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Everything -- my purse, containing
	upwards of a hundred guineas, my
	jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches.
	And all because this blundering
	coward fell to his knees...

			FOOTMAN
	Be fair, ma'am, them wasn't so much.
	Didn't he return you the thirteen
	pence in copper, and the watch,
	saying it was only pinchbeck?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Don't be insolent, or I'll report
	you to the Captain.

			FOOTMAN
	Sorry, ma'am.

He shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction
that the Captain has vanished.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	That fool didn't know what was the
	meaning of a hundred-pound bill,
	which was in the pocket-book that
	the fellow took from me.

			RODERICK
	I am riding to Dublin myself, and if
	your ladyship will allow me the
	honor of riding with you, I shall do
	my best to protect you from further
	mishap.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	But I shouldn't like to put you to
	such trouble, Mister...?

			RODERICK
	O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.

EXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY

They stop at the inn.

			RODERICK
		   (very gallantly)
	As you have been robbed of your
	purse, may I have permission to lend
	your ladyship a couple of pieces to
	pay any expenses which you might
	incur before reaching your home?

			MRS. O'REILLY
		   (smiling)
	That's very kind of you, Mr.
	O'Higgins.

He gives her two gold pieces.

INT.  INN - DAY

Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly finishing their meal.

We will hear dialogue underneath Roderick's voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How different was her lively rattle
	to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan
	assemblies.  In every sentence, she
	mentioned a lord or a person of
	quality.  To the lady's question
	about my birth and parentage, I
	replied that I was a young gentleman
	of large fortune, that I was going
	to Dublin for my studies, and that
	my mother allowed me five hundred
	per annum.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	You must be very cautious with
	regard to the company you should
	meet in Dublin, where rogues and
	adventurers of all countries abound.
	I hope you will do me the honor of
	accepting lodgings in my own house,
	where Captain O'Reilly will welcome
	with delight, my gallant young
	preserver.

Paying the bill.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Perhaps had I been a little older in
	the world's experience, I should
	have begun to see that Madame
	O'Reilly was not the person of
	fashion she pretended to be; but, as
	it was, I took all her stories for
	truth, and, when the landlord
	brought the bill for dinner, paid it
	with the air of a lord.  Indeed, she
	made no motion to produce the two
	pieces I had lent her.

EXT.  DUBLIN - STREET - NIGHT

They ride by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so we rode on slowly towards
	Dublin, into which city we made our
	entrance at nightfall.  The rattle
	and splendor of the coaches, the
	flare of the linkboys, the number
	and magnificence of the houses,
	struck me with the greatest wonder;
	though I was careful to disguise
	this feeling.

EXT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DUBLIN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We stopped at length at a house of
	rather mean appearance, and were let
	into a passage which had a great
	smell of supper and punch.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Captain O'Reilly, a stout red-faced man, without a
periwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap.
Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how
	grateful I am for your timely
	assistance to my wife.

			RODERICK
	I am only sorry that I was unable to
	prevent the villain from carrying
	off all her ladyship's money and
	pearls.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt,
	and rest assured, sir, you have
	friends in this house whenever you
	are in Dublin.
		   (pours a glass)
	Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know
	your good father?

			RODERICK
	Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I
	have never heard your name mentioned
	in my family.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins
	of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins
	was a close friend of my wife's dear
	father, Colonel Granby Somerset.

			RODERICK
	Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine
	are the O'Higgins of Watertown.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I have heard of them.

There are relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a
cracked dish before them.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	My love, I wish I had known of your
	coming, for Bob Moriaty and I just
	finished the most delicious venison
	pasty, which His Grace the Lord
	Lieutenant, sent us, with a flash of
	sillery from his own cellar.  You
	know the wine, my dear?  But as
	bygones are bygones, and no help for
	them, what say ye to a fine lobster
	and a bottle of as good claret as
	any in Ireland?  Betty, clear these
	things from the table, and make the
	mistress and our young friend
	welcome to our home.

Captain O'Reilly searches his pockets for some money to
give to Betty.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I'm sorry, Mr. O'Higgins, but I
	don't seem to have any small change.
	May I borrow a ten-penny piece to
	give to the girl?

			MRS. O'REILLY
	I have some money, my dear.  Here,
	Betty, go to the fishmonger and
	bring back our supper, and mind you
	get the right change.

She takes out one of the golden guineas Roderick gave to
her.

INT.  DINNING ROOM - LATER

They are eating.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our supper was seasoned, if not by
	any great elegance, at least by a
	plentiful store of anecdotes,
	concerning the highest personages of
	the city, with whom, according to
	himself, the captain lived on terms
	of the utmost intimacy.  Not to be
	behind hand with him, I spoke of my
	own estates and property as if I was
	as rich as a duke.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The couple wishing Roderick goodnight.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Had I been an English lad, the
	appearance of the chamber I occupied
	might, indeed, have aroused
	instantly my suspicion and distrust.
	But we are not particular in Ireland
	on the score of neatness, hence the
	disorder of my bed-chamber did not
	strike me so much.

Broken door.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was there a lock to the door, or a
	hasp to fasten it to?

Dress lying over bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Though my counterpane was evidently
	a greased brocade dress of Mrs.
	O'Reilly.

Cracked mirror.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And my cracked toilet-glass not much
	bigger than a half-crown, yet I was
	used to these sort of ways in Irish
	houses, and still thought myself to
	be in that of a man of fashion.

Drawers, full of junk.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was no lock to the drawers,
	which, when they did open, were full
	of my hostess' rouge-pots, shoes,
	stays, and rags.

INT.  BEDROOM - O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

In the middle of the night, Mrs. O'Reilly comes to
Roderick's room on a flimsy pretext, and in the course of
events, he has his first woman.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	I needn't ask whether you had a
	comfortable bed.  Young Fred
	Pimpleton slept in it for seven
	months, during which he did me the
	honor to stay with me, and if he was
	satisfied, I don't know who else
	wouldn't be.

EXT.  PROMENADE - PHOENIX PARK - DAY

Roderick, Captain and Mrs. O'Reilly, their friends.
Various cuts.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After breakfast, we drove out to
	Phoenix Park, where numbers of the
	young gentry were known to Mrs.
	O'Reilly, to all of whom she
	presented me in such a complimentary
	way that, before half an hour, I had
	got to be considered as a gentleman
	of great expectations and large
	property.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had little notion then that I had
	got amongst a set of impostors --
	that Captain O'Reilly was only an
	adventurer, and his lady a person of
	no credit.  The fact was, a young
	man could hardly have fallen into
	worse hands than those in which I
	now found myself.

An evening of gambling.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Their friends were always welcome on
	payment of a certain moderate sum
	for their dinner after which, you
	may be sure, that cards were not
	wanting, and that the company who
	played did not play for love merely.

Various cuts of the characters present.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What could happen to a man but
	misfortune from associating with
	such company?  And in a very, very
	short time I became their prey.

Roderick loses two hundred guineas to Captain O'Reilly in
a single hand.

We see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not.

He pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum
his mother gave him.

			RODERICK
	I shall have to write out a note for
	the rest of it, Captain O'Reilly.

EXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN

Roderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling
can still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by
Councillor Mulligan.

			COUNCILLOR MULLIGAN
	Master Roderick, you appear a young
	fellow of birth and fortune; let me
	whisper in your ear that you have
	fallen into very bad hands -- it's a
	regular gang of swindlers; and a
	gentleman of your rank and quality
	should never be seen in such
	company.  The captain has been a
	gentleman's gentleman, and his lady
	of no higher rank.  Go home, pack
	your valise, pay the little trifle
	you owe me, mount your mare, and
	ride back again to your parents --
	it's the very best thing you can do.

Roderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him
down the street.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Roderick enters.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Into a pretty nest of villains,
	indeed, was I plunged!  When I
	returned to my bed-chamber, a few
	hours later, it seemed as if all my
	misfortunes were to break on me at
	once.

Valise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's
keys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Whom have I been harboring in my
	house?  Who are you, sirrah?

			RODERICK
	Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a
	gentleman as any in Ireland!

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	You're an impostor, young man, a
	schemer, a deceiver!

			RODERICK
	Repeat the words again, and I run
	you through the body.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as
	well as you, Mr. Roderick James.
	Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your
	secret is known, is it?  You come
	like a viper into the bosom of
	innocent families; you represent
	yourself as the heir to my friends
	the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I
	introduce you to the nobility and
	gentry of this methropolis; I take
	you to my tradesmen, who give you
	credit.  I accept your note for near
	two hundred pounds, and what do I
	find?  A fraud.

He holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the
linen.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
	Not Master O'Higgins of Watertown,
	but Roderick James of the devil only
	knows where...

Captain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver
toilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, Mr. O'Reilly, I will tell
	you why I was obliged to alter my
	name, which is James and the best
	name in Ireland.  I changed it, sir,
	because, on the day before I came to
	Dublin, I killed a man in deadly
	combat -- an Englishman, sir, and a
	Captain in His Majesty's service;
	and if you offer to let or hinder me
	in the slightest way, the same arm
	which destroyed him is ready to
	punish you.

So saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and
giving a "ha, ha!" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it
within an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and
turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings
herself between them.

			MRS. O'REILLY
	Dearest Roderick -- be pacified.
	O'Reilly, you don't want the poor
	child's blood.  Let him escape -- in
	Heaven's name, let him go.

			CAPTAIN O'REILLY
		   (sulkily)
	He may go hang for me, and he's
	better be off quickly, for I shall
	go to the magistrate if I see him
	again.

O'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins
to cry.

EXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY

Roderick riding down the street, with his valise.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Where was now a home for the
	descendant of the James?  I was
	expelled from Dublin by a
	persecution occasioned, I must
	confess, by my own imprudence.  I
	had no time to wait and choose.  No
	place of refuge to fly to.

INT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was a score of recruiting
	parties in the town beating up for
	men to join our gallant armies in
	America and Germany.

Roderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly
make him welcome.

			RODERICK
	I will tell you frankly, sir.  I am
	a young gentleman in difficulties; I
	have killed an officer in a duel,
	and I am anxious to get out of the
	country.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I needn't have troubled myself
	with any explanations; King George
	was in too much want of men to heed
	from whence they came -- and a
	fellow of my inches was always
	welcome.  Indeed, I could not have
	chosen my time better.  A transport
	was lying at Dunleary, waiting for a
	wind.

EXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I never had a taste for any thing
	but genteel company, and hate all
	descriptions of low life.  Hence my
	account of the society in which I at
	present found myself must of
	necessity be short.  The
	reminiscences of the horrid black-
	hole of a place in which we soldiers
	were confined, of the wretched
	creatures with whom I was now forced
	to keep company, of the plowmen,
	poachers, pickpockets, who had taken
	refuge from poverty, or the law, as,
	in truth, I had done myself, is
	enough to make me ashamed even now.

Roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid
bacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess.
When it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is
served, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing
somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water.  The
beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning
round to the messman and saying:

			RODERICK
	Fellow, get me a glass!

At which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of
laughter, the very loudest among them being Mr. Toole, a
red-haired monster of a man.

			MR. TOOLE
	Get the gentleman a towel for his
	hands, and serve him a basin of
	turtle-soup.

Roars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on
the deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly
seizes Roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst
of another burst of applause.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	If you want to vex him, ask him
	about his wife, the washerwoman, who
	bates him.

			RODERICK
	Is it a towel of your wife's
	washing, Mr. Toole?  I'm told she
	wiped your face often with one.

			LINK-BOY
		   (whispers)
	Ask him why he wouldn't see her
	yesterday, when she came to the
	ship.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And so I put to him some other
	foolish jokes about soapsuds, hen-
	pecking, and flat-irons, which set
	the man into a fury, and succeeded
	in raising a quarrel between us.

Roderick and Toole fight with cudgels.  Roderick gives him
a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the
floor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	This victory over the cock of the
	vile dunghill obtained me respect
	among the wretches among whom I
	formed part.

EXT.  MILITARY DRILL FIELD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our passage was very favorable, and
	in two days we landed at Cuxhaven,
	and before I had been a month in the
	Electorate, I was transported into a
	tall and proper young soldier, and,
	having a natural aptitude for
	military exercise, was soon as
	accomplished at the drill as the
	oldest sergeant in the regiment.

Various cuts.

Roderick learning the soldierly arts, musket drill, manual
of arms, bayonet, marching.

EXT.  MILITARY COURTYARD - CUXHAVEN - DAY

The Cuxhaven troops are drawn up to receive a new
regiment, arrived from England.

Roderick sees, marching at the head of his company, his
old friend, Captain Grogan, who gives him a wink.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Six weeks after we arrived in
	Cuxhaven, we were reinforced by
	Gales regiment of foot from England,
	and I promise you the sight of
	Grogan's face was most welcome to
	me, for it assured me that a friend
	was near me.

INT.  GROGAN'S QUARTERS - DAY

Roderick and Grogan.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Grogan gave me a wink of
	recognition, but offered no public
	token of acquaintance and it was not
	until two days afterwards that he
	called me into his quarters, and
	then, shaking hands with me
	cordially, gave me news which I
	wanted, of my family.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith,
	you've begun early, like your
	father's son, but I think you could
	not do better than as you have done.
	But why did you not write home to
	your poor mother?  She has sent
	half-a-dozen letters to you in
	Dublin.

			RODERICK
	I suppose she addressed them to me
	in my real name, by which I never
	thought to ask for them at the post
	office.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	We must write to her today, and you
	can tell her that you are safe and
	married to "Brown Bess."

Roderick sighs when Grogan says the word "married," on
which Grogan says with a laugh:

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I see you are thinking of a certain
	young lady at Duganstown.

			RODERICK
	Is Miss Dugan well?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	There's only six Miss Dugans now...
	poor Dorothy.

			RODERICK
	Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she
	died of grief?

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	She took on so at your going away
	that she was obliged to console
	herself with a husband.  She is now
	Mrs. John Best.

			RODERICK
	Mrs. John Best!  Was there another
	Mr. John Best?!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	No, the very same one, my boy.  He
	recovered from his wound.  The ball
	you hit him with was not likely to
	hurt him.  It was only made of tow.
	Do you think the Dugans would let
	you kill fifteen hundred a-year out
	of the family?  The plan of the duel
	was all arranged in order to get you
	out of the way, for the cowardly
	Englishman could never be brought to
	marry from fear of you.  But hit him
	you certainly did, Roderick, and
	with a fine thick plugget of tow,
	and the fellow was so frightened
	that he was an hour in coming to.
	We told your mother the story
	afterwards, and a pretty scene she
	made.

			RODERICK
	The coward!

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	He has paid off your uncle's
	mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach-
	and-six.  That coward of a fellow
	has been making of your uncle's
	family.  Faith, the business was
	well done.  Your cousins, Michael
	and Harry, never let him out of
	their sight, though he was for
	deserting to England, until the
	marriage was completed, and the
	happy couple off on their road to
	Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my
	boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got
	a couple of hundred out of Master
	Best for my share and, while they
	last, you shall never want.

EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - BRITISH ON THE MARCH - DAY

Roderick on the march.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our regiment, which was quartered
	about Stade and Luneberg, speedily
	had got orders to march southwards
	towards the Rhine, where we would
	fight the famous battle of Minden.
	It would require a greater
	philosopher and historian than I am
	to explain the causes of the famous
	Seven Years' War in which Europe was
	engaged, and, indeed, its origin has
	always appeared to me to be so
	complicated, and the books written
	about it so amazingly hard to
	understand, that I have seldom been
	much wiser at the end of a chapter
	than at the beginning, and so shall
	not trouble you with any personal
	disquisitions concerning the matter.

Various cuts featuring Roderick; marching, cooking at open
fires, gambling, resting in a farm yard, officers riding
by; shivering in his blanket.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD OF MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENT - DAY

Roderick and his company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Were these memoirs not characterized
	by truth, I might easily make myself
	the hero of some strange and popular
	adventures.

EXT.  MINDEN - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

Officers ride by in smoke.  Troops marching to the attack.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But I saw no one of the higher ranks
	that day than my colonel and a
	couple of orderly officers riding by
	in the smoke -- no one on our side,
	that is.  A poor corporal is not
	generally invited into the company
	of commanders and the great.

Roderick advancing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But, in revenge, I saw, I promise
	you, some very good company on the
	French part, for their regiments of
	Lorraine and Royal Cravate were
	charging us all day; and in the sort
	of melee high and low are pretty
	equally received.  I hate bragging,
	but I cannot help saying that I made
	a very close acquaintance with the
	colonel of the Cravates.

Roderick firing his musket.  He bayonets a French colonel,
amidst shouts and curses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And finished off a poor little
	ensign, so young, slender, and
	small, that a blow from my pigtail
	would have dispatched him.

Roderick kills a French ensign with a blows from the butt
of his musket.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And in the poor ensign's pocket
	found a purse of fourteen louis
	d'or, and a silver box of sugar-
	plums, of which the former present
	was very agreeable to me.

Roderick taking money and the box of sugar-plums from the
ensign.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If people would tell their stories
	of battles in this simple way, I
	think the cause of truth would not
	suffer by it.  All I know of this
	famous fight of Minden, except from
	books, is told here above.

Captain Grogan is shot, cries out, and falls.

A brother captain turns to Lieutenant Lakenham.

			CAPTAIN
	Grogan's down; Lakenham, there's
	your company.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	That was all the epitaph my brave
	patron got.

Roderick kneels above Grogan.

			CAPTAIN GROGAN
	I should have left you a hundred
	guineas, Roderick, but for a cursed
	run of ill-luck last night at faro.

He gives Roderick a faint squeeze of the hand; and, as the
word is given to advance, Roderick leaves him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When we came back to our ground,
	which we presently did, he was lying
	still, but he was dead.  Some of our
	people had already torn off his
	epaulets, and, no doubt, had rifled
	his purse.

EXT.  VARIOUS ROUGH RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

Short cuts to voice over.

Roderick and British troops rape, pillage and burn.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After the death of my protector,
	Captain Grogan, I am forced to
	confess that I fell into the very
	worst of courses and company.  In a
	foreign country, with the enemy
	before us, and the people
	continually under contribution from
	one side or the other, numberless
	irregularities were permitted to the
	troops.  It is well for gentlemen to
	talk of the age of chivalry; but
	remember the starving brutes whom
	they lead -- men nursed in poverty,
	entirely ignorant, made to take
	pride in deeds of blood -- men who
	can have no amusement but in
	drunkenness, debauch, and plunder.
	It is with these shocking
	instruments that your great warriors
	and kings have been doing their
	murderous work in the world.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - WARBURG - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The year in which George II died,
	our regiment had the honor to be
	present at the Battle of Warburg,
	where Prince Ferdinand once more
	completely defeated the Frenchmen.

Lieutenant Lakenham is shot, falls, and cries for help.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	During the action, my lieutenant,
	Mr. Lakenham, of Lakenham, was
	struck by a musket-ball in the side.
	He had shown no want of courage in
	this or any other occasion where he
	had been called upon to act against
	the French; but this was his first
	wound, and the young gentleman was
	exceedingly frightened by it.

			LAKENHAM
	Here, you, Roderick James.  I will
	pay you five guineas if you will
	carry me into the town which is hard
	by those woods.

Roderick and another man take him up in a cloak, and carry
him towards the nearby town of Warburg.

EXT.  A FARMHOUSE - GERMAN STREET - WARBURG - DAY

In order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man
are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces,
which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the
door; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her
old, half-blinded father.

They are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but
Mr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a
couple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily
convinces the people that they have only to deal with a
person of honor.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

They carry Lieutenant Lakenham to bed and receive their
five guineas.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We put the patient to bed, and he
	paid me the stipulated reward.  A
	young surgeon, who desired nothing
	better than to take himself out of
	the fire of the musketry, came
	presently to dress the wound.

In his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved
compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking,
with no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be
billeted there.

EXT.  STREET - WARBURG - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DAY

He starts back to the regiment, with his comrade, when the
man interrupts his reverie by suggesting they divide the
five guineas.

			PRIVATE
	I should get half.

			RODERICK
	Your share is one guinea.

Roderick gives him one guinea.

			PRIVATE
	He gave you five guineas, and I
	bloody well expect half.

			RODERICK
	Go to the devil.

The private lifting his musket, hits Roderick a blow with
the butt-end of it, which sends him stunned to the ground,
allowing his comrade to take the other four guineas from
his pocket.

Recovering his senses, Roderick bleeding, with a large
wound in the head, has barely time to stagger back to the
house where he had just left the lieutenant, when he
falls fainting at the door, just as the surgeon exits.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is carried by the surgeon and the black-eyed
girl, into another bed in the room where the Lieutenant
has been laid.

			LAKENHAM
		   (languidly, in pain)
	Who are you putting into that bed?

			LISCHEN
	We have the Corporal, wounded, to
	you bringing.

			LAKENHAM
	A corporal?  Turn him out.  Schicken
	sie Herrn Koporal weg!

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT AND DAY

Lischen brings Roderick a refreshing drink; and, as he
takes it, he presses the kind hand that gave it to him;
nor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I found Lischen the tenderest of
	nurses.  Whenever any delicacy was
	to be provided for the wounded
	lieutenant, a share was always sent
	to the bed opposite his, and to the
	avaricious man's no small annoyance.

Lischen serving food.

Various cuts, representing different days.

Lakenham behaving as rottenly as Roderick describes:

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor was I the only person in the
	house to whom the worthy gentleman
	was uncivil.  He ordered the fair
	Lischen hither and thither, made
	impertinent love to her, abused her
	soups, quarreled with her
	omelettes, and grudged the money
	which was laid out for his
	maintenance, so that our hostess
	detested him as much as, I think,
	without vanity, as she regarded me.

Roderick making lover to Lischen while Lieutenant Lakenham
sulks in the next bed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For if truth must be told, I had
	made very deep love to her during my
	stay under her roof, as is always my
	way with women, of whatever age or
	degree of beauty.  Do not think me
	very cruel and heartless, ladies;
	this heart of Lischen's was like
	many a town, which had been stormed
	and occupied several times before I
	came to invest it,

Roderick sitting up in bed.  Lischen has just served him
his supper.

Enter a British officer, an aide who carries a notebook,
and a surgeon.  In a brief scene to be written, we learn
that a sudden movement on the part of the French requires
the British army to follow them.  The town is to be
evacuated, except for some Prussian line-of-communication
troops, whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the
place; and, when they are well, they are to be drafted to
their regiments.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I began to reflect how pleasant my
	quarters were to me, and that I was
	much better here than crawling under
	an odious tent with a parcel of
	tipsy soldiers, or going the night-
	rounds, or rising long before
	daybreak for drill.  I determined
	that I never would join mine again.

EXT.  VIEW OUT OF WARBURG FARMHOUSE WINDOW - DAY

Roderick stands by the window, watching English troops and
wagons leaving the town.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick walks into Lakenham's room attired in his full
regimentals, and with his hat cocked over his left eye.

			RODERICK
	I'm promoted Lieutenant.  I've come
	to take my leave of you.  I intend
	to have your papers and purse.

			LAKENHAM
	You great scoundrel!  You mutinous
	dog!  What do you mean by dressing
	yourself in my regimentals?  As sure
	as my name's Lakenham, when we get
	back to the regiment, I'll have your
	soul cut out of your body.

With this, Roderick puts his hand under his pillow, at
which Lakenham gives a scream that might have called the
whole garrison about his ears.

Roderick threatens him with a knife at his throat.

			RODERICK
	Hark ye, sir!  No more noise, or you
	are a dead man!

Roderick, taking his handkerchief, binds it tight round
his mouth, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt,
ties them in a knot together, and so leaves him, removing
the papers and the purse, and wishing him politely a good
day.

EXT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - STREET - DAY

Lischen, waiting outside the house, with a saddled horse,
throws her arms around him, and makes the tenderest adieu.

Roderick mounts his newly-purchased animal, waves his hat
gallantly, and, prances away down the street.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick happily riding along a wooded country road,
rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about
two hundred yards away, a company of Prussian infantry
resting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen
mounted dragoons.

A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed
than to turn back, and he rides into their midst,
approaching a group of officers.

He presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for
directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is
riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map.

During the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches
with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and
says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if
Roderick will honor him with his company.

To avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer,
and the two men mount up, and ride off together.

EXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick and Galgenstein riding together.

Dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My companion treated me with great
	civility, and asked me a thousand
	questions about England, which I
	answered as best I might.  But this
	best, I am bound to say, was bad
	enough.  I knew nothing about
	England, and I invented a thousand
	stories which I told him; described
	the king and the ministers to him,
	said the British ambassador in
	Berlin was my uncle, and promised my
	acquaintance a letter of
	recommendation to him.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What is your uncle's name?

			RODERICK
		   (slowly)
	O'Grady.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (with a laugh)
	Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador
	O'Grady...

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads
together, jogging on.

They pass a party of recruits under the armed guard of a
red-coated Hanoverian sergeant.

He exchanges signs of recognition with Captain
Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It hurts my feelings to be obliged
	to commune with such wretches, but
	the stern necessities of war demand
	men continually, and hence these
	recruiters whom you see market in
	human flesh.  They get five-and-
	twenty thaler a man from our
	government for every man they bring
	in.  For fine men -- for men like
	you.
		   (he adds laughing)
	They would go as high as hundred.

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely-
looking place.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	This is a very good inn.  Shall we
	stop for dinner?

			RODERICK
	This may be a very good inn for
	Germany, but it would not pass in
	old Ireland.  Corbach is only a
	league off, let us push on for
	Corbach.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Do you want to see the loveliest
	woman in Europe?

Roderick smiles.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will
	influence you.

			RODERICK
	The place seems more a farm than an
	inn-yard.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The people are great farmers, as
	well as inn-keepers.

They enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and
at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place.

A couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their
horses are littered under a shed hard by.

Lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of
sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their
hats to the captain.

The inn has something foreboding about it, and the men
shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (explaining the gate)
	Parties of French horsemen are about
	the country, and one cannot take too
	many precautions against such
	villains.

The two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain
orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his
bedroom.

Roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his
pains.

They enter into supper.

INT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

A dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous
old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely
creature which had been expected; and the captain,
laughing, says:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Well, our meal is a frugal one, but
	a soldier has many a time a worse.

Taking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great
ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his
weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the
captain's is laid.

The hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine,
at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a
considerable ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (when she leaves)
	Where's the beauty you promised me?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (laughing and looking
		    hard at Roderick)
	It was my joke.  I was tired, and
	did not care to go farther.  There's
	not prettier woman here than that.
	If she won't suit your fancy, my
	friend, then you must wait awhile.

This increases Roderick's ill-humor.

			RODERICK
		   (sternly)
	Upon my word, sir, I think you have
	acted very coolly.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I have acted as I think fit.

			RODERICK
	Sir, I'm a British officer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	It's a lie!  You're a deserter!
	You're an impostor, sir; Your lies
	and folly have confirmed this to me.
	You pretend to carry dispatches to a
	general who has been dead these ten
	months; you have an uncle who is an
	ambassador and whose name you don't
	know.  Will you join and take the
	bounty, sir, or will you be given
	up?

			RODERICK
	Neither!

Springing at him like a tiger.

But, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard.
He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off,
and says, from the other end of the table where he stands
dodging Roderick, as it were.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Advance a step, and I send this
	bullet into your brains!

The door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed
with musket and bayonet to aid their captain.

The game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which
he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the
wine, had removed his sword.

			RODERICK
	I volunteer.

EXT.  A ROAD - DAY

Prussian troops on the march.  Roderick is now one of
them.

Captain Galgenstein rides by.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the close of the Seven Years' War,
	the Prussian army, so renowned for
	its disciplined valor, was
	officered and under-officered by
	native Prussians, it is true, but
	was composed for the most part of
	men hired or stolen, like myself,
	from almost every nation in Europe.
	The deserting to and fro was
	prodigious.

EXT.  A FIELD - DAY

Prussian punishment gauntlet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life the private soldier led was
	a frightful one to any but the men
	of iron courage and endurance.  The
	punishment was incessant.

EXT.  VARIOUS RURAL LOCATIONS - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was not near so unhappy, in spite
	of all, as I had been on my first
	enlisting in Ireland.  At least,
	there will be no one of my
	acquaintance who will witness my
	shame, and that is the point which I
	have always cared for most.

Rape, pillage and burn.

Brief thematic repeat of British army version.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I reasoned with myself thus:  "Now
	you are caught, there is no use in
	repining -- make the best of your
	situation, and get all the pleasure
	you can out of it.  There are a
	thousand opportunities of plunder,
	offered to the soldier in war time,
	out of which he can get both
	pleasure and profit; make use of
	these, and be happy."

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - FRAGMENT

Prussians against Austrians, or French, or Saxons.

Roderick fighting.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I do not intend to make a history of
	battles in the Prussian any more
	than in the English service.  I did
	my duty in them as well as another,
	and there was not a braver,
	cleverer, handsomer, and, I must
	own, wickeder soldier in the
	Prussian army.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - ACTION - DAY

			RODERICK
	I had formed myself to the condition
	of the proper fighting beast; on a
	day of action, I was savage and
	happy.

Roderick saves Captain Galgenstein's life.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Roderick is decorated by Colonel Bulow for his heroism in
saving Captain Galgenstein.

Colonel Bulow gives Roderick two Frederic d'or in front of
the regiment.

			COLONEL BULOW
	You are a gallant soldier, and have
	evidently come of good stock; but
	you are idle, dissolute, and
	unprincipled; you have done a deal
	of harm to the men; and, for all
	your talents and bravery, I am sure
	you will come to no good.

			RODERICK
	I hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken
	regarding my character.  I have
	fallen into bad company, it is true;
	but I have only done as other
	soldiers have done; and, above all,
	I have never had a kind friend and
	protector before, to whom I might
	show that I was worthy of better
	things.  The Colonel may say I am a
	ruined lad, and send me to the
	devil; but be sure of this, I would
	go to the devil to serve the
	regiment.

Captain Galgenstein looks pleased with Roderick's
performance.

BERLIN - 1763

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Soon after the war ended, our
	regiment was garrisoned in the
	capital, the least dull, perhaps, of
	all the towns of Prussia; but that
	does not say much for its gaiety.

INT.  ANTE-ROOM - CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick enters and approaches the Captain's sergeant.

			RODERICK
	Private Roderick James.  First
	Hanoverian Guards.  Captain
	Galgenstein sent for me.

			PRUSSIAN SERGEANT
	You may wait.

			RODERICK
	Thank you, sir.

Roderick stands stiffly.  We can make out the sound of
loud talking behind the closed door.

Enter a private huffing and puffing.

			PRIVATE
	Sergeant, the wagon has arrived with
	the Captain's furniture, but the
	driver says he is not supposed to
	unload it.  Is it possible for you
	to talk to him?

Exit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the
office, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what
is being said.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN (O.S.)
	Give him his discharge!  Bon Dieu!
	You are a model of probity!  You'll
	never succeed to my place, my dear
	nephew, if you are no wiser than you
	are just now.  Make the fellow as
	useful to you as you please.  You
	say he has a good manner and a frank
	countenance, that he can lie with
	assurance, and fight, you say, on a
	pinch.  The scoundrel does not want
	for good qualities.  As long as you
	have the regiment in terrorem over
	him, you can do as you like with
	him.  Once let him loose, and the lad
	is likely to give you the slip.
	Keep on promising him; promise to
	make him a general, if you like.
	What the deuce do I care?  There are
	spies enough to be had in this town
	without him.

Roderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to
the door.

Then the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out,
sees Roderick, smiles and say:

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Good morning, Private James.  Please
	come in.  I should like you to meet
	my uncle, Herr Minister of Police
	Galgenstein.

			RODERICK
	How do you do, sir?

The Minister nods.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The captain was the nephew and heir
	of the Minister of Police, Herr
	Galgenstein, a relationship which,
	no doubt, aided in the younger
	gentlemen's promotion.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Your loyalty to me and your service
	to the regiment has pleased me very
	well -- and now there is another
	occasion on which you may make
	yourself useful to us; if you
	succeed, depend on it, your reward
	will be your discharge from the
	army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.

			RODERICK
	What is the service, sir?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	There is lately come to Berlin a
	gentleman in the service of the
	Empress Queen, who calls himself the
	Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears
	the red riband and star of the
	pope's order of the Spur.  He is
	made for good society, polished,
	obliging, a libertine, without
	prejudices, fond of women, of good
	food, of high play, prudent and
	discreet.

The Captain smiles at Roderick.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	He speaks Italian and French
	indifferently; but we have some
	reason to fancy this Monsieur de
	Belle Fast is a native of your
	country of Ireland, and that he has
	come here as a spy.

The Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Naturally, your knowledge of English
	makes you an ideal choice to go into
	his service.  Of course, you will
	not know a word of English; and if
	the Chevalier asks as to the
	particularity of your accent, say
	you are Hungarian.  The servant who
	came with him will be turned away
	today, and the person to whom he has
	applied for a faithful fellow will
	recommend you.

Roderick nods.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You are a Hungarian; you served in
	the army, and left on account of
	weakness in the loins.  He gambles a
	great deal, and wins.  Do you know
	the cards well?

			RODERICK
	Only a very little, as soldiers do.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	I had thought you more expert.  You
	must find out if the Chevalier
	cheats.  He sees the English and
	Austrian envoys continually, and the
	young men of either ministry sup
	repeatedly at his house.  Find out
	what they talk of, for how much each
	plays, especially if any of them
	play on parole.  If you are able to,
	read his private letters, though
	about those which go to the post,
	you need not trouble yourself -- we
	look at them there.  But never see
	him write a note without finding out
	to whom it goes, and by what channel
	or messenger.  He sleeps with the
	keys of his dispatch-box with a
	string around his neck -- twenty
	frederics, if you get an impression
	of the keys.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Does this assignment interest you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, Minister, I am interested in
	any work in which I can be of
	service to Captain Galgenstein.

The Minister studies Roderick, coldly.

EXT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, now dressed in civilian clothes, admires a
beautiful carriage, waiting at the door.  Then he enters.

INT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S APARTMENT - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	You are the young man who M. de
	Seebach recommended?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.

Roderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman,
with which the Captain had taken care to provide him.

As the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the
leisure to examine him.

He is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly,
wearing rings, diamonds and laces.

One of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears
a little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios,
which fall over his lip.

The Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read
the letter.

			CHEVALIER
	Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?

			RODERICK
	Yes, sir.

			CHEVALIER
	You come highly recommended by Herr
	Seebach.

			RODERICK
	Herr Seebach was a very kind
	employer.

			CHEVALIER
	For whom else have you worked?

			RODERICK
	No one, sir.  Before that I served
	in the army but had to leave due to
	weakness of the loins.

			CHEVALIER
	Who else can give me information
	about you?

			RODERICK
	Only the agency of servants.

The Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for
a few seconds, and then smiles.

			CHEVALIER
	You will do.  I will give you 30...
	a day.  I do not provide your
	clothing; you will sleep at home,
	and you will be at my orders every
	morning at seven o'clock.

He notices Roderick begin to tremble and look peculiar.

			CHEVALIER
	Is there something wrong?

He goes up to Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was very imprudent of me; but
	when I saw the splendor of his
	appearance, the nobleness of his
	manner, I felt it impossible to keep
	disguise with him.  You, who have
	never been out of your country know
	little what it is to hear a friendly
	voice in captivity; and there's a
	many a man that will understand the
	cause of the burst of feeling which
	was about to take place.

The Chevalier takes Roderick by the shoulder.

			RODERICK
		   (as he speaks,
		    bursting into tears)
	Sir, I have a confession to make.  I
	am an Irishman, and my name is
	Roderick James.  I was abducted into
	the Prussian army two years ago, and
	now I have been put into your
	service by my Captain and his uncle,
	the Minister of Police, to serve as
	a watch upon your actions, of which
	I am to give information to the same
	quarter.  For this odious service, I
	have been promised my discharge, and
	a hundred guineas.

Sobbing, Roderick falls into his arms.

			CHEVALIER
	The rascals!  They think to catch
	me, do they?  Why, young man, my
	chief conspiracy is a faro-bank.
	But the king is so jealous, that he
	will see a spy in every person who
	comes to his miserable capital, in
	the great sandy desert here.

EXT.  BERLIN - PARK - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And I think he was as much affected
	as I was at thus finding one of his
	kindred; for he, too, was an exile
	from home, and a friendly voice, a
	look, brought the old country back
	to his memory again, and the old
	days of his boyhood.

			CHEVALIER
	I'd give five years of my life to
	see the old country again, the
	greenfields, and the river, and the
	old round tower, and the burying
	place.

EXT.  BERLIN - STREET - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking.

			CHEVALIER
	My lad, I have been in every
	service; and, between ourselves, owe
	money in every capital in Europe.  I
	have been a rolling stone.  Play --
	play has been my ruin!  That and
	beauty.  The women have made a fool
	of me, my dear boy.  I am a soft-
	hearted creature, and this minute,
	at sixty-two, have no more command
	of myself than when Peggy O'Dwyer
	made a fool of me at sixteen.

EXT.  BERLIN - LAKE WANNSEE - DAY

Roderick and the Chevalier walking along the bank.

			CHEVALIER
	The cards are now my only
	livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck,
	and then I lay out my money in these
	trinkets you see.  It's property,
	look you, and the only way I have
	found of keeping a little about me.
	When the luck goes against me, why,
	my dear, my diamonds go to the
	pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do
	you understand the cards?

			RODERICK
	I can play as soldiers do, but have
	no great skill.

			CHEVALIER
	We will practice in the mornings, my
	boy, and I'll put you up to a thing
	or two worth knowing.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOMS - BERLIN - DAY

Quick cuts -- Roderick being taught the profession of
cards and the dice-box.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Minister Galgenstein, and Captain Galgenstein.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I carried my little reports to
	Captain Galgenstein at the Garden
	house outside the town where he gave
	me rendezvous.  These reports, of
	course, were arranged between me and
	the Chevalier beforehand.  I was
	instructed, and it is always the
	best way, to tell as much truth as
	my story would possible bear.

Dialogue comes up from under voice over.

			RODERICK
	He goes to church regularly -- he is
	very religious, and after hearing
	mass comes home to breakfast.  Then
	he takes an airing in his chariot
	till dinner, which is served at
	noon.  After dinner, he writes his
	letters, if he has any letters to
	write; but he has very little to do
	in this way.  His letters are to the
	Austrian envoy, with whom he
	corresponds, but who does not
	acknowledge him; and being written
	in English, or course, I look over
	his shoulder.  He generally writes
	for money.  He makes his party with
	Calsabigi, the lottery contractor,
	the Russian attaches, two from the
	English embassy, my lords Deuceace
	and Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer,
	and a few more.  He wins often, but
	not always.  Lord Deuceace is a very
	fine player.  The Chevalier Elliott,
	the English Minister, sometimes
	comes, on which occasion the
	secretaries do not play.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT

The Chevalier is at play against several gentlemen,
including the Prince of Turbingen, while Roderick signals
the cards.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was agreed that I should keep my
	character of valet, that in the
	presence of strangers I should not
	know a word of English, that I
	should keep good lookout on the
	trumps when I was serving the
	champagne and punch about; and,
	having a remarkably fine eyesight,
	and a great natural aptitude, I was
	speedily able to give my dear
	benefactor much assistance against
	his opponents at the green table.

Several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice
over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Simplicity was our secret.
	Everything successful is simple.
	If, for instance, I wiped the dust
	off a chair with my napkin, it was
	to show that the enemy was strong in
	diamonds; if I pushed it, he had an
	ace, king; if I said, "Punch or
	wine, my lord?" hearts was meant.
	If "Wine or punch?" clubs.  If I
	blew my nose, it was to indicate
	that there was another confederate
	employed by the adversary; and then,
	I warrant you, some pretty trials of
	skill would take place.  The Prince
	of Turbingen, although so young, had
	a very great skill and cleverness
	with the cards in every way; and it
	was only from hearing Ritter von
	Brandenburg, who came with him, yawn
	three times when the Chevalier had
	the ace of trumps, that I knew we
	were Greek to Greek, as it were.

The Prince loses a big hand, and, in a fury, throws down
his cards.  He stares at the table, then at the Chevalier.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, though I cannot say how,
	I believe you have cheated me.

			CHEVALIER
	I deny your Grace's accusations, and
	beg you to say how you have been
	cheated?

			PRINCE
		   (glaring at Roderick)
	I don't know.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace owes me seventy thousand
	frederics, which I have honorably
	won.

			PRINCE
	Chevalier, if you will have your
	money now, you must fight for it.
	If you will be patient, maybe I will
	pay you something another time.

			CHEVALIER
	Your Grace, if I am so tame as to
	take this, then I must give up an
	honorable and lucrative occupation.

			PRINCE
	I have said all there is to be said.
	I am at your disposal for whatever
	purposes you wish.  Good night.

He exits.

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Was he cheated?

			RODERICK
	In so far as I can tell these things
	-- no.  I believe the Chevalier won
	the money fairly.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Hmm-mmmm.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	What are the Chevalier's intentions?

			RODERICK
	I am not sure.  The Prince told him
	quite clearly that if he wished to
	have the money, he would have to
	fight for it.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	A meeting with the Prince of
	Turbingen is impossible.

			RODERICK
	The Prince left him only that
	choice.

The Captain and the Minister walk a few steps away and
speak in whispers.

Then they return to Roderick.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Will you be able to return here
	tomorrow without arousing suspicion?

INT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

			CHEVALIER
	Tell them I intend to demand
	satisfaction from the Prince.

			RODERICK
	But they will prevent a meeting at
	whatever the cost.

			CHEVALIER
	Have no fear.  It will come out well
	for me.

			RODERICK
	I believe they will deport you.

			CHEVALIER
	I have faced that problem before.

			RODERICK
	But, if they send you away, then
	what is to become of me?

			CHEVALIER
		   (with a smile)
	Make your mind easy, you shall not
	be left behind, I warrant you.  Do
	take a last look at your barracks,
	make your mind easy, say a farewell
	to your friends in Berlin.  The dear
	souls, how they will weep when they
	hear you are out of the country,
	and, out of it, you shall go.

			RODERICK
	But how, sir?

EXT.  GARDEN HOUSE - BERLIN - DAY

Roderick, Captain Galgenstein and Minister Galgenstein.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	The King has determined to send the
	Chevalier out of the country.

			RODERICK
	When is he to go?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Has he sent the challenge yet?

			RODERICK
	Not yet, but I believe he intends
	to.

			MINISTER GALGENSTEIN
	Then this must be done tomorrow.

			RODERICK
	What is to be done?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	You say he drives after breakfast
	and before dinner.  When he comes
	out to his carriage a couple of
	gendarmes will mount the box, and
	the coachman will get his orders to
	move on.

			RODERICK
	And his baggage?

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I
	have a fancy to look into that red
	box which contains his papers, you
	say; and at noon, after parade,
	shall be at the inn.  You will not
	say a word to any one there
	regarding the affair, and will wait
	for me at the Chevalier's rooms
	until my arrival.  We must force
	that box.  You are a clumsy hound,
	or you would have got the key long
	ago.

EXT.  CHEVALIER'S APARTMENTS - DAY

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At ten o'clock the next morning, the
	carriage of the Chevalier de Belle
	Fast drew up as usual at the door of
	his hotel, and the Chevalier came
	down the stairs in his usual stately
	manner.

Looking around and not finding his servant to open the
door.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my rascal, Lazlo?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (standing by the
		    carriage)
	I will let down the steps for your
	honor.

No sooner does the Chevalier enter than the officer jumps
in after him, another mounts the box by the coachman, and
the latter begins to drive.

			CHEVALIER
	Good gracious!  What is this?

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
		   (touching his hat)
	You are going to drive to the
	frontier.

			CHEVALIER
	It is shameful -- infamous!  I
	insist upon being put down at the
	Austrian ambassador's house.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	I have orders to gag your honor if
	you cry out, and to give you this
	purse containing ten thousand
	frederics if you do not.

			CHEVALIER
	Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel
	owes me seventy thousand.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Your honor must lower his voice.

			CHEVALIER
		   (whispering)
	All Europe shall hear of this!

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	As you please.

Both lapse into silence.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by.  Suddenly -- "boom," the alarm cannon
begins to roar.

INT.  COACH - DAY

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	Do not be alarmed.  The alarm cannon
	only signals a deserter.

Chevalier nods.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The coach drives by and action as described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Hearing the sound of the alarm
	cannon, the common people came out
	along the road, with fowling-pieces
	and pitch-forks, in hopes to catch
	the truant.  The gendarmes looked
	very anxious to be on the lookout
	for him too.  The price of a
	deserter was fifty crowns to those
	who brought him in.

EXT.  SAXON CUSTOM-HOUSE - DAY

The black and white barriers came in view at last hard by
Bruck, and opposite them the green and yellow of Saxony.
The Saxon custom-house officers came out.

			CHEVALIER
	I have no luggage.

			PRUSSIAN OFFICER
	The gentleman has nothing
	contraband.

The Prussian officers, grinning, hand the Chevalier the
purse and take their leave of their prisoner with much
respect.

The Chevalier de Belle Fast gives them three frederic a-
piece.

			CHEVALIER
	Gentlemen, I wish you a good day.
	Will you please go to the house from
	whence we set out this morning, and
	tell my man there to send my baggage
	on to Three Kings at Dresden?

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Then ordering fresh horses, the
	Chevalier set off on his journey for
	that capital.  I need not tell you
	that I was the Chevalier.

INT.  ROOM - HOTEL DES TROIS COURONNES - DAY

Roderick reading a letter over his breakfast in bed.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	From the Chevalier de Belle Fast to
	Roderick James, Esquire, Gentilhomme
	Anglais.  At the Hotel des trois
	Couronnes, Dresden, Saxe.  My dear
	Roderick -- This comes to you by a
	sure hand, no other than Mr. Lumpit,
	of the English mission, who is
	acquainted, as all Berlin will be
	directly, with our wonderful story.
	They only know half as yet; they
	only know that a deserter went off
	in my clothes, and all are in
	admiration of your cleverness and
	valor.

INT.  CHEVALIER'S ROOM - DAY

Action as per description in letter.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	As I lay in my bed two and a half
	hours after your departure, in comes
	your ex-captain, Galgenstein.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
		   (in his imperious
		    Dutch manner)
	Roderick!  Are you there?

No answer.

			CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN
	The rogue is gone out.

Action as per voice over.

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Straightaway he makes for the red
	box where I keep my love letters, my
	glass eye which I used to wear, my
	two sets of Paris teeth, and my
	other private matters that you know
	of.  He first tries a bunch of keys,
	but none of them fit the English
	lock.  Then he takes out of his
	pocket a chisel and hammer, and
	falls to work like a professional
	burglar, actually bursting open the
	little box!  Now was my time to act!
	I advance towards him armed with an
	immense water-jug.  I come
	noiselessly up to him just as he has
	broken the box, and, with all my
	might, I deal him such a blow over
	the head as smashes the water-jug to
	bits, and sends the captain with a
	snort lifeless to the ground.  Then
	I ring all the bells in the house;
	and shout, and swear, and scream,
	"Thieves! -- Thieves! -- Landlord!
	-- Murder! -- Fire!" until the whole
	household comes tumbling up the
	stairs.

			CHEVALIER
	Where is my servant?  Who dares to
	rob me in open day?  Look at the
	villain whom I find in the act of
	breaking my chest open!  Send for
	the police, send for his Excellency
	the Austrian Minister!  All Europe
	shall know of this insult!

			LANDLORD
	Dear heaven!  We saw you go away
	three hours ago.

			CHEVALIER
	Me!  Why, man, I have been in bed
	all morning.  I am ill -- I have
	taken physic -- I have not left the
	house this morning!  Where is that
	scoundrel, Lazlo?  But, stop!  Where
	are my clothes and wig?

			CHAMBERMAID
	I have it -- I have it!  Lazlo is
	off in your honor's dress.

			CHEVALIER
	And my money -- my money!  Where is
	my purse with forty-eight frederics
	in it?  But we have one of the
	villains left, Officers, seize him.

			LANDLORD
		   (more and more
		    astonished)
	It's the young Herr Galgenstein.

			CHEVALIER
	What!  A gentleman breaking open my
	trunk with hammer and chisel --
	impossible!

			CHEVALIER (V.O.)
	Herr Galgenstein was returning to
	life by this time, with a swelling
	on his skull as big as a saucepan;
	and the officers carried him off,
	and, to make a long story short,
	poor Galgenstein is now on his way
	to Spandau; and his uncle, the
	Minister of Police Galgenstein, has
	brought me five hundred louis, with
	a humble request that I would leave
	Berlin forthwith, and hush up this
	painful matter.

INT.  GERMAN PALACE - BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, the Chevalier and the Duke of Wurttemberg.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The Chevalier de Belle Fast was in
	particularly good order with the
	Duke of Wurttemberg, whose court
	was, at this period, the most
	brilliant in all Europe.

The Duke of Wurttemberg chatting with ballet dancers, who
will perform at the party.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He spent fabulous sums on the
	ballets and operas.  All the
	ballerinas were pretty, and they all
	boasted that they had all at least
	once made their amorous sovereign
	happy.

Roderick and the Chevalier kissing hands, hobnobbing with
the nobility, and dancing minuets.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	There was not a party of the
	nobility to which the two Irish
	gentlemen were not invited, and
	admired, nor where we did not make
	the brave, the high-born and the
	beautiful talk to us.  There was no
	man in Europe more gay in spirits,
	more splendid in personal
	accomplishment, than young Roderick
	James.

EXT.  GERMAN STREET - DAWN

Roderick and the Chevalier in a comfortable coach, on
their way home to bed, pass troops marching out on early
parade.

INT.  COACH - DAWN

Roderick sinks back into the comfortable cushion and
yawns.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	What a delightful life did we now
	lead!  I knew I was born a
	gentleman, from the kindly way in
	which I took to the business, as
	business certainly it is.

INT.  BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick in a tub, being washed by a servant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	For though it seems all pleasure,
	yet I assure any low-bred persons
	who may chance to read this, that
	we, their betters, have to work as
	well as they; though I did not rise
	until noon, yet had I not been up at
	play until long past midnight?

INT.  ANOTHER BEDROOM - GERMANY - DAY

His hair being done.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I came into it at once, and as if I
	had never done anything else all my
	life.  I had a gentleman to wait
	upon me, a French friseur to dress
	my hair of a morning.

INT.  DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A candle-lit supper.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I knew the taste of chocolate as by
	intuition almost, and could
	distinguish between the right
	Spanish and the French before I had
	been a week in my new position.

INSERTS - JEWELRY

Action and cuts as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had rings on my fingers, watches
	in both my fobs, trinkets, and
	snuff-boxes, of all sorts, and each
	outvying the other in elegance.

INT.  RECEPTION ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

As described.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had the finest natural taste for
	lace and china of any man I ever
	knew.

EXT.  STABLES - GERMANY - DAY

Buying horses.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I could judge a horse as well as any
	dealer in Germany.  I could not
	spell, but I could speak German and
	French cleverly.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick being fitted for clothes.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had at least twelve suits of
	clothes; three richly embroidered
	with gold, two laced with silver;
	one of French grey, silver-laced and
	lined with chinchilla.  I had damask
	morning robes, to which a peacock's
	tail is as sober as a Quaker's drab
	skirt.

INT.  ORANGERY - DAY

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I took lessons on the guitar, and
	sang French catches exquisitely.
	Where, in fact, was there a more
	accomplished gentleman than Roderick
	James?

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	How have we had the best blood, and
	the brightest eyes, too, of Europe
	throbbing round the table as I and
	the Chevalier have held the cards
	and the bank against some terrible
	player, who was matching some
	thousands out of his millions
	against our all which was there on
	the baize!

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Roderick dealing a faro bank.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Our principles were:  play grandly,
	honorably.  Be not, of course, cast
	down at losing; but, above all, be
	not eager at winning, as mean souls
	are.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - GERMANY - NIGHT

Action as voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When the Duke of Courland brought
	fourteen lackeys each with bags of
	florins, and challenged our bank to
	play against the sealed bags, what
	did we ask?

			CHEVALIER
	Sir, we have but eighty thousand
	florins in bank, or two hundred
	thousand at three months; if your
	highness' bags do not contain more
	than eight thousand, we will meet
	you.

Playing.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we did, and after eleven hours
	play, in which our bank was at one
	time reduced to two hundred and
	three ducats, we won seventeen
	thousand florins off him.

Four crowned heads look on at the game, and an imperial
princess, when Roderick turns up the ace of hearts, bursts
into tears.

INT.  MASQUERADE BALL - NIGHT

Roderick and a girl.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Nor need I mention my successes
	among the fairer portion of the
	creation.  One of the most
	accomplished, the tallest, the most
	athletic, and the handsomest
	gentleman in Europe, as I was then,
	a young fellow of my figure could
	not fail of having advantages, which
	a person of my spirit knew very well
	how to us.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

Making love to a masked lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Charming Schuvaloff.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Black-eyed Sczortarska.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Dark Valdez.

			RODERICK
	Do you expect me to believe that
	your lover brought you here tonight?

			VALDEZ
	Yes.  He brought me in his carriage,
	and he will call for me at midnight.

			RODERICK
	And he doesn't care about me?

			VALDEZ
	He is only curious to know who you
	are.

			RODERICK
	If his love were like mine, he would
	not permit you to come here.

			VALDEZ
	He loves me, as I love you.

			RODERICK
	Will he wish to know the details of
	this night?

			VALDEZ
	He will believe that it will please
	me if he asks about it, and I shall
	tell him everything except some
	circumstances which might humiliate
	him.

EXT.  GARDEN - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Tender Hegenheim.

INT.  BOUDOIR - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Brilliant Langeac.

Roderick takes from his portfolio a little jacket of very
fine transparent skin, eight inches long and closed at one
end, and which by way of a pouch string at its open end,
has a narrow pink ribbon.

He displays it to her, she looks at it, and laughs.

			LANGEAC
	I will put in on you myself.

She puts it on, out of shot.

			LANGEAC
	There you are, dressed by my hand.
	It is nearly the same thing; but
	despite the fineness and
	transparency of the skin, the little
	fellow pleases me less well in
	costume.  It seems that this
	covering degrades him, or degrades
	me -- one of the other.

			RODERICK
	Both, my angel.  It was Love who
	invented these little jackets:  for
	he had to ally himself with
	Precaution.

INT.  ROOM OFF A BALLROOM - NIGHT

Roderick making love to the Countess von Trotha.  Enter
the Count, in the uniform of a Colonel.

			COUNT
	I entered here, monsieur, at a bad
	moment for you; it seems that you
	love this lady.

			RODERICK
	Certainly, monseigneur, does not
	Your Excellency consider her worthy
	of love?

			COUNT
	Perfectly so; and what is more, I
	will tell you that I love her, and
	that I am not of a humor to put up
	with rivals.

			RODERICK
	Very well!  Now that I know it, I
	will no longer love her.

			COUNT
	Then you yield to me.

			RODERICK
	On the instant.  Everyone must yield
	to such a nobleman as you.

			COUNT
	Very well; but a man who yields
	takes to his legs.

			RODERICK
	That is a trifle strong.

			COUNT
	Take to your legs, low Irish dog.

Roderick smiles at him.

			RODERICK
	Your Excellency has wantonly
	insulted me.  That being so, I
	conclude that you hate me,
	Monseigneur, and that hence you
	would be glad to remove me from the
	number of the living.  In this wish,
	I can and will satisfy Your
	Excellency.

EXT.  BEAUTIFUL GARDEN - EARLY MORNING

Roderick's sword duel with the Count.

Details to be worked out.

INT.  BILLIARD ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian
officer, Lieutenant Dascher.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was my unrivaled skill with
	sword and pistol, and readiness to
	use them, that maintained the
	reputation of the firm.

Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is
losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker
tells him so to his face.

Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game,
takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in
his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's
adjurations, or to Roderick's.

Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard
cue and swings it at Dascher's face.

He wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and
runs at Roderick, who is unarmed.

The marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the
waist and prevents murder.

			DASCHER
	I see that you are without your
	sword, but I believe you are a man
	of mettle.  Will you give me
	satisfaction?

			RODERICK
	I shall be delighted; but you have
	lost and you must pay me the money
	before we meet, for, after all, you
	cannot pay me when you are dead.

			ANOTHER OFFICER
	I will undertake to pay you the 20
	louis, but only tomorrow morning at
	the meeting.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

On the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher,
and his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket
and hands them to Roderick, saying:

			DASCHER
	I may have been mistaken, but I mean
	to make you pay deadly for your
	brutality.

Roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the
utmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.

			RODERICK
		   (privately)
	It is distasteful to kill a
	scoundrel -- that should be work for
	a hangman.

			CHEVALIER
	To risk one's life against such
	people is an imposition.

			RODERICK
		   (laughs)
	I risk nothing, for I am certain to
	kill him.

			CHEVALIER
	Certain?

			RODERICK
	Perfectly certain, because I shall
	make him tremble.

He takes his station between two trees, about four paces
apart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.

			RODERICK
	You have only to pace yourself at
	ten paces difference, and fire
	first.  The space between these two
	trees is the place where I choose to
	walk back and forth.  You may walk
	too, if you wish, when it is my turn
	to fire.

No one could have explained his intentions more clearly or
spoken more calmly.

			DASCHER
	But we must decide who is to have
	the first shot.

			RODERICK
	There is no need of that.  I never
	fire first; and, in any case, you
	have that right.

Dascher places himself at the specified distance.

Roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees
without looking at him.

Dascher takes aim and fires, missing.

			RODERICK
		   (with the greatest
		    composure)
	You missed me, sir.  I was sure you
	would.  Try again.

The others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of
discussion between the parties, but not a bit of it.

Dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again
missing Roderick.

Without a word, but in a firm and confident manner,
Roderick fires his first shot into the air.

Dascher looks amazed.  Then, aiming at Dascher with his
second pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead
and stretches him out dead on the ground.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Chevalier traveling in their coach.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Thus is will be seen that our life,
	for all its splendor was one of
	extreme difficulty and danger,
	requiring high talents and courage
	for success, and sudden and
	unexpected departures.

They meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses,
carrying a master and a servant.

The driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's
driver to make way for him.

Roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset
his master in the ditch, but the other insists.

Roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and
asks him to order his driver to make way for him.

			RODERICK
	I am posting, monsieur, and
	furthermore I am a foreigner.

			STRANGER
	Monsieur, here in Saxony, the post
	has no special right, and if you are
	a foreigner, you must admit that you
	have no greater claim than mine,
	since I am in my own country.

At that, Roderick gets out and holding his drawn-sword
tells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him.

The stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword
and that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly
reason.

He tells Roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes
way for him.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and the Chevalier running a faro bank when an
important lady suffers a huge loss.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The ladies were passionately fond of
	play, and hence would often arise no
	small trouble to us; for the truth
	most be told, that the ladies loved
	to play, but not to pay.  The point
	of honor is not understood by the
	charming sex; and it was with the
	greatest difficulty that we could
	keep them from the table, could get
	their money if they lost or, if they
	paid, prevent them from using the
	most furious and extraordinary means
	of revenge.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	On this evening, the lady of high
	rank, after I had won a considerable
	sum in diamonds and pearls from her,
	sent her lover with a band of cut-
	throats to waylay me.

Roderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their
carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon
which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.

The Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in
his right arm, which he thinks is broken.

Their servant forces the door open to help them out,
telling them that the two postilions have fled.

Roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door,
which is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move
because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.

His piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the
strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.

From the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols,
and sword.

Roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for
armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.

The Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning
and in no condition to resist robbers.

Roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune
and his life at the highest price.

His carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the
horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a
circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons.

In this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the
poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a
seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when
a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her
empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing
to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,
and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the
strength to hold in.

The chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an
attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's
lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.

Some falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his
pistol.

The leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.
During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless
Chevalier and two of them are killed.

After they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who
utters some appropriate last words, then dies.

His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at
the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,
each with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten
or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready
to obey his orders.

EXT.  SPA - HOTEL - DAY

Roderick's carriage arrives.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After making suitable arrangements
	for the Chevalier's burial, in
	proper accord with his church, I
	traveled to Spa, which was now in
	season, alone, to continue my
	profession which formerly had the
	support of my friend and mentor.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Crowds surround Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was by this time one of the best-
	known characters in Europe; and the
	fame of my exploits, my duels, my
	courage at play, would bring crowds
	round me in any public society where
	I appeared.

INT.  CASINO - NIGHT

Attractive women alone, while men are at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The passion for play is stronger
	than the passion for gallantry; the
	gamester at Spa has neither time to
	stop to consider the merits of a
	woman, nor the courage to make
	sacrifices for her.

EXT.  GARDEN IN SPA - DAY

The Countess of Cosgrove walks beside her husband, Sir
William Cosgrove, who is in a wheelchair.  They are
accompanied by their young son, Lord Brookside, and two
servants.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In evoking the recollections of
	these days, I have nothing but
	pleasure.  I would if I could say as
	much of a lady who will henceforth
	play a considerable part in the
	drama of my life -- I mean the
	Countess of Cosgrove, whose fatal
	acquaintance I made at Spa, very
	soon after the tragic events which
	caused me to quit Germany.

Closer shot of the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Victoria, Countess of Cosgrove.  A
	Countess and a Viscountess in her
	own right.

Closer shot of Sir William Cosgrove.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the wife of her cousin, the
	Right Honorable Sir William Reginald
	Cosgrove, Knight of the Bath, and
	Minister to George II and George III
	of several of the smaller courts of
	Europe.

Closer shot of young Lord Brookside, walking behind them
in the care of his governor.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was the mother to Viscount
	Brookside -- a melancholy, deserted,
	little boy, about whom his father
	was more than indifferent, and whom
	his mother never saw.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Shots of Sir William Cosgrove being wheeled in, and at
play with Roderick, and some other gentlemen.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I made Sir William Cosgrove's
	acquaintance as usual at the play-
	table.  One could not but admire the
	spirit and gallantry with which he
	pursued his favorite pastime; for,
	though worn out with gout and a
	myriad of diseases, a cripple
	wheeled about in a chair, and
	suffering pangs of agony, yet you
	would see him every morning, and
	every evening at his post behind the
	delightful green cloth.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you
	have no more manners than a barber,
	and I think my black footman has
	been better educated than you; but
	you are a young fellow of
	originality and pluck, and I like
	you, sir.  because you seem
	determined to go to the devil by a
	way of your own.

Laughter at the table.

			RODERICK
	I am obliged to observe, Sir William
	Cosgrove, that since you are bound
	for the next world much sooner than
	I am, I will depend on you to get
	comfortable quarters arranged for
	me.

Laughter.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at
	me.  Marriage has added forty years
	to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out
	cripple, at the age of fifty.  When
	I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was
	no man of my years who looked so
	young as myself.  Fool that I was!
	I had enough with my pensions,
	perfect freedom, the best society in
	Europe -- and I gave up all these,
	and married and was miserable.  Take
	a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and
	stick to the trumps.  Do anything,
	but marry.

			RODERICK
	Would you have me spend my life all
	alone?

			SIR WILLIAM
	In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must
	marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.

			RODERICK
		   (laughing)
	The milkmaid's daughter?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter?
	No man of sense need restrict
	himself or deny himself a single
	amusement for his wife's sake; on
	the contrary, if he selects the
	animal properly, he will choose such
	a one as shall be no bar to his
	pleasure, but a comfort in his hours
	of annoyance.  For instance, I have
	got the gout; who tends me?  A hired
	valet who robs me whenever he has
	the power.  My wife never comes near
	me.  What friend have I?  None in
	the wide world.  Men of the world,
	as you and I are, don't make
	friends, and we are fools for our
	pains.

Polite laughter at the table.

			SIR WILLIAM
	My lady is a weak woman, but she is
	my mistress.  She is a fool, but she
	has got the better of one of the
	best heads in Christendom.  She is
	enormously rich, but somehow I have
	never been so poor, as since I
	married her.  I thought to better
	myself, and she has made me
	miserable and killed me, and she
	will do as much for my successor
	when I'm gone.

There is a reflective silence at the table.

			RODERICK
	Has her ladyship a very large
	income?

This question causes Sir William to burst out into a
yelling laugh, joined by the rest of the table, and makes
Roderick blush not a little at his gaucherie.

EXT.  ORNAMENTAL GARDEN - SPA - NIGHT

A beautiful scene, lit by the flambeaux, held by a dozen
footmen.  A small orchestra, playing in a Temple of Love,
some dancers, people gambling and lounging along a line of
trees.

Roderick approaches the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite my friend's strong warning.
	I resolves to become acquainted with
	his lady.  Sir William Cosgrove was
	dying.  His widow would be a rich
	prize.  Why should I not win her,
	and, with her, the means of making
	in the world that figure which my
	genius and inclination desired?
	When I determine, I look upon the
	thing as done.

			RODERICK
	Charming lady, tell me the truth and
	earn my gratitude.  Have you a
	lover?

The countess laughs.

			COUNTESS
	No.

			RODERICK
	Have you had one?

			COUNTESS
	Never.

			RODERICK
	But, for a time... a passing fancy?

			COUNTESS
	Not even that.

			RODERICK
	How can I believe that there is not
	a man who has inspired desires in
	you?

			COUNTESS
	Not one.

			RODERICK
	Have you not a man whom you value?

			COUNTESS
	That man has, perhaps, not yet been
	born.

			RODERICK
	What!  You have not met a man worthy
	of your attention?

			COUNTESS
	Many worthy of attention; but
	valuing is something more.  I could
	value only someone whom I loved.

			RODERICK
	Then you have never loved?  Your
	heart is empty.

			COUNTESS
	Your word "empty" makes me laugh.
	Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If
	it is fortunate, I congratulate
	myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do
	not care, for I am not aware of it.

			RODERICK
	It is nonetheless a misfortune, and
	you will know it when you love.

			COUNTESS
	But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I
	will know that my empty heart was my
	good fortune.

			RODERICK
	That is true, but it seems to me
	impossible that you should be
	unhappy in love.

			COUNTESS
	It is only too possible.  Love
	requires a mutual harmony which is
	difficult, and it is even more
	difficult to make it last.

			RODERICK
	I agree; but God put us on earth to
	take that risk.

			COUNTESS
	A man may need to do that, and find
	it amusing; but a girl is bound by
	other laws.

			RODERICK
	I believe you, and I see I must
	hasten to leave, for otherwise I
	shall become the unhappiest of men.

			COUNTESS
	How so?

			RODERICK
	By loving you, with no hope of
	possessing you.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	You want my heart?

			RODERICK
	It is my only object.

			COUNTESS
	To make me wretched in two weeks.

			RODERICK
	To love you until death.  To
	subscribe to all your commands.

			COUNTESS
	The amusing thing is that you
	deceive me without knowing, if it is
	true that you love me.

			RODERICK
	Deceiving someone without knowing it
	is something new for me.  If I do
	not know it, I am innocent.

			COUNTESS
	But you deceive me nonetheless if I
	believe you, for it will not be in
	your power to love me when you love
	me no longer.

Roderick laughs and kisses her.

			COUNTESS
	Be so good as to tell me with whom
	you think you are?

			RODERICK
	With a woman who is completely
	charming, be she a princess or a
	woman of the lowest condition, and
	who, regardless of her rank, will
	show me some kindness, tonight.

She laughs.

			COUNTESS
	And if she does not choose to show
	you some kindness?

			RODERICK
	Then I will respectfully take leave
	of her.

			COUNTESS
	You will do as you please.  It seems
	to me that such a matter can hardly
	be discussed until after people know
	each other.  Do you not agree?

			RODERICK
	Yes -- but I am afraid of being
	deceived.

			COUNTESS
	Poor man.  And, for that reason, you
	want to begin where people end?

			RODERICK
	I ask only a payment on account
	today -- after that, you will find
	me undemanding, obedient and
	discreet.

She laughs.  He kisses her again.  They exit.

EXT.  ROAD - SPA - NIGHT

Coach and four moves slowly along.

INT.  COACH - NIGHT

They kiss.  She gently struggles as he tries to undo her
dress.  He stops.

			RODERICK
	Will we always leave it at this?

			COUNTESS
	Always, my dear one, never any
	further.  Love is a child to be
	pacified with trifles.  A full diet
	can only kill it.

			RODERICK
	I know better than you do.  Love
	wants a more substantial fare, and
	if it is stubbornly withheld, it
	withers away.

			COUNTESS
	Our abstinence makes our love
	immortal.  If I loved you a quarter
	of an hour ago, now I should love
	you even more.  But I should love
	you less if you exhausted my joy by
	satisfying all my desires.

			RODERICK
	Let us give each other complete
	happiness, and let us be sure that
	as many times as we satisfy our
	desires, they will each time be born
	anew.

			COUNTESS
	My husband has convinced me of the
	contrary.

			RODERICK
	Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is
	dying, and yet I envy him more than
	any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a
	privilege of which I am deprived.
	He may take you in his arms whenever
	he pleases, and no veil keeps his
	senses, his eyes, his soul from
	enjoying your beauty.

She silences him with her fingertips.

			COUNTESS
	Shall I tell you something -- I
	believed what was called love came
	after the union -- and I was
	surprised when my husband, making me
	a woman, made me know it only by
	pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure.
	I saw that my imaginings had stood
	me in better stead.  And so we
	became only friends, seldom sleeping
	together and arousing no curiosity
	in each other, yet on good terms for
	a while, as whenever he wanted me, I
	was at his service, but since the
	offering was not seasoned with love,
	he found it tasteless, and seldom
	demanded it.

			RODERICK
	O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg
	you.  Stop believing in your
	experience.  You have never known
	love.  My very soul is leaving me!
	Catch it on your lips, and give me
	yours!

They kiss ardently.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	To make a long story short, her
	ladyship and I were in love six
	hours after we met; and after I once
	got into her ladyship's good graces,
	I found innumerable occasions to
	improve my intimacy, and was
	scarcely ever out of her company.

EXT.  COUNTESS' HOUSE - SPA - DUSK

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I shall never forget the
	astonishment of Sir William Cosgrove
	when, on one summer evening, as he
	was issuing out to the play-table,
	in his sedan-chair, her ladyship's
	barouche and four came driving into
	the courtyard of the house which
	they inhabited and, in that
	carriage, by her ladyship's side,
	sat no other than "the vulgar Irish
	adventurer," as she was pleased to
	call me.

Sir William makes the most courtly of bows and grins, and
waves his hat in as graceful a manner as his multiplicity
of illness permits, and her ladyship and Roderick reply to
the salutation with the utmost politeness and elegance on
their part.

INT.  RODERICK'S APARTMENT - SPA - NIGHT

Making ardent love.

			COUNTESS
	Without you, my dearest, I might
	have died without ever knowing love.
	Inexpressible love!  God of nature!
	Bitterness than which nothing is
	sweeter, sweetness than which
	nothing is more bitter.  Divine
	monster which can only be defined by
	paradoxes.

			RODERICK
	Let me give a thousand kisses to
	that heavenly mouth which has told
	me that I am happy.

			COUNTESS
	As soon as I saw you loved me, I was
	pleased, and I gave you every
	opportunity to fall more in love
	with me, being certain that, for my
	part, I would never love you.  But
	after our first kiss, I found that I
	had no power over myself.  I did not
	know that one kiss could matter so
	much.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We then spent an hour in the most
	eloquent silence except that, from
	time to time, her ladyship cried
	out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I
	am not dreaming?"

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick enters and approaches a table at which Sir
William Cosgrove, who is drunk, is at play with several
other jovial fellows.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Sir William Cosgrove, with his
	complication of ills, was dying
	before us by inches.  He was
	continually tinkered up by doctors,
	and, what with my usual luck, he
	might be restored to health and live
	I don't know how many years.  If
	Cosgrove would not die, where was
	the use of my pursing his lady?  But
	my fears were to prove groundless,
	for on that very night, patient
	nature would claim her account.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Good evening, Mr. James, have you
	done with my lady?

			RODERICK
	I beg your pardon?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Come, come, sir.  I am a man who
	would rather be known as a cuckold
	than a fool.

			RODERICK
	I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you
	have had too much drink.  Your
	chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me
	into the company of your lady to
	advise me on a religious matter, of
	which she is a considerable expert.

Sir William Cosgrove greets this line with a yell of
laughter.  His laugh is not jovial or agreeable, but
rather painful and sardonic, and ends in a violent fit of
coughing.

			SIR WILLIAM
	Gentlemen, see this amiable youth!
	He has been troubled by religious
	scruples, and has flown for refuge
	to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has
	asked for advise from my wife, Lady
	Cosgrove, and between them both,
	they are confirming my ingenious
	young friend in his faith.  Did you
	ever hear of such doctors and such a
	disciple?

			RODERICK
	Faith, sir, if I want to learn good
	principles, it's surely better I
	should apply for them to your lady,
	and your chaplin than to you?

			SIR WILLIAM
		   (laughing, but pretty
		    red)
	He wants to step into my shoes!  He
	wants to step into my shoes!

Roderick stares at him coldly.

			RODERICK
	Well, if my intentions are what you
	think they are -- if I do wish to
	step into your shoes, what then?  I
	have no other intentions than you
	had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's
	wealth may be great, but am I not of
	a generous nature enough to use it
	worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but
	not so lofty as my ambition.  I will
	be sworn to muster just as much
	regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you
	ever showed her; and if I win her,
	and wear her when you are dead and
	gone, corbleu, knight, do you think
	that it will be the fear of your
	ghost will deter me?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for
	me, as I am drawing near the goal,
	to find my home such a happy one; my
	wife so fond of me, that she is even
	now thinking of appointing a
	successor?  Isn't it a comfort to
	see her; like a prudent housewife,
	getting everything ready for her
	husband's departure?

			RODERICK
	I hope that you are not thinking of
	leaving us soon, knight?

			SIR WILLIAM
	Not so soon, my dear, as you may
	fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have
	been given over many times these
	four years, and there was always a
	candidate or two waiting to apply
	for the situation.  Who knows how
	long I may keep you waiting.

			RODERICK
	Sir, let those laugh that win.

			SIR WILLIAM
	I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm
	grieved to keep you or any gentleman
	waiting.  Had you not better to
	arrange with my doctor or get the
	cook to flavor my omelette with
	arsenic?  What are the odds,
	gentlemen, that I don't live to see
	Mr. James hang yet?

There is laughter around the table, and Sir William starts
dealing the cards.

			VOICE
	Dies at Spa, in the Kingdom of
	Belgium, the Right Honorable Sir
	William Cosgrove, Knight of the
	Bath, Member of Parliament for
	Cosgrove and Devonshire and many
	years His Majesty's representative
	at various European courts.  He hath
	left behind him a name which is
	endeared to all his friends for his
	manifold virtues and talents, a
	reputation justly acquired in the
	service of His Majesty, and an
	inconsolable widow to deplore his
	loss.

Sir Williams keels over dead.

INT.  CHURCH - DAY

The wedding of Roderick and the Countess.  The service is
preformed by Reverend Hunt, her ladyship's chaplain.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	A year from that day, on the
	fifteenth of May, in the year 1773,
	I had the honor and happiness to
	lead to the altar Victoria, Countess
	of Cosgrove, widow of the late Right
	Honorable Sir William Cosgrove, K.B.
	I had procured His Majesty's
	gracious permission to add the name
	of my lovely lady to my own, and,
	henceforward, assumed the title of
	James Cosgrove.

EXT.  A GARDEN - LONDON - DAY

The Wedding reception.

Roderick and the Countess are approached by young Lord
Brookside, aged 12.

			COUNTESS
	My Lord Brookside, come and embrace
	your papa!

Brookside walks slowly towards them, and shakes his fist
in Roderick's face.

			BROOKSIDE
	He, my father!  I would as soon call
	one of your ladyship's footmen,
	papa!

Roderick laughs, as the Countess unsuccessfully tries to
get the boy to shake hands.

			COUNTESS
	Lord Brookside, you have offended
	your father.

			BROOKSIDE
	Mother, you have offended my father.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a declaration of war to me,
	as I saw at once; though I declare I
	was willing enough to have lived
	with him on terms of friendliness.
	But as men serve me, I serve them.
	Who can blame me for my after-
	quarrels with this young reprobate,
	or lay upon my shoulders the evils
	which afterwards befell?

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Three carriages, each with four horses, proceed along the
picturesque track.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	After we had received the
	congratulations of our friends in
	London -- I and Victoria set off to
	visit our country estate, Castle
	Hackton, where I had never as yet
	set foot.

INT.  CARRIAGE - DAY

Roderick and his Lady.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The first days of a marriage are
	commonly very trying; and I have
	known couples, who lived together
	like turtle-doves for the rest of
	their lives, peck each other's eyes
	out almost during the honeymoon.  I
	did not escape the common lot.  In
	our journey westwards, my Lady
	Cosgrove chose to quarrel with me
	because I had pulled out a pipe of
	tobacco.  Lady Cosgrove was a
	haughty woman, and I hate pride, and
	I promise you that, in this instant,
	I overcame this vice in her.

Roderick blows smoke into the Countess' face.  She is
shocked into an apprehensive silence.

INT.  COACH - DAY

Young Lord Brookside with his governor, glowering and
petulant.  A parrot, in a cage, on his lap.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

As the carriages drive past, there is a band, floral
arches, flags, church bells ringing.  The parson and the
farmers assemble in their best by the roadside, and the
school-children and the laboring people are loud in their
"hurrahs" for her ladyship.

Roderick flings pennies among the cheering tenants, from
two bags of coppers, stored in the carriage for the
occasion.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Fifty, or so, servants have turned out to greet their
mistress, and their new master.  The land steward, who is
the senior servant, introduces the others -- the clerk of
the kitchen, clerk of the stables, head gardener, ladies
in waiting, butler, valet, chef, cook.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had not arrived at the pitch of
	prosperity, and having, at thirty
	years of age, by my own merits and
	energy, raised myself to one of the
	highest social positions that any
	man in England could occupy, I
	determined to enjoy myself as
	becomes a man of quality for the
	remainder of my life.

INT.  STABLES - DAY

Roderick and his beautiful horses.

EXT.  A STREAM - DAY

Roderick and some companions fishing.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and his friends riding.

EXT.  FIELDS - DAY

Roderick and friends shooting.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick having his portrait painted by a miniaturist.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But it was not meant for me to
	finish my life as a man of quality
	and position.  Indeed, I am one of
	those born clever enough at gaining
	a fortune, but incapable of keeping
	one; for the qualities and energy,
	which lead a man to accept the
	first, are often the very causes of
	his ruin in the latter case; indeed,
	I know of no other reason for the
	misfortunes which finally befell me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At the end of the year, Lady
	Cosgrove presented me with a son;
	Patrick Cosgrove, I called him, in
	compliment to my royal ancestry, but
	what more had I to leave him than a
	noble name?

EXT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Two coaches pull up, and the Countess and Roderick exit.
Servants remove their luggage and baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We spent the season in London at our
	house in Berkeley Square.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The Countess alone and depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship and I lived, for a
	while, pretty separate when in
	London.  She preferred quiet, or, to
	say the truth, I preferred it, being
	a great friend to a modest, tranquil
	behavior in woman and a taste for
	the domestic pleasures.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Several cuts of the Countess, caring for the infant,
Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Besides, she was a mother, and had
	great comfort in the dressing,
	educating, and dandling of our
	little Patrick for whose sake it was
	fit that she should give up the
	pleasures and frivolities of the
	world; so she left that part of the
	duty of every family of distinction
	to be performed by me.

INT.  THEATER LOBBY - NIGHT

Roderick arriving with a party of friends, escorting a
beautiful woman.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - DAY

Countess crying and having an argument with Roderick.
Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her ladyship's conversations with me
	were characterized by a stupid
	despair, or a silly blundering
	attempt at forced cheerfulness,
	still more disagreeable; hence, our
	intercourse was but trifling, and my
	temptations to carry her into the
	world or to remain in her society of
	necessity exceedingly small.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - LONDON - NIGHT

A drunken Roderick rudely demands his lady to entertain
their guests.  She rushes from the room in tears.
Dialogue starts scene, goes under for voice over, then
ends scene.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She would try my temper, at home,
	too, in a thousand ways.  When
	requested by me to entertain the
	company with conversation, wit, and
	learning, of which she was a
	mistress; or music, of which she was
	an accomplished performer, she
	would, as often as not, begin to
	cry, and leave the room.  My company
	from this, of course, fancied I was
	a tyrant over her; whereas, I was
	only a severe and careful guardian
	of a silly, bad-tempered and weak-
	minded lady.

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Roderick strolling arm-in-arm with his Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Despite the utter distaste with
	which I now regarded Lady Cosgrove,
	and, although I took no particular
	pains to disguise my feelings in
	general, yet she was of such a mean
	spirit that she pursued me with her
	regard, and would kindle up at the
	smallest kind word I spoke to her.

INT.  COSGROVE STUDY - DAY

Roderick and accountant.  Her ladyship is signing various
documents, and orders for payment.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, in these fits of love, she was
	the most easy creature in the world
	to be persuaded, and would have
	signed away her whole property, had
	it been possible.  And, I must
	confess, it was with very little
	attention on my part that I could
	bring her into good humor, and, up
	to the very last day of our being
	together, would be reconciled to me,
	and fondle me, if I addressed her a
	single kind word.  Such is female
	inconsistency.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess fighting about her refusal to
sign some papers.  Live dialogue under voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was luckily very fond of her
	youngest son, and through him I had
	a wholesome and effectual hold on
	her; for if in any of her tantrums
	or fits of haughtiness, she
	pretended to have the upper-hand, to
	assert her authority against mine,
	to refuse to sign such papers as I
	might think necessary for the
	distribution of our large and
	complicated property.

Roderick picks up baby Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I would have Master Patrick carried
	off to Chiswick for a couple of
	days; and I warrant me his lady-
	mother could hold out no longer and
	would agree to anything I proposed.

The Countess rushes to the window to see the child being
put into a carriage.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Another quarrel.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove and I did not quarrel
	more than fashionable people do, and,
	for the first three years, I never
	struck my wife but when I was in
	liquor.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick throws a knife at young Brookside.  The knife
digs into an expensive antique chest, just missing the
young Brookside's head.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When I flung the carving-knife at
	Brookside, I was drunk, as
	everybody present can testify, but
	as for having any systematic scheme
	against the poor lad, I can declare
	solemnly that, beyond merely hating
	him, I am guilty of no evil towards
	him.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - DAY

The Countess discovers Roderick making love to the child's
nurse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Do what one would to please her, my
	lady would never be happy or in good
	humor.  And soon she added a mean,
	detestable jealousy to all her other
	faults, and would weep and wring her
	hands, and threaten to commit
	suicide, and I know not what.

She screams and shouts something about suicide.

Her son, Brookside, comes running in and consoles her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Her death would have been no comfort
	to me, as I leave any person of
	common prudence to imagine; for that
	scoundrel of a young Brookside who
	was about to become my greatest
	plague and annoyance, would have
	inherited every penny of the
	property.

INT.  COSGROVE HOUSE - LONDON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick, bored and distracted, sits before a stack of
bills and papers, with his accountant.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Humble people envy us great men, and
	fancy that our lives are all
	pleasure.  But the troubles of
	poverty, the rascality of agents,
	the quibbles of lawyers are endless.
	My life at this period seemed to
	consist of nothing but drafts of
	letters and money-brokers relative
	to the raising of money, and the
	insuring of Lady Cosgrove's life,
	and innumerable correspondence with
	upholsterers, decorators, cooks,
	horsekeepers, bailiffs, and
	stewards.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Various cuts.

Birthday fete for Patrick who is now five years old.

Gaily colored tents, ponies, a puppet show, expensive
presents.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My own dear boy, Patrick, was now
	five years old, and was the most
	polite and engaging child ever seen;
	it was a pleasure to treat him with
	kindness and distinction; the little
	fellow was the pink of fashion,
	beauty, and good breeding.  In fact,
	he could not have been otherwise,
	with the care both his parents
	bestowed upon him, and the
	attentions which were lavished upon
	him in every way.

Brookside and Roderick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Whereas, young Brookside had grown
	to be a very nasty and disrespectful
	fellow indeed.  In my company, he
	preserved the most rigid silence,
	and a haughty, scornful demeanor,
	which was so much the more
	disagreeable because there was
	nothing in his behavior I could
	actually take hold of to find fault
	with, although his whole conduct was
	insolent and supercilious to the
	highest degree.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LIBRARY - DAY

Brookside sitting alone reading a book.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In addition to this, the lad was
	fond of spending the chief part of
	his time occupied with the musty old
	books, which he took out of the
	library, and which I hate to see a
	young man of spirit pouring over.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Brookside and the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The insubordination of that boy was
	dreadful.  He used to quote passages
	of "Hamlet" to his mother, which
	made her very angry.

Brookside quoting "Hamlet."

The Countess begins to cry and leaves the room.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY

Roderick caning young Brookside.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	As it is best to nip vice in the
	bud, and for a master of a family to
	exercise his authority in such a
	manner as that there may be no
	question about it, I took every
	opportunity of coming to close
	quarters with Master Brookside.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Many guests around the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	He always chose the days when
	company, or the clergy, or gentry of
	the neighborhood were present, to
	make violent, sarcastic, and
	insolent speeches.

Brookside begins to fondle and caress Patrick.

			BROOKSIDE
	Dear child, what a pity it is I am
	not dead for your sake!  The
	Cosgroves would then have a worthy
	representative, and enjoy all the
	benefits of the illustrious blood of
	the James' of Duganstown, would they
	not, Mr. James Cosgrove?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick caning Brookside again.  The boy bears the
punishment without crying.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick's reunion with his mother.

Present are the Countess, Patrick, Lord Brookside and
others.

Mrs. James flings herself into her son's arms with a
scream, and with transports of joy, which can only be
comprehended by women who have held, in their arms, an
only child, after a twelve-year absence from him.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and mother feeding Patrick.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and mother playing with Patrick in the garden.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Mother at dinner with the family, in a strained
atmosphere.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother talk in whispers near the bed of
the sleeping Patrick.

			MOTHER
	Ah, Roderick, it's a blessing to see
	that my darling boy has attained a
	position I always knew was his due,
	and for which I pinched myself to
	educate him.  Little Patrick is a
	darling boy, and you live in great
	splendor, but how long will it last?
	Your lady-wife knows she has a
	treasure she couldn't have had, had
	she taken a duke to marry her, but
	if, one day, she should tire of my
	wild Roderick and his old-fashioned
	Irish ways, or if she should die,
	what future would there be for my
	son and grandson?

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	You have not a penny of your own,
	and cannot transact any business
	without the Countess' signature.
	Upon her death, the entire estate
	would go to young Brookside, who
	bears you little affection.  You
	could be penniless tomorrow, and
	darling Patrick at the mercy of his
	stepbrother.

INT.  MOTHER'S ROOM - CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	I shall tell you a secret -- I shall
	not rest until I see you Earl of
	Duganstown, and my grandson, a Lord
	Viscount.

She smooths down Roderick's hair.

			MOTHER
	This head would become a coronet.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and Mother slowly walking and talking.  Young
Patrick, ahead of them sitting in a small cart, pulled by
a lamb.

			MOTHER
	These things entail considerable
	expense, and you will need your
	lady's blessing, but the young boy
	forms the great bond of union
	between you and her ladyship, and
	there is no plan of ambition you
	could propose in which she would not
	join for the poor lad's benefit, and
	no expense she will not eagerly
	incur, if it might be any means be
	shown to tend to his advancement.
	You have important friends, and they
	can tell you how these things are
	done.

INT.  LONDON GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Standing away from the play tables, Roderick chats with
Lord West, a fat giant of a man.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And, to be sure, I did know someone
	who knew precisely how these things
	were done, and this was the
	distinguished solicitor and former
	Government Minister, Lord West,
	whose acquaintance I made, as I had
	so many others, at the gaming table.

			LORD WEST
	Do you happen to know Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs?

			RODERICK
	By name only.

			LORD WEST
	Well, sir, this nobleman is one of
	the gentlemen of His Majesty's
	closet, and one with whom our
	revered monarch is on terms of
	considerable intimacy.  I should say
	you would be wise to fix upon this
	nobleman your chief reliance for the
	advancement of your claim to the
	Viscounty which you propose to get.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - DAY

Roderick having lunch with Lord West and the Earl of
Crabs.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And for a five-hundred guinea fee,
	paid to his City law-firm, Lord West
	kindly arranged a meeting with that
	old scamp and swindler, Gustavus
	Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of
	Crabs.

			EARL OF CRABS
	Mr. Cosgrove, when I take up a
	person, he or she is safe.  There is
	no question about them any more.  My
	friends are the best people.  I
	don't mean the most virtuous, or,
	indeed, the least virtuous, or the
	cleverest, or the stupidest, or the
	richest, or the best born, but the
	"best" -- in a word, people about
	whom there is no question.  I cannot
	promise you how long it will take.
	You can appreciate it is not an easy
	matter.  But any gentlemen with an
	estate, and ten-thousand a-year
	should have a peerage.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - EARL OF CRABS - DAY

Roderick being introduced to three noblemen, including the
Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The striving after this peerage, I
	consider to have been one of the
	most unlucky dealings at this
	period.  I made unheard of
	sacrifices to bring it about.  I can
	tell you bribes were administered,
	and in high places too -- so near
	the royal person of His Majesty that
	you would be astonished were I to
	mention what great personages
	condescended to receive our loans.

INT.  DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick gives a beautiful diamond to a fat princess on
her birthday.  He is applauded by the other guests.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lavished money here, and diamonds
	there.

EXT.  FARMLAND - DAY

Roderick and the seller, riding over a prospective
property.  A broker shows them a survey map of the
property.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I bought lands at ten times there
	value.

INT.  SALON - LONDON - NIGHT

A musical evening.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I gave repeated entertainments to
	those friends to my claims who,
	being about the royal person, were
	likely to advance it.

INT.  STATELY HOME - DAY

Roderick buying pictures.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I purchased pictures and articles of
	vertu at ruinous prices.

EXT.  RACES - DAY

Roderick laughing and paying a bet.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I lost many a bet to the royal
	dukes, His Majesty's brothers.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Reviewing the company of troops.

Roderick, the Earl of Crabs, the Countess, Patrick and
Brookside, several princes and noblemen and the Duke of
Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	One of the main causes of expense
	which this ambition of mine entailed
	upon me was the fitting out and
	arming of a company of infantry from
	the Hackton estates, which I offered
	to my gracious sovereign for the
	campaign against the American
	rebels.  These troops, superbly
	equipped and clothed, were embarked
	at Portsmouth in the year 1778.

INT.  ST. JAMES - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

George III meeting people and stopping to talk to
Roderick.  Present also is the Duke of Rutland.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And the patriotism of the gentlemen
	who raised them was so acceptable at
	court that, on being presented by my
	Lord Crabs, His Majesty condescended
	to notice me particularly and said:

			GEORGE III
	That's right, Mr. Cosgrove, raise
	another company, and go with them,
	too!

INT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Crabs was really one of the most
	entertaining fellows in the world,
	and I took a sincere pleasure in his
	company, besides the interest and
	desire I had in cultivating the
	society of the most important
	personages of the realm.

Roderick clumsily tries to engage in conversation with the
famed Dr. Johnson, on the subject of a book or play, of
the day, and is rebuffed for his trouble.

			JOHNSON
	If I were you, Mr. Cosgrove, I
	should mind my horses and tailors
	and not trouble myself about
	letters.

Laughter, Roderick bristles.

			RODERICK
	Dr. Johnson, I think you misbehave
	most grossly, treating my opinions
	with no more respect than those of a
	schoolboy.  You fancy, sir, you know
	a great deal more than me, because
	you quote your "Aristotle" and
	"Plato," but can you tell me which
	horse will win at Epsom Downs next
	week?  Can you shoot the ace of
	spades ten times without missing?
	If so, talk about Aristotle and
	Plato with me.

			BOSWELL
		   (roars)
	Do you know who you're speaking to?!

			JOHNSON
	Hold your tongue, Mr. Boswell, I had
	no right to brag of my Greek,
	gentlemen, and he has answered me
	very well.

			RODERICK
		   (pleased)
	Do you know ever a rhyme for
	Aristotle?

			GOLDSMITH
		   (laughing)
	Port, if you please.

			JOHNSON
	Waiter, bring on of Captain James'
	rhymes for Aristotle.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	And we had six rhymes for Aristotle
	before we left the coffee house that
	evening.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

			EARL OF CRABS
	Henri, this is Mr. James Cosgrove,
	who wishes to arrange a dinner party
	next week for sixty guests.

			HENRI
	I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove.
	How much do you wish to spend?

			RODERICK
	As much as possible.

			HENRI
	As much as possible?

			RODERICK
	Yes, for I wish to entertain
	splendidly.

			HENRI
	All the same, you must name an
	amount.

			RODERICK
	It is entirely up to you.  I want
	the best.

			EARL OF CRABS
	May I suggest five hundred guineas?

			RODERICK
	Will that be enough?

			HENRI
	Last month, the Duke of Suffolk
	spent no more.

			RODERICK
	All right, five hundred guineas.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick is seated at a large table, stacked high with
bills and letters; his accountant is seated next to him,
aided by a bookkeeper.  Roderick looks at each bill and
his accountant explains the charge.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The life I was leading was that of a
	happy man, but I was not happy.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - LONG GALLERY - DAY

Roderick, walking with big strides, leads Brookside by his
ear.  Little Patrick runs alongside, pleading for his
brother.

			PATRICK
	Papa, please don't flog Brookside
	today.  It wasn't his fault --
	really is wasn't.

Roderick ignores him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, young Brookside was of so
	wild, savage, and insubordinate a
	nature that I never had the least
	regard for him.  As he grew up to be
	a man, his hatred for me assumed an
	intensity quite wicked to think of
	and which, I promise you, I returned
	with interest.

He drags Brookside into his study, slamming the door
behind him.

INT.  LIBRARY - DAY

Roderick alone.  Brookside enters with a pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (grinding his teeth)
	Look you now, Mister Roderick James,
	from this moment on, I will submit
	to no further chastisement from you!
	Do you understand that?

			RODERICK
	Give me that pistol.

			BROOKSIDE
	Take heed, Mister James.  I will
	shoot you if you lay hands on me
	now, or ever again.  Is that
	entirely clear to you, sir?

Roderick stares hard at him, then he laughs and sits down.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I decided, at once, to give up that
	necessary part of his education.
	In truth, he then became the most
	violent, daring, disobedient,
	scapegrace, that ever caused an
	affectionate parent pain; he was
	certainly the most incorrigible.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BROOKSIDE'S ROOM - DAY

Brookside smashing a chair over the head of his governor,
Reverend Hunt.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Twice or thrice, Reverend Hunt
	attempted to punish my Lord
	Brookside; but I promise you the
	rogue was too strong for him, and
	leveled the Oxford man to the
	ground with a chair, greatly to the
	delight of little Patrick, who cried
	out:  "Bravo, Brooksy!  Thump him,
	thump him!"

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Brookside and Patrick.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	With the child, Brookside was,
	strange to say, pretty tractable.
	He took a liking to the little
	fellow -- I like him the more, he
	said, because he was "half a
	Cosgrove."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - BALLROOM - NIGHT

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Another day, it was Patrick's
	birthday, we were giving a grand
	ball and gala at Hackton, and it was
	time for my Patrick to make his
	appearance among us.

There is a great crowding and tittering as the child comes
in, led by his half-brother, who walks into the dancing-
room in his stockinged feet, leading little Patrick by the
hand, paddling about in the great shoes of the older.

			BROOKSIDE
		   (very loudly)
	Don't you think he fits my shoes
	very well, Sir Richard Wargrave?

Upon which, the company begins to look at each other and
to titter, and his mother comes up to Lord Brookside with
great dignity, seizes the child to her breast, and says:

			COUNTESS
	From the manner in which I love this
	child, my lord, you ought to know
	how I would have loved his elder
	brother, had he proved worthy of any
	mother's affection.

Brookside is stunned by his mother's words.

			BROOKSIDE
	Madam, I have borne as long as
	mortal could endure the ill-
	treatment of the insolent Irish
	upstart, whom you have taken into
	your bed.  It is not only the
	lowness of his birth, and the
	general brutality of his manners
	which disgusts me, but the shameful
	nature of his conduct towards your
	ladyship, his brutal and
	ungentlemanlike behavior, his open
	infidelity, his habits of
	extravagance, intoxication, his
	shameless robberies and swindling of
	my property and yours.  It is these
	insults to you which shock and annoy
	me more than the ruffian's infamous
	conduct to myself.  I would have
	stood by your ladyship, as I
	promised, but you seem to have taken
	latterly your husband's part; and,
	as I cannot personally chastise this
	low-bred ruffian, who, to our shame
	be it spoken, is the husband of my
	mother, and as I cannot bear to
	witness his treatment of you, and
	loathe his horrible society as if it
	were the plague, I am determined to
	quit my native country, at least
	during his detested life, or during
	my own.

Bursting into tears, Lady Cosgrove leaves the room.
Roderick loses control, and rushes at Brookside, knocking
down Lords, Dukes and Generals, left and right, who try to
interfere.

The company is scandalizes by the entire incident.

INT.  LONDON CLUB - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.  Roderick is shunned.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If I had murdered my lord, I could
	scarcely have been received with
	more shameful obloquy and slander
	than now followed me in town and
	country.  My friends fell away from
	me, and a legend arose of my cruelty
	to my stepson.

INT.  ST. JAMES - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My reception at court was scarcely
	more cordial.  On paying my respects
	to my sovereign at St. James, His
	Majesty pointedly asked me when I
	had news of Lord Brookside.  On
	which I replied, with no ordinary
	presence of mind:

			RODERICK
	Sire, my Lord Brookside has set sail
	to fight the rebels against Your
	Majesty's crown in America.  Does
	Your Majesty desire that I should
	send another company to aid him?

The King stares at Roderick, turns on his heel and quickly
leaves the presence-chamber.

Roderick is approached by the Duke of Rutland, who takes
him aside into an alcove.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
		   (speaking very
		    quietly)
	Let me tell you, sir, that your
	conduct has been very odiously
	represented to the King, and has
	formed the subject of royal comment.
	The King has said, influenced by
	these representations, that you are
	the most disreputable man in the
	three kingdoms, and a dishonor to
	your name and country.

Roderick begins to sputter.

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	Hear me out, please.  It has been
	intimated to His Majesty that you
	had raised the American Company for
	the sole purpose of getting the
	young Viscount to command it, and so
	get rid of him.  And, further, that
	you had paid the very man in the
	company, who was ordered to dispatch
	him in the first general action.

			RODERICK
	Thus it is that my loyalty is
	rewarded, and my sacrifices in favor
	of my country viewed!

			DUKE OF RUTLAND
	As for your ambitious hopes
	regarding the Irish peerages, His
	Majesty has also let it be known
	that you have been led astray by
	that Lord Crabs, who likes to take
	money, but who has no more influence
	to get a coronet than to procure a
	Pope's tiara.  And, if you have it
	in mind to call upon Lord Crabs, you
	will be disappointed.  He left for
	the continent on Tuesday, and may be
	away for several months.

INT.  LORD WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

Roderick and Lord West.

			RODERICK
	I insist upon being allowed to
	appear before His Majesty and clear
	myself of the imputations against
	me, to point out my services to the
	government, and to ask when the
	reward, that had been promised me,
	the title held by my ancestors, is
	again to be revived in my person.

There is a sleepy coolness in the fat Lord West.  He hears
Roderick with half-shut eyes.  When he finishes his
violent speech, which he has made striding about the room,
Lord West opens one eye, smiles, and says:   

			LORD WEST
		   (gently)
	Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?

			RODERICK
	Yes!

			LORD WEST
	Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you
	point by point.  The King is
	exceedingly averse to make peers, as
	you know.  Your claim, as you call
	them, have been laid before him, and
	His Majesty's gracious reply was,
	that you were the most impudent man
	in his dominions, and merited a
	halter, rather than a coronet.  As
	for withdrawing your support from
	us, you are perfectly welcome to
	carry yourself whithersoever you
	please.  And, now, as I have a great
	deal of occupation, perhaps you will
	do me the favor to retire, or tell
	me if there is anything else in the
	world in which I can oblige you.

So saying, Lord West raises his hand lazily to the bell,
and bows Roderick out.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant going over the bills which he
has heaped on the table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The news of His Majesty's disregard
	were not long in getting around,
	and, in a very short time, all the
	bills came down upon me together --
	all the bills I had been contracting
	for the years of my marriage.  I
	won't cite their amount; it was
	frightful.  I was bound up in an
	inextricable toil of bills and
	debts, or mortgages and insurances,
	and all the horrible evils attendant
	upon them.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GROUNDS - DAY

Roderick walking alone.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Was it my own want of style, or my
	want of a fortune?  I know not.  Now
	I was arrived at the height of my
	ambition, but both my skill and my
	luck seemed to be deserting me.
	Everything I touched, crumbled in my
	hands; every speculation I had,
	failed; every agent I trusted,
	deceived me.  My income was saddled
	with hundreds of annuities, and
	thousands of lawyers' charges, and I
	felt the net drawing closer and
	closer around me, and no means to
	extricate myself from its toils.
	All my schemes had turned out
	failures.

INT.  LONDON GAMING CLUB - NIGHT

Roderick at the gaming table.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My wife's moody despondency made my
	house and home not over-pleasant;
	hence, I was driven a good deal
	abroad, where as play was the
	fashion in every club, tavern, and
	assembly, I, of course, was obliged
	to resume my old habit, and to
	commence as an amateur those games
	at which I was once unrivaled in
	Europe.

Roderick loses a large amount of money.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had a run of ill-luck at play, and
	was forced to meet my losses by the
	most shameful sacrifices to the
	money-lenders, and was compelled to
	borrow largely upon my wife's
	annuities, ensuring her ladyship's
	life, which was the condition for
	every loan against her property.

INT.  LONDON OFFICE - INSURANCE BROKER - DAY

Roderick and the broker.

			BROKER
	Your wife's life is as well known
	among the insurance societies in
	London, as any woman in Christendom,
	and, I'm sorry to say there is not
	one of them willing to place another
	policy against her ladyship's life.
	One of them even had the impudence
	to suggest that your treatment of
	the Countess did not render her life
	worth a year's purchase.

EXT.  STUD FARM - DAY

Roderick buying a horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	In the midst of my difficulties, I
	promised to buy a little horse for
	my dear little Patrick, which was to
	be a present for his eighth
	birthday, that was now coming on.  I
	may have had my faults, but no man
	shall dare to say of me that I was
	not a good and tender father.

Roderick admires the horse.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was a beautiful little animal,
	and stood me in a good sum.  I never
	regarded money for that dear child.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

The horse kicks off one of the horse-boys who tries to
ride him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But the horse was a bit wild, and he
	kicked off one of the horse-boys who
	rode him at first, and broke the
	lad's leg.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick riding the horse.  The horse-boy lies in the back
of a wagon.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	But he was a beautiful animal and
	would make a fine horse for Patrick
	after he had a bit of breaking-in.

EXT.  ROAD - NEAR CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick dismounts and gives the horse to one of the
horse-boys.

			RODERICK
	Timmy, take the injured lad to see
	the doctor, and then bring the horse
	to Doolan's farm, and tell him to
	break him in thoroughly.  Tell him
	it's for little Patrick, and that
	I'll be over to see him next week.

			HORSE-BOY
	Yes, sir.

			RODERICK
	One more thing, and listen well, I
	don't want little Patrick to know
	where the horse is being kept.  It's
	going to be surprise for his
	birthday.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Patrick rushes out to greet his father.

			PATRICK
	Hello, papa!

Roderick picks him up in his arms, and kisses him.

			PATRICK
	Did you buy the horse, papa?

			RODERICK
	Now, just have a little patience, my
	boy.  Your birthday isn't until next
	week.

			PATRICK
	But I will have it on my birthday,
	won't I?

			RODERICK
	Well, we'll just have to wait and
	see, won't we?

He walks up the steps holding Patrick, who hugs and kisses
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My son, little Patrick Cosgrove, was
	a prince; his breeding and manners,
	even at his early age, showed him to
	be worthy of the two noble families
	from whom he was descended, and I
	don't know what high hopes I had for
	the boy, and indulged in a thousand
	fond anticipations as to his future
	success and figure in the world, but
	stern Fate had determined that I
	should leave none of my race behind
	me.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick is drunk.  Patrick is brought in by his governor,
Hunt, to say good night.  His kisses his mother first,
then approaches Roderick.

			PATRICK
		   (kissing him)
	Good night, papa.

			RODERICK
	Good night, my little darling.

			PATRICK
	Papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			PATRICK
	One of the boys in the stable told
	Nelly that you've already bought my
	horse, and that it's at Doolan's
	farm, where Mick the groom is
	breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?

			RODERICK
		   (angered)
	What the devil?  What kind of fools
	do we have here?  Pottle, who told
	the lad this story?

			HUNT
	I don't know, sir.

			PATRICK
	Then it's true!  It's true!  Oh,
	thank you, papa!  Thank you!

He hugs his father.

			COUNTESS
	Promise me, Patrick, that you will
	not ride the horse except in the
	company of your father.

			PATRICK
		   (unconvincingly)
	I promise, mama.

			RODERICK
	I promise your lordship a good
	flogging if you even so much as go
	to Doolan's farm to see him.

			PATRICK
	Yes, papa.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is awakened by his valet and Hunt, the governor.

			RODERICK
	Yes...?

			VALET
	I'm sorry to disturb you, sir, but
	Mr. Hunt has something important to
	tell you.

			RODERICK
	Yes?

			HUNT
	I think Master Patrick has disobeyed
	your orders and stolen off to
	Doolan's farm.  When I went to the
	lad's room this morning, his bed was
	empty.  One of the cooks said she
	saw him go away before daybreak.  He
	must have slipped through my room
	while I was asleep.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLES - DAY

Roderick, in a rage, taking a great horse-whip, gallops
off after the child.

EXT.  ROAD - CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick comes upon a sad procession of farmers, moaning
and howling, the black horse led by the hand, and, on a
door that some of them carry, little Patrick.  He lies in
his little boots and spurs, and his little coat of scarlet
and gold.  His face is quite white, and he smiles as he
holds a hand out to Roderick and says painfully:

			PATRICK
	You won't whip me, will you, papa?

Roderick bursts out into tears in reply.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Some doctors around the bed, Roderick and the Countess
anxiously waiting upon them.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The doctors were called, but what
	does a doctor avail in a contest
	with the grim, invincible enemy?
	Such as came could only confirm our
	despair by their account of the poor
	child's case.  His spine was
	injured, the lower half of him was
	dead when they laid him in bed at
	home.  The rest did not last long,
	God help me!  He remained yet for
	two days with us, and a sad comfort
	it was to think he was in no pain.

INT.  PATRICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick, Countess and Patrick.

			PATRICK
		   (weakly)
	Papa, I beg you and mama to pardon
	me for any acts of disobedience I
	have been guilty of towards you.

			COUNTESS
		   (weeping)
	Oh, my little angel, you have done
	nothing for which you need pardon.

			PATRICK
	Where is Brooksy?  I would like to
	see him.

			RODERICK
	Your bother is in America fighting
	the rebels.

			PATRICK
	Is he all right, papa?

			RODERICK
	Yes, he's fine.

			PATRICK
	Brooksy was better than you, papa,
	he used not to swear so, and he
	taught me many good things while you
	were away.

Patrick takes a hand of his mother and of Roderick, in
each of his little clammy ones.

			PATRICK
	I beg you not to quarrel so, but to
	love each other, so that we might
	meet again in heaven where Brooksy
	told me quarrelsome people never go.

His mother is much affected by these admonitions, and
Roderick is too.

Patrick gives Roderick a ring from his finger, and a
locket to his mother.

He says that these gifts are so that they will not forget
him.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	At last, after two days, he died.
	There he lay, the hope of my family,
	the pride of my manhood, the link
	which kept me and my Lady Cosgrove
	together.

EXT.  CHURCH - GRAVEYARD - DAY

Funeral.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I won't tell you with what splendor
	we buried him, but what avail are
	undertakers' feathers and heralds'
	trumpery.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STABLE - DAY

Roderick enters the stable and, after a few seconds, we
hear a pistol shot.  He exits rapidly, the smoking pistol
still in his hand.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

The Countess:  Praying.  Waking up screaming.  Fits of
crying.  Severely depressed.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Lady Cosgrove, always vaporish and
	nervous, after our blessed boy's
	catastrophe, became more agitated
	than ever, and plunged into devotion
	with so much fervor that you would
	have fancied her almost distracted
	at times.

Countess sees visions.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She imagined she saw visions.  She
	said an angel from heaven told her
	that Patrick's death was a
	punishment to her for her neglect of
	her firstborn.  Then she would
	declare that Brookside was dead.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and his accountant.  Bills, bills, bills.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	By now, my financial affairs were
	near to ruin.  I could not get a
	guinea from any money-dealer in
	London.  Our rents were in the hands
	of receivers by this time, and it
	was as much as I could do to get
	enough money from the rascals to pay
	my wine-merchants their bills.  Our
	property was hampered, and often as
	I applied to my lawyers and agents
	for money, would come a reply
	demanding money of me for debts and
	pretended claims which the rapacious
	rascals said they had on me.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother arrives.  Roderick greets her.  Servants unload her
bags.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother was the only person who,
	in my misfortune, remained faithful
	to me -- indeed, she has always
	spoken of me in my true light, as a
	martyr to the rascality of others,
	and a victim of my own generous and
	confiding temper.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Mother supervising kitchen staff.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She was an invaluable person to me
	in my house, which would have been
	at rack and ruin before, but for her
	spirit of order and management and
	her excellent economy in the
	government of my rapidly dwindling
	household staff.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDEN - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	If anything could have saved me from
	the consequences of villainy in
	others, it would have been the
	admirable prudence of that worthy
	creature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Action as per voice over.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	She never went to bed until all the
	house was quiet and all the candles
	out; you may fancy that this was a
	matter of some difficulty with a man
	of my habits who had commonly a
	dozen of jovial fellows to drink
	with me every night, and who
	seldom, for my part, went to bed
	sober.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Many and many a night, when I was
	unconscious of her attention, has
	that good soul pulled my boots off,
	and seen me laid by my servants snug
	in bed, and carried off the candle
	herself...

	... and been the first in the
	morning, too, to bring me my drink
	of small beer.  It was my mother's
	pride that I could drink more than
	any man in the country.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother holding a letter before a fire,
which slowly brings out the writing in lemon juice between
the widely-spaced lines of directions to her milliner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My mother discovered that always,
	before my lady-wife chose to write
	letters to her milliner, she had
	need of lemons to make her drink, as
	she said, and this fact, being
	mentioned to me, kind of set me
	a-thinking.

			RODERICK
		   (reading letter
		    aloud)
	"This day, three years ago, my last
	hope and pleasure in life was taken
	from me, and my dear child was
	called to Heaven.  Where is his
	neglected brother, whom I suffered
	to grow up unheeded by my side, and
	whom the tyranny of the monster to
	whom I am united drove to exile,
	and, perhaps to death?  I pray the
	child is still alive and safe.
	Charles Brookside!  Come to the aide
	of a wretched mother, who
	acknowledges her crime, her coldness
	towards you, and now bitterly pays
	for her error!  What sufferings,
	what humiliations have I had to
	endure!  I am a prisoner in my own
	halls.  I should fear poison, but
	then I know the wretch has a sordid
	interest in keeping me alive, and
	that my death would be the signal
	for his ruin.  But I dare not stir
	without my odious, hideous, vulgar
	gaoler, the horrid Irish woman, who
	purses my every step.  I am locked
	into my chamber at night, like a
	felon, and only suffered to leave it
	when ordered into the presence of my
	lord, to be present at his orgies
	with his boon-companions, and to
	hear his odious converse as he
	lapses into the disgusting madness
	of intoxication."

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick, and the Countess and mother, at a silent dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	It was not possible to recover the
	name for whom the note was intended,
	but it was clear that, to add to all
	my perplexities, three years after
	my poor child's death, my wife,
	whose vagaries of temper and wayward
	follies I had borne with for twelve
	years, wanted to leave me.  I
	decided it best not to reveal to her
	ladyship our discovery, that we
	might still intercept and uncover
	further schemes with might be afoot.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - VARIOUS - DAY AND NIGHT

A few cuts showing Mother keeping an eye on the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	Yet I was bound to be on my guard
	that she should not give me the
	slip.  Had she left me, I was ruined
	the next day.  I set my mother to
	keep sharp watch over the moods of
	her ladyship, and you may be sure
	that her assistance and surveillance
	were invaluable to me.  If I had
	paid twenty spies to watch her lady,
	I should not have been half so well
	served as by the disinterested care
	and watchfulness of my excellent
	mother.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - GARDENS - DAY

Roderick walking with the Countess.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with
	me was a singular one.  Her life was
	passed in a series of crack-brained
	sort of alternation between love and
	hatred for me.  We would quarrel for
	a fortnight, then we should be
	friends for a month together
	sometimes.  One day, I was joking
	her, and asking her whether she
	would take the water again, whether
	she had found another lover, and so
	forth.  She suddenly burst out into
	tears, and, after a while, said to
	me:

			COUNTESS
	Roderick, you know well enough that
	I have never loved but you!  Was I
	ever so wretched that a kind word
	from you did not make me happy?
	Ever so angry, but the least offer
	of good-will on your part did not
	bring me to your side?  Did I not
	give a sufficient proof of my
	affection for you in bestowing one
	of the finest fortunes of England
	upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked
	you for the way you have wasted it?
	No, I loved you too much and too
	fondly; I have always loved you.
	From the first moment I saw you, I
	saw your bad qualities, and trembled
	at your violence; but I could not
	help loving you.  I married you,
	though I knew I was sealing my own
	fate in doing so, and in spite of
	reason and duty.  What sacrifice do
	you want from me?  I am ready to
	make any, so you will but love me,
	or, if not, that at least, you will
	gently us me.

Roderick kisses her.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was in a particularly good humor
	that day, and we had a sort of
	reconciliation.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - NIGHT

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, artful hussy has some
	other scheme in her head now.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	The old lady was right, and I
	swallowed the bait which her
	ladyship had prepared to entrap me
	as simply as any gudgeon takes a
	hook.

EXT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Arrival of Mr. Newcombe, the money-broker.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I had hired a money-broker
	especially to find some means of my
	making a loan.  After several months
	without success, it was with some
	considerable interest that I
	received his visit.

INT.  RODERICK'S STUDY - DAY

Roderick and the money-broker, Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	I have good news for you, Mr.
	Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle
	and Chatwick, in the city of London,
	are prepared to lend you 20,000
	pounds, pledged against your
	interest in the Edric mines.  They
	will redeem the encumbrances against
	the property, which amount to some
	10,000 pounds, and take a twenty-
	year working lease on the mines.
	They will lend you the 20,000 pounds
	against the lease income,
	which they will apply to the loan as
	it comes in, and they will make a
	charge of 18% per annum interest on
	the outstanding loan balance.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Newcombe, I have made some
	difficult loans during the past few
	years, at very onerous terms, but
	18% a year interest seems very stiff
	indeed.

			NEWCOMBE
	Considering your financial
	circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has
	been impossible to find anyone at
	all prepared to do any business with
	you.  I think you may count yourself
	lucky to have this opportunity.
	But, obviously, if you would reject
	this offer, I shall keep trying to
	find a better one.

			RODERICK
		   (after a pause)
	I am prepared to accept the terms,
	Mr. Newcombe.

			NEWCOMBE
	There are a few other points we
	should discuss.  The loan agreement
	can only be executed by her
	ladyship's signature, and provided
	that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be
	assured of her ladyship's freewill
	in giving her signature.

			RODERICK
	Provided that they can be assured of
	her ladyship's freewill?  Are you
	serious?

			NEWCOMBE
	May I be quite frank with you?

			RODERICK
	Yes, of course.

			NEWCOMBE
	Mister Bracegirdle said to me that
	he had heard her ladyship lives in
	some fear of her life, and meditated
	a separation, in which case, she
	might later repudiate any documents
	signed by herself while in durance,
	and subject them, at any rate, to a
	doubtful and expensive litigation.
	They were quite insistent on this
	point, and said they must have
	absolute assurance of her ladyship's
	perfect freewill in the transaction
	before they would advance a shilling
	of their capital.

			RODERICK
	I see.

			NEWCOMBE
	When I asked them in what form they
	would accept her ladyship's
	assurances, they said that they were
	only prepared to accept them if her
	ladyship confirms her written
	consent by word of mouth, in their
	presence, at their counting-house in
	Birchin Lane, London.  I requested
	they come here, and save her
	ladyship and yourself the
	inconvenience of the trip to London,
	but they declined, saying that they
	did not wish to incur the risk of a
	visit to Castle Hackton to
	negotiate, as they were aware of how
	other respectable parties, such as
	Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been
	treated here.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.

			MOTHER
	Depend on it, there is some
	artifice.  When once you get into
	that wicked town, you are not safe.
	There are scores of writs out
	against you for debt.  If you are
	taken in London, and thrown into
	prison, your case is hopeless.

			RODERICK
	Mother dear, we are now living off
	our own beef and mutton.  We have to
	watch Lady Cosgrove within and the
	bailiffs without.  There are certain
	situations in which people cannot
	dictate their own terms; and faith,
	we are so pressed now for money,
	that I would sign a bond with old
	Nick himself, if he would provide a
	good round sum.  With this money, we
	can settle our principal debts and
	make a fresh start.

			MOTHER
	Roderick, you must listen to me.  As
	soon as they have you in London,
	they will get the better of my poor
	innocent lad; and the first thing
	that I shall hear of you will be
	that you are in trouble.  You will
	be a victim of your own generous and
	confiding nature.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' BEDROOM

Roderick and the Countess.

			COUNTESS
	Why go, Roderick?  I am happy here,
	as long as you are kind to me, as
	you now are.  We can't appear in
	London as we ought; the little money
	you will get will be spent, like all
	the rest has been.  Let us stay here
	and be content.

She takes his hand and kisses it.

Mother and Roderick.

			MOTHER
	Humph!  I believe she is at the
	bottom of it -- the wicked schemer.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Roderick's carriage moving along.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We did not start in state, you may
	be sure.  We did not let the country
	know we were going, or leave notice
	of adieu with our neighbors.  The
	famous Mr. James Cosgrove and his
	noble wife traveled in a hack-
	chaise and pair.

INT.  COACH - DAY

The Countess lays her head on Roderick's shoulder and
smiles.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	When a man is going to the devil,
	how easy and pleasant a journey it
	is!  The thought of the money quite
	put me in a good humor, and my wife,
	as she lay on my shoulder in the
	post-chaise, going to London, said
	it was the happiest ride she had
	taken since our marriage.

EXT.  INN - DUSK

The carriage stops and they disembark.

	One night we stayed at Reading.

INT.  INN - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife at dinner.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	My lady and I agreed that, with the
	money, we would go to France, and
	wait there for better times, and
	that night, over our supper, formed
	a score of plans both for pleasure
	and retrenchment.  You would have
	thought it was Darby and Joan
	together over their supper.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and his wife making love.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	O woman!  Woman!  When I recollect
	Lady Cosgrove's smiles and
	blandishments, how happy she seemed
	to be on that night!  What an air of
	innocent confidence appeared in her
	behavior, and what affectionate
	names she called me!  I am lost in
	wonder at the depth of her
	hypocrisy.  Who can be surprised
	that an unsuspecting person like
	myself should have been a victim to
	such a consummate deceiver?

EXT.  GRAY'S INN OFFICE - DAY

The coach drives up.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	We were in London at three o'clock,
	an half-an-hour before the time
	appointed.

INT.  STAIRCASE - DAY

Roderick and the Countess looking for the office.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I easily found out Mr. Tapewell's
	apartment:  a gloomy den it was, and
	in an unlucky hour, I entered it.

They climb up dirty backstairs, lit by a feeble lamp, and
the dim sky of a dismal London afternoon.

The Countess seems agitated and faint.

When they get to the door, she stops in front of it.

			COUNTESS
	Roderick -- don't go in.  I am sure
	there is danger.  There's time yet,
	let us go back -- anywhere!

The Countess has put herself before the door in a
theatrical attitude and takes Roderick's hand.

He pushes her away to one side.

			RODERICK
	Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.

			COUNTESS
	Old fool!

She jumps at the bell, which is quickly answered by a
moldy-looking gentleman in an unpowered wig.

			COUNTESS
	Say Lady Cosgrove is here!

She stalks down the passage, muttering:  "Old Fool."

INT.  MR. TAPEWELL'S OFFICE - DAY

Tapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his
parchments and tin boxes.

He advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and
points towards a chair for Roderick, which he takes,
rather wondering at the lawyer's insolence.

The lawyer retreats to a side-door, saying he will be back
in a moment.

In the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another
layer, six constables in red waist-coats, with bludgeons
and pistols, and Lord Brookside.

Lady Cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son,
crying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her
preserver, her gallant knight.

Then, turning to Roderick, she pours out a flood of
invective which quite astonishes him.

			COUNTESS
	Oh fool as I am, I have outwitted
	the most crafty and treacherous
	monster under the sun.  Yes, I was a
	fool when I married you, and gave up
	other and nobler hearts for your
	sake -- yes, I was a fool when I
	forgot my name and lineage to unite
	myself with a base-born adventurer
	-- a fool to bear, without repining,
	the most monstrous tyranny that ever
	woman suffered; to allow my property
	to be squandered; to see women as
	base and low-born as yourself...

			TAPEWELL
	For heaven's sake, be calm.

Tapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a
threatening look in Roderick's eye.

The Countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury,
screaming against Roderick, and against his mother, and
always beginning and ending the sentence with the word
"fool."

			RODERICK
	You didn't tell all, my lady -- I
	said "old" fool.

			BROOKSIDE
	I have no doubt that you said and
	did, sir, everything that a
	blackguard could say or do.  This
	lady is now safe under the
	protection of her relations and the
	law, and need fear your infamous
	persecutions no longer.

			RODERICK
	But you are not safe, and as sure as
	I am a man of honor, I will have
	your heart's blood.

			TAPEWELL
	Take down his words, constables;
	swear the peace against him.

			BROOKSIDE
	I would not sully my sword with the
	blood of such a ruffian.  If the
	scoundrel remains in London another
	day, he will be seized as a common
	swindler.

			RODERICK
	Where's the man who will seize me?

He draws his sword, placing his back to the door.

			RODERICK
	Let the scoundrel come!  You -- you
	cowardly braggart, come first, if
	you have the soul of a man!

The Countess and the bailiffs move away.

			TAPEWELL
	We are not going to seize you!  My
	dear sir, we don't wish to seize
	you; we will give you a handsome sum
	to leave the country, only leave her
	ladyship in peace.

			BROOKSIDE
	And the country will be rid of such
	a villain.

As Brookside says this, he backs into the next room.

The lawyer follows him, leaving Roderick alone in the
company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was no longer the man I was at
	twenty, when I should have charged
	the ruffians, sword in hand, and
	sent at least one of them to his
	account.  I was broken in spirit,
	regularly caught in the toils,
	utterly baffled and beaten by that
	woman.  Was she relenting at the
	door, when she paused and begged me
	to turn back?  Had she not a
	lingering love for me still?  Her
	conduct showed it, as I came to
	reflect on it.  It was my only
	chance now left in the world, so I
	put down my sword upon the lawyers
	desk.

Roderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.

			RODERICK
	Gentlemen, I shall have no violence;
	you may tell Mr. Tapewell I am quite
	ready to speak with him when he is
	at leisure.

Roderick sits down and folds his arms quite peaceably.

EXT.  COFFEE HOUSE - NEAR GRAY'S INN - DAY

INT.  RODERICK'S ROOM IN COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

			RODERICK (V.O.)
	I was instructed to take a lodging
	for the night in a coffee house near
	Gray's Inn, and anxiously expected a
	visit from Mr. Tapewell.

Tapewell talking to Roderick.

			TAPEWELL
	I have been authorized by Lady
	Cosgrove and her advisors to pay you
	an annuity of 300 pounds a year,
	specifically on the condition of you
	remaining abroad out of the three
	kingdoms, and to be stopped on the
	instant of your return.  I advise
	you to accept it without delay for
	you know, as well as I do, that your
	stay in London will infallibly
	plunge you in gaol, as there are
	innumerable writs taken out against
	you here and in the west of England,
	and that your credit is so blown
	upon that you could not hope to
	raise a shilling.  I will leave you
	the night to consider this proposal,
	but if you refuse, the family will
	proceed against you in London, and
	have you arrested.  If you accede, a
	quarter salary will be paid to you
	at any foreign port you should
	prefer.

			RODERICK
	Mr. Tapewell, I do not require a
	night to consider this proposal.
	What other choice has a poor, lonely
	and broken-hearted man?  I shall
	take the annuity, and leave the
	country.

			MR. TAPEWELL
	I am very glad to hear that you have
	come to this decision, Mr. Cosgrove.
	I think you are very wise.

There is a knock at the door and Roderick opens it.
Brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols.

The dialogue for this scene has to be written.

Brookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to
have Roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out
against him for debt.

Mr. Tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that
Brookside is acting in bad faith.

Brookside brushes aside his objections.

Roderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair.

The following lines are read over Roderick being shackled
and led out of the room.

			NARRATOR
	Mr. James Cosgrove's personal
	narrative finishes here, for the
	hand of death interrupted the
	ingenious author soon after the
	period which this memoir was
	compiled, after he had lived
	nineteen years an inmate of the
	Fleet Prison, where the prison
	records state he died of delirium
	tremens.

EXT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

His mother, now very old and hobbled with arthritis,
enters the prison, carrying a basket on her arm.

			NARRATOR
	His faithful old mother joined him
	in his lonely exile, and had a
	bedroom in Fleet Market over the
	way.  She would come and stay the
	whole day with him in prison
	working.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - COUNTESS' STUDY

Signing a payment draft, the Countess sighs and gazes out
of the large window.

			NARRATOR
	The Countess was never out of love
	with her husband, and, as long as
	she lived, James enjoyed his income
	of 300 pounds per year and was,
	perhaps, as happy in prison, as at
	any period of his existence.

INT.  CASTLE HACKTON - STUDY - DAY

Brookside tearing up the payment draft presented to him by
his accountant.

			NARRATOR
	When her ladyship died, her son
	sternly cut off the annuity,
	devoting the sum to charities,
	which, he said, would make a nobler
	use of it than the scoundrel who had
	enjoyed it hitherto.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick, now grey-haired, blacking boots.

			NARRATOR
	When the famous character lost his
	income, his spirit entirely failed.
	He was removed into the pauper's
	ward, where he was known to black
	boots for wealthier prisoners, and
	where he was detected in stealing a
	tobacco box.

INT.  FLEET PRISON - DAY

Roderick and his mother.  Action as per voice over.

			NARRATOR
	His mother attained a prodigious old
	age, and the inhabitants of the
	place in her time can record, with
	accuracy, the daily disputes which
	used to take place between mother
	and son, until the latter, from
	habits of intoxication, falling into
	a state of almost imbecility, was
	tended by his tough old parent as a
	baby almost, and would cry if
	deprived of his necessary glass of
	brandy.

			THE END
The Battle of Algiers

 
The Battle of Algiers


1	VILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. NIGHT. 

	Inside a three-story villa, just built, with whitewashed walls. 
	An elevator shaft is empty, the large cables dangle. 

	On every landing two apartments. The front doors are wide open.
	Whitewash on the floor of the halls, swirls of whitewash on the 
	windowpanes, naked light bulbs hung from electric wires. The rooms 
	contain hardly any furnishings. 

	The kitchens are still without sinks and stoves.
  
	An agitated bustle, a rhythm of efficiency. Paratroopers go up and 
	down the stairs, pass along the halls, enter and leave the rooms.

	The sounds in the background are indecipherable.

	SHOUTED ORDERS, CRIES, HOWLS. 

	SHOUTS, HALF-SPOKEN REMARKS, LAUGHS.

	SOMEWHERE A GRAMOPHONE IS PLAYING AT FULL BLAST. 

	The scene is tense. No pauses.
 
	When the paras are tired, they move to another room. 

	They sit down, stretch out on the floor, drink coffee or beer, and 
	smoke cigarettes while awaiting the next shift. Suddenly, the rhythm 
	of this routine, the timing of these images is upset. A para rushes 
	down the stairs, and asks cheerfully while running:

				MARC
		The colonel. Where's the colonel? 

				PARAS
		Why? What's happening?

				MARC 
		We know where Ali la Pointe is. One of 
		them "spoke" ...

	His voice echoes through the corridors, on the landings, from one 
	floor to another. The excitement is contagious. Many crowd around 
	the door of the kitchen.
 
	The Algerian who has "spoken" is there. He is young with a thin face 
	and feverish eyes. The paras are all around him: they help him stand 
	up, dry him, clean his face with a rag, give him some coffee in a 
	thermos cover. They are full of attention, sincerely concerned. One 
	of them tries to push away the others.

				PARA 
		C'mon, let him breathe!

	Meanwhile others who are arriving ask if it is true. 

				OTHER PARAS
		So he spoke? Does he really know where 
		Ali is?
 
				MARC 
		It seems so. We'll go see. Give him a 
		little coffee. 

	Marc is tall and husky, his eyes young and cheerful. One of the others 
	asks him with a shade of admiration:
 
 				PARA 
		Hey Marc, you made him talk?
 
 				MARC 
			(smiling)
		Sure.
 
	He then begins to smoke again, and moves aside to rest a bit. The 
	Algerian is trying to drink, but his hands are trembling. Someone 
	helps him and holds still the cover of the thermos, drawing it to his 
	mouth:
 
				LAGLOY 
		C'mon Sadek ... Drink, you'll feel better. 

	The Algerian drinks, but his stomach can't take it, causing him to 
	double over and vomit again. 

	Colonel Mathieu enters, elegant and graceful.
 
				MATHIEU 
			(smiling)
		At ease. Is it true? 

				MARC 
		I think so. Rue des Abderames three ...
 
	The colonel turns to the para, who had gone to call him, and who is 
	holding a pair of camouflage fatigues in his hands. 

				MATHIEU 
		Dress him.

	Then he goes near the Algerian, lifts his chin, inspects him for a 
	moment with curiosity.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Chin up, it's all over. Nothing can happen 
		to you now, you'll see. Can you stand up?
 
	The Algerian nods yes. The colonel turns to the paras who are holding 
	him up. 

				MATHIEU 
		Let him go.

	He takes the camouflage fatigues and hands them to the Algerian.

				MATHIEU 
		Here, put them on.
 
	The Algerian mechanically takes the fatigues, but he doesn't 
	understand. The colonel explains to him:

				MATHIEU 
		We're trying to help you. We're going to 
		the Casbah. Dressed like this, they won't 
		be able to recognize you. Understand? 
		We're going to see the place, then you'll 
		be free ... and under our protection ...

	The Algerian shivers from the cold. He is completely naked. He 
	laboriously puts on the fatigues which are too big for him. 

				MATHIEU 
		Go on, give him the cap.

	They give him a wide belt and buckle it. The other paras, one on either 
	side of him, pull up his sleeves to the elbows. A third places the cap 
	on his head and cocks it. 

				LAGLOY 
		Nationalized!
      
	The colonel turn to him angrily: 

				MATHIEU 
		Don't be an idiot, Lagloy!
     
	The Algerian is ready. The paras look at him repressing their laughter. 
	The Algerian continues to tremble. His breath is short, his eyes 
	glossy. He is crying.
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		Let's go.
 
	The Algerian looks around. He breathes deeply. Then, suddenly, 
	unexpectedly, he lets out a hoarse cry:
 
 				SADEK 
		No!
 
 	and tries to jerk forward toward the window.

	Marc seizes him immediately, and with his right hand grabs him by the 
	chest, almost lifting him. With his left hand he gives him two quick 
	slaps, not very hard.
 
 				MARC 
			(persuadingly)
		What do you think you're doing, you fool? 
		Do you want us to start all over again? 
		C'mon, be good. Don't make me look like 
		an idiot in front of the others.
 
	He makes a reassuring sign to the colonel. Then, he takes the Algerian
 	by the arms, and they move off.
 

2	STREETS OF ALGIERS. OUTSIDE. DAWN. OCTOBER 7, 1957. 

	The city is gray and white, by the sea which looks like milk. The dawn
	outlines her features sharply.
 
	The streets and wide avenues of the European quarters are empty.
	Silence, until gradually is heard ...
 
	A HUMMING OF MOTORS.
 
	One truck after another. Their headlights on, with an opaque glow, by 
	now useless.
 
	A line of trucks follow one another along the sea-front, all at the 
	same speed.
 
	They turn right and go up toward Place du Gouvernement. 

	Here, without stopping, the columns divide in two. The two lines enter 
	each of the two roads that lead up to surround the Casbah.

	In the brighter light, the Casbah appears completely white, limestone. 
	Enclosed by the European city, it stands at a greater height and 
	overlooks it.
 
	Mosaic of terraces. White pavement, pavement interspersed by the black 
	outlays of narrow alleys. Only a jump from one terrace to another ...

	Agile and silent, the paras jump one by one from the trucks in a hurry.
 
	SOUND OF TRUCKS.
 
	They arrange themselves geometrically, their movements synchronized. 
	They disperse and disappear in the alleys. 

	They reappear together, then once again scatter. 

	They meet without looking at one another; each one takes his own 
	course.
 
	In like manner without a sound, they are above, even on the terraces, 
	in perfect geometry. Even up here, the paras tighten their grip ...
 

3	RUE DES ABDERAMES. COURTYARD OF HOUSE. INSIDE/OUTSIDE. DAWN.
 
	Every three yards, there is a para, even at all four corners of an 
	intersection.

	They are also in the side streets as well as the main streets. 

	And also above, against the sky, many other paras appear. 

	Number three. The doorway is the height of a man. A squadron stands 
	ready in a semicircle with machine guns in firing position.

	Marc continues to hold up the Algerian by his arm. 

	The captain glances at his watch, then looks up at the terrace and 
	gives a signal.
 
	In a lowered voice, without turning around, he speaks to the para who 
	is at his back:
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		Fire ...
 
	The para nears the front door, his legs wide open, his machine gun, 
	clenched at his side, and aims at the lock.
 
 	MACHINE GUN FIRE.
 
	He moves the gun barrel in a circular direction. 

	Immediately the others hurl themselves against the door. 

	At the same time, the door of the terrace is broken down, and the paras 
	burst into the house below.

	The inner courtyard is square. In the center there is a well; above, a 
	patch of sky; on four sides, the arcades, columns, and majolica arches. 
	Beneath the porches, there is a door for every dwelling. And above, a 
	balcony with railings and other doors. The doors are wide open. The 
	paras quickly carry out their orders.

	ORDERS, CURT AND BRIEF.

	The people are used to all this and know how to obey. The scene takes 
	place exactly as if it were an arranged maneuver, a practice drill.
 
	The rooms are emptied in a few seconds. The people are crowded together 
	in the courtyard. 

	Eyes wide with fright.
 
	Men, women, and children with blankets and sheets thrown around their 
	shoulders. By now, it is almost day. A soft light is diffused from 
	above.
 
	The Algerian walks with his head lowered, Marc on one side, the captain
 	on, the other.
 
	They climb to the first floor and go along the balcony. 

	The Algerian stops in front of a door. 

	The captain murmurs softly:
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		Here?
 
 	The Algerian nods yes. They enter.
 

4	ALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN. 

	The room is badly lit. There is a mattress on the floor, and another on 
	the table, a cupboard against the wall, some chairs. Nothing else. At 
	the back of the room to the left, there is a dividing curtain hung by a 
	cord at medium height. The curtain is drawn and a large bed with brass 
	headboards is visible. The Algerian points in that direction; the 
	captain signals for him to go there.

	They go forward silently, and push aside the curtain. There is a small 
	light bulb hung on the wall beneath a small shelf covered with 
	postcards and photos.
 
	The baseboard all around is more than three feet tall and is covered by 
	majolica tiles.

	The Algerian points to a spot in the brick structure, on the back 
	wall, between the headboard of the bed and a corner of the room.

	Marc and the captain have their machine guns ready. The captain goes 
	near the wall, his breath drawn, and begins to examine it.
 
	He runs the fingernail of his thumb along the wall horizontally, 
	between one row of tiles and another.

	He taps the tiles at different places until he hears the plaster in the 
	interstices crumble. He looks at the bit of plaster that is left in his 
	nail.
 
	He squeezes it in his fingertips; it is soft, newly laid.

	Then he bends over, places his ear to the wall, and listens. 

	Suddenly he smiles.
 

5	ALI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE.
 
 	There isn't enough air in the hiding place. The four are forced to 
	breathe deeply. And in that small space their laborious breaths 
	resound like splashes.
 
	Ali la Pointe has his eyes fixed upon the square patch of wall that 
	seals the hiding place. His eyes are large, black, slanted, his eyelids 
	heavy, somewhat lowered, so that the black of the irises appears even 
	blacker in the shadows, deeper and more sullen.

	Petit Omar is with him, a boy of twelve, and Mahmoud who is eighteen. 
	There is also Hassiba, a Kabyle girl, blond, blue-eyed, and fair 
	skinned.

	The hiding place is only five feet high, and hardly holds them. They 
	are sitting or stretched out on the ground, close to one another.

	The entrance to the hiding place is blocked by the small patch of wall 
	which matches exactly the rest. It is held firm by a bar through an 
	iron ring attached at the center. On the other side of the cell, above 
	them, there is a hole for air. 

	They are tense and do not move. Their lips are dry, half-open, and 
	their breasts rise and fall in a difficult attempt to breathe.
 
				CAPTAIN 
			(off)
		Ali la Pointe ... the house is surrounded. 
		You haven't got a chance. Surrender. Let 
		the child and the girl come out, then you 
		and the other one. Leave your weapons 
		inside. It's useless to try anything. Our 
		machine guns are ready to fire -- you 
		wouldn't have time. Do you understand?
 
	Ali's face is motionless and hasn't changed its expression.
 
				CAPTAIN 
			(off)
		Ali, do you hear me? Listen! You are the 
		last one. The organization is finished. 
		All your friends are dead or in prison. 
		Come out. You'll have a fair trial. Come 
		out, surrender.
 
	SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS, OTHER VOICES, CHEERFUL, INCOHERENT: 

				VOICES PARAS
		Why are they breathing so heavily? 
		Fear ...
		Air ... 
		They haven't got enough air inside ...

	And again the voice of the captain, clear and somewhat distant:

				CAPTAIN 
			(off)
		Make up your mind, Ali? Do you want us to 
		wall you in, or do you prefer that we 
		blow you to pieces? ... Alright. So much 
		the worse for you.

	Ali's expression is still firm; his stare is dark and sullen.
 

6	VIEWS OF THE CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY. NOVEMBER 1, 1954. 

	The Casbah: compressed humanity, swarming in the alleyways, on the 
	steps, in the cafes, in the Arab baths, in the mosques, and in the 
	markets; a tangle of voices, gestures, faces, veiled women, eyes. 
	Someone is putting up a handbill, another distributes them.
 
				SPEAKER
		"National Liberation Front! Algerian 
		brothers! The time has come to break 
		loose at long last from the bonds of 
		misery in which one hundred and thirty 
		years of colonial oppression has kept us 
		chained. The moment of struggle is near; 
		our goal -- national independence ..."
 

7	VIEWS OF THE EUROPEAN CITY. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The European city: reinforced concrete, asphalt, steel, lights, shop 
	windows, buildings, automobiles. A steady rhythm of efficiency, music, 
	cordiality, an apéritif.
 
				SPEAKER
		"In order to avoid a fatal and bloody 
		conflict, we propose an honorable program 
		of discussion to the French authorities, 
		on condition that they recognize the right 
		of our people to self-government ..."

	And the Algerians who work in the European city, the dockers, waiters, 
	laborers, street-cleaners, farm-hands, and gardeners.

				SPEAKER
		"Algerians unite! Be ready for action! 
		The National Liberation Front calls you to 
		struggle." 

	Unemployed, peddlers, beggars, shoeshine boys ...
 

8	STREET CARD GAME. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	Two hands are moving; one over the other, they criss-cross with 
	incredible speed; at the same time, they are shifting three small 
	pieces of wood which appear to be identical. The hand movements are 
	marked by a kind of Algerian CHANT.

	From time to time, the pieces of wood are overturned for a split second 
	so that the other sides are visible. Robust hands, thick, unusually 
	agile for their size. The hands of Ali la Pointe, younger then, twenty-
	four years old.
 
	A European quarter of Algiers. Coming and going of people, automobile 
	traffic. On the sidewalk a small group of European and two Algerian 
	boys.
 
	Other passersby stop to watch. The group crowds around the stand where 
	Ali la Pointe is playing his game.

	The entranced eyes of all present are staring at the pieces of wood.

	Ali's hands seem to move by themselves.
 
	His glance, always a bit sullen, apparently distracted, indifferent, 
	passes from one face to another, and then to the street, from one side 
	to another.
 
	At fifty yards, a policeman. Two Europeans, a man and a woman, are 
	speaking to him in an excited manner, and nudging him along pointing to 
	Ali.
 
				WOMAN
		Look! Yes, that's him!
  
 	Ali is no longer singing. His hands have stopped moving. 

	A POLICE SIREN IS HEARD.

	Ali pushes his way through the crowd. 

	He breaks into a run.
 
	The policeman also begins to run.
 

9	STREET. ALI'S FLIGHT. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	The street is sloping. Ali flees, pursued by the policeman. He dodges 
	passersby with agility. He gains ground. But nearby are heard ... 

	SIRENS 

	and also in front of him.

	Another two policemen; they too are running. 

	There is an intersection. At the corner, a cafe. 

	GAY MUSIC.

	Young Europeans leaning against a shop window stop chattering and look.

	Ali reaches the corner, crosses the street, passes by the bar. 

	There is a blond youth, about eighteen, who seems to be a student who 
	stretches out his foot, and pushes a chair in front of him.

	Ali stumbles and falls.
 
	The youth attempts a laugh, and at the same time moves backward.

	Ali is lying face downward, but suddenly turns his head toward the 
	youth and stares at him. Then lifting himself by his arms, he turns to 
	look back. 

	The police are now twenty yards away.

	Ali gets to his feet. For a split second, he hesitates. He hurls 
	himself against the youth, headfirst.

	Using his head, Ali rams into the youth's face, striking him in the 
	nose and splurting blood everywhere.
 
	The youth is unable to shout. He opens his mouth in the attempt, but 
	the only result is a gurgling sound and blood. His friends intervene. 
	Ali is surrounded. The police arrive. A mass of people jump on Ali, 
	kicking him and striking him with their fists as long as they please. 
	Finally the police aid Ali and disperse the crowd.

	Ali is now in handcuffs and being led away.

	More people have arrived. They are yelling, shouting insults, and 
	spitting on Ali.
 
	Ali passes in their midst protected by the police. He pays no heed to 
	the fist blows, the shouts, the spits, but seems neither to see nor 
	hear, as if he were already resigned to having lost the battle this 
	time, and were preparing to wait patiently for a better chance.

	He is walking with an unfaltering step. His face is emotionless, oval, 
	swarthy. His hair black and wavy, his forehead low and wide; his eyes 
	large and slanted with eyelids somewhat lowered, his mouth firm and 
	proud.

10	PARIS 1955. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The air is clear and springlike. A 4CV Citroen delivery van is parked 
	in front of the Minister of the Interior warehouses. The rear door is 
	open, the motor is running, a policeman is at the wheel. Two workers in 
	overalls exit from the warehouses.

	Each one is carrying a box, and places it inside the van. The boxes are 
	made of seasoned wood, both of them rectangular. They are each about 
	eight inches long; one and two yards high respectively. The two workers 
	sit down inside the van, toward the rear. They are facing toward the 
	exterior. Their feet are dangling and almost touch the ground.

	The jolting movement of the van in motion causes them to laugh.

	STREETS OF PARIS. Spring. Girls with lightweight clinging dresses. The 
	two workers call them, whistle, gesture, and then move off in the 
	distance.
 
	ORLY AIRPORT. The van stops in front of a warehouse. The two workers 
	jump to the ground, place the boxes on their shoulders, and enter the 
	warehouse.
 
	The boxes are moving on a mobile ramp. There is a large label on each 
	one which says: REPUBLIC OF FRANCE. MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR. 
	DESTINATION: BARBEROUSSE PRISON. ALGIERS.
 

11	ALGIERS. BARBEROUSSE PRISON. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
	Barberousse prison is situated on the outskirts of the Upper Casbah. It 
	is an ancient fortress with thick, high surrounding walls, which appear 
	to vanish in contrast with the central building which dominates them. 
	The whole structure is covered with limestone like the other houses of 
	the Casbah. Only the bars on the windows and the big gate are black. 

	The gate opens. A covered jeep enters the prison courtyard. In the 
	stronghold of the jeep are the two boxes sent from Paris. 

	Early morning. The sky is pale blue. In the prison courtyard, the 
	workers open the two chests and assemble the guillotine. It is possible 
	to see it from the cell windows that face the courtyard. Faces of 
	prisoners appear between the bars of some windows.
 
	The workers have disappeared. Only the delicate, makeshift structure of 
	the guillotine is visible, its slender outline lengthened.
 

12	PRISON CELL. INSIDE. MORNING.
 
	In one of the cells there are about twenty prisoners. The cell is huge; 
	there are two very high windows that almost reach the ceiling.
 
	A prisoner is standing on the urine bucket, and looks outside through 
	the barred window. On the ground there are some mats which serve as 
	beds. Nothing else.
 
	About ten prisoners are in a group, seated on the ground, and they are 
	speaking in whispers. 

	AD LIB DIALOGUE IN LOWERED VOICES.
 
	Two of them are playing with some stones on a chessboard drawn in the 
	dirt; others are speaking among themselves. One is reading a Mickey 
	Mouse comic book and laughing to himself. But all of them, in 
	appearance and behavior, are distinguished from those who make up the 
	more numerous group. These solitary men are different in some way, they 
	are not ordinary delinquents.

	Ali la Pointe is alone, withdrawn from the others, seated on the 
	ground, his shoulders propped against the wall, his knees raised. He is 
	barefoot. On his left ankle, directly above his foot, are tattooed two 
	words in print: TAIS-TOI. His shirt is unbuttoned and on his chest are 
	other tattoos in a strange design.

	Ali looks at the group and seems to listen to their murmured words 
	absent-mindedly. His expression is taciturn, reserved, and indifferent.

	Ali turns to the prisoner at the window.
 
				PRISONER AT WINDOW
		Look at them!

	Ali jumps to his feet. Everyone moves toward the two windows.
 
 	Ali moves away two yards at a quick pace, then runs toward the window, 
	and grabbing hold of the bars, heaves himself up to it.

	The condemned man turns and looks up toward the windows. He seems to 
	smile although his face is motionless. In a soft voice, he speaks to 
	those faces which appear behind the bars: 

				CONDEMNED MAN
		Tahia el Djez-air! [Long live Algeria!]

	The political prisoners take up the phrase and recite it gutturally, 
	keeping time to the steps of the condemned man. 

				POLITICAL PRISONERS
		Tahia el Djez-air!
 

13 	PRISON COURTYARD. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	The condemned man walks toward the guillotine accompanied by guards and 
	a priest reading the Koran. There is also the executioner wearing a 
	black hood. The executioner tries to appear indifferent. The priest 
	recites his prayers. The entire ceremony seems improvised and hasty. 
	The epilogue is reached quickly. 

	PRAYERS.

	The condemned man bends. The executioner places his neck in the right 
	position, adjusts it, turns his head a bit, then pushes his body 
	forward. He releases the mechanism.
 
	The blade falls, the head rolls. There is no longer a chorus. No one is 
	chanting.
 
	Ali's eyes have remained motionless.
 
	Then from above, as the dismembered body is being carried away in a 
	basket, as the priest, the guards, and the officer are leaving, as the 
	workers dismantle the guillotine, from above, from the balconies of the 
	Casbah, suddenly the "ju-jus" of the women are heard, dense like the 
	cries of birds, shrill, metallic, angry.
 
				WOMEN
		Ju-ju ... 
 
 
14	SMALL SQUARE. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY. JANUARY 1956. 

	It is raining. The water runs along the gulleys of the narrow alleys. 
	The white houses have turned spongy gray. The children of the Casbah 
	are playing and spattering mud. Skinny and half-naked children with 
	bloated bellies and hair cropped because of sores.

	Their mothers call them in vain. They continue to run, play, and wallow 
	in the mud with a despairing gaiety. 

	CALLS. VOICES. SHOUTS.
 
	Petit Omar was then ten years old. He is slender, dressed in long pants 
	and a jacket which is too large for him and torn so that he seems 
	almost clownish. Calm and absorbed, he passes in the midst of the other 
	children, but doesn't notice them or their games.
 
	A small square on a sloping ascent.

	In the center, a fountain. On the elevated side of the square, on a 
	corner, there is a mosque. 

	SOUNDS OF CHURCH MUSIC.

	Standing still at the foot of the steps is an Algerian in white cloak, 
	and hood down to his eyes. Other people pass by. The Algerian is turned 
	to one side so as not to be seen. Petit Omar walks toward him and nears 
	his back. The Algerian turns; it is Ali la Pointe. He tells the boy 
	with a tone of boredom and curtness:
 
				ALI 
		Go away!
 
 				PETIT OMAR 
		Men have two faces: one that laughs and 
		one that cries ...
 
	Ali looks at him incredulously and asks:
 
				ALI 
		And they sent you!
 
	The child slips a hand under his sweater to his chest.
 
				PETIT OMAR 
		Sure, something wrong with that?
 
	Omar takes out a piece of paper folded in four, and hands it to Ali.
 
				PETIT OMAR 
		Take it. Everything's written here. 

	He turns away and begins to run. 

				ALI 
		Wait!

	Omar stops running and turns to Ali.

				ALI 
		Come here ... Come.
 
	Omar retraces his footsteps. Ali goes to meet him. 

				ALI 
			(in a brusque manner)
		Can you read? 

				PETIT OMAR 
		Sure ...

	Ali hands back the paper.
 
 				ALI 
		Read it.
 
 				PETIT OMAR 
		Here?
 
	Ali turns and looks around him. He squats on his heels in order to 
	reach Omar's height.
 
 				ALI 
		Here.
 
 	It is still drizzling. Omar unfolds the paper and begins to read it.
 

15 	RUE RANDOM. CAFE MEDJEBRI. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.
 
	The following day at 5 p.m., rue Random. The street is fairly wide for 
	a street in the Arab quarter and at this hour it is crowded with 
	people. There are Algerians in traditional costumes and others in 
	European clothes. Noisy and tumultuous background ...
 
	VOICES, SOUNDS, WORDS -- ALL MIXED TOGETHER. 

	Veiled women with intent glances. Silent women who seem to float 
	through the crowds, untouchable.

	An Arab cafe filled with customers at the tables and bar. Through the 
	large shop window, a smoky, steamy interior is visible. The cafe is 
	located in rue Random, number 40.
 
				OMAR 
			(off)
		There is an Arab cafe at rue Random 40. 
		The owner's name is Medjebri. He is a 
		police informer ...
 
 	Medjebri is standing behind the cash register, smiling, very busy. He 
	is wearing a traditional costume. He is very clearly visible through 
	the shop window above the heads of the customers.
 
	In a doorway near the cafe there is a clock hanging from a signboard in 
	front of a store. It is five o'clock. A French policeman enters the 
	cafe.
 
 				OMAR 
			(off) 
		Every day at 5 p.m., a French policeman 
		goes to see him. He stops for a few 
		minutes to get information with the 
		excuse of drinking a cup of tea. You have 
		to kill the policeman ...
 
				ALI 
			(off) 
		Not Medjebri?
 
 	Medjebri moves away from the register, still standing behind the bar, 
	to where the policeman is seated. He greets him, and hands him a cup of 
	tea.
 
 				OMAR 
			(off)
		No. It says the policeman.
 
 	The policeman is leaning on the bar. He is tall and husky, and is 
	wearing a scruffy uniform with a kepi pushed back somewhat. Now his 
	thick lips are sipping the scalding mint tea.

				ALI
			(off)
		Okay ...
 
	The large clock and store signboard. Standing in front, there is a 
	slender girl, veiled, her eyes darting in contrast with the rigid form 
	of her motionless body. Her arms are raised to form an arch, her hands 
	supporting the edges of a large basket balanced on her head.
 
				OMAR 
			(off) 
		At the corner, right in front of the 
		large clock, there will be a girl 
		carrying a basket. When the policeman 
		comes out, you will follow him together. 
		At the right moment she will give you a 
		pistol. You have only to shoot ... 
		quickly and in the back. 

	Now the policeman has finished drinking his tea. He makes a sign to 
	pay. Smiling, Medjebri refuses the money, and says good-bye.

	Ali approaches the girl. They exchange glances. The girl puts down her 
	basket which is filled with corn, and rests it by her side.

	She moves slowly toward the cafe. Ali walks beside her.
 
	The policeman is coming out of the cafe. He rudely bumps into those who 
	are entering.
 
	He makes his way along the sidewalk, and moves further away, balancing 
	his heavy body at every step.
 
	Ali and the girl are about a yard away from him. They follow him, 
	pushed along with the many others who are crowded on the sidewalk.

	Then the girl plunges her hand into the corn. In a second, she places 
	the revolver in Ali's right hand.

	He holds it under his cloak. The policeman's back is a hand's-bredth 
	away. But Ali does not shoot. 

	He moves forward to pass by the policeman.
 
	Alarmed, the girl looks at him, and tries to hold him back. She shakes 
	her head as if to speak. 

	Ali smiles at her. His eyes have a hard glint.

	He moves a few steps past the policeman. Suddenly Ali turns, lifts his 
	arm as if to push his way through, and then stretches out his hand with 
	the revolver aimed.
 
	The policeman stops; his eyes are wide with fear. Instinctively he 
	lifts his arms and opens his palms. 

	Terror paralyzes him.
 
	Ali glances about him. Many people are moving away hastily, but others 
	stand still in a circle and watch fascinated. Ali speaks to all of 
	them, in a loud voice. His eyes are alight.
 
 				ALI 
		Don't move! Look at him. You're not 
		giving any orders now! Your hands are up, 
		eh! Do you see him, brothers? Our masters 
		aren't very special, are they?
 
	A sharp, metallic click. Ali tries a second time, presses the trigger 
	again.
 
	SEVERAL CLICKS. REVOLVER EMPTY. 

	Ali rolls the gun barrel; it is empty.

	The policeman slowly lowers his hands. His right hand rushes to his 
	holster.
 
	Ali is ready to jump, throws away the gun, and starts to move forward.

	He knocks down the policeman, who is overwhelmed, and falls backward.
 
	The crowd moves away quickly. Ali starts to throw himself on the 
	Frenchman lying on the ground, but stops halfway. 

	A thought restrains him. He turns and sees the girl who has picked up 
	the revolver and hidden it again in her basket. 

	Then she moves away hurriedly.
 
	Ali curses angrily, then, kicks the policeman's head twice, and runs 
	after the girl.

	He reaches her, grabs her shoulder so roughly that she shouts.
 
				ALI 
			(in a whisper) 
		Bastard! ... Bitch!
 
	The girl struggles free from his grip. At the same time, they hear 
	behind them ...
 
 	POLICE WHISTLES.
 
	The girl quickens her step.
 

16 	SIDE ALLEY WITH FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. SUNSET. 

	The girl arrives at a side street, enters it, and breaks into a run.

	Ali is again beside her, but unexpectedly the girl enters a front door.

	She bends, places the basket on the ground, removes the revolver, and 
	hides it in her breast beneath her shawl. She gets up again, and leaves 
	the basket. Ali blocks her way.
 
				ALI 
		Tell me what this joke is all about.
      
	The girl attempts to push past him toward the door.
 
				DJAMILA 
		Let's move now or they'll catch us.
 
	Ali grabs her by the arm, shakes her, and shouts uncontrollably:

				ALI 
		I want to know who sent me that letter. 
		What's his name? 

				DJAMILA 
		He's waiting for you! 

				ALI 
		Where?
 
				DJAMILA 
		We're going there ... if you don't get us 
		arrested first.

	The girl nods toward the street where two policemen are passing by 
	hastily.
 
	Ali moves backward into the shadow of the doorway. He regains control 
	of his nerves, loosens his cloak, and lets it fall on the basket. He is 
	dressed in European clothes, trousers and pullover.
 
				ALI 
			(pushing her ahead)
		Move ... go ahead. I'll follow you.
 
	The girl takes a look outside, then goes out. Ali follows her a few 
	steps behind. By now it is dusk.
 

17	TERRACE. KADER'S HOUSE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	It is a starry night and there are few lights visible in the windows of 
	the Casbah. In the background, there is the triumphant neon of the 
	European city, the sea, the ships at anchor, the shining beams of a 
	lighthouse. Kader turns around gracefully, and goes to sit on the wall 
	of the terrace. 

				KADER 
		You could have been a spy. We had to put 
		you to the test.
 
	Ali looks at him sullenly. 

				ALI 
		With an unloaded pistol?
 
 				KADER 
		I'll explain.
 
	Kader is a few years older than Ali, but not so tall. He is slender 
	with a slight yet sturdy bone structure. The shape of his face is 
	triangular, aristocratic, his lips thin, his eyes burning with hatred, 
	but at the same time, cunning. He continues to speak in a calm tone 
	which has an ironic touch to it.
 
				KADER 
		Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, 
		when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to 
		support the revolution, and then the 
		French help you to escape ...

				ALI 
		Sure. By shooting at me.

				KADER 
		Even that could be a trick. You escape, 
		then show up at the address which the 
		brothers in prison gave to you, and so 
		you are able to contact me ...
 
				ALI
		I don't even know your name yet ...
 
				KADER 
		My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... 
		In other words, in order to join the 
		organization, you had to undergo a test. 
		I could have told you to murder the 
		barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the 
		police would let you kill him, even 
		though he is one of theirs. By obeying 
		such an order, you still could have 
		been a double agent. And that's why I 
		told you to kill the French policeman: 
		because the French wouldn't have let 
		you do it. If you were with the police 
		you wouldn't have done it.
 
	Ali has followed Kader's logic a bit laboriously, and he is fascinated 
	by it. But not everything is clear yet. 

				ALI 
		But I haven't shot him.
 
 				KADER 
			(smiling)
		You weren't able to. But what's important 
		is that you tried.
 
				ALI 
		What's important for me is that you let me 
		risk my life for nothing.
 
 				KADER 
		C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders 
		were to shoot him in the back.
 
				ALI 
		I don't do that kind of thing. 

				KADER 
		Then don't complain.
 
				ALI 
		You still haven't told me why you didn't 
		let me kill him.
 
				KADER 
		Because we aren't ready yet for the 
		French. Before attacking, we must have 
		safe places from which to depart and find 
		refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. 
		But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There 
		are too many drunks, pushers, whores, 
		addicts, spies ... people who talk too 
		much ... people who are ready to sell 
		themselves, undecided people. We must 
		either convince them or eliminate them. 
		We must think of ourselves first. We must 
		clean out the Casbah first. Only then 
		will we be able to deal with the French. 
		Do you understand, Ali? 

	Ali doesn't answer.
 
	Kader has come down from the wall and looks toward the Casbah. Ali too 
	looks toward the Casbah, immersed in the night.
 
				ALI 
		And how many are we? 

				KADER 
		Not enough.
 

18 	AREAS OF CASBAH UNDERWORLD. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. MARCH 1956.
 
	A warm spring wind, large white clouds. At the western edge of the 
	Casbah, from the Upper to Lower Casbah, the street of the Algerian 
	underworld descends to the brothel quarter.
 
				SPEAKER
		"National Liberation Front, bulletin 
		number 24. Brothers of the Casbah! The 
		colonial administration is responsible not 
		only for our people's great misery, but 
		also for the degrading vices of many of 
		our brothers who have forgotten their own 
		dignity ..."
 
	Shady bars for gamblers and opium smokers, shops filled with tourist 
	trinkets, merchants, fences, pimps, children with adult faces, ghastly 
	old women, and young girls, whores standing in the doorways of their 
	houses.  The girls having their faces uncovered have put scarves on 
	their heads, knotted at the nape.
 
 				SPEAKER
		"Corruption and brutality have always 
		been the most dangerous weapons of 
		colonialism. The National Liberation 
		Front calls all the people to struggle 
		for their own physical and moral 
		redemption -- indispensable conditions 
		for the reconquest of independence. 
		Therefore beginning today, the 
		clandestine authority of the NLF 
		prohibits the following activities: 
		gambling, the sale and usage of all types 
		of drugs, the sale and usage of alcoholic 
		beverages, prostitution and its 
		solicitation. Transgressors will be 
		punished. Habitual transgressors will be 
		punished by death."
 

19	BAR. EUROPEAN CITY FACING CASBAH. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. SUNSET.
 
	It is dusk. In the European city, the first lights are visible. People 
	begin to crowd the bars for an apéritif.

	An Algerian shoeshine man leaves his workbox at the entrance of the 
	bar. He goes to the counter. He is tall and thin as a reed. He takes 
	from his pocket a handful of change; his hands tremble slightly as he 
	counts it.
 
	The barman recognizes him, fills a glass of wine, and places it in 
	front of him. The Algerian pays and takes the glass. It's probably not 
	his first; the trembling of his hands increases. The Algerian drinks 
	the wine in one gulp, then goes to the door. He waits patiently while 
	some Europeans enter. He goes out, picks up his workbox, and moves 
	away.
 

20 	RUE MARENGO AND STEPS. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
 
	The Algerian is standing at the top of some steep, almost vertical 
	steps that lead from the European quarters to the Casbah.

	Now he is in rue Marengo. There is still some daylight. The street is 
	crowded. The Algerian is unsteady on his legs. He stops and mutters 
	something to himself. It is obvious that he is trying to hide his 
	drunkenness.
 
	He begins to walk, his hand against the wall for support. He stumbles.
 
	The workbox falls, scattering brushes and cans of shoe polish on the 
	ground. The Algerian bends down, and begins to pick up his tools. He is 
	swearing.
 
	Others have seen him. A peddler points him out to a child of about ten. 
	It is Petit Omar, who nods yes, then whistles. 

	Another whistle answers him, then another and another. 

	There are other children, at every corner of the street. 

	They arrive in a run and gather together.

	Omar points to the drunk who is now moving away, and gives the order to 
	attack. It is evident that this is not a game for them, but a duty.

	There is a chorus of brief shouting, of insults, and whistles. 

	The drunk sees them approaching. He is terrified. 

	He tries to quicken his step.
 
	They reach him quickly and surround him. They attack him and then flee, 
	small yet elusive. They do not laugh even once; their faces are hard 
	and cruel.
 
	The drunk swings around holding his workbox by its strap. 

	Some children are hit; some fall.
 
	The drunk avails himself of this chance to escape, and retraces his 
	steps to the staircase.
 
	He begins to descend toward the European quarters. But the children are 
	again upon him.
 
	They are shouting more loudly now, and pushing him. He quickens his 
	step, and staggering jumps the steps two by two. 

	The children trip him and he falls.
 
	He is crying. He shields himself with his hands. 

	The workbox has fallen and is rolling down the steps. The children are 
	now on top of him, like small beasts on a carrion. They smother him, 
	push him and pull him. They are no longer shouting.

	All of them are intent upon their efforts. Only the drunk is shouting 
	despairingly.
 
	They succeed in moving him, and hurl him down the steps. He rolls 
	downward, trying in vain to grab something with his hands.
 

21	BAR CASBAH. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.
 
	Outside the sun's light is blinding. Inside the small bar there is 
	fresh air and shade.
 
	A young Algerian, with lifeless eyes and an idle expression, is rolling 
	an opium cigarette. He lights it. Two slaps cause the cigarette to fall 
	from his lips.

	Ali la Pointe is wearing a djellabah, a type of cloak without buttoning 
	which slips on over the head. There is an opening of about eight inches
 	at the waist.
 
	Ali has stretched his arm through the opening to slap the opium addict, 
	who recognizes Ali, smiles, and makes a dazed grimace.
 
 				OPIUM-ADDICT
		Ali la Pointe ...

				ALI 
		Wake up! Have you seen Hacene le Bonois?
 
				OPIUM-ADDICT 
			(shaking his head) 
		Not today ...
 
	Then he gets up laboriously, bends down, and looks for the cigarette 
	that had fallen from his hand.

	He doesn't reach it. Ali quickly crushes the cigarette with his foot. 
	He is wearing a pair of sneakers. He moves away and leaves the bar.
 

22 	STREET BAR. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	Ali continues to scour the streets. From time to time, without 
	lingering, he asks someone:
 
 				ALI 
		Seen Hacene le Bonois?
 
 	Then adds:
 
 				ALI 
		Tell him I'm looking for him ...
 

23 	BROTHEL QUARTERS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	OFF LIMITS 
	Entrance to the brothel quarters. The street widens, the alleys branch 
	off and seem to broaden. There are one or two Europeans, not only 
	tourists in search of adventure, but also elements of the international 
	criminal underworld who mingle here with the Algerians.

	Almost all the buildings house a brothel or other place of ill-repute. 
	On some doorways signs are hanging which read: 

			THIS IS AN HONEST HOUSE.
 

24	BROTHEL. INSIDE. DAY. 

	Ali has entered a brothel. It is morning and there are few clients. The 
	whores are Algerian and European. Some of them are pretty.

	The madam is an Algerian, dressed in European clothes. She is about 
	forty, heavily made up. When she spots Ali, she interrupts her usual 
	professional chant. She seems curious, yet glad.
 
				MADAM 
			(shouting) 
		Ali la Pointe!
 
 	She stops herself, already sorry for having spoken so quickly and 
	imprudently. Ali doesn't answer her, but approaches with a steady and 
	serious glance.
 
 				MADAM 
			(changing tone)
		Haven't seen you around for some time. I 
		thought you were still in prison.
 
	Ali leans against the counter, never once taking his eyes off her.

				ALI 
		Is Hacene le Bonois here?
 
				MADAM
		No. He left early this morning. You know 
		how it is with the boss ...

				ALI 
		I want to see him. If he shows up, tell 
		him that I'm around. 

	Ali moves away from the counter and turns. He leaves without a word. 
	The woman tries to understand what has happened, and follows him with a 
	worried glance.
 

25	SMALL STREET. HACENE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 				HACENE 
		Ali, my son ... Where have you been 
		hiding? 

	Ali turns suddenly, then pulls back so that his back is against the 
	wall of the alley.
 
				ALI 
			(in sharp voice)
		Don't move! 

	Then he glances at the others. 

				ALI 
		Hands still.
 
	The others are three young Algerians, Hacene's bodyguards. Hacene le 
	Bonois is tall with short legs out of proportion with his enormous 
	chest. He is somewhat corpulent. He has a wide face, a cheerful and 
	self-confident expression. His clothing is a strange combination of 
	Algerian and European which does not, however, appear ridiculous, but 
	imposing. At Ali's remark, his expression changes, becomes amazed and 
	baffled. But at the same time, his eyes give away the brain's attempt 
	to find an explanation and a solution.
 
 				HACENE 
			(astonished)
		You know I never carry weapons ...

	Ali keeps his arms and hands hidden under his djellabah.
 
				ALI 
		I know.
 
	Hacene laughs warmly, and stretches out his hands which are enormous, 
	thick and rough.
 
 				HACENE 
		You afraid of these ...?
 
 				ALI 
		Don't move, Hacene.

				HACENE 
		Why are you afraid? We've always been 
		friends. One might even say that I brought 
		you up ... Isn't it true, Ali? 

				ALI 
		It's true.
 
 				HACENE 
		What's happened to you? 

				ALI 
		The NLF has condemned you to death.

	Hacene is stunned. He speaks aloud his thoughts in a soft voice.
 
				HACENE 
		Ah, so its come to this ...
 
	Then he bursts into loud laughter, and seems to turn to the three 
	guards at his back.
 
				HACENE 
		I'm dying of laughter! Ha ... ha ... 
		ha ...
 
 	Ali doesn't speak. He continues to stare at Hacene. Hacene suddenly 
	stops laughing. His tone of voice changes, becomes brusque and hurried.
 
				HACENE 
		How much are they paying you?

				ALI 
		They're not paying me anything. They've 
		already warned you twice; this is the 
		last warning. Decide. 

				HACENE 
		What ... What must I decide?
 
 				ALI 
		You've got to change occupations, Hacene. 
		Right away! 

	Hacene makes a gesture as if to emphasize what he is going to say.
 
				HACENE 
			(with irony) 
		Okay, you convince me.
 
 	Then suddenly, unexpectedly, he lets out a SHRILL SCREAM, like fencers 
	who before plunging their swords, try to frighten their adversaries.
 
	Simultaneously, he hurls himself forward, head lowered and arms 
	outstretched.

	Ali steps aside, and releases a BLAST OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

	Hacene falls flat on his face. There is movement. Some passersby 
	approach. The three boys try to escape.
 
				ALI 
			(shouting)
		Stop!
 
	The barrel of the machine gun is visible through the opening in his 
	djellabah. Ali's voice is quivering angrily:
 
 				ALI 
		Look at him well! Now nobody can do 
		whatever he wants in the Casbah. Not even 
		Hacene ... least of all you three pieces 
		of shit! Go away now ... go away and 
		spread the word ... Go on!


26	WEDDING. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	Summer. There is a garland of flowers strung across an alley. A front 
	door is open, and the guests continue to arrive.
 

27	WEDDING HOUSE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	In the inner courtyard, there are benches and chairs arranged in rows. 
	In front of all of them, there are two chairs separated from the rest, 
	one next to the other. In front of them, there is a small table with a 
	pen and inkstand on top. The people remain standing, about twenty 
	Algerians, of all ages. They are speaking among themselves in thick 
	whispers. There is an expectant and ceremonious atmosphere. 

	BUZZING.

	Mahmoud was seventeen then. He has soft down on his cheeks, his first 
	beard. He is thin, his neck long and tense, his glance nervous. He 
	appears to be the protagonist of what is about to take place. His hair 
	is combed with care and covered with much hair cream. He is wearing a 
	clean and newly bought white costume.

	Many of the others come to speak with him; the younger ones are joking 
	and trying to provoke him. 

	AD LIB REMARKS.
 
	Mahmoud reacts comically with a grim frown with which he tries in vain 
	to hide his shyness. At the same time, he glances secretly, anxiously, 
	up to the empty balcony on the first floor. Much gay and lively 
	chattering can be heard from an open door above.
 

28	WEDDING ROOM. INSIDE. DAY.
 
 	In the room, a group of girls are busy preparing trays with cups of 
	coffee. They are little more than children, twelve or thirteen years 
	old, with soft complexions, white teeth, and shining eyes. They seem
	children who are playing, but beneath that veneer of gaiety, some 
	anxiety is noticeable, emotions in suspense. The faltering voice of an 
	old woman calls from the adjoining room.

	A girl leaves the group, lifts the dividing curtain, and nearing the 
	bed where the old woman is lying, she kneels beside her. The old woman 
	lifts her hand and places it on the girl's hair, caressing her 
	tenderly. She speaks in a wavering voice, and her small yet kind eyes 
	fill with tears. 

	OLD WOMAN'S SPEECH IN ARABIC.

	The girl nods yes, then she gets up and goes to rejoin her companions. 
	Passing before a mirror, she stops a minute to tidy her hair.
 

29	WEDDING HOUSE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	They appear on the balcony, then descend to the courtyard. The nervous 
	glance of Mahmoud scans their faces, then rests upon that girl who, 
	with lowered eyelids, also glances quickly at him. Meanwhile the trays 
	are being passed among the guests.

	Now the people turn to face the front door. A young man has entered 
	carrying a briefcase under his arm. Behind him are two boys who seem to 
	be his bodyguards, and are the only ones dressed in European clothes. 
	Both of them have their right hands under their jackets, which are old 
	and torn. They seem to be armed. They close the door, and remain 
	standing on either side of it.

	The man with the briefcase walks toward the table. All present look at 
	him respectfully. He smiles, responds to their greetings, shakes hands 
	with all. But he refuses coffee and seems to be in a hurry.

	He sits down, places his briefcase on the table, opens it, and takes 
	out a large notebook. From the open briefcase, the metallic butt of a 
	sub-machine gun appears.

	On the cover of the notebook is written: NLF -- ALGERIAN  AUTONOMOUS 
	ZONE. CIVIL RECORDS.
 
	He turns the pages of the notebook until he reaches the last written 
	page. Then he glances up toward the people who, in the meantime, have 
	taken their seats. He smiles, says a few words, then calls two names.
 
	Mahmoud walks forward stiffly, erect, his eyes staring straight ahead 
	of him.
 
	The girl also walks forward, with a perplexed expression. They sit down 
	next to each other, but without looking at each other. The ceremony 
	consists of a few words. Finally the two youths look at each other. 
	Mahmoud tries to smile, but he cannot.
 
	The girl's expression softens somewhat. Her glance is tender; she 
	lowers her face quickly. Meanwhile the others recite the verses of the 
	Koran in low voices. 

	CHORUS.
 

30	RUE D'ISLY. OUTSIDE. DAY. JUNE 20, 1956. 8:05 A.M.
 
	There is a French guard, no more than thirty years old. He has a blond 
	mustache, his beard recently shaved. There are few people in the 
	street. The guard walks slowly, glancing in the shop windows from time 
	to time to admire his reflection. He stops, adjusts his cap, and 
	smiles.
 
	An Algerian appears beside him; he is also young. The guard pretends to 
	be interested in the photographic equipment which is on display, then
	moves on.
 
	The Algerian's arm springs forward and returns quickly to its place. He 
	plunges the knife into the guard's neck.
 
	The guard opens his mouth wide to shout, but he cannot. The blood 
	gurgles in his gashed throat. None of the few passersby has seen what 
	happened. The guard falls flat on his face. Someone sees him and 
	screams.
 
	The Algerian hurls himself on top of the soldier, opens his holster, 
	takes his pistol, then gets up pulling the gun with him. The gun is 
	fastened by a leather cord. The cord gets tangled in the gashed neck of 
	the guard.

	The Algerian pulls in vain. He panics. He looks about him with 
	terrified eyes.
 
	People approach hurriedly. They are shouting. The Algerian pulls the 
	cord a second time, desperately.

	He regains his control, picks up the knife which is lying on the 
	ground, and cuts the leather cord, thus freeing the pistol. The others 
	have almost reached him and he is surrounded, but he manages to dodge 
	them, and escapes.
 

31	BOULEVARD BRU. OUTSIDE. DAY. 8:40 A.M.
 
	A group of zouaves on patrol, three soldiers and an officer. The street 
	is sloping; on the right there is a high fence covered with advertising 
	signs and cinematographic posters, all of them torn and full of holes; 
	the emptiness on the other side is visible through the holes.

	The soldiers are chatting among themselves and looking at the posters.

	A soldier stops because he sees something moving on the other side of 
	the fence.
 
	He points to it and shouts, but not in time. 

	MACHINE-GUN FIRE INTERRUPTED BY SINGLE SHOTS. 

	The soldier falls, the others remain motionless, unbelieving. They 
	begin to run and scatter and look for cover. 

	An Algerian appears on top of the fence. He moves like a cat, and jumps 
	from the other side.
 
	His invisible companions continue to shoot. He is unarmed, and runs to 
	the dead soldier. He grabs the machine gun and retraces his steps. The 
	action takes place in a second. 

	By now the soldiers too are shooting, but it is too late.
 

32	POLICE STATION. CHEMIN AIN-ZEBOUDJA. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. 9:10 A.M.
 
	A police station in the Casbah, a small prefabricated one-story
	building.
 
	At the main door there is a police guard. A group of five Algerians is 
	approaching. They are talking among themselves, and gesticulating.

	BUZZING.
 
	The policeman enjoys watching them, then asks what it's about. All five 
	of them answer him at once, trying to outdo one another.

	The policeman has to shout to make them keep quiet. Then, assuming a 
	very humble behavior, they enter silently. The oldest among them speaks 
	in a mournful voice. He seems to be crying and asks the sergeant 
	something.
 
	The policeman calls a colleague, and tells him to accompany the 
	Algerians. Four of them go with the policeman, while another remains in
 	the waiting room, saying that it is better because he is afraid of 
	losing his control.
 
	Then he begins to explain the reasons for the quarrel: it concerns a 
	will. The old man is his grandfather, but he has recently remarried. 
	Then from inside is heard ...
 
	MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
 
	The policeman reacts quickly and tries to draw his gun. But the 
	Algerian is faster and fires point-blank.

	The four reappear. One of them is wounded. All of them are armed with 
	revolvers, and carry at their sides a machine gun and two sub-machine 
	guns that they have taken from the armory. Other cries and shots are 
	heard behind them. 

	All five of them run out in haste.
 

33	RUE MARENGO. OUTSIDE. DAY. 9:45 A.M.
 
	Another police station. Two policemen are chatting in front of the 
	entrance.
 
	A black Renault is passing by at a walking speed, then slows down 
	almost to the point of halting completely.
 
	The right door opens and there is a burst of machine-gun fire. One of 
	the policemen has been, hit, and grabs the other so as not to fall.

	Another burst of ...
 
	MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
 
	The two policemen fall down together. The car motor is accelerated, the 
	tires screech and the Renault shoots forward.
 
	A military jeep arrives from the opposite direction, crashes into the 
	car and blocks its escape.
 
	An Algerian flees and is pursued. Another descends from the auto with 
	his hands raised. 

	The soldiers shoot and kill him.


34	AVENUE DU 8 NOVEMBRE. OUTSIDE. DAY. 1:10 P.M.
 
	A large garage with workshop and filling station. In front are some 
	automobiles and a military truck.

	A scooter with two Algerian boys passes by, rumbling noisily along the 
	road. Then at full speed, it makes a sharp turn, retraces its steps and 
	turns again. The boys seem to be showing off for fun.

	Meanwhile, the employees of the garage are leaving their work since it 
	is lunchtime. The attendant at the gasoline pumps is left alone.

	The scooter stops in front of the high-test gasoline pump. The attendant 
	is a European, an elderly man, who approaches them holding in one hand 
	some bread he has just unwrapped. He detaches the pump handle of high-
	test, and asks how many gallons.

	One of the Algerians points a revolver at the attendant, and tells him 
	to pour out the gasoline on the ground all around. The other, 
	meanwhile, goes to the other two gasoline pumps, detaches the handles, 
	and fastens them in an open position in order to empty them of
	gasoline. He uses two pieces of iron that he has brought with him to 
	clamp the handles open. He stretches the pump hoses as far as they can 
	go toward the garage and the parked cars.
 
	The gasoline flows all over the large square. The two youths are again 
	on the scooter; they tell the European to move away. They have soaked a 
	rag in gasoline and they light it. 

	The gasoline continues to flow from the two open pumps. The European is 
	by now far away, the scooter is already moving away, and at the same 
	time, the boys hurl the lit rag into the square. It immediately bursts 
	into flames.
 

35	COMMISSIONER's OFFICE. INSIDE. NIGHT. 

	The night of the same day, in an office of the police commissioner's 
	headquarters. On the desk, photos of the day's terroristic attempts are 
	piled in a heap. An employee is in front of his typewriter.

	The Assistant Commissioner is about forty years old, very robust. His 
	face is somewhat wide, ordinary, and with heavy features. He leafs 
	through the photos while speaking on the telephone. It is a very warm 
	night, and the window of the office is open. From outside is heard 
	the SOUND OF TRAFFIC.
 
 				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
			(on telephone) 
		Yes, sir, but they haven't received a 
		search-warrant yet. Rue d'Isly? We 
		followed them for a while, but then we 
		lost track ... Yes, sir, but it is in 
		another precinct. No, it wasn't in 
		theirs ... There are some suspects for 
		rue Marengo ... No ... the judge hasn't 
		given permission yet. He is requesting a 
		formal investigation first. Yes, sir, 
		yes ... Yes, sir, yes -- But we haven't 
		enough men. Of course, I understand ...
		If it were possible, sir, you should ... 
		but the Commissioner can't ... in ... But 
		couldn't you ... Alright, sir ...  We'll 
		let them cut our throats then!
 
 	He slams the receiver angrily and begins to dictate his report. His 
	voice is harsh, filled with rancor.
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
		Time: 3 P.M. Attempt at homicide against a 
		Patrol of the 3rd B.P.C. Place: Luciani 
		street at El Biar. Weapon: Revolver 7.75.
		Victim: A soldier wounded in the right leg 
		and groin. Hospitalized. Assailants: 
		Unknown. ... Time: 3:35 P.M. Homicide. 
		Place: Chopin Street, opposite number 20. 
		Weapon: P.M. 38. Victim: Private

 		Time: Four minutes past 4 P.M. Homicide 
		and attempt at homicide against patrol of 
		border guards. Place: Intersection between 
		Consular Street and General Laquiere ...
		Wait a minute ...
 
	The officer stops speaking, takes a glass from his desk, and goes near 
	the window. On the ledge, there is a bottle of beer, left there 
	evidently to keep it a bit cool. He takes it, fills his glass and 
	drinks.

	Then he speaks in a lowered voice, while looking outside, without even 
	giving any directions to the employee who waits with his hands poised 
	about the keyboard of his typewriter.
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
		I want to see the newspapers tomorrow. If 
		they're still talking about pacification 
		of our Moslem brothers!
 
	He returns to his desk.
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
		Where were we?

				EMPLOYEE
		Intersection, between Consular Street and 
		General Laquiere Avenue ...
 

36	VARIED FLASHES. POLICE STATIONS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	In front of police stations: Ain-Zeboudja ... rue Marengo ... and all 
	the others ... in the Casbah ... in the European quarters ... sandbag 
	entrenchments are being prepared, barbed wire is being stretched, 
	metallic lookout turrets are being set up. It is very hot. Workers and 
	policemen work in silence. There is an oppressive atmosphere.
 
				SPEAKER
		"Ordinance of the Prefecture of Algiers: 
		All police stations in Algiers, without 
		exception and until further notice, are 
		required to prepare and maintain external 
		protection devices. The shifting of guards 
		outside must continue uninterrupted 
		twenty-four hours a day. Sentinels must 
		be equipped with automatic weapons ..."
 

37	EUROPEAN AND CASBAH PHARMACIES. MUSTAPHA HOSPITAL. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.

	View of pharmacies in the European quarters and in the Casbah.

 	The shelves, medicines; people who are buying. The Mustapha hospital, 
	reserved for Algerians. The wards: hospitalized Algerians.

				SPEAKER
		"The Governor-General of Algiers decrees: 
		Article No. 1 -- The sale of medicinal 
		and pharmaceutical products, effective 
		for the cures of gunshot wounds, can be 
		made only to those who present written 
		authorization from the Commissioner of 
		Police.

		Article No. 2 -- Directors of all 
		hospitals and clinics must produce to the 
		police authorities an immediate listing 
		of all patients admitted to their 
		institutions for the care and treatment 
		of gunshot wounds."
 

38	CASBAH ROAD BLOCKS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	The Casbah is being closed off. Every point of entrance, every alley, 
	every street that joins the Casbah and the European quarters has been 
	blocked off with wooden horses and with barbed wire nine feet high.

	There are also workers, policemen, and soldiers who are working at the 
	barricades.
 
	Beyond them, on the other side of the barbed wire, the Algerians seem 
	to be encaged.
 
 				SPEAKER
		"The Prefecture of Algiers states: In 
		the course of these last few days, dozens 
		of assaults have been committed in this 
		city. We have reason to believe that the 
		assailants originate in the Casbah, and 
		that they have always found a speedy and 
		easy refuge in the alleys of the Arab 
		quarters. As a result, and in order to
		alleviate without delay the insecurity 
		that now reigns in the city, the 
		Prefecture of Algiers has decided that 
		entrance to the Casbah can only he 
		permitted at those points in the blockade
		under military control, where citizens in 
		transit must exhibit their documents at 
		request, and submit to eventual searches."
 
	The Casbah is imprisoned, like a huge concentration camp. Only five 
	streets have been left open, the widest streets. There are five exits 
	where the wooden horses serve to restrict passage, and where some 
	wooden posts for the guards are being built.

	Every exit is marked by a sign with large lettering.
 

39 	BLOCKADE MARENGO. OUTSIDE. DAY. AUGUST 10, 1956.
 
	At each blockade, there are two ramps, an entrance and an exit to the 
	Casbah. The Algerians and some Europeans crowd around in both 
	directions. The soldiers are wearing fatigues with helmets and machine 
	guns. The Europeans are not requested to show identity papers.

	The Algerians are often frisked, and accept this fact silently, 
	patiently, without any sign of intolerance. But if the soldiers attempt 
	to search a woman, then, it is different.
 
	A woman begins to shout, while waving her arms wildly, and pushes away 
	the soldier who had tried to search her. A stream of incoherent words.
 
	Other Algerians intervene; they push forward threateningly. The soldier 
	is young; he is timid and frightened. He looks over his back for help.

 	A police officer approaches. He has a different tone, and a very self-
	assured manner. He shouts at the Algerians to calm down.
 
				OFFICER
		Are you mad, touching one of their women? 
		Go on, go on, alright ... Go ahead, keep 
		moving!
 
 	The woman passes the blockade, but still continues her protest with a 
	shrill and unbearable voice.
 

40	RUE PHILIPPE. OUTSIDE. DAY. 8:35 A.M.
 
 	An Algerian woman walks along the sidewalk. She is elderly, fat, and is 
	wearing a traditional costume with her face veiled. She walks slowly 
	toward a bar, which has its tables outside, and already some customers.

	Near the bar, leaning against a wall, there is an Algerian who now 
	begins to move and goes to meet the old woman. They greet one another 
	with much warmth, like a mother and son who haven't seen each other for 
	a long time.
 
	They embrace, and the man searches at her breast among the folds of her 
	veil. He finds a revolver which is hung by a cord, and grabs it. They 
	are at ten or twelve feet distance from the bar. At a table, there is a 
	French soldier having coffee with cream, croissant, and an open 
	newspaper.
 
	The Algerian continues to embrace the old woman, and aims from above 
	her shoulders. Only one shot; the newspaper rips, the soldier tries to 
	get up again, his face full of blood. Then he collapses on the table.
 
	The Algerian has hidden the revolver in the woman's veil. The two 
	separate from their embrace. They seem terrified and surprised, and 
	move away from each other in different directions while the people are 
	rushing about and SHOUTING.
 

41	DE LA LYRE MARKET. OUTSIDE. DAY. 9:10 A.M.
 
 	The cries of the peddlers are loud and incoherent. An Algerian is 
	squatting on his heels in front of his wares scattered on the ground:
	clusters of aromatic herbs, jars of spices. A youth is in front of him, 
	and from time to time, he looks around him. He seems to be waiting.

	Now he bends down and begins to rummage through the herbs. He selects a 
	bunch of mint, weighs it in his hand, and argues the price with the 
	peddler.
 
	A policeman in the market passes nearby and watches. The youth waits a 
	second, then turns toward the back of the policeman, and stretches out 
	his arm.
 
	He has in his hand the bunch of mint; a revolver is hidden among the 
	greens. He shoots twice.
 
	The French policeman falls down. The youth drops the mint with the 
	revolver among the other herbs, and moves away in the midst of the
	crowd.
 

42 	RUE DE BAR-EL-QUED. OUTSIDE. DAY. 10:15 A.M.
 
	In front of the police station there are sandbags and a police guard at 
	duty with helmet and machine gun. The policeman jumps to attention and 
	salutes. An officer has come out of the station and returns his salute. 
	He moves away and walks along the sidewalk.
 
	There are few people. An Algerian seems to appear from nowhere, and 
	walks behind him. He is very young, is wearing a short-sleeved shirt 
	and blue jeans.
 
	The officer turns at the first corner. Further on, there is a row of 
	cars and a metallic sign which warns that the parking space is reserved 
	for police vehicles only.
 
	The officer hears the steps of the boy behind him, and summons him in a 
	brusque manner.
 
 				OFFICER
		What are you doing here? Where are you 
		going?
 
	The boy shrugs his thin, shoulders and lowers his head.
 
				BOY 
			(in servile tone)
		I'm going for a swim; my friends are 
		waiting for me.
 
	The officer curses under his breath and proceeds. He stops in front of 
	a Dyna-Panhard, parked not too far away. 

	The boy moves on a few yards past the automobile until he reaches a 
	metallic wastebasket which is fastened to the pole of a street lamp. He 
	stops there, then glances around. 

	The officer is not far behind him; he has taken his car keys from his 
	pocket, and is about to open the car door. The boy plunges his hand 
	into the basket, rummages among the torn papers, then suddenly turns, 
	points a revolver at the officer's back, and shoots.
 
	The man tries to clutch something, but slips and falls down. The boy 
	shoots again at the man on the ground, then plunges his hand again into 
	the wastebasket, drops the revolver, and glances around him. He breaks 
	into a run.
 
	The policemen come out of the police station hurriedly. 

	WHISTLES, ORDERS, EXCITED CRIES.
 
	They turn the corner. Some rush to the man lying on the ground. Others 
	jump into a jeep. Four of them jump on motorcycles that are lined up in
 	the rack. They move off in two directions.

	At the same time, wails of police sirens moving nearer are heard in the 
	distance. The street is deserted. There is no trace of the boy. 

	People are seen at their windows. The officer is lifted by his arms.
 
	An ambulance arrives and stops, its siren at full blast, its doors wide 
	open. The officer is placed inside.
 
	The motorcycles are racing through the sidestreets. The jeep converges 
	on them, then reverses its direction, moving while balanced on two 
	wheels.
 
	Passersby stop to watch, all of them Europeans. The siren's wail is at 
	a high pitch.
 

43	ADJACENT STREETS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	A deserted street, recently covered with wet asphalt. 

	A Moslem road worker is sitting on the ground next to a steamroller. 
	He is eating his lunch. The combined sounds of the siren's wail and the 
	rumbling of the motorcycles are heard approaching.
 
	Two motorcyclists appear in the street, passing by the road worker.

	One of them stops and turns around.
 
	The road worker moves backward to the street corner. He breaks into a 
	run. His eyes are burning with fear, his face is anxious, undecided.

	From the windows, the people point to him, and shout after him.

	A jeep appears in the street in front of him. 

	The motorcyclist approaches from the opposite direction. 

	The Algerian stops running; he doesn't know what to do. 

	From the windows, continuous SHOUTING.
 
	The Algerian leans against the wall, watches the scene, and begins to 
	cry. The policemen jump down from the jeep and leap at him. The 
	Algerian isn't able to speak, but only shakes his head.
 

44	POLICE STATION. INSIDE. DAY. 

	A room inside the police station. The Algerian's face is beaten from 
	right and left by a series of slaps.

	The room is filled with policemen. All of them are practically on top 
	of the Algerian; all of them are shouting. In the confusion can be 
	heard SHOUTS.
 
				VARIED VOICES
		Do you know he's dead, you bastard? Do you 
		know you killed him?

	They try to reach him, pushing against one another in order to get 
	closer and hit him. The Algerian is crying and speaks in broken-off 
	phrases, half Arabic and half French. His continual efforts to repeat 
	certain words are heard: 

				ALGERIAN
		No, no, no, no, ... me no ... Viva 
		France ...

	An officer arrives making his way.

				OFFICER
		Get out, go on, outside ... Get out of 
		the way! Go away ...

	They make way for him; he reaches the Algerian who tries to smile at 
	him, continually shaking his head: 

				ALGERIAN
		Sir ... sir ... sir ...
 
 				OFFICER 
		What's your name?
 
	The Algerian's mouth is dry; he tries to swallow.
 
				ALGERIAN 
		Sir ... sir ... sir ...
 
				OFFICER 
		What's your name?

				ALGERIAN 
			(straining, still 
			trying to swallow)
		Lardjane Boualem, sir ...
 

45	COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. INSIDE. NIGHT.
 
 	In the Commissioner's office, the Assistant Commissioner dictates:
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Guilty: Lardjane Boualem, manual worker, 
		married with three children. Resident in 
		rue de Thèbes, number eight ... So? How 
		many today?

	The employee removes the copies from the typewriter and begins to put 
	them in order. 

				EMPLOYEE
		Seven assaults, three dead.
 
	Then he moves to the desk, and hands over the various copies for 
	signature.
 
				EMPLOYEE
		Here, one for the Commissioner ... the 
		press offices ... the archives ... and 
		one for you, sir. 

	The Assistant Commissioner signs.

				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you 
		tomorrow.
 
				EMPLOYEE
		Good evening, sir.

	The employee salutes, then moves toward the door. He is about to go out 
	when the Assistant Commissioner stops him. 

				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
 
				EMPLOYEE
		Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I 
		think ...
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
 
				EMPLOYEE
		Good evening, sir.

	The employee leaves and closes the door. The Assistant Commissioner 
	crosses the room to the large map of Algiers which covers the entire 
	wall. He moves his finger along the Casbah zone; as he moves it, he 
	follows it with his glance in that tangle of streets.

				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
			(to himself)
		Rue de Thèbes ... de Thèbes ... 

	He has found it. He observes it for a minute, then moves his finger 
	along the road leading to the European quarters. He finds the right 
	route, then concentrates in order to memorize it.

	He returns to the desk, lifts the receiver, and dials a number.

				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
    			(on the phone) 
		Hello, Engineer Henry Amaud, please ... 
		He's already left? Alright, yes, yes, 
		alright ... I have the number.
 
	He clicks the receiver, then dials another number. At the other end of 
	the line, a feminine voice is heard. The Assistant Commissioner 
	abandons his usual peremptory tone.
 
 				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
		Hello, Bernadette...Yes, right away. I'm 
		going to change my clothes first, and I'll 
		be right there. My wife is already there, 
		right? No, it's not important. But call 
		Henry for me. Just for a minute ... 
		Alright ... thanks ...
 
	He places the receiver on the desk, then puts on his jacket which is on 
	the back of his chair. He straightens his tie. Now from the receiver a 
	muffled voice is heard; the Assistant Commissioner picks up the 
	receiver.
 
 				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
		Hello, Henry? ... Everything's okay. 
		Good. What are we going to tell our 
		wives? The club? Good idea, yes. I'll be 
		there right away. Just give me time to 
		change my clothes ... Ah, I've found the 
		address. No, it's better to talk in 
		person. Yes, it's the right place ... 
		Okay. Bye.
 
	He puts down the receiver, then goes to the coat-hanger and takes his 
	beret. He goes out after glancing again at the photos of the day's 
	assaults.
 

46	HENRY ARNAUD'S HOME. INSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	Two small children are kneeling in front of their beds.
 
				CHILDREN
		Notre Père, dans le ciel ...

	Two children, five or six years old, blond, charming, but not affected. 
	They seem to be twins, and are wearing identical pajamas.

	At the same time, a servant is preparing their beds for the night. She 
	is about fifty years old, her apron clean and ironed; she has gray 
	hair, her face that of a good woman. She is Algerian.  When the 
	children falter in their prayers, she helps them. When they have 
	finished she says with an Algerian accent:

				SERVANT
		Now, let's go to say good night.
 
 	In the dining room, there is a large open window. The beach, the sea, 
	and the sound of the surf are outside, not too distant. It is a starry 
	night. At a table, there are four men and four women, all of them well 
	dressed and tanned. It is the home of Henry and Bernadette Arnaud. The 
	Assistant Commissioner is in plain clothes. He and his wife seem ill at 
	ease, somewhat out of place.
 
	The maid and children have entered the room.
 
				BERNADETTE
		Come here, children. Say hello ...

				CHILDREN 
		Good evening ...

	The others smile. The servant accompanies the children to their 
	parents.

				CHILDREN
		Good night, daddy. Good night, mommy. 

				BERNADETTE 
		Good night, dear.
 
	They kiss. At the same time the women make the usual delighted 
	exclamations. One of the men attracts the Assistant Commissioner's 
	attention, points to his watch, and makes a sign.

	The Assistant Commissioner nods his head affirmatively.
 

47	ALGERIAN STREETS. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
 	A DS Citroen is crossing the city at high speed.

	The four men are inside. Arnaud is at the wheel. The Assistant 
	Commissioner is sitting in the back seat.
 

48 	CASBAH ENTRANCE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
 	The automobile arrives at Place du Gouvernement, takes a turn around 
	the square, then turns toward the blockade, and slows down.

	One of the soldiers moves to the center of the ramp, and raises the 
	phosphorescent flag. The car lowers its headlights and stops.

	The soldier goes to the driver's window. In his right hand, he is 
	holding a machine gun which hangs from his shoulders. He greets them.
 
	He bends to window level:

				SOLDIER 
		Good evening ...

	Arnaud responds in an innocent, cheerful tone: 

				ARNAUD
		Good evening ... Can we pass?

				SOLDIER 
		It's too late. No one is allowed to enter 
		the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.

				ARNAUD
		But it's not even midnight yet!

				SOLDIER 
		It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew 
		begins at midnight.

				ARNAUD
		Please, we just want to take a short ride. 
		A friend of mine has never seen the 
		Casbah.
 
				SOLDIER 
		I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of 
		the question.
 
	The Assistant Commissioner intervenes with the self-assured and 
	somewhat arrogant tone common to all policemen. He stretches his arm 
	toward the window and hands the soldier a card.
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		It's alright, they're with me. 

	The soldier examines the card by the glare of the headlights, hands it 
	back, and bringing his hand to his visor, he salutes. 

				SOLDIER 
		Okay, sir. Go ahead.
      
	The Assistant Commissioner salutes with his hand.
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Let's go, Henry. 

				ARNAUD 
			(he changes gears)
		Thank you. Good evening. 

	The soldier steps aside, and salutes again.

	The automobile begins to move, steadily increasing its speed.


49	CASBAH STREET. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. 

	The streets of the Casbah are deserted, almost completely blackened. 
	Some cats are frightened by the headlights and run close to the walls.
 
	Inside the car the four men are silent. They keep their eyes fixed 
	straight ahead of them, their faces concentrating, taut.
 
				ARNAUD 
		This way?

				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Yes, it's the first intersection ... or 
		the second.
 
 
50	RUE DE THÈBES. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	The automobile slows down at the first intersection. Arnaud leans out 
	the window and looks. There is an enamel nameplate -- RUE DE THÈBES.
 
				ARNAUD 
		Right or left?
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Try going to the right. 

	The car turns right, moving slowly.
 
	On one side of the street, the even numbers are getting higher: 26 ... 
	28 ... 30 ...
 
				ARNAUD 
		What number is it?
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Eight.
      
	The man next to the Assistant Commissioner says:
 
				FRIEND
		Let's park here. It doesn't matter.
 
 				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
			(in sharp tone) 
		It does matter. Go back, Henry. Let's go 
		to number eight.
 
	Arnaud puts the gears in reverse; the car moves back quickly and passes
 	the intersection: 16 ... 14 ... 12 ... 10 ... 8... it stops.

	Arnaud puts it in neutral. With the motor still running, he presses the 
	cigarette lighter on the dashboard.

	The Assistant Commissioner takes a large package that he is holding 
	under his legs on the car floor. It is wrapped in pieces of newspaper. 
	He lifts it forward. The man who is next to Arnaud takes it, leans it 
	against the back of his seat, touches it until he finds the right spot, 
	unwraps it from that part, and straightens a small plastic tube which 
	appears at the opening. It is a fuse.
 
				ARNAUD 
		How long do you want the timing device? 

				FRIEND
		Five minutes. Give me a match ...
 
	Arnaud takes the cigarette lighter from the dashboard.
 
	The other man has opened the car door. He takes the lighter and touches 
	it to the fuse which ignites immediately. The door of number eight is 
	very near, almost directly opposite the car door. 
 
	The man places the package in a shady area and returns to the car in a 
	run. Arnaud has already changed gears, releases the clutch, and the 
	automobile shoots forward.
 

51	RUE DE THÈBES. EXPLOSION. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. AUGUST 11, 1956. 12:20 A.M.

	The explosion is very violent. The fronts of buildings number eight, 
	ten, and twelve explode and collapse. 

	EXPLOSION.
 
	The echo of the explosion has ended. There is a long pause, only some 
	isolated noises resound. They are stressed, recognizable: a burning 
	beam, the thud of falling debris, broken glass ...

	Then suddenly and almost simultaneously with the other sounds, after 
	the shock, the human voices, the shouts and weeping are heard.

	VOICES, SHOUTS, WEEPING.
 

52	RUE DE THÈBES. OUTSIDE. DAWN.
 
	The dawn's light is clear and white. It dispels every shadow and 
	designs precisely every outline. Here and there, in the middle of the 
	sky, there are numerous clouds of dust, strangely motionless. In the 
	light, the human figures seem black. Seen from a distance, they seem to 
	be ants upon heaps of debris. There are women, motionless, weeping 
	softly, their voices similar to prayer. From time to time, there is a 
	sudden scream, a despairing sob, someone running.

	Another corpse is pulled out from the rubble, bodies mutilated or still 
	intact -- they are all dead.

	The people continue to rummage through the debris and to wait around 
	pitifully.
 

53	CASBAH STREETS. OUTSIDE. DAY.

	But there is no pity in the other streets and alleys of the Casbah, or 
	at the top of the steps. There is anger and hatred. The people are 
	running and shouting.

	They are shouting from their windows and balconies:
 
	JU-JU.
 
	They smother every other sound. The excitement increases. They run 
	where there is more shouting, more people. They don't know what to do 
	yet, but want to be together. Until there is a voice stronger and 
	clearer than the others which gives them a goal and direction.

	Ali la Pointe points below beyond the slopes of the alleys and 
	stairways. There below are the European quarters which widen near the 
	sea.
 
	The crowd is shouting, pushing, rushing forward with him, like a raging 
	stream, tumultuous and unrestrainable. Ali is together with his men, 
	five boys, one of them older than twenty. All of them are armed. The 
	crowd forces them to quicken their step to a run.

	Petit Omar is furthest in the rear. He is wearing a pair of short 
	pants, his chest bare; he is barefoot. He calls Ali with all his might, 
	but in vain.

	He tries to join Ali, to make his way through the legs of the others; 
	he runs, clinging to the others, pushes, passes near the walls; then, 
	turning into a side-street, he rushes into an alleyway, and finally 
	arrives in front. He runs to Ali, almost out of breath.
 
				PETIT OMAR 
			(shouting)
		Kader says to stop them! He says we've 
		got to stop them!
 
	Ali slows down as much as he can with the crowd pushing him from 
	behind.
 
				ALI 
		Where's Kader?
 
				PETIT OMAR 
		With the others. They are trying to stop 
		the people.
 
				ALI 
		Go away.

	Their voices can hardly be heard or understood amid the loud noises.
 
				PETIT OMAR 
		But he says that if we go on like this, 
		we're playing their game, and they'll 
		murder everyone ... Stop, Ali!
 
	Ali continues to run. His face is sullen, frowning, as always when he 
	must choose between instinct and reason. Omar calls him again. His 
	voice is hysterical, repeating again to stop. He is hanging on one of 
	Ali's arms. Ali jerks himself free violently; he strikes the child. 
	Omar sways and falls against the wall.

	With this movement, Ali seems to release his anger at not being able to 
	carry out his actions.

	He slows down, speaks to his men, a few words in Arabic, his voice cold 
	and bitter.
 
	Ali extends his arm and the others imitate him. Each man grabs another 
	by the arm, forming a chain. They check the flow behind them and hold 
	back the crowd that is pressing forward.
 

54 	KADER'S HOUSE. INSIDE. DAY. SEPTEMBER 30, 1956.
 
	Djamila, the girl who in January, in rue Random, gave the revolver to 
	Ali la Pointe, is now standing in front of a large mirror. She removes 
	the veil from her face. Her glance is hard and intense; her face is 
	expressionless. The mirror reflects a large part of the room: it is a 
	bedroom. There are three other girls.
 
	There is Zohra, who is about the same age as Djamila. She undresses, 
	removing her traditional costume, and is wearing a slip ...

	There is Hassiba who is pouring a bottle of peroxide into a basin. She 
	dips her long black hair into the water to dye it blond.

	Every action is performed precisely and carefully. They are like three 
	actresses preparing for the stage. But there is no gaiety; no one is 
	speaking. Only silence emphasizes the detailed rhythm of their 
	transformation ...

	Djamila's lightweight European dress of printed silk ...

	Zohra's blouse and short skirt to her knees ... make-up, lipstick, 
	high-heeled shoes, silk stockings ...

	Hassiba has wrapped her hair in a towel to dry it ... a pair of blue 
	jeans, a striped clinging tee-shirt ...

	Her blond hair is now dry. She ties it behind in a ponytail. Hassiba 
	has a young, slim figure. She seems to be a young European girl who is 
	preparing to go to the beach. 

	Continual silence. Djamila and Zohra have finished their preparations 
	and sit down to wait. Hassiba is still barefoot. She is putting on her 
	sandals, when someone knocks at the door.
 
	Djamila gets up and goes to open it. 

	It is Kader.

	A quick attentive glance; Djamila ... Zohra ... Hassiba ...

	Hassiba responds to his look with a gay and somewhat coquettish 
	expression; she says, stressing her French:
 
				HASSIBA
		Ça va, monsieur?
 
 	Kader smiles for a second, without any gaiety, but to please her. Then
	he speaks briefly and harshly in Arabic. And turning one at a time to
 	each of the three, he gives them three addresses.
 
				KADER 
			(to Djamila)
		Number three rue de Chêne.
			(to Zohra)
		Number fourteen rue Monseigneur Leynaud. 
			(to Hassiba)
		Number twenty-one rue de l'Hydre.
 
	Each one of the girls repeats, in turn, the address which he has given 
	her. Each one of the three responds emotionally. The atmosphere is 
	tense. Kader bids them farewell according to the Algerian custom, first 
	bringing his right hand over his heart. Then he embraces them.

	They look at him for a moment; they are embarrassed. Kader tries to 
	ease their discomfort, smiles, and answers Hassiba's previous remark.
 
				KADER 
		Ça va ... Et bonnes chances!
 

55	RUE DE L'HYDRE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. 5:45 P.M.
 
	At number twenty-one rue de l'Hydre, there is a bread store. Hassiba 
	has again covered her face with a veil, and is also wearing a white 
	cloak which covers her whole body. 

	She enters the store. There are other women who are buying bread. 
	Hassiba waits for them to leave, then says in Arabic to the shopkeeper:
 
				HASSIBA
		I've come to take the package ...
 
	The shopkeeper empties half a basket of bread; at the bottom, there is 
	a beach bag with a shoulder-strap, and he gives it to Hassiba.

	Hassiba hides it under her cloak, bends her head in a sign of farewell, 
	and leaves.
 

56	RUE MONS. LEYNAUD. INSIDE. DAY. 5:45 P.M. 

	At number fourteen rue Monseigneur Leynaud, there is a tailor shop and 
	clothing store. Zohra is also wearing the veil and white cloak. She 
	enters.
 
				ZOHRA
		I've come to take the package ...
 
	The tailor accompanies her to the back of the shop, where there is a 
	workroom and young girls who are sewing. He rummages in a closet, takes 
	out an Air France utility bag and gives it to Zohra who hides it under 
	her cloak, greets him, and leaves.
 

57	RUE DU CHÊNE. INSIDE. DAY. 

	Inside number three rue du Chêne, an Algerian craftsman is working in 
	filigree. Djamila takes a small leather cosmetic case.

	Djamila hides it, greets the man, and leaves.
 

58	ALLEY AND BLOCKADE. RUE MARENGO. INSIDE/OUTSIDE. DAY. 6:05 P.M. 

	At an intersection of rue Marengo, an alley, Hassiba enters a large 
	door, and shuts it. In a second, she has removed her veil and cloak. 
	Her face is made up; she is wearing pants and a jersey top. She places 
	the strap of her bag on her shoulder.
 
	Inside the bag, a towel and bathing suit are visible. 

	Hassiba goes out the door, proceeds down the alley until she reaches 
	rue Marengo. She approaches the blockade. 

	It is Saturday evening; there is a hurried bustle of Algerians and 
	Europeans. Soldiers and policemen, are very busy with their usual 
	requests for documents.

	Hassiba's arrival is quickly noticed for she is very pretty and 
	attracts much attention. Some soldiers whistle.

	An elderly Algerian woman looks at her with dislike. Hassiba is 
	indifferent and waits her turn. A French soldier approaches her.
 
				SOLDIER
		I'd like to search you, Miss ...

	For an instant, Hassiba is dismayed; then, she glances down at her 
	clinging shirt and pants.
 
				HASSIBA 
			(innocently)
		Where?
      
	The boy is young, handsome, and cheeky. 

				SOLDIER
		Not here. There's too many people.

				HASSIBA 
		But you don't understand. I was saying 
		that there's nothing to search.

				SOLDIER
		That's what you think!
 
	Some Europeans laugh, the Algerians seem not to see or hear, but it is 
	evident that they are scornful.

				SECOND SOLDIER
		Are you going for a swim, Miss ... all by 
		yourself?

				HASSIBA 
		No, with some friends.
     
	At the same time, she passes the blockade. 

				SECOND SOLDIER
		Lucky them. Next Sunday I'm free .... Shall
		we go together?
     
	Hassiba shrugs her shoulders, smiles again, and moves away.
 
 
59	BLOCKADE RUE DU DIVAN. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	At the rue du Divan blockade, Zohra too is dressed like a European, and 
	seems to be calm.
 
	There are not too many people. A soldier makes a sign for her to pass 
	in a hurried manner, and the girl passes.
 

60	BLOCKADE RUE DE LA LYRE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	Djamila is tense, pale, her features are strained. Her eyes seem even 
	larger with make-up. Now, at the blockade at rue de la Lyre, the Casbah 
	exit is blocked. An Algerian has been discovered without documents. He 
	argues, shouts, and says that he wants to go back. 

	INCOHERENT VOICES.

	The soldiers try to catch him, he struggles to get free. 

	Meanwhile the people push forward in protest. Two soldiers catch the 
	Algerian, and drag him bodily into the guard posts. The flow of people 
	continues.

	Djamila steps forward, holding the cosmetic-case with both of her 
	hands. She doesn't know how to carry it, and from time to time she 
	changes her position. She realizes that she looks awkward.

	It's now her turn. The soldiers' tone is arrogant. The previous scene 
	has made them nervous. An officer signals her to pass, then points to 
	the cosmetic-case.
 
 				OFFICER 
		What's inside?
 
 	Instinctively, Djamila lifts the case and looks at it; she feels 
	herself failing, but makes an effort to answer.
 
				DJAMILA 
		Here?

 				OFFICER 
		There ...
 
	Djamila uses all her strength to smile and she succeeds. Her eyes light 
	up defiantly.
 
 				DJAMILA 
			(provocatively)
		Nothing. 

	The officer signals her to pass.
 

61	FISH-MARKET. INSIDE. DAY. 6:15 P.M.
 
	A large warehouse in the fish-market. There are enormous iceboxes with 
	cartons of frozen fish and tubs with running water and live fish. The 
	three girls are next to one another. 

	The three bags are on top of the counter, a few steps away. With them 
	is a thin Algerian about twenty-five years old. He has thick black 
	hair, straight and combed neatly. He is wearing glasses. With his rough 
	and nervous hands, he pulls out the towel and bathing suit from 
	Hassiba's bag, then delicately and carefully, a square wooden box. He
	opens it, and turning to the girl, signals her to move away a bit. The 
	girl steps back. In the box, there is a huge iron tube, sealed at both 
	ends by two clock dials. Inside the tube, two batteries with wires are 
	attached to the dials. The youth glances at his wristwatch, then 
	adjusts the hands of the dials to six forty-five. He puts the bomb back 
	into the box, closes it, and places it in the bag. He replaces the 
	towel and bathing suit, then hands the bag to Hassiba. He is smiling 
	slightly. 

	Hassiba takes the bag and goes away.

	The box fits perfectly into Djamila's cosmetic-case. The youth opens it 
	without removing it from the case, adjusts the two dials to six fifty, 
	puts everything back in its place, and hands the case to Djamila. He 
	smiles at her and she moves away. In the Air France bag, there are 
	newspapers and magazines on top, and the same box. The youth adjusts 
	the bomb to six fifty-five, arranges it again inside the bag, closes 
	the zipper, and hands the bag to Zohra. He smiles at her. His smile is 
	more genuine, less mechanical. There is less tension than before.

	The youth smiles at the girl and says in Arabic:
 
 				ALGERIAN
		May Allah protect you.
 
	Zohra thanks him in a whisper, bends her head, and moves away. The 
	youth takes a cigarette from his shirt pocket, places it between his 
	lips, and lights it. His hand is trembling a little.
 

62	CAFETERIA RUE MICHELET. INSIDE. DAY. 6:30 P.M.
 
	Cafeteria, rue Michelet 1. The club is very crowded. There are two 
	rooms; one at the entrance with an American-style bar, and one at the 
	back with tables. It is Saturday, and at this hour many European
	families go out to have an ice cream. There is not too much confusion 
	or uproar. The people are calm, they take their places at the bar and 
	small tables, and eat their ice cream while chatting quietly.

	Hassiba enters, glances at the large clock above the cash register. It 
	is half past six. She goes to the register and waits her turn. The 
	different orders mingle; she orders a Coca-Cola. They give her the 
	check. She pays.

	She goes to the bar; all the seats are taken. She gives her order and 
	the ticket to the waiter.
 
	A man moves aside, looks at her, then steps down from his stool and 
	offers it to her.
 
	Hassiba tells him that it doesn't matter, but the man insists. Hassiba 
	thanks him and sits down. The man is about fifty, well groomed. He 
	smiles again, and turns to chat with some friends.

	Hassiba settles herself more comfortably on the seat, then removes the 
	bag from her shoulder. Holding it by the strap, she places it on the 
	floor below the counter behind the brass railing used to lean one's 
	feet.
 
	The waiter has brought her the drink. Hassiba drinks slowly, from time 
	to time glancing at the clock. She finishes drinking. The bag is in a 
	vertical position.
 
	Moving her feet slowly and carefully, Hassiba lets the bag slip on its 
	side.
 
	She gets down from the seat, and points it out to the man who is 
	standing next to her. 

				HASSIBA
		I'm giving your seat back. 

				MAN
		Are you already leaving, Miss? 

	Hassiba smiles, nods yes. 

				HASSIBA
		Good evening ...

	The man sits down.
 
 				MAN
		Good evening ...
 

63	MILK BAR. RUE D'ISLY. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.
 
	Milk Bar, rue d'Isly, at the corner of Place Bugeand. The jukebox is 
	playing full blast. It is a bar for young people. There is much bustle 
	and confusion, much laughter. The girls are making plans for Sunday.

	Djamila enters and moves to the jukebox which is in the corner near the 
	door. There are playbills for various theater performances hanging on
 	the wall. Djamila stops to look at them and reads the bottom lines. She 
	places the cosmetic-case on the floor. Rising again she looks around 
	her, and pushes the case behind the jukebox with her foot ...
 

64 	AIR FRANCE. IMMEUBLE MAURETANIA. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	Maison Blanche, Immeuble Mauretania. The entire ground floor is filled 
	with ticket counters and a waiting room for the airlines. There are 
	some employees, stewardesses and some travelers.
 
	Zohra passes through the large glass door at the entrance, goes to the 
	Air France counter, takes a time schedule, then goes to sit down on a 
	sofa which runs along the opposite wall. She sits down and places the 
	airline bag on the ground in front of her, and begins to leaf through 
	the timetable, from time to time glancing around. Using her heels, she 
	pushes the bag under the sofa.

	She looks at the large electric clock which is hanging in the center of 
	the room; it is forty minutes past six.
 
 
65	CAFETERIA RUE MICHELET. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	It is six forty-four by the cafeteria clock. The second hand is moving.
 	There are more or less the same people. The old man is still seated on
 	the barstool, and continues to chat.

	Hassiba's bag is still at his feet; the second hand is racing. A five-
	year-old child hands a coin to the waiter:
 
				CHILD
		Ice cream ...

	The father and mother are watching him, delighted. The waiter smiles at 
	the child and points to the cash register. He speaks to the child in 
	the usual tone of a grownup when speaking to children:
 
 				WAITER
		You have to go there first ... and then 
		come back to me.

	The second hand reaches twenty-five, then thirty. The child goes to the 
	cashier and pays. The cashier smiles at him and gives him the check.
 
				CASHIER
		What a good boy ...

	The child returns to the counter. The waiter has already prepared the 
	ice cream for him, and hands it to him. The child is standing on
	tiptoes.
 

66	CAFETERIA MICHELET. EXPLOSION. INSIDE. DAY. 

	The second hand, the explosion: bodies flung into the air, arms, legs, 
	white smoke, screams.
 
	Bodies thrown outside, the doors unhinged, the windows broken, empty.

	The people watch from their windows, the passersby move closer, they 
	bend down to look at those who are writhing on the ground.

	Astonished and incredulous faces. No one speaks. Only screams and 
	weeping. Sirens which are drawing nearer. Firemen and police 
	arriving ...
 

67	MILK BAR. RUE D'ISLY. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The ambulance sirens on rue d'Isly, one car after another. 

	At the Milk Bar, the people go to the doors to look at the ambulances 
	which are racing toward Place Bugeand. The sirens fade in the distance 
	and move away. The jukebox is again loud: "Brigitte Bardot, Bardot ..." 

	The people re-enter the bar, chattering, to have their apéritifs. It is 
	six fifty: the explosion.
 

68 	MILK BAR. EXPLOSION. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	The jukebox is flung into the middle of the street. There is blood,
 	strips of flesh, material, the same scene as at the Cafeteria; the 
	white smoke and shouts, weeping, hysterical girls' screams. One of them 
	no longer has an arm and runs around, howling despairingly; it is 
	impossible to control her. The sound of sirens is heard again. The 
	crowd of people, the firemen, police, ambulances all rush to the scene 
	from Place Bugeand.

	The ambulances arrive at rue Michelet.

	They are already loaded with dead and wounded. The relatives of the 
	wounded are forced to get out. The father of the child who was buying 
	ice cream seems to be in a daze: he doesn't understand.

	They pull him down by force. The child remains there, his blond head a 
	clot of blood.
 
	The policemen try to bring order to the chaos, are forced to shout, 
	push, threaten. The wounded swarm around the ambulances. A Commissioner 
	sends off the first one.
 
 				COMMISSIONER
		What time is it?
 
 				POLICEMAN
		A quarter to seven.
 
 	The Commissioner goes to the second ambulance, pulls down a man who is 
	trying to enter by force, slams the door, and shouts to the driver. His 
	face is pale and drawn; the veins of his neck are swollen.
 
				COMMISSIONER 
		Go away, for God's sake!
 
	The auto leaves and now, the third explosion resounds in the distance. 
	It is heard clearly and violently from the Mauretania section.

	The Commissioner stops midway in his last gesture, and likewise, all 
	the others, who are paralyzed with fright, incapable of taking action
	again, of accepting such reality for a third time.

	In Place Bugeand, there also, the people are motionless. All of them 
	are looking in the same direction. Their faces are alike in their 
	terror, alike in their sense of impotence, alike in their deep sadness.


69	STREET. EUROPEAN CITY. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The sun appears, then hides behind black clouds. There is a cool wind.
 	It is ten in the morning, and the European city has its usual rapid and 
	efficient rhythm of every day at this hour, only there is terror 
	written on the face of every person. That same terror has remained, and 
	suspicion, and despairing impotence.

	Patrols of soldiers and policemen move around the city, search 
	Algerians and some Europeans, stop automobiles, trucks, buses, and 
	trams that they block at both doors. 

	At the entrance to every shop, the owner searches every customer before 
	letting him enter.
 
	He does so politely with a drawn smile, and methodically rummages 
	through every handbag, every package. 

	So too in the bars, in the offices, in workshops ... And now that it is 
	already late afternoon, also outside the brothels, the cinemas, the 
	theaters.
 

70	LEMONS STREET. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
 
	A young Algerian boy thirteen or fourteen years old, wearing sandals
	without socks, trousers that reach to his ankles, walks quickly 
	carrying a cardboard box tied with a cord. It is dusk.
 
	A European woman sees him pass in front of her, looks at him, and 
	follows him with her glance.
 
	On the sidewalk there are some youths. The woman points to the Algerian 
	boy, says something. The traffic is heavy. Her words are unclear. One 
	youth calls to the boy who is by now thirty feet away:

				YOUTH
		Hey, little rat ...
 
	The boy turns around for a second, his face frightened, and quickens 
	his step. The youths follow behind him and the boy begins to run. The 
	youths too begin to run and others join them, people who are passing. 
	They form a small mob and are shouting. The boy shoots into a
	sidestreet, drops his box, and races ahead.

	While some chase the boy, others stop around the box, make way, look 
	for a policeman, a soldier, an officer. A circle continues to form 
	around the box. A patrol arrives. One of the soldiers has a Geiger 
	counter. He moves near the box, carefully placing the counter above it, 
	then ceasing to be prudent, he takes his bayonette, cuts the cord, and 
	tears open the box: lemons.
 

71	STREET CORNER. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
 
	The boy has been cornered, surrounded, pinned down, kicked, hit with 
	umbrellas, until he is exhausted and can no longer defend himself. He 
	is no longer moving. He is lying on the ground, dead. The air is gray 
	now, and slowly all the colors unite to form gray. Lights are lit in
	the city and contrast with the whiteness of the Casbah high above. The 
	sky is still clear, the black profiles of the mountains, the straight 
	coasts on the sea, the sea itself that seems to be land until it 
	reaches the horizon where the moon rises between the clouds.
 
				SPEAKER
		"Following a lengthy discussion, the 
		General Assembly of the United Nations has 
		decided its agenda for the forthcoming 
		debates:
 
		(1) re-unification of Korea 
		(2) disarmament 
		(3) the Algerian question.

		Colombia has proposed that only the first 
		two points be discussed for the day. 
		However, the Afro-Asian nations opposed, 
		underlining the importance they attribute 
		to the Algerian question ..."
 

72	SEA-FRONT. OUTSIDE. DAY. JANUARY 10, 1957.
 
	The European crowd applauds, their eyes aglow, their mouths wide open, 
	shouting and yelling, their teeth flashing in the sun. Clapping of 
	applause on the sea-front of Algiers. Children, are held up to see, 
	waving small flags. The paratroopers of the Tenth Division march past.
 
				SPEAKER
		"Mr. Raymond Lefevre, Inspector General 
		of the Administration, has presided over 
		a meeting in which important decisions 
		have been taken with the aim of securing 
		public order and the protection of 
		persons and their property. In particular, 
		it has been decided to recall the 'Tenth' 
		Division of paratroopers to Algiers that, 
		until now, has been employed in the 
		antiguerrilla operations on the Cabiro 
		plateau. The Commander General of the 
		Tenth Division will assume responsibility 
		for the maintenance of order in Algiers, 
		and will have at his disposal in order to 
		achieve this goal, all civil and military 
		means provided for the defense of the 
		zone."
 
	Massu and the authorities are standing on the balconies of the 
	Prefecture building.
 
	The paras are marching, their sleeves rolled up, their faces sunburned. 
	Machine guns, bazookas, crew-cuts, the eyes of singing boys, silent 
	steps, one battalion after another. 

	The dragon "black berets" pass by ...

	The "red berets" of the 2nd Regiment of colonial paratroopers ...

	"Les casquettes" of the 3rd Regiment parade by; "les hommes-peints,"
	Mathieu's paras.
 
	Colonel Mathieu is at the head of the regiment. He is tall, slender, 
	over fifty. He has thinning gray hair, a lean face, blue eyes, and a 
	wide forehead. His face is lined with many wrinkles. Were it not for 
	the uniform, the weapons, his tanned skin, his manner of walking, and 
	his energetic voice when giving orders, he wouldn't seem a soldier, but 
	an intellectual.
 
 	The 3rd Regiment colonial paratroopers are now before the Commissioner. 
	Mathieu turns his head slightly and: 

				MATHIEU 
		3rd Regiment! Attention à droite ... 
		Droite!
 
				SPEAKER
		Family name: Mathieu; Name: Philippe; 
		Born in Rennes May 3, 1906; Rank: 
		Lieutenant Colonel; Schooling: 
		Politechnique-degree in Engineering; 
		Campaigns: Second World War, Anti-Nazi 
		Resistance Movement, Italian Campaign, 
		Indochinese War, Algerian War ...
 

73	VILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	In a villa in the military headquarters, a reception room is visible 
	through a large window on the first floor. There are about twenty 
	officers seated in rows of chairs as if for a lecture. Mathieu is in 
	front of them and he is speaking while standing next to a desk. At his 
	back there is a blackboard, and near it, a large map with pyramid 
	graphs, cells, arrows, crossmarks, and, above them, the title: 
	STRUCTURE NLF AUTONOMOUS ZONE OF ALGIERS.

	Mathieu's voice has nothing of the military and traditional. His tone 
	is neither harsh nor cold, but rather kind and pleasing; from it
 	emanates a superior authority imposed by reason and not by position.
 
				MATHIEU 
		The result is that in the last two 
		months, they have reached an average of 
		4.2 assaults per day, including 
		aggression against individuals, and the 
		explosions. Of course, the conditions of 
		the problem are as usual: first, the 
		adversary; second, the method to destroy 
		him ... There are 80,000 Arabs in the 
		Casbah. Are they all against us? We know 
		they are not. In reality, it is only a 
		small minority that dominates with 
		terror and violence. This minority is 
		our adversary and we must isolate and 
		destroy it ...
 
	While speaking, he goes to the window, and pulls down the shade. He 
	interrupts his speech, points to the rest of the window:
 
				MATHIEU 
		Draw it down there too ...
 
	Two or three officers stand up to perform the task. At the back of the 
	room there is a movie projector. 

	Next to it there is a para who is preparing to operate it. 

	The other shades are drawn, and gradually the room is darkened.

	Mathieu, meanwhile, has resumed speaking:
 
				MATHIEU 
		He is an adversary who shifts his 
		position above and below the surface with 
		highly commendable revolutionary methods
 		and original tactics. ... He is an 
		anonymous and unrecognizable enemy who 
		mingles with thousands of others who 
		resemble him. We find him everywhere: in 
		the alleys of the Casbah; in the streets 
		of the European city, and in working 
		places.

	Mathieu interrupts himself again and makes a signal to the back of the 
	room which is completely darkened.
 
				MATHIEU
		Go ahead, Martin.

	Martin turns on the projector. On the white wall next to the map and 
	graph appear pictures of the Casbah. There are the blockades, the 
	barbed wire, the metal screens, the Algerians who exit and enter, the 
	policemen and soldiers who examine documents and frisk someone. From 
	time to time, close-ups of the pictures are shown, enlarged to the 
	minutest details, close-ups of faces, motionless images that last only 
	for a few seconds.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Here is some film taken by the police. 
		The cameras were hidden at the Casbah 
		exits. They thought these films might be 
		useful, and in fact they are useful in 
		demonstrating the usefulness of certain 
		methods. Or, at least, their inadequacy.

	Hassiba is now seen and the soldiers who are wooing her, while she 
	laughs, jokes, flirts in a provocative manner, and passes the blockade.
 
				MATHIEU 
		I chose these films because they were 
		shot in the hours preceding some recent 
		terroristic assaults. And so, among all 
		these Arabs, men and women, there are the 
		ones responsible. But which ones are they? 
		How can we recognize them? Controlling 
		documents is ridiculous: one who has 
		everything in order is most likely to be 
		the terrorist.

	An Algerian is being dragged away while protesting, kicking, and trying 
	to free himself. And then the scene changes. There is another Casbah 
	exit, and an Algerian who is being searched.
 
 				MATHIEU 
			(smiling)
		Note the intuition of the cameraman. He 
		realized that in that box, there had to 
		be something of interest, and he paused 
		to focus it.
 
	The picture is enlarged. The small box which the Algerian is carrying 
	on his shoulder is seen in detail. It is opened. The box is swarming 
	with snakes; the soldier who had wanted to examine it jumps backward.

	The officers in the room burst into laughter.

				MATHIEU 
			(laughing)
		Maybe the bomb was hidden right there, in 
		a double bottom. Who knows? We'll never 
		know.
 
	Using the barrel of his machine gun, a soldier has closed the box. A 
	snake has managed to jump out, and fallen to the ground. The people are 
	terrified and move away. Others laugh, among them, Petit Omar, who 
	seems to be an ordinary child enjoying himself. 

				MATHIEU 
		That's enough, Martin ...

	The lights are again switched on in the room. Mathieu is again next to 
	the desk, and waits a second until the buzz of comments subsides.

				MATHIEU
		We must start again from scratch. The only 
		information that we have concerns the 
		structure of the organization. And we 
		shall begin from that ...

	He takes a wooden pointer from the desk in order to illustrate the 
	graph, while he speaks with the tone and precision of a university 
	professor.
 
				MATHIEU 
		It is a pyramid-like organization divided 
		into a series of sectors. At the top of 
		the pyramid is their General Staff. 

	He has moved near the blackboard, and taken some chalk, and slowly as 
	he speaks, he illustrates his speech. 

				MATHIEU 
		The military commander responsible for 
		the executive body finds the right man 
		and nominates him to responsibility for 
		a sector: number one. Number one in his 
		turn, chooses another two: number two and 
		number three ... And so they form the 
		first triangle.

	He has written high on the board a number one and below it, with some 
	space between them, the numbers two and three. He unites the three 
	numbers with lines and forms a triangle. 

				MATHIEU 
		Now number two and number three choose, 
		in their turn, two men each ... number 
		four and five, and so on ...
 
	Mathieu writes the new numbers, spacing them on the next line. Then he 
	unites two to four and five, and three to six and seven, forming two 
	new triangles.
 
	Mathieu has written other numbers and unites them to those of the 
	preceding line and thus forms other triangles. Now the blackboard is 
	covered by a series of triangles that form a large pyramid.
 
				MATHIEU 
		The reason for this geometry is so that 
		every militant will know only three 
		members in the entire organization: his 
		commander who has chosen him, and the two 
		members that he himself has chosen ... 
		Contacts take place only by written 
		instructions ... That is why we do not 
		know our adversaries: because, in 
		practice, they do not even know each 
		other.

	Mathieu leaves the blackboard and moves near the officers. The tone of 
	his voice changes. The explanation is now finished. He gives 
	directions ... 
 
				MATHIEU 
		To know them means to eliminate them. 
		Consequently, the military aspect is 
		secondary to the police method. I know we
 		are not fond of this word, but it is the 
		only word that indicates exactly the type 
		of work that we must perform. We must 
		make the necessary investigations in 
		order to proceed from one vertex to 
		another in the entire pyramid. The 
		reason for this work is information. The 
		method is interrogation. And 
		interrogation becomes a method when 
		conducted in a manner so as to always 
		obtain a result, or rather, an answer. 
		In practice, demonstrating a false 
		humanitarianism only leads to the 
		ridiculous and to impotence. I am 
		certain that all the units will 
		understand and react accordingly. 
		However, success does not depend solely 
		on us. We need to have the Casbah at our 
		disposal. We must sift through it ... and 
		interrogate everyone. And here is where 
		we find ourselves hindered by a 
		conspiracy of laws and regulations that 
		continue to be operative, as if Algiers 
		were a holiday resort and not a 
		battleground. We have requested a carte 
		blanche. But it is very difficult to 
		obtain. Therefore, it is necessary to 
		find an excuse to legitimize our 
		intervention, and make it possible. It 
		is necessary to create it ourselves --
		this excuse. Unless our adversaries will 
		think of it themselves, which seems to be 
		what they are doing.
 

74	ALLEY UPPER CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	It is not a song, but a type of spoken chorus, an assembly of young 
	voices, words whispered from the throat, both high and low, and sudden 
	silent pauses. It is monotonous; but it is just such a repetition, 
	always with the same pattern of tones -- high, low, then, silent -- 
	that manages to transform itself into a motif, reach an excited pitch, 
	and acquire breadth and solemnity. The sound fills the alleys, rises 
	toward the long rectangle of sky, and moves farther away as if it were 
	meant to be heard by all.

	The alley is narrow and sloping, with crumbling walls, tufts of grass,
 	and refuse. It is located at the outer periphery of the Casbah -- the 
	countryside is in the background. An Algerian is walking with large 
	steps; a five-year-old child is behind him, moving quickly, stumbling 
	from time to time on the pavement; although he does not cry, 
	occasionally he calls to his father, who proceeds forward, and does not 
	turn around. The chorus arises from behind them. It is incoherent. They 
	stop in front of a door; they have arrived. The door gives way and they 
	enter.
 

75	KORAN SCHOOL. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	A large room, like a shop or stable. Here too, on the ground and 
	pavement, there are tufts of grass. It is cold. The walls are 
	unplastered, the windows boarded. The roof is in sight, but not the 
	beams. The roof is made of tiles and covered with a coat of whitewash.
 
	There are about twenty children, five to eight years old, seated on the 
	floor. The teacher is in front of them; he too is seated. He is 
	prompting the verses in a low voice, almost in a whisper, and the 
	chorus repeats it.
 
	The Koran School: a bare, wobbling place.

	The Algerian who has entered takes the child by his hand, and 
	accompanies him to the teacher who is now standing; the chorus 
	continues; the other children, do not look at the two who have just 
	entered.
 
	The Algerian and the teacher greet each other, bringing their hands to 
	their hearts, and then to their mouths. At the same time, the teacher 
	takes an envelope from under his tunic, and hands it over to the other.
 
				SPEAKER 
		"To all militants! After two years of 
		hard struggle in the mountains and city, 
		the Algerian people have obtained a great 
		victory. The UN Assembly has placed the 
		Algerian question in its forthcoming 
		agenda. The discussion will begin on 
		Monday, January 28. Starting Monday, for 
		a duration of eight days, the NLF is 
		calling a general strike.  For the 
		duration of this period, all forms of 
		armed action or attempts at such are 
		suspended. We are requesting that all 
		militants mobilize for the strike's 
		organization and success."
 
	The Algerian has hidden the envelope inside his tunic, then presents 
	the child to the teacher, who makes him sit down with the other 
	children The teacher also returns to his place and sits down, and 
	suggests a new phrase; the chorus continues. The Algerian leaves the 
	school.
 

76	ALLEY UPPER CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	Having passed through the door, he again moves along the alley, this 
	time descending, with hurried steps. The chorus continues, again heard 
	from without, but its echo is now different.
 

77	VARIOUS VIEWS CASBAH. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.
 
 	Bars, stores, market stalls, "Arab baths." Typewritten pieces of paper 
	are used to wrap purchases, or slipped inside bags, or used on the 
	blank side to add up bills and then handed to the customers.
 

78	VARIOUS VIEWS EUROPEAN CITY. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. 

	In the European city the Algerian workers: at the docks, the central 
	gas company; on the trams; the waiters in the restaurants, in the bars; 
	the shoeshine men
 
				SPEAKER
		"Algerian brothers! A great hope has 
		arisen for us. The world is watching us. 
		The next few days may be decisive for our 
		future and our freedom. The colonial 
		powers will attempt to demonstrate to the 
		UN that the NFL does not represent the 
		will of our people. Our response will be 
		unanimous support of the general strike."
 

79	SEA-FRONT. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	At the sea-front, there is a newspaper boy, about twelve years old, 
	barefoot. His voice is shrill yet cheerful. He is smiling.
 
				NEWSBOY 
		Le Monde! Le Monde! General strike! ... 
		Strike! 

	Some Europeans buy the newspaper, half-heartedly, grumbling
	disagreeably. The boy remains cheerful, places the change inside the 
	bag strapped to his shoulder, thanks them.
 
	Now he passes in front of a beggar, an elderly Algerian who is leaning 
	against a railing.

	The boy winks at him, while he continues to shout:
 
				NEWSBOY 
		Strike!

				SPEAKER
		"During the eight days of the strike, do 
		not frequent the European city, or leave 
		the Casbah. Provide lodgings in your 
		homes for the poor, the beggars, the 
		brothers who do not have homes. Store 
		provisions of food and water for eight 
		days!"
 

80	CASBAH STREETS AND SHOPS. INSIDE/OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	There is a strange atmosphere in the Casbah. People are greeting each 
	other in the streets; a thick buzz of voices, a festive mood, a sense 
	of brotherhood, and the children, who are taking advantage of the 
	situation and play and run everywhere.

	The shops are unusually crowded. The people enter and exit, loaded with 
	supplies. In the shops too, there is the same festive mood, almost as 
	if the supplies were for a trip to the country. The shopkeepers are 
	also cheerful.
 
	And the poor customers, instead of paying, hand over a ticket stamped 
	NLF.
 
 
81	CASBAH BLOCKADE. OUTSIDE. DAY. SUNSET. SUNDAY. JANUARY 27, 1957.
 
	Late afternoon, at the blockades of rue de la Lyre, rue du Divan, and 
	rue Marengo. The Casbah exit ramps are deserted, while the entrance 
	ramps are overflowing with people. Here too, there is an intangible air 
	of gaiety, witty remarks, laughter, ironic glances toward the soldiers 
	and policemen with cold faces, immobile -- helmets and machine guns --
	who stand at the entrances without intervening.
 
	The image is shortened and focused through the lenses of binoculars.
 

82	GOVERNMENT PALACE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. SUNSET. 

	A paratrooper officer looks at the blockades of rue du Divan from a 
	Government Palace balcony. Mathieu is beside him.
 
				MATHIEU 
		No one is leaving, eh?

	The officer hands him the binoculars. 

				OFFICER
		No. They continue to enter, the rats.
 
	Mathieu looks through the binoculars, and comments in a low voice, 
	smiling:
 
				MATHIEU 
		Rats in a trap, we hope ...

				OFFICER
		But do you believe that the strike will 
		be widespread? 

				MATHIEU 
		Without a doubt.
 
 	Behind the two officers, through a large open window, a room is 
	visible. There is a large table, and around it, other high officers of 
	the various armed forces, and some important officials in plainclothes.

	A general, who has his back to the balcony, turns and calls Mathieu:
 
				GENERAL
		Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...

				MATHIEU 
		A name?
 
				GENERAL
		Yes, a name for the operation.
 
	Mathieu moves the binoculars from the blockades and turns slowly around 
	the Government square, until he reaches an advertising sign for a brand 
	of champagne which now, in the dusk, lights up with a sporadic rhythm: 
	CORDON ... ROUGE.
 
	Mathieu pauses then turns toward the room, and enters smiling:

				MATHIEU 
		Champagne ... All right? 

	The general repeats absent-mindedly: 

				GENERAL
		Champagne ... Champagne. 
			(then, in a convinced voice) 
		Operation Champagne, yes, alright.
 
 
83 	RUE DU DIVAN BLOCKADE. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
 
	At the rue du Divan blockade, there is an incoherent, monotonous, and 
	irritating chant. There is a blind beggar. He is light-complexioned, 
	tall and thin, his beard long, his arms stretched out, a cane in his 
	hand. He arrives at last at the entrance ramp, tries to find the way, 
	but cannot. He tries again and again with his cane, continually 
	repeating his sorrowful chant, until a policeman takes him by his free 
	hand, placing the hand roughly on the metal screen.
 
 				POLICEMAN
		Go on! Go on!
 
	The beggar protests and waves his cane in a way that the policeman has 
	to duck to prevent himself from being hit. The policeman curses, 
	spitefully, coarsely.

	A soldier starts to laugh. The old man takes up his chant again, and 
	moves forward leaning on the metal screen. On the other side of the 
	blockade, behind the square, there is a group of veiled girls who have 
	seen the old man, and seem to be waiting for him.

	Two of them go to meet him, and each one takes one of his arms. At the 
	touch of their hands, the old man is again infuriated. Even the girls 
	laugh. Then, one of them speaks to him slowly in a loud voice.

	It seems that the old man has understood. He is convinced. He mumbles 
	something kindly and lets them accompany him.
 

84	CASBAH ALLEY. FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	A poorly lit alley. A group of unemployed men and beggars are standing 
	in front of a door.
 
	One of the three companions consults a list, then points to two in the 
	group. He signals them to enter.
 

85	KADER'S HOUSE. INSIDE. NIGHT.
 
 	Inner courtyard.
 
	In the inner courtyard, there is an elderly man who awaits them and 
	receives them kindly.
 
	They greet each other in the customary Algerian manner.
 
	Courtyard and balcony.

	On the terrace also, someone is looking toward the courtyard. Kader is 
	on the terrace together with a man about forty years old, dressed in 
	European clothes, he has narrow shoulders and a sunken chest. His face 
	is sensitive, his forehead high, and his hair and eyes black. His eyes 
	are kind and thoughtful and twinkle with irony.

	He is Ben M'Hidi, one of the four members of the CCE, the Central 
	Executive Committee.
 
				KADER 
			(to him)
		They are beggars and unemployed, homeless. 
		We have organized things in such a way 
		that during the strike they will be 
		guests of other families who have homes 
		and will provide shelter in the event of 
		possible reprisals ... But I didn't know 
		that they would be brought to this house 
		too. It is a mistake.
 
 				BEN M'HIDI 
		Why?
 
				KADER 
		Because you are here too. It would be 
		better for you to move to another house.
 
	Ben M'Hidi moves away from the parapet. 

				BEN M'HIDI
		All right ... You're the one who must 
		decide. 

	Kader follows him along the terrace.
 
				KADER 
		No, if I were the one to decide, you 
		wouldn't be in Algiers now.
 
	Ben M'Hidi looks at him, smiling.
 
				BEN M'HIDI 
		Why? Isn't it wise?
 
	Kader smiles too, and repeats:
 
 				KADER 
		It isn't wise.
 
	At the end of the terrace, there is a construction raised to a level 
	with the stairs that lead to the floor below. There is a large room; 
	through the open door, the lighted interior is visible. The walls have 
	high brick baseboards, and at the bottom of one of the four walls there 
	is a square opening that leads into a hiding place. The closure of the 
	hiding place, a square of very thick wall, is placed to one side. Ali 
	la Pointe is covering it with bricks.
 
	On the other side of the room next to the door, there are some cement 
	wash-basins, and a shed for rain water. Kader appears at the door.
 
				KADER 
		Ali, you must accompany Ben M'Hidi to the 
		Maison des Arbres.
 
	Ali doesn't answer immediately. He finishes placing the last brick then 
	turns to Kader.
 
 				ALI 
		Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
 
 				KADER 
		No, it's better if he doesn't. The house 
		is filled with new people.
 
	Ali gets up, wipes his hands on his trousers, at the same time 
	inspecting the work that he has just completed. 

				ALI 
		Here's another one ready. What a hideout! 
		It really looks like a wall. I'll dirty 
		it a bit, and it's perfect. Want to give 
		a look inside?
 
	Kader has taken a machine gun from one of the basins, and he tosses it 
	to Ali, who catches it. 

				KADER 
		No, go now. It's already late.

	They go out on the terrace. Ali releases the catch of his machine gun 
	so that the bullet slips into the barrel. 

				KADER 
			(to Ben M'Hidi)
		They are a family of militants from way 
		back. Everything will work out well, 
		you'll see ... C'mon, Ali, hurry up.

				BEN M'HIDI 
		Alright. See you tomorrow.

	They say good-bye, embracing one another. Ali has already climbed over 
	the terrace wall, and has jumped to the next one.

	Ben M'Hidi follows him; he is less agile and moves with a bit of 
	trouble.

	From the parapet, Kader says to him:

				KADER 
		Passing along the terraces only takes 
		five minutes ... and with Ali la Pointe, 
		you'll be safe ...

	While jumping, Ben M'Hidi loses his balance, and has to grab on to Ali 
	to prevent himself from falling. 

				BEN M'HIDI
		But it's he who won't be safe with me ...

	The two figures move away from terrace to terrace, and disappear in the 
	dark.
 

86	CASBAH VIEWS AND TERRACES. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	In the dark in front of them, a metallic reflection is visible and the 
	sharp and aggressive sound of an Algerian voice is heard.

	Ali responds to the password.
 
	A youth steps out from the shadows. He too is carrying a machine gun, 
	recognizes Ali, and greets him. Ali and Ben M'Hidi continue ...
 

87	MAISON DES ARBRES, TERRACE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. 

	Until they arrive at a terrace which is separated from the next one by 
	an alley about ten feet wide. 

				ALI 
		Here it is ... we've arrived ... 

	Ben M'Hidi glances at the emptiness beneath them, looks at Ali, and 
	takes a deep breath.
 
				BEN M'HIDI 
		Not yet ...

	Ali has climbed onto the parapet, looks around him concentrating 
	attentively for a moment, and then jumps into the void, reaching the 
	opposite side. He bends, searches for something in the dark, and lifts 
	a type of gangplank.
 
	He hands it over to Ben M'Hidi, and together they place it between the 
	two terraces.
 
				ALI 
		Be careful now. Unless you know how it 
		works, it's better if you sit on the plank 
		and move forward like this ...

				BEN M'HIDI 
		Let's try ...

	He tries to stand up on the gangplank, but he lacks the necessary 
	steadiness. He can't hold his balance. He does as Ali has advised him; 
	he sits astride on the plank, and using the force of his arms, he 
	pushes himself forward. He stops halfway to rest for a minute. 

				BEN M'HIDI 
		It's good nobody is following us ...

				ALI 
		It's a question of habit ...

	And when Ben M'Hidi is closer, Ali helps him to get down to the terrace.

				ALI 
		It's better if I go first, to make sure 
		everything's okay ...

	Without waiting for an answer, he moves toward the stairway that leads 
	to the floor below; his movements are silent and graceful.

	Ben M'Hidi leans out from the terrace, and looks toward the European 
	city and the sea. At the port, two searchlights are lit, and their long 
	bright rays move slowly toward the Casbah ...

 	When Ali la Pointe returns, Ben M'Hidi is still leaning on the railing. 
	He seems not to hear the sound of Ali's footsteps, or his voice.
 
				ALI 
		Everything's okay ... They're waiting for 
		you ...

	Ali moves near him, and Ben M'Hidi turns and looks at him. 

				BEN M'HIDI 
		What do you think of the strike, Ali? 

				ALI 
		I think it'll be a success ...

				BEN M'HIDI
		Yes, I think so too ... It's been 
		organized well ... But what will the 
		French do?
      
	Both the question, and the answer seem obvious to Ali. 

				ALI 
			(shrugging)
		It's clear. They'll do everything 
		possible to make it fail.
 
 				BEN M'HIDI
		No, they'll do even more. We've given 
		them the opportunity to do a lot more ... 
		Do you understand what I mean? Starting 
		tomorrow, they won't be groping in the 
		dark any more; every shop and every 
		worker who strikes will be a known enemy, 
		a self-confessed criminal ... And they 
		will be able to pass to the offensive. 
		Have you thought of this?
 
	Ali has listened attentively. The effort with which he is trying to ask 
	himself the meaning of these words is visible on his face.
 
				ALI 
			(shaking his head)
		No ...
 
 				BEN M'HIDI
		But Kader told me that you weren't in 
		favor of the strike.
 
 				ALI 
		No, and neither were my men. 

 				BEN M'HIDI
		Why?
 
				ALI 
		Because they told us that we mustn't use 
		weapons, now, when the time is right.

 				BEN M'HIDI
		That's true ... Wars aren't won with 
		terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. 
		Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, 
		all the people must act ... This is the 
		reason for the strike, and its necessity: 
		to mobilize all Algerians, count them and 
		measure their strength ...

				ALI 
		To show them to the UN, right?
 
 				BEN M'HIDI 
			(smiling slightly)
		Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the 
		UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this 
		way, we'll give the UN the possibility of 
		evaluating our strength. 

	Ali breathes deeply, instinctively, unrestrainedly, Ben M'Hidi watches 
	him, smiles, and says:
 
 				BEN M'HIDI
		Do you know something Ali? Starting a 
		revolution is hard, and it's even harder 
		to continue it. Winning is hardest of all. 
		But only afterward, when we have won, 
		will the real hardships begin.
 
	He pats Ali's back fondly with his hand and continues, smiling:

				BEN M'HIDI
		Anyway, there's still a lot to be done 
		... you aren't already tired, Ali, are 
		you?
 
	Ali looks at him, and without reacting to his irony: 

				ALI 
			(with conviction)
		No!
 

88 	VARIOUS HOUSES. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAWN. JANUARY 28, 1957. 

	It is gray and smoky dawn, a slow reabsorption of the night, an opaque 
	light which is diffused, sprayed, frozen, to transparency, and 
	rediscovers its outlines and perspectives; and finally, the sun, golden 
	light, awakens all Algiers. To the north, the sea. To the south, the 
	mountains and the Casbah, situated halfway along the coast. The Casbah, 
	still, inert, expectant, on this first day of the strike ...

	The paratroopers are already at their places, one after another, at 
	equal distances like links of a very long chain, strung through every 
	alley, spreading to every sidestreet, twisting through the squares, 
	climbing up the stairways, dividing, joining, and lengthening again. 
	The silence is perfect; the camouflaged immobile forms seem to be part 
	of the landscape.

	Then a brief and sharp hiss, a hundred whistles together. 

	A signal releases the still forms: the attack begins. 

	Doors are beaten down, shots, screams, rifle fire, machine gun fire; 
	the doors opened or broken down; the courtyards, the houses, the rooms, 
	invaded; the men who are trying to escape and who protest and try to 
	save themselves.
 
 				VOICES
		Of course ... I was just going to work ...
 

89	BEN M'HIDI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAWN.

	Ben M'Hidi is inside the hiding place. From outside, an old man helps 
	him to place the square piece of wall over the entrance, and then, in 
	the spaces between the bricks, he adds a paste of plaster mixed with 
	coal dust. When the paras arrive, everything is in order.

	Still men are being seized, beaten, dragged; a cache of weapons; men 
	pushed down the stairs:
 
				SOLDIERS 
		Go on, go on, you little rats! Get to 
		work!


90	CASBAH. STREETS. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
	Women are clinging together after the beatings. 

	Someone is fleeing toward the terraces. We hear the deafening whirl of 
	the helicopters flying against the wind, their cabin doors open, paras 
	sitting on both sides with their legs dangling out, their machine guns 
	on their knees, a loudspeaker for every helicopter, microphones turned 
	on in such a way that the din of the motors is multiplied a hundred 
	times.
 
	The helicopters fly low again, they skirt the terraces. 

	The Algerians are fleeing in terror, the uproar begins to fade away, is 
	less intense; microphones are turned on, and off. The terraces are 
	emptied, men seized, beaten, dragged; all the men are forced outside in 
	the alleys, the streets, the squares, every man is forced to face the 
	wall, his hands up.
 

91	SHOPS. DOORS UNHINGED. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	A truck in reverse, a rope fastened to the hub of the wheels, its other 
	end to a door-latch. The motor is accelerated, clouds of exhaust 
	fumes ...

	Door latches pried open like lids of sardine cans, shop windows smashed 
	with machine-gun butts, the counters, the shelves, flung into the air, 
	the merchandise thrown into the streets; a game, a frenzied 
	excitement ...

	The Algerians watch, but can not intervene. Some shopkeepers rush to 
	the scene, crying despairingly, while others are dragged away forcibly, 
	tossed about, slapped, pushed, forced to open their shops.
 

92	CANDY SHOP. INSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	A shopkeeper is pushed behind the counter; he gets up, trembling with 
	fear.
 
	A para asks him for a bag of candy, pays politely, smiles, pats his 
	bald head, and asks him sweetly:
 
				PARA 
		And the strike, my friend?
 
	Then he distributes the candy among the children who are outside.
 

93	CANDY SHOP. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	The children take the candy silently, without thanking him, then eat 
	the candies slowly, their faces unfriendly and cold ...
 

94	PLACE DU GOUVERNEMENT. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
	The black sky, the trees, the advertising signs ... Cordon Rouge ...
	... an equestrian statue, a car radio, a loudspeaker. 

				LOUDSPEAKER
		"Attention, people of the Casbah! The NLF 
		wants to stop you from working. The NLF 
		forces you to close your shops. 
		Inhabitants of the Casbah, rebel against 
		their orders. France is your country. 
		France has given you civilization and 
		prosperity: schools, streets, hospitals. 
		People of the Casbah, show your love for 
		your mother country, by disobeying the 
		terrorists' orders. Algerians, return to 
		work!"

	And then Algerian music, a cheerful and rhythmical melody; the 
	Algerians are forced out of the Casbah in columns, and are pushed 
	toward the military trucks which clutter the southern side of the 
	square, and continue to arrive and depart.
 

95	CASBAH. EXIT. OUTSIDE. MORNING.

	Meanwhile the paras of the psychological divisions make their first 
	selection, randomly, or else deliberately, basing them on the slightest 
	suspicions. They evaluate each man by his appearance or behavior. They 
	block the Algerians from the exit ramp, and assault them with a battery 
	of questions: 

				PARA'S VOICES
		Who are you? What's your name? Occupation? 
		Where do you work? Why did you strike?
 		They forced you, eh? ... No ... Tell the 
		truth! You promised them, right? Then 
		you're the one who wants to strike. Do 
		you belong to the NLF? C'mon, answer me! 
		Are you afraid to say it? Never mind, it 
		doesn't matter.
 
	The Algerian does not answer, but stares into the para's eyes. The para 
	turns to his companions and shouts:
 
				PARA 
		Jacques! ... Jacques! ... Another one to 
		headquarters! 

	The Algerian is seized, and pushed toward the truck.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		"Attention, Algerians! The NLF wants to 
		stop you from working. The NLF forces you 
		to close your shops. The NLF wants to 
		starve you and condemn you to misery. 
		Algerians, return to work ... !"
 

96	THE PORT. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The port is deserted, the cranes still. A loaded ship sways lazily at 
	her moorings, the fork-lifts are filled with supplies ...

	The limestone is dried out, the bridges empty, dangling cables swing 
	slowly from the pulleys. There is silence in the docks ...

 	Then, the sound of motors approaching, clouds of dust, Arabs pushed out 
	of the trucks, into the shipyard.
 

97	STREETS OF ALGIERS. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	In the streets of the European city, there is an atmosphere of fear and 
	doubt. The shop windows have their shutters lowered halfway, the 
	shopkeepers are standing in the doorways, ready to close.

	The front doors of houses are shut. There are a few hurried passersby 
	but no automobiles; the trams are not running; on the sidewalks the 
	garbage is piled high, nearby the long brooms of the Algerian street 
	cleaners. 

				PARAS
			(yelling)
		Sweep, mes enfants, sweep.

	An Algerian with a very refined expression, a gentle appearance, says, 
	while excusing himself: 

				ALGERIAN 
		I don't know how, sir, I'm sorry ...

	They shove the broom into his hands, and shout to him:
 
				PARA 
		Learn!

				LOUDSPEAKER
		"French citizens! Europeans of Algiers! 
		The strike called by the NLF is a failure. 
		Do not be afraid. Return to your jobs. 
		General Massu guarantees your safety. 
		The Army will protect you!"
 

98	STREETS OF ALGIERS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	A jeep with loudspeaker precedes a row of military trucks loaded with 
	Algerians.

	In every truck there are two paras carrying machine guns by their 
	sides. The Algerians are standing crowded together one against the 
	other. Some of them are holding banners and signs:
 
		I AM GOING TO WORK BECAUSE I AM FREE. 

		WE ARE FREE.

		ARMY-POPULATION-PEACE. 

		THE ARMY PROTECTS OUR RIGHTS.

 	The trucks turn a corner, a youth jumps from the last truck, falls, 
	gets up again, and breaks into a run.

	The paras shout to him to stop, their voices mix with that of the 
	loudspeaker.
 
	The Algerian continues to run.

	A burst of machine-gun fire, then another.

	The Algerian jerks forward, his back curved, his arms raised. 

	He falls down.
 

99	COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. PRESS ROOM AND STAIRWAY. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	Noise, confusion in the Commissioner's office press room, ticking of 
	the teletype machines, throngs of journalists in the telephone room. 
	They are trying to transmit the first news. 

	VARIED VOICES.
      
	Shouting in every language is heard.
 
 				A JOURNALIST
		We are now in the fourth day and the 
		strike continues, with total support by 
		the Arab population. The city is very 
		calm. However -- Calm ... Are you deaf? 
		The city is peaceful. In the Moslem 
		quarters, in the outskirts of the city, 
		in the Casbah ... Bye, will call again, 
		I'm busy.
 
	Through the open door, Mathieu can be seen passing, accompanied by 
	another officer. Some journalists see him, and rush behind him. Some 
	others follow, four or five in all, trying to stop him.

				JOURNALISTS 
		Colonel, colonel ... Excuse me, colonel, 
		a statement ... We don't know anything ... 
		You promised us a press conference ...
		Now there is a meeting with the 
		Commissioner. 

				FIRST JOURNALIST
		Will you tell us what is happening? 

				MATHIEU 
		Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We are still 
		weighing the situation.

	They move to the landing and begin to ascend the stairway that leads to 
	the second floor. The journalists have difficulty keeping up with 
	Mathieu.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Look around. I've put everything at your 
		disposal. Go take a look with your own 
		eyes.

				2ND JOURNALIST
		The strike is a success; but ...

				MATHIEU 
		No. It has failed in its objective. 

				1ST JOURNALIST
		Insurrection? 

				MATHIEU 
		Insurrection.
 
				2ND JOURNALIST 
		But the NLF has always spoken of a strike 
		as a demonstration ...

				MATHIEU 
		And you believe the NLF?
 
				2ND JOURNALIST 
		They seemed to be plausible this time. A 
		general strike is a good argument for the 
		UN.

				MATHIEU 
		The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier 
		to make oneself heard with bombs. If I 
		were in their place, I would use bombs. 

				1ST JOURNALIST
		Armed insurrection ... but what is it 
		exactly?
 
 				OFFICER
		It is an armed insurrection ...

	They have arrived at the second-floor landing, hurry along, and stop in 
	front of a large door, where there is a written sign: PREFECT. Mathieu, 
	at the same time, has continued speaking.
 
 				MATHIEU 
		It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary 
		war; from terrorism, one passes to 
		insurrection ... as from open guerrilla 
		warfare one passes to real war, the latter 
		being the determining factor ...
 
				3RD JOURNALIST
		Dien Bien Phu? 

				MATHIEU 
		Exactly.
 
 	Mathieu glances at the journalist, as if to see if there were any irony 
	in his remark, but the journalist's face is expressionless.
 
				MATHIEU 
		In Indochina, they won. 

				3RD JOURNALIST 
		And here? 

				MATHIEU 
		It depends on you.
 
				4TH JOURNALIST 
		On us? You aren't thinking of drafting us 
		by any chance, are you, colonel?

	Mathieu leans his hand on the door handle and smiles at the 
	journalists.

 				MATHIEU 
		No! We have enough fighters. You have 
		only to write, and well, if possible.

				1ST JOURNALIST 
		What's the problem then?

				MATHIEU 
		Political support. Sometimes it's there, 
		sometimes not ... sometimes, it's not
		enough. What were they saying in Paris 
		yesterday?

				5TH JOURNALIST
		Nothing ... Sartre has written another 
		article ...

	Mathieu gestures and makes an expression as if to say: "see what I 
	mean?" At the same time, he opens the door. But before entering, he 
	turns again to the journalists. 

				MATHIEU 
		Will you kindly explain to me why all the 
		Sartres are always born on the other side?

				5TH JOURNALIST
		Then you like Sartre, colonel ... 

				MATHIEU 
		Not really, but he's even less appealing 
		as an enemy.
 

100	PLACE DU GOUVERNEMENT AND RUE DU DIVAN BLOCKADE. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
 
	Place du Gouvernement, dusk, the other side of the blockade is silent, 
	only the uncovered eyes of the Algerian women who await their men.
 
	The trucks continue to arrive: the men are forced to descend and 
	allowed to enter the Casbah. There is an atmosphere of sadness, for not 
	all the men have returned. The women look at them, scrutinize their 
	faces, from the first to the last in one glance, then slowly ... one 
	face at a time. Some women recognize their husbands, or their brothers 
	or their sons, and run to meet them ... 

	But others continue to ask for news in lowered, sorrowful voices.
 
				AD-LIB VOICES 
		Have you seen Mohamed? Where? When? Why
		hasn't he returned?
 
	A steady hum of voices in Arabic; then the monotonous voice of a 
	policeman who speaks in the microphone of the loudspeaker.
 
				LOUDSPEAKER 
		"The NLF wants to stop you from working. 
		The NLF forces you to close your shops, 
		inhabitants of the Casbah, disobey their 
		orders. France has given you civilization 
		and prosperity: schools, streets, 
		hospitals. People of the Casbah! Show your 
		love for your mother country by disobeying 
		the terrorists' orders."
 
	The loudspeaker is attached to one of the blockade posts, and from it a 
	long wire for the microphone is hanging. The policeman has a raspy and 
	bored voice; he stops speaking and leans the microphone on the table in 
	front of him. He gets up, lights a cigarette, and moves away a few 
	steps.
 
	Two children are among the women and behind the wooden horses 
	barricades. They were waiting for this moment.
 
	They bend, seem to be playing, but one of them lifts the barbed wire
 	as high as he can, from the ground. Petit Omar passes a wire 
	underneath, its farthest end bent in the form of a hook. He moves it 
	toward the microphone cord which is lying coiled on the ground. He 
	succeeds in clasping it and pulls it toward him slowly. The cord  
	unwinds, lengthens, stretches, until the microphone on the table begins 
	to move, until it reaches the edge of the table, and falls ...

	The noise re-echoes in the loudspeaker, but no one pays any attention 
	to it.
 
	Petit Omar waits a second, then begins to pull again. 

	The microphone is dragged along the ground -- a humming sound -- it 
	moves nearer, inch by inch, forward, under the barbed wire, until the 
	children are able to take it, and disappear with it behind the women.
 
				LOUDSPEAKER 
		"Algerians! Brothers! Do not be afraid! 
		Algeria will be free. Be courageous, 
		brothers! Resist! Do not listen to what 
		they are telling you ... Algeria will be 
		free ..."
 
	The voice is not violent, but gentle, somewhat breathless and hurried. 
	It extends to the whole square, so that all can hear it well: the 
	people stop what they are doing to listen. They are emotional, proud, 
	or angry, and look toward the sky where the voice seems to be diffused, 
	as if those words should be written up above.

	The officer is slow to realize what has happened, looks at the 
	loudspeaker, the cord, and now grabs it, cursing. He pulls and tugs it; 
	the wire yields, and he wrenches it from the microphone.
 
				LOUDSPEAKER 
		"Brothers--" 

	The voice is no longer heard, nothing more, silence. 

	Silence, only that something is changed in the women's eyes. The veils 
	that cover the lower half of their faces suddenly begin to tremble, 
	sway as if shaken by a breath, a light wind. There is no longer an 
	atmosphere of sadness, or silence.
 
	JU-JU.

	The ju-jus attack the air, invade it, shake it, make it vibrate as if 
	they were electric charges, or the sound produced by the wind on a 
	field of dry reeds, or the sound produced by a hundred, a thousand 
	fingernails that are scratching a window pane ...
 

101	HEADQUARTERS. PARA. OUTSIDE. DAY.

				PARA 
		One, two, three, four ... Inside! C'mon!
 
	The five Algerians indicated are forced to get up, taken, pushed, and 
	brought inside a large deserted house which is the paras' headquarters.
 
	The other Algerians, about a hundred of them, are sitting on the 
	ground, in the clearing in front of the house, and the paras of the 
	first regiment continue to guard them with pointed machine guns ...

	Suddenly from the villa, the music of a French song comes forth at full 
	blast.
 
	The Algerians look at each other nervously. Even a young para seems to 
	be upset.
 
				1ST PARA 
			(turning to other para)
		What are they doing?
 
 				2ND PARA 
			(smiling)
		Dancing inside ...
 

102	HEADQUARTERS. VILLA. INSIDE. DAY. 

	A para rushes through a corridor carrying a tape recorder, enters a 
	room where there are some sergeants and an Algerian.

	The adjoining room with white tiled walls and a sink is visible through 
	an open door. Two paras are sitting on the floor, smoking and chatting 
	between themselves in whispers. 

	The para places the tape recorder on the table. The Algerian is naked 
	to the waist. Signs of torture are visible. His face is swollen and 
	wet. The sergeant places the chair near him, and helps him to sit down, 
	then starts the tape recorder. He says to the Algerian who is 
	trembling:
 
				SERGEANT
		Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything 
		from the beginning, and then we'll let 
		you go. Name ...
 
				ALGERIAN 
		Sid Ahmed.
 
				SERGEANT
		Second name.
 
				ALGERIAN 
		Sail.
 
				SERGEANT
		Which "district" do you belong to? 

				ALGERIAN 
		Second district ...

				SERGEANT
		Second district ... Explain better ...

				ALGERIAN 
		Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
 
				SERGEANT
		What "group"? 

				ALGERIAN 
		Third group.

				SERGEANT
		Third group. What's your assignment? 

				ALGERIAN 
		Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
 

103	VILLA. HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAY.
 
 	In a room on the ground floor, a captain is bent over a large map with 
	graphs, and is writing the name Sid Ahmed Sail in one of the blocks at 
	the bottom of the pyramid ...
 
	At the same time, paras are seen through the large window, bringing 
	other Algerians to the villa, and immediately afterward, the music and 
	song are heard again very loudly.
 

104	CASBAH ALLEY. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. 

	Night, darkness, locked doors. The Casbah is silent. The paras tread 
	noiselessly on their rubber soles. Patrols. 

	A flashlight searches for the number of a door, then stops. A para 
	knocks discreetly. 

	NOISES INSIDE. VOICES.

				ALGERIAN VOICE
		Who is it?
 
 				PARA
		Sid Ahmed ... Sid Ahmed Sail.
 
	The door is opened, the paras break in.
 

105	ANOTHER ALLEY. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	Another alley in the Casbah, other paras. 

	Another door forced open, broken into.
 
	Algerians are crowded together in a courtyard which is illuminated with 
	electric flares. 

	They are being interrogated.
 

106	CASBAH STREET. OUTSIDE. DAY. RAIN. 

	A cloudy day, a light drizzle, a sloping street, Algerian music. A 
	company of zouaves walk two by two in the Casbah, through the alleys, 
	stop, play their music, and move on again, alternating Algerian music 
	and a French song.

	Behind them, a line of donkeys with baskets full of packages and bags, 
	and cheerful paras who are joking, as they distribute the supplies to 
	the starving women and children, who stand ashamed in front of their
	houses, their eyes lowered, their gestures too brusque, and hesitant.
 
				SPEAKER
		"At the General Assembly of the United 
		Nations, none of the motions presented in 
		the course of the debate has obtained the 
		necessary majority. At last an agreement 
		has been reached on a resolution that 
		excludes any form of direct intervention 
		by the UN in the Algerian question. The 
		Assembly of the United Nations has limited 
		itself to expressing the hope that in a 
		spirit of cooperation, a peaceful, 
		democratic, and just solution will be 
		found, that conforms to the principles of 
		the United Nations Charter ..."
 
	The monotony of the last words is drowned out and lost. It is raining 
	more heavily now. The water has begun to run along the sloping alleys. 
	The walls are gray, wet; the doors of the cafes and shops are barred 
	with signs nailed upon them. 

		THIS SHOP HAS SUPPORTED THE NLF STRIKE. 
		THE PREFECT HAS ORDERED ITS CLOSING UNTIL 
		FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. 

	The band of zouaves has stopped again, and now they are playing "La vie 
	en rose."
 

107	VILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAWN.
 
 	In some parts of the villa a gramophone is playing "La vie en rose."
 
	In the room on the first floor, through the large window, the whiteness 
	of the dawn is visible. The desk is cluttered with beer cans and 
	thermos. Mathieu and other officers have their eyes fixed on the graph, 
	where the captain is marking other small crosses at the bottom of the 
	pyramid. The scene is motionless; their expressions are dull. Everyone 
	seems to be incapable of movement, overcome by the dull apathy that
	always follows a sleepless night.

	Until Mathieu breaks the stillness of the scene. 

				MATHIEU
		Good ... Good work ... Now we can all go 
		to sleep. 

	And moving together with the others, he continues.
 
				MATHIEU 
		The end of the strike doesn't change 
		anything. The directives remain the same. 
		Give your men the usual shifts. We must 
		remain in the Casbah: twenty-four hours a 
		day! 

	He turns and points to the graph. 

				MATHIEU 
		We must cling to it, and work fast!

	Then he turns to the officers and smiling, says in another tone of 
	voice:
 
				MATHIEU 
		Have any of you ever had a tapeworm?
 
	The officers say "no" and laugh.

				MATHIEU 
		The tapeworm is a worm that can grow to 
		infinity. There are thousands of segments. 
		You can destroy all of them; but as long 
		as the head remains, it reproduces itself 
		immediately. It is the same thing with the 
		NLF. The head is the General Staff, four 
		persons. Until we are able to eliminate 
		them, we must always start again from the 
		beginning.

	While he is speaking, Mathieu takes his wallet from his back pocket, 
	opens it, takes out four photos.

				MATHIEU 
		I found these in the police archives. 
		They are old shots, but I made some 
		close-ups. Ramel ... Si Mourad ... 
		Kader ... Ali la Pointe. We must print a 
		thousand copies and distribute them to 
		the men.
 
	Meanwhile, the photos are passed around.

	There are photos taken from identification cards, or blown up from some 
	group shots, figures somewhat blurred, faded, smiling, peaceful ...
 

108	NLF LEADERS' HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	In the dim light, the four faces are barely illuminated. The shadows 
	tone down their expressions: Kader, Ali la Pointe, Ramel, Si Mourad. 
	They are crowded into the hiding place, sitting on the floor, 
	motionless, their eyes staring straight ahead, their breathing heavy. 
	From outside, noises, voices that are fading in the distance. Silence. 

	Then, a discreet knock, a remark in Arabic.
 
	The four breathe deeply, look at each other, then smile a little.

	Ali unslips the beam which, placed through an iron ring, is holding 
	shut the door of the hiding place. Using the soles of his feet, he 
	pushes against the square of wall: the light enters violently. It is 
	not electric light, but daylight.
 
	Kader blinks his eyes to accustom them to the light, then goes out on 
	all fours; after him, Ramel, and then the others. They leave the hiding 
	place that Ali built in the wash-house on the terrace.
 

109	COMPLEX OF KADER'S HOUSE. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	All of them have machine guns. Ramel is very tall and robust, about 
	thirty years old.
 
	Si Mourad is slightly older than Ramel. His movements are slow and 
	precise; his glance expresses patience and authority. Djamila is 
	waiting for them.
 
				DJAMILA 
		You can come out. Thank God. There were so 
		many this time, about ten.

	Ali recloses the hiding place.
 
 				KADER 
		Paratroopers? 

				DJAMILA 
		Yes.
 
 				KADER 
		What do you think? Did they come here on 
		purpose or by accident?
 
				DJAMILA 
		No. By accident. They asked some questions, 
		but they didn't touch anyone.
 
	Ali has come out of the wash-house. The sun is high, and helicopters 
	are seen passing one another in the sky. On some faraway terraces, 
	bivouacs of paras are visible. They are guarding the Casbah from above.
	
	The rumble of motors and the voice of the loudspeaker are heard more 
	clearly as they near the house.
 
				LOUDSPEAKER
		"Attention! Attention! Inhabitants of the 
		Casbah! The terrorist Ben Amin has been 
		executed this morning. Qrara Normendine 
		has been arrested. Boussalem Ali has been 
		arrested. Bel Kasel Maussa has been 
		arrested. Inhabitants of the Casbah! The 
		NFL has been defeated. Rebel against the 
		remaining terrorists who want to force 
		you to continue a bloody and futile 
		struggle. People of the Casbah, the 
		terrorist Ben Amin has been executed. 
		Help us to build a free and peaceful 
		Algeria. Inhabitants of the Casbah, the 
		NLF has been defeated. Rebel against the 
		remaining terrorists who want to force 
		you to continue a bloody and futile 
		struggle. Attention! Attention! 
		Inhabitants of the Casbah! The terrorist 
		Ben Amin has been executed this morning. 
		Qrara Normendine has been arrested. 
		Boussalem Ali has been arrested. Bel 
		Kasem Moussa has been arrested. 
		Inhabitants of the Casbah -- the NLF has
		been defeated ..."
 
 	The voice fades away and is no longer heard. At the same time, a woman 
	has come up from the floor below, carrying a tray of cups and a teapot.

	Ali looks at her quickly, but then watching her more closely, he sees 
	that she is crying. When she passes near him, he stops her, places his 
	hand kindly on her shoulder, and asks her in Arabic why she is crying.

 	DIALOGUE IN ARABIC BETWEEN ALI AND WOMAN. 

	The woman shakes her head, tries to smile, but says nothing. Then she 
	enters the wash-house silently and begins to serve the tea.
 
				KADER 
		It's better to split up, to increase our 
		chances. We must change hiding places, and 
		change them continually ... In the 
		meantime, we must make new contacts, 
		replace our arrested brothers, reorganize 
		our sections--
 
				ALI 
			(interrupting him)
		Yes, but we must also show them that we 
		still exist.
 
 				KADER 
		Of course. As soon as possible.
 
				ALI 
		No, immediately. The people are 
		demoralized. Leave this to me ...
 
 				KADER 
		No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as 
		we are free, the NLF continues to exist 
		in the Casbah. If they manage to take us 
		too, there won't be anything left ... And 
		from nothing comes nothing ...

				RAMEL 
			(intervening)
		But it's also necessary to do something ...
 
				KADER 
		And we will do something, don't worry. As 
		soon as we have reestablished contacts ...
 
 				MOURAD
		And our movements?
 
				KADER 
		For this too we've got to change methods.
 

110	MUNICIPAL STADIUM. OUTSIDE. DAY. FEBRUARY 10, 1957.

	The municipal stadium is crowded with people. There is a football game 
	between two European teams. It is almost the end of the first half. 
	From above to the right of the guest box, there is a very loud 
	explosion.
 
	Strips of flesh are hurled into the air. Thick, white smoke ... There 
	are screams of terror. The people try to move away in haste. They are 
	shoving, pushing, bumping into one another ... Then, calm returns. The 
	sirens of the ambulances are heard.

	The stretcher, the dead carried away, scores of wounded.
 

111	PREFECT'S OFFICE. PRESS HALL. INSIDE. DAY. FEBRUARY 25.
 
 	Ben M'Hidi is standing in front of the journalists with handcuffs on 
	his wrists and ankles. He is without a tie. He is smiling a little, his 
	glance ironical. There are two paras behind him with machine guns 
	ready. The picture is still for an instant; Ben M'Hidi's smile is 
	steady, so too his eyes, his entire face. Flashes, clicking of cameras.
 
				1ST JOURNALIST
		Mr. Ben M'Hidi ... Don't you think it is 
		a bit cowardly to use your women's baskets 
		and handbags to carry explosive devices 
		that kill so many innocent people?
 
	Ben M'Hidi shrugs his shoulders in his usual manner and smiles a 
	little.
 
				BEN M'HIDI 
		And doesn't it seem to you even more 
		cowardly to drop napalm bombs on unarmed 
		villages, so that there are a thousand 
		times more innocent victims? Of course, 
		if we had your airplanes it would be a lot 
		easier for us. Give us your bombers, and 
		you can have our baskets.

				2ND JOURNALIST
		Mr. Ben M'Hidi ... in your opinion, has 
		the NLF any chance to beat the French 
		army?

				BEN M'HIDI
		In my opinion, the NLF has more chances 
		of beating the French army than the 
		French have to stop history. 

	The press hall in the prefect's office is crowded with journalists of 
	every nationality. At the side and central aisles there are 
	photographers and cameramen.
 
	Ben M'Hidi is opposite them, standing on a low wooden platform. Mathieu 
	is next to him, seated behind a small desk. Mathieu now gets up, and 
	signals to two paratroopers. Another journalist simultaneously has 
	asked another question:
 
 				3RD JOURNALIST
		Mr. Ben M'Hidi, Colonel Mathieu has said 
		that you have been arrested by accident, 
		practically by mistake. In fact, it seems 
		that the paratroopers were looking for 
		someone much less important than yourself. 
		Can you tell us why you were in that 
		apartment at rue Debussy last night?
 
	The two paras have moved forward and they take Ben M'Hidi by the arms. 
	At the same time, he answers.
 
				BEN M'HIDI
		I can only tell you that it would have 
		been better if I had never been there ...
 
 				MATHIEU 
			(intervening)
		That's enough, gentlemen. It's late, and 
		we all have a lot of work ...
 
	Ben M'Hidi glances at him ironically. 

				BEN M'HIDI
		Is the show already over?
 
				MATHIEU 
			(smiling)
		Yes, it's over ... before it becomes 
		self-defeating.

	The paras lead Ben M'Hidi away. He moves away with short steps, as much 
	as he can with the irons that are tightened around his ankles. Mathieu 
	has turned to the journalists and smiles again.
 

112	PREFECT'S OFFICE. PRESS HALL. INSIDE. DAY. MARCH 4. 

	Colonel Mathieu is standing. On his face is a brief smile, motionless, 
	his eyes attentive, but half-closed somewhat, due to the camera 
	flashes.
 
 				1ST JOURNALIST
		Colonel Mathieu ... the spokesman for the 
		residing minister, Mr. Gorlin, has stated 
		that "Larbi Ben M'Hidi committed suicide 
		in his own cell, hanging himself with 
		pieces of his shirt, that he had used to 
		make a rope, and then attached to the 
		bars of his cell window." In a preceding 
		statement, the same spokesman had 
		specified that: "... due to the intention 
		already expressed by the prisoner Ben 
		M'Hidi to escape at the first opportunity, 
		it has been necessary to keep his hands 
		and feet bound continually." In your 
		opinion, colonel, in such conditions, is 
		a man capable of tearing his shirt, 
		making a rope from it, and attaching it 
		to a bar of the window to hang himself?
 
				MATHIEU 
		You should address that question to the 
		minister's spokesman. I'm not the one who 
		made those statements ... On my part, I 
		will say that I had the opportunity to 
		admire the moral strength, intelligence, 
		and unwavering idealism demonstrated by 
		Ben M'Hidi. For these reasons, although 
		remembering the danger he represented, I 
		do not hesitate to pay homage to his 
		memory.
 
		 		2ND JOURNALIST
		Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said 
		lately not only of the successes 
		obtained by the paratroopers, but also of 
		the methods that they have employed ... 
		Can you tell us something about this? 

				MATHIEU 
		The successes obtained are the results 
		of those methods. One presupposes the 
		other and vice versa.
 
				3RD JOURNALIST 
		Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression 
		that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... 
		my colleagues continue to ask the same 
		allusive questions, to which you can only 
		respond in an allusive manner. I think it 
		would be better to call things by their 
		right names; if one means torture, then 
		one should call it torture.

				MATHIEU 
		I understand. What's your question?

				3RD JOURNALIST
		The questions have already been asked. I 
		would only like some precise answers, 
		that's all ...
 
 				MATHIEU 
		Let's try to be precise then. The word 
		"torture" does not appear in our orders. 
		We have always spoken of interrogation as 
		the only valid method in a police 
		operation directed against unknown 
		enemies. As for the NLF, they request 
		that their members, in the event of 
		capture, should maintain silence for 
		twenty-four hours, and then, they may 
		talk. Thus, the organization has already
 		had the time necessary to render useless 
		any information furnished ... What type 
		of interrogation should we choose? ... 
		the one the courts use for a crime of 
		homicide which drags on for months?
 
 				3RD JOURNALIST
		The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
 
				MATHIEU 
		And those who explode bombs in public 
		places, do they perhaps respect the law? 
		When you asked that question to Ben 
		M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, 
		gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious 
		circle. And we could discuss the problem 
		for hours without reaching any 
		conclusions. Because the problem does 
		not lie here. The problem is: the NLF 
		wants us to leave Algeria and we want to 
		remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite 
		varying shades of opinion, you all agree 
		that we must remain. When the rebellion 
		first began, there were not even shades 
		of opinion. All the newspapers, even the 
		left-wing ones wanted the rebellion 
		suppressed. And we were sent here for 
		this very reason. And we are neither 
		madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who 
		call us fascists today, forget the 
		contribution that many of us made to the 
		Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do 
		not know that among us there are 
		survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We 
		are soldiers and our only duty is to 
		win. Therefore, to be precise, I would 
		now like to ask you a question: Should 
		France remain in Algeria? If you answer 
		"yes," then you must accept all the 
		necessary consequences.
 

113	CASBAH HOUSES. TORTURE SEQUENCE. INSIDE. DAY.

	Casbah, bedrooms, kitchens, bathrooms.
 
	Sharp, white light; motionless faces, figures paused midway in 
	gestures.
 
	Women, children ... glassy eyes ...

	Background motionless like in a landscape.

	Algerians ... wild eyes ... animals being led to slaughter.

	Paras, their every gesture measured exactly, perfection achieved.
 
	An Algerian is lying down on the table, his arms and ankles bound with 
	belts.

	An Algerian, in the form of a wheel, an iron bar in the curvature of 
	his knees, his ankles tied to his wrists. 

	Electrical wires wrenched from their outlets, a generator with crank, 
	extended pliers with their prongs open wide, the tops of the wires held 
	between two prongs, the pliers applied to a naked body, the most 
	sensitive parts: lips, tongue, ears, nipples, heart, sexual organs ...

	Faucets, tubing, buckets, funnels, a mouth forced open, held open, with 
	a wooden wedge, tubing in the mouth, rags scattered around, water, a 
	belly that is swelling . .. The torture is precise in every detail, and 
	every detail points to a technique that is taken apart and reassembled.
 

114	UPPER CASBAH ALLEY. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The chorus of the Koran school like ceaseless wailing, like a stubborn 
	will to survive that seems to be spreading through the Casbah.

	Petit Omar looks up instinctively, his small face hardened and 
	taciturn, like that of an adult, then enters the school.
 

115	KORAN SCHOOL. INSIDE. DAY. 

	The children are sitting on the mats, motionless; only their lips are 
	moving. There is an oblique light, the teacher is in the shadow.

	RELIGIOUS CHORUS.

	Petit Omar approaches the teacher who shakes his head in denial. Omar 
	goes out.
 

116	CASBAH STREETS. PATROLS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	The Casbah is patrolled by paratroopers; helmets, machine guns, 
	portable radios, police dogs ...

	Paratroopers are erecting loudspeakers at every street corner. 
	Paratroopers with brushes and buckets of paint are marking the doors of 
	the Casbah with large numbers. From time to time, machine-gun fire is 
	heard in the distance.

	Algerians are standing against the wall, their hands up. There is a 
	dead man a few feet away, an Algerian youth. The paratroopers turn him 
	over and search him. A child with terrified eyes turns around a little.
 
	A para transmits the dead man's name into the portable radio.
 

117	CASBAH. OTHER STREETS. OUTSIDE. DAY.

	A car radio receives and transmits the same name; and then the name is 
	repeated by the loudspeakers scattered throughout the Casbah.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		"Inhabitants of the Casbah! The rebellion 
		gets weaker every day. The terrorist Ben 
		Amin has been executed. Kasem Moussa has 
		been arrested. He was commander of the 2nd 
		Sector NLF. Inhabitants of the Casbah! The 
		terrorists are not your true brothers. 
		Leave them to their fate. Rely on the 
		protection of the French army. Denounce 
		the terrorists and agitators. Cooperate 
		with us to reestablish peace and 
		prosperity in Algeria ..."
 

118	FOUR WOMEN. STREET. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	Four women, their faces veiled, meet a patrol of paras in a small 
	street.
 
	Two of the paras stop the last woman, and lift her dress, uncovering 
	her feet and ankles -- those of a man. The tear away her veil.

	The man is Ali. At the same time, there is ...
 
	MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
 
	The two paras fall to the ground. Ali grasps his weapon, visible 
	through the opening of his cloak. The other paras fling themselves to 
	the ground.
 
	The other three women flee, while Ali continues to shoot, then runs 
	away.
 
	The four flee through the narrow streets and alleys, climb a stairway, 
	and leap from one terrace to another. Behind them, shouts, whistles, 
	and machine-gun fire are heard. And moving nearer ...

	BARKING OF DOGS.


119 	COURTYARD WITH WELL. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The four enter a courtyard. Ali's three companions have also lifted 
	their veils. They are Kader, Mourad, and Ramel. 

	A woman rushes to shut the door while a man leads the four toward an 
	opening hidden by some boxes.
 
	The others who are in the courtyard, women and children, are also busy 
	helping, silently, hurriedly, in a tense atmosphere of solidarity with 
	the four fugitives. 

	Very near are heard ...
 
	BARKING OF DOGS AND PARAS' HURRIED FOOTSTEPS. 

	A woman runs toward the door and throws some large handfuls of pepper 
	under the cracks.
 

120 	STREET COURTYARD WITH WELL. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The group of pursuers -- paras who are holding police dogs by leashes 
	-- slow down in front of the door. 

	BARKING DOGS.
 
	The animals sniff the ground, then move on together with the paras.
 

121	ARAB BATH. INSIDE. DAY.

	Petit Omar enters the large steamy room. He moves near the manager and 
	hands him an envelope. The manager slips it quickly under the counter.
 
				SPEAKER
		"To all NLF militants! Reorganize! Replace 
		your fallen and arrested brothers. Make 
		new contacts! This is a grave moment. 
		Resist brothers! The General Staff leaves 
		you free to take any and all necessary 
		offensives ...
 

122 	CASBAH HOUSE. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	All the inhabitants of a house. The men are in a row on the balcony of 
	the first floor, their hands crossed behind their heads, their backs to 
	the wall, while paras guard them with pointed machine guns.

	Two paratroopers lead an Algerian girl forward: she seems to be 
	exhausted, and can barely walk, her eyes half-closed. 

	They stop in front of the first man and ask her:
 
 				PARAS 
		Is this one?

				SPEAKER
		"Our hearts are breaking before such 
		outrages, our houses invaded, our 
		families massacred. Brothers, rebel! 
		Bring terror to the European city!"
 

123	ALGERIAN STREETS. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
 
 	The European city, evening, houses are being lit. People have finished 
	working. They are going to the bars, cinemas, or for walks, or crowding 
	the bus stops ...
 
	The wail of a siren at full blast, an ambulance, driven at frightening 
	speed.
 
	The people move aside, jump to the sidewalks. The cars squeeze to the 
	right, stop.
 
	The ambulance door is opened, a corpse is thrown out, falls, rolls into 
	the street.
 
	The people rush to it. It is a hospital attendant's in white uniform 
	with a knife stuck in his throat.
 
	The sound of the siren decreases in intensity; the ambulance is by now 
	far away.
 

124 	AMBULANCE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. EVENING. 

	In the driver's cab, there are two Algerian boys. Their hair is curly, 
	their shirts old and torn. They are sweating; their eyes wide open, 
	staring.
 
	The one who is driving barely reaches the height of the steering wheel. 
	He clutches it desperately. The other has a machine gun. He makes a 
	remark in Arabic shouting to be heard above the siren.

	The driver takes a hand off the steering wheel, places it on the 
	dashboard, and tries all the switches until he finds the one for the 
	headlights. The high beams.
 
	The other, meanwhile, is now on his knees on the seat. He is leaning 
	out the open window to his waist, and he begins to shoot.


125	ROUTE OF AMBULANCE. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
 
 	The pictures succeed one another in a dizzy rhythm; surprise, terror, 
	someone falls. 

	SHOTS. SIREN.
 

126	AMBULANCE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. EVENING.
 
	There is no more ammunition. The machine gun is thrown in the back of 
	the ambulance. The siren is still at full blast. The auto races ahead 
	at terrifying speed. The two boys don't know any more what to do, where 
	to go, and the one who is driving has his eyes almost closed, as if he 
	were dizzy. 

	They reach a square. 

	SIREN.
 
	The other points ahead to the left.
 

127	BUS SHELTER. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
 
 	The people are crowded in a bus shelter. The one who is driving doesn't 
	understand or doesn't want to.

	The other shouts to him again and again, the same phrase, then flings 
	himself on the steering wheel, and turns it in that direction.
 
	The bus shelter is nearer and nearer.
 
	The people are paralyzed. They have no time to move. They are run down, 
	rammed into. The ambulance crashes into a pillar.

	On the ground, all about, the bodies of dead and wounded. The boys' 
	bodies remain motionless, their foreheads resting on the smashed 
	windshield.
 
	But the sound of the siren does not stop, and is heard, mournful and 
	full of anguish.
 

128	RAMEL'S HOUSE. IMPASSE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL. 
	OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. AUGUST 26.
 
	Impasse St. Vincent-de-Paul, noon. There are helicopters in the sky, 
	and paras fill the alley.
 
	Their faces are pale and tense, their eyes wide open, their hands 
	clutch their machine guns. There is a strange silence. Then a movement 
	at the back of the alley, a voice, a brief greeting. Mathieu has 
	arrived and he is saying to an officer:
 
 				MATHIEU 
		Now is not the time for heroes. Give me 
		the megaphone. 

	Mathieu takes the megaphone in his hands and approaches an open door. 
	Through the doorway the inner courtyard of the house is visible where 
	the corpses of four paras are strewn about.
 
	Ramel and Si Mourad are on the first-floor balcony, lying in wait 
	behind the railings, so they are able to watch the door, courtyard, and 
	the stairway that leads from the balcony to the terrace.

	On the terrace there are other paras who are facing the balcony. From 
	time to time they release a burst of machine gun fire.

	The voice of Mathieu is heard over the loudspeaker.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Ramel ... Si Mourad ... use your heads. 
		If you go on like this, I wouldn't want to 
		be in your place when you are captured ... 
		Because you will be captured in the end, 
		and you know it too. Surrender! If you do 
		it immediately, I promise that you will 
		not be harmed and you will have a fair 
		trial. Can you hear me?
 
	Ramel and Si Mourad look at each other.
 
 				MOURAD
		Who is speaking?

				MATHIEU 
		Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
 
 				MOURAD
		We don't trust you, colonel. Come 
		forward, show yourself.
 
	A moment of silence.

				MATHIEU 
		I don't trust you either. First stand up 
		so I can see you, and keep your hands 
		still and well in sight.

	Mourad hesitates an instant, glances at Ramel, then: 

 				MOURAD
		Okay. But we want your promise for a fair 
		trial in writing. Give us a written 
		statement, Mathieu, and then we'll 
		surrender. 

				MATHIEU 
		How can I give you this statement? 

				MOURAD
		We'll lower a basket from the window ...

				MATHIEU 
		Okay, I'll make the statement in 
		writing ...

	Mourad shows his companion the two large time-bombs that are on the 
	floor in front of him. He takes one, begins to prepare it, and 
	regulates the mechanism.

	At the same time, he tells Ramel in Arabic to go find the basket.
 
	Ramel crawls past the doors which are all closed, and asks for a basket.

	A door opens and an old woman appears. She hands him a basket with its 
	cord rolled up.
 
				MOURAD
			(without turning around)
		A newspaper too, or a piece of paper ...
 
	Ramel brings him the basket and newspaper. Mourad has loaded the time-
	bomb mechanism, and the tic-toc sound is sharp and clear.

	Now he has to move the second hand. Mourad's hands do not tremble, his 
	glance is attentive, concentrating. Ramel watches him without saying a 
	word; his fear is obvious. 

	Without moving, his eyes glued to the bomb dial:
 
				MOURAD
			(loudly)
		Are you ready, colonel?
 
				MATHIEU 
		Yes ... But let me first see you.

	Mourad moves one of the clock hands to precede the other one by a 
	minute. Immediately afterward he places the flat and rectangular bomb 
	in the bottom of the basket.
 
	The basket seems to be empty. The piece of newspaper protects its 
	bottom. Mourad tells Ramel to get up, and he too gets up. Their machine 
	guns are lying on the ground. Meanwhile, Mourad has begun to count to 
	himself silently, his lips moving: one, two, three, four ... 

	From the terrace, the paras can see Ramel and Mourad standing up not 
	very far away, their empty hands resting near the basket on the 
	railing. 

	A para shouts:
 
 				PARA 
		We see them. You can come.
 
	Mourad begins to lower the basket very slowly.
 
				MOURAD 
			(counting)
		60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53 ...

	Mathieu enters the courtyard together with an officer and other paras. 
	He looks up toward the balcony, smiles, and shows them a folded piece 
	of paper.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Here it is ... you know that when I give 
		my word, I keep it ...
 
	Mourad does not answer, but looks at Mathieu as if to calculate the 
	distance and time, and slows down even more the basket's descent.

	Mathieu moves forward a few steps, as if to go for the basket that is 
	hanging on the other side of the courtyard, but suddenly he seems 
	perplexed for a second, and then changes his mind. He turns to the 
	nearest para, and gives him the note.
 
				MATHIEU
		You go ...

	Mourad's face has remained motionless. In his expression there is a 
	shade of disappointment. He sees Mathieu retrace his steps toward the 
	door, and is now surrounded by a group of paratroopers ...

				MOURAD 
			(counting) 
		25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19 ...

	The basket has stopped moving two yards from the ground. In order to 
	reach it, the para has to step over the corpses of his dead companions, 
	his face hardens, he reaches the basket, and extending his arm, he 
	throws in the note. The basket does not move; the para looks up.

				PARA 
			(muttering)
		Hurry up, black bastard!
 
	Mourad smiles at him, and mumbles something in Arabic, a phrase that he 
	doesn't manage to finish, for now is heard -- the explosion.
 

129	RUE CATON 4. FATHIA'S HOUSE. INSIDE. NIGHT. SEPTEMBER 2.

	Rue Caton number four. It is 11 p.m. A large, badly lit room is filled 
	with paratroopers and one of them is now being carried away on a 
	stretcher. Another three or four wounded are seated on the opposite 
	side of the room and are waiting their turn to be carried away.

	Two paras are by the door. They look out from time to time, and are 
	attentive, ready, with machine guns clutched by their sides.
 
	On the other side of the room opposite the door, the Algerians who live 
	in the house are standing against the wall. Mathieu is in front of 
	them, and he is asking a group of women:

				MATHIEU
		Which one of you is Fathia?

	A woman about forty years old raises her eyes toward him.
 
				MATHIEU
		Is it you?

	The woman nods yes.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Go up the stairs, and tell Kader that if 
		they don't surrender, we'll blow up 
		everything ... Do you understand? 

	The woman again nods yes, and without waiting for more words, she moves 
	toward the door, taciturn, silent. Mathieu follows her, he pushes past 
	her.

				MATHIEU 
		Try to convince him, if you care about 
		your house ... Wait a minute ... Do you 
		want to get killed? 

	He leans out the door and says loudly:
 
				MATHIEU 
		Kader, look. Fathia is coming ... I 
		wouldn't shoot ...
 
	Then he steps aside and lets the woman pass.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Go on ...
 
	Outside the door, there is a small landing, then a steep stairway, and 
	at the top, a corridor. Fathia climbs the stairs that are cluttered 
	with empty magazines, with cartridge boxes. The walls are chipped from 
	the shooting. The ceiling is parallel to the stairway at the same 
	inclination, for part of its distance. But for the last few yards, it 
	straightens out and lowers to become horizontal.

	The floor of the hiding place is open. Inside are Zohra and Kader.

	Fathia repeats to them in Arabic what Mathieu has said to her.

	Kader listens to her then answers, he too in Arabic. Then he smiles.
 
				KADER 
		Okay ... You can tell the colonel to blow 
		up whatever he likes. Go on, now.
 
	Fathia goes down the stairs, and reenters the room.
 
				FATHIA 
			(to Mathieu)
		He said that you can blow up whatever 
		you like ...

	She, then, rejoins the other women.

	Mathieu seems to be tired, he has lost weight, he is nervous. He turns 
	to his men, and slowly as he gives the orders, the paras begin to move.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Return to where the others are. Prepare 
		the plastic. It should be placed on the 
		ceiling of the stairway under the hiding 
		place ... a long fuse rolled up ... Take 
		cover ... keep shooting while you are 
		working. Quickly! Clear the house ... 
		Bring them outside, then check the rooms 
		again ... Hurry up!
 
	Kader gives Zohra a box of matches. She goes to the back of the hiding 
	place where there is a bundle of papers. She lights them, then returns 
	near to Kader who is inspecting the magazine of his machine gun.

	There are only two shots left. The other empty magazines are scattered 
	around. Kader turns to Zohra, and starts to speak, but suddenly his 
	words are blurred by the sound of shots. 

	Kader and Zohra have to step back a little, because the shells are 
	flashing at the edge of the opening.
 
	The shooting stops. From the stairway, one end of a long fuse is 
	thrown into the corridor. The other end is inserted into a plastic 
	charge fastened to the ceiling of the stairway, under the hiding place.
 
	Kader and Zohra can see two or three yards in front of them, below, 
	into the corridor, where the end of the fuse is glowing and burning.

	Kader too has lost weight, his beard is long. He looks at the fuse, 
	then at Zohra. A second passes in silence. Now Zohra too looks at him, 
	and Kader says calmly in his usual voice:

				KADER 
		It doesn't do any good to die like this ... 
		it doesn't help anybody ...

	He leans out from the hiding place.
 
				KADER 
			(shouting)
		Mathieu! If you give your word that you 
		won't touch any of the other people in 
		the house, we'll come out.
 

130	MILITARY CAR. INSIDE. NIGHT. 

	Inside a military automobile.

	In the back seat, Mathieu is sitting next to Kader who is handcuffed.
 
	Zohra is in the front seat, between the driver and a para who has in 
	his hand a large regulation pistol. The interior is lighted by the 
	headlights of a jeep which is following directly behind the auto a few 
	yards. Silence. Mathieu looks hastily at Kader, who is staring straight 
	in front of him, and appears to be sullen and downcast.

	Then Mathieu speaks in a pleasant tone, as if in friendly conversation.

				MATHIEU
		If you had let me blow you up, you would 
		have disappointed me ...

	Kader turns to him, and replies, trying to maintain his own voice at 
	the same level of indifference:
	 
				KADER
		Why?
 
				MATHIEU 
		For many months, I've had your photo on 
		my desk together with a dozen or so 
		reports on you ... And naturally, I am 
		under the illusion that I know you 
		somewhat. You never seemed the type, 
		Kader, inclined to performing useless 
		actions. 

	Kader doesn't answer right away, then speaks slowly as if expressing 
	the results of his doubts, a new point of view ...
 
 				KADER 
		You seem to be very satisfied to have 
		taken me alive ...
 
 				MATHIEU 
		Of course I am.
 
				KADER 
		That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I 
		credited you with an advantage greater 
		than I should have.

				MATHIEU 
		No. Let's just say that you've given me 
		the satisfaction to have guessed 
		correctly. But from the technical point 
		of view, it isn't possible to speak of 
		advantages. By now the game is over. The 
		NLF has been defeated.

	Zohra has turned around suddenly. She is crying and speaks hastily in 
	Arabic, violently, harshly.

	Mathieu doesn't understand, and turns to Kader to ask him politely, 
	although with a bit of irony:

				MATHIEU 
		What is she saying?

				KADER 
		She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
 

131	CROWDED BEACH. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	Ali la Pointe's glance is sullen, heavy, motionless. He moves his head 
	slowly in such a way so that his glance also moves in a semicircle.

	White beach, fine sand, transparent sea, bodies stretched out in the 
	sun, golden skin of girls; girls in bikinis, sensual, smiling, young 
	men with narrow hips, with muscles well cared for, cheerful youth, 
	naturally happy, enviable. The children are building sand castles near 
	the water's edge; the beach is shaped like a half-moon with rocky reefs 
	at both ends ...
 
	A September Sunday, warm and calm. Ali is leaning on the wall. He is 
	wearing a white wool cloak. Only his eyes are visible ... the eyes of a
 	hungry tiger perched above a path, on the lookout for innocent prey. 
	Eyes that now gleam, cruel eyes, tension dilating the pupils ... Then
	again the calm, a gloomy calm, a gratifying tension. The place is 
	right, and the victims couldn't be better ones.

	Ali moves, leaves the wall, crosses the street to a large city 
	sanitation truck, one of those metallic trucks with no visible 
	openings.

	A young Algerian is at the steering wheel, a street cleaner. He is 
	leaning his thin face on the wheel. His hands are dirty, by now 
	unwashable from years of work.

	Ali has climbed into the cab. The truck is in motion and leaves.
 

132	SANITATION TRUCK. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	The name of the street cleaner is Sadek. He seems frightened. He looks 
	around, hesitates before speaking.
 
 				SADEK
		Then the beach is okay, Ali.

	Silence. Sadek looks at him again, waiting, but Ali does not respond.

 	Ali looks straight ahead at the street bathed in sunlight, the tar that 
	seems to be liquid, the villas that surround Algiers, the lemon trees, 
	the oleanders ... Then he speaks, but without turning to Sadek. He 
	speaks in a whisper, his eyes continually staring straight ahead. 

				ALI 
		We need two more, the biggest ones.
 
 				SADEK
		And the others?

				ALI 
		The others ... let's wait and see. 

	Sadek remains silent for a while.

 				SADEK
		I've looked, Ali, even where I work. 
		Nothing. The ones who have not been 
		arrested have left Algiers and gone into 
		the mountains ... And the others don't 
		want to hear any more about it ... 
		they're afraid ...
    
	Ali doesn't answer him. Silence.
 
				ALI 
		Can't you go any faster?
 
 				SADEK
		Yes, sure ... here.

	Sadek puts the truck in third gear, accelerates the motor, then shifts 
	back again into fourth gear. The truck increases its speed. The road is 
	straight, the outskirts of Algiers are visible.

 				SADEK
		If we don't find any others ... should we 
		call it off? 

	Ali turns suddenly to look at him but says nothing. Sadek can feel 
	those eyes on him, and tries to justify himself.
 
 				SADEK
		We can't plant all of them by 
		ourselves ... 

	Ali speaks to him in a dry and indifferent voice. 

				ALI 
		You don't have to plant anything. You 
		only have to carry them, that's all.
 

133	RUE DES ABDERAMES. ALI'S HOUSE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	Night. At number three rue des Abderames, on the first-floor balcony, 
	the stove fires are glowing. The women are cooking outside on their 
	stoves built from tin containers. They are cooking in front of the 
	doors of their homes. The doorways are lit up.

	Ali passes along the balcony, passes by Mahmoud and his wife who are 
	speaking in whispers by themselves and leaning on the railing. It is a 
	warm and starry night. Mahmoud says some more words to his wife, still 
	speaking in whispers, tenderly. Then he follows Ali who has stopped in 
	front of the door.
 

134	ALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	In the room, there is Petit Omar who is cutting out some pictures from 
	a comic book.
 
	As soon as he sees Ali at the door, he stops, closes his book, puts the 
	scissors in his pocket. He seems to be embarrassed at being caught in 
	his childish game.
 
	In the center of the room, there is a dividing curtain, pulled halfway 
	to the side. On the other side, Hassiba is typing. Behind Hassiba, next 
	to the bed, the hiding place is open. Ali enters. He seems tired, 
	sweating. He removes his cloak, tosses it on the chair, and puts his 
	machine gun on the table.
 
				ALI 
			(turning to Petit Omar)
		C'mon, hurry. Go to sleep. Tomorrow we 
		four have a lot of work to do: Mahmoud, 
		Hassiba, you and I.
 
	Mahmoud has remained motionless at the door. Hassiba has stopped typing 
	and approaches them. Omar says nothing, but there is a satisfied look 
	in his eyes. He can't help stretching out his hand to touch the machine 
	gun.
 
	Ali sits down, at the table, moves the machine gun away from Omar, and 
	continues to speak, still talking to Omar.
 
 				ALI 
		Because we can't find anyone else, Sadek 
		will bring us there in the truck. You get 
		out first and plant the bomb where I tell 
		you ... then return here quickly. But be 
		careful that no one is following you. Then 
		Hassiba will get out, and after her, 
		Mahmoud. Then I will plant the ones that 
		are left. They'll know that we're still
		strong ... you can be sure of that.
 
 
135	ALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN. OCTOBER 7, 1957.
 
 	The room is badly lit by a small lamp which is on the other side of the 
	curtain. There is a mattress on the table and Petit Omar is lying on 
	top, asleep.
 
	Ali is lying on a mattress on the ground, fully dressed, with his 
	machine gun by his side. His eyes are open, and he is listening to the 
	far-away sound of a motor. He looks at his watch, gets up, and goes to 
	open the door. Outside there is the first gray light of dawn. The sound 
	is heard more clearly and seems to be moving nearer.
 
	Ali returns to Petit Omar, stays a minute looking at him, then shakes 
	him roughly. The child gets up immediately. He is trembling, as if he 
	had slept with taut nerves, and jumps down quickly from the table. His 
	eyes are open, but he is still sleepy.

	Ali smiles for a moment, and runs his fingers through Omar's hair.
 
				ALI 
		Omar, Omar. C'mon, wake up. Hurry, little 
		one. Today you're going to see fireworks.

	The child also smiles and his face relaxes, then brightens up. At the 
	same time, he extends his hand and pats Ali's side. Mahmoud enters the 
	room from the balcony. He is carrying a tray with four cups of coffee. 

				MAHMOUD
		It's almost time, isn't it? 

				ALI 
		Yes.
 
 	Then Ali turns to the curtain and calls:
 
 				ALI 
		Hassiba ...
 
				HASSIBA
		I'm ready.
 
	Ali sits down and puts on a pair of sneakers. Petit Omar has finished 
	dressing.
      
	The curtain is drawn, Hassiba appears, already dressed. 

				MAHMOUD
		I heard the sound of a truck before ...
 
 				ALI 
		Me too. But I don't think it was Sadek. 
		Otherwise he'd be here by now.

	Hassiba is dressed in European clothes, a skirt and blouse. She nears 
	the table and takes a cup of coffee. 

				HASSIBA 
			(smiling)
		How is your wife now?
      
	Mahmoud's face is expressionless. He shakes his head.
 
				MAHMOUD
		So-so ... 

	Ali has finished putting on his shoes. He takes a cup of coffee. In the 
	same moment, outside the door is heard: 

	MACHINE-GUN FIRE. 

	The four are startled. 

				ALI 
			(shouting)
		Inside! Inside!
 
	Simultaneously, all of them move toward the hiding place. 

	Mahmoud's wife appears at the door. Her face is despairing, but she 
	moves carefully, quickly, precisely. She closes the door. She puts the 
	coffee cups back on the tray, and hides everything in the sink.
 
	She goes to the other side of the curtain. Ali is entering the hiding 
	place. The other three are already inside. Ali pushes the movable piece 
	of wall toward him, and the woman helps him.

	Then, she takes a can from the night table; it is full of plaster mixed 
	with coal dust. The woman spreads the paste in the joints between the 
	bricks of the wall and the closure of the hiding place. At the same 
	time, shouting, shots, and the footsteps of paras are heard.

	As soon as she has finished, the woman slips into bed under the sheets.

	The paratroopers break into the room shouting, and make the woman get 
	up. They drag her outside on the balcony.
 

136 	ABDERAMES COURTYARD. OUTSIDE. DAWN.
 
	They drag Mahmoud's wife down from the balcony to the center of the 
	courtyard, where now all the inhabitants of the building are standing 
	-- men, women, children -- all of them with their hands to the wall, in 
	full sight of the paras who are guarding them.

	Sadek's head is lowered. He passes along the balcony between Marc and 
	the captain. He stops in front of the door.
 
				CAPTAIN 
			(mumbling softly)
		Here?
 
	The Algerian nods yes. They enter.
 

137	ALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN.
 
 	Sadek points toward the curtain. The captain signals him to go there. 
	The Algerian points to a spot in the brick baseboard.

	The captain examines it and with his thumb, he tests the fresh plaster. 
	He bends down and leans his ear to the wall. He smiles as he listens to 
	the ...

	HEAVY BREATHING.
 
	It is the same breathing that soon after Mathieu hears, bent in the 
	same position as the captain. The colonel gets up and looks around him.
 
	Four paras are ready with their machine guns aimed at the hiding place. 
	Others are arranging plastic charges along the wall, all of them 
	connected to a single fuse.
 
	In a corner, Sadek, wearing his cap and army camouflage fatigues, is 
	sitting on a chair.

	He is watching the scene with his eyes wide open. He is trembling. His 
	body is slouched forward. He seems to be lifeless, without nerves. If 
	it weren't for his face, he would seem to be a heap of rags.
 
				MATHIEU 
			(to the captain)
		Everything ready?
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		Yes, sir.
 
 				MATHIEU 
		He hasn't answered?
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		No, sir. Total silence. 

				MATHIEU 
		I thought so. It was obvious.
 
	Mathieu bends down again and leans his ear against the bricks. He gets 
	up again. He remains a minute in this position, lost in thought.

				MATHIEU 
			(loudly and markedly)
		Ali ... Ali la Pointe ... You're going to 
		be blown up. Let the others come out, at 
		least the child. We'll let him off with 
		reformatory school ... Why do you want to 
		make him die?

	Mathieu stops, and shakes his head. He turns to the captain: 

				MATHIEU 
		Let's go ...

	A paratrooper is unrolling a large bundle of fuse. 

				CAPTAIN 
		Bring it down there, till it reaches 
		outside ...
 
				PARA 
		Yes, sir ...

	Mathieu has stopped in front of Sadek. He looks at him.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Is this one still here? ... Take him away. 

	Two paratroopers grab the street cleaner by the armpits and almost 
	lifting him completely, they lead him away. Mathieu is about to go out, 
	then turns and takes the megaphone from the captain's hands, and places 
	it to his mouth. 

				MATHIEU 
		Ali! Ali la Pointe! I am giving you 
		another thirty seconds. What do you hope 
		to gain? You've lost anyway. Thirty 
		seconds, Ali, starting now.
 

138	ALI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAWN.
 
 	Ali la Pointe's eyes are staring at the square piece of wall that seals 
	the hiding place. His glance is taciturn, gloomy. The others are 
	watching Ali. Their lips are half-open, their breasts rise and fall in
 	laborious breathing.
 
 				ALI 
			(in deep, resigned voice) 
		Who wants to leave?
 
	Petit Omar presses against Ali's arm; he looks like a son with his 
	father.
 
	Mahmoud takes his head in his hands and squeezes it.
 
 				HASSIBA
		What are you going to do? 

				ALI 
		I don't deal with them.
 

139	ALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN.
 
 	Mathieu checks his watch; thirty seconds have passed. He moves to go 
	out. The four paras with machine guns are still in the room.
 
 				CAPTAIN 
			(to another paratrooper)
		You stay here by the door to signal the 
		others. When I call you, all of you come 
		down ...
 

140	RUE DES ABDERAMES. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	The sun has risen to the height of the terraces. 

	The terraces are swarming with people.
 
	The alley is empty and only the fuse is visible; it reaches to a small
	clearing full of paratroopers. Two more colonels and a general have 
	arrived.
 
	There is a paratrooper with an "Arriflex" ready to film the explosion.
 
	The atmosphere is that of a show. Two paratroopers are connecting the 
	ends of the fuse to the electric contact.
 
	On the terraces, there are Algerian women, children, and old people.

	Their eyes are motionless; someone is praying. There is an atmosphere 
	of suspense.
 
	There is also the wife of Mahmoud; her eyes seem blank. 

	Five paras come out of the house quickly, and pass along the alley 
	toward the clearing.

	The captain signals, and the para begins to lower the contact switch 
	slowly.
 
	The eyes of all are motionless. The camera is ready. But the explosion 
	does not occur.
      
	The paratrooper swears; he examines the wires.
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		Stand back! Ready, Pierre?
 
 	Pierre responds by mumbling something, and at the same time his hands 
	are moving frenziedly around the wires.
 

141	ALI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	Ali la Pointe bends over Petit Omar as if to cover him. Hassiba has 
	stopped breathing, her eyes wide open; Mahmoud is crying ...

	A single image, a second and now: 

	THE EXPLOSION.
 

142 	RUE DES ABDERAMES. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
	The house collapses in a white cloud, as if its foundations had 
	suddenly been removed.
 
	Mathieu and the other officers move away. Behind them the echo of the 
	explosion continues to resound, then shouts, orders, and isolated 
	ju-ju.
 
	Mathieu's face is weary but his expression is relieved. He is smiling.
 
				GENERAL
		And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. 
		Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers 
		everything should be over.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Yes, I believe there won't be any more 
		talk of the NLF for some time.
 
				GENERAL
		Let's hope forever. 

	Another colonel intervenes:
 
 				1ST COLONEL
		At heart they are good people. We've had 
		good relations with them for a hundred and 
		thirty years ... I don't see why we 
		shouldn't continue that way.

				2ND COLONEL
		Yes, but Algiers is not the only city in 
		Algeria. 

				MATHIEU 
			(smiling)
		Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the 
		only country in the world ...
 
				GENERAL 
			(smiling)
		Why, yes, of course ... But for the 
		moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! 
		In the mountains our work is always 
		easier.
 
	Gradually the officers move away down the slanting street toward their 
	jeeps, and their remarks fade away and are lost.
 

143	CASBAH STREETS. DEMONSTRATIONS. OUTSIDE. DAY. DECEMBER 1960.
 
	Like the cries of birds, of thousands of wild birds, the ju-jus invade 
	and shake the black sky. 

	JU-JU-JU ...

	And below, in the Casbah the white cloaks of the Algerians are like 
	streams, floods; through the alleys, down the stairways, through the 
	streets and the squares, they flow toward the European city.
 

144	PRESS HALL. PREFECT'S OFFICE. INSIDE. DAY.
 
 	In the press hall, the journalists are taking the telephones by force, 
	shouting at the top of their voices. An English journalist:
 
				JOURNALIST
		No one knows what could have been the 
		pretext. The fact is that they seem to be 
		unleashed without warning ... I telephoned 
		Lausanne ... yes, Lausanne. I spoke with 
		an NLF leader in exile. They don't know 
		anything there.
 

145	ALGIERS STREETS. DEMONSTRATION. OUTSIDE. DAY/NIGHT.
 
	In front, the adolescents, very young boys and girls, their mouths wide 
	open, their eyes burning, laughing, their arms stretched above them, 
	raised and lowered to mark the rhythm.
 
				VOICES
		Algerie! 
		Mu-sul-mane!
 		Algerie Musulmane!
 
 	The paratroopers jump down from the trucks, and rush forward.

	The policemen rush forward, soldiers, zouaves, the CRS ...

	Deployed in cordons, in a wedge, in turtle-like formations, in order to 
	divide, to scatter, to hold back ...

	But the demonstrators will not move back, or divide. They continue to 
	press forward, pushing against the troops, face to face.
 
				VOICES
		Free Ben-Bel-la! 
		Free Ben-Bel-la!
 
	The Europeans are closing their doors, lowering shutters. They too, the 
	younger ones, the more decisive, are grouping together, trying to 
	confront the Algerians. They are less numerous, but armed ...

	The first revolver shots resound in the streets, from the windows. Some 
	Algerians fall, but the others continue to advance. They are running 
	now, scattering.
 
 				VOICES
		Ta-hia Et-thou-ar! 
		[Long live the partisans!]
 
	The jeeps, the trucks, the sirens, the tear-gas bombs, machine gun 
	fire.
 
	And then the tanks. The turrets move slowly in a semi-circle. The 
	machine gunner fires the first burst at point-blank. 

 				VOICES 
		Ta-hia el-Djez-air! 
		Ta-hia el-Djez-air! 
 
	Meanwhile the sun has set, and shadows of night are visible.
 
				VOICE OF 
				ENGLISH 
				JOURNALIST 
			(off)
		Today the situation is tenser. In spite 
		of pressure from the more intolerant 
		colonialist group it seems that the 
		Government has given strict orders not 
		to use arms except in emergency 
		situations. But this afternoon there were 
		attempts to enter the European city by 
		force: as a result, the first casualties 
		... Now calm has returned, although from 
		the Casbah continue to be heard those 
		cries ... incoherent, rhythmic, 
		nightmarish cries ...

	And then, from time to time, in the by now dark night, the shrill and 
	angry ju-jus. 

	JU-JU-JU ...
 

146	ALGERIAN STREETS. FLAGS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	Those cries continued until the following day.

	The following day is sunny; the scene begins again like the day 
	before. Only that ...
 
				VOICE OF 
				ENGLISH 
				JOURNALIST 
			(off) 
		This morning for the first time, the 
		people appeared with their flags -- green 
		and white with half moon and star. 
		Thousands of flags. They must have sewn 
		them overnight. Flags so to speak. Many 
		are strips of sheets, shirts, ribbons, 
		rags ... but anyway they are flags.
 
	Thousands of flags. All are carrying flags, tied to poles or sticks, or 
	waving in their hands like handkerchiefs. Waving in the sullen faces of 
	the paratroopers, on the black helmets of the soldiers.
 
				SPEAKER 
		"Another two years had to pass and 
		infinite losses on both sides; and then 
		July 2, 1962 independence was obtained --
		the Algerian Nation was born."
 
 				VOICES

Screenplay by Franco Solinas
The Battle of Algiers


1	VILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. NIGHT. 

	Inside a three-story villa, just built, with whitewashed walls. 
	An elevator shaft is empty, the large cables dangle. 

	On every landing two apartments. The front doors are wide open.
	Whitewash on the floor of the halls, swirls of whitewash on the 
	windowpanes, naked light bulbs hung from electric wires. The rooms 
	contain hardly any furnishings. 

	The kitchens are still without sinks and stoves.
  
	An agitated bustle, a rhythm of efficiency. Paratroopers go up and 
	down the stairs, pass along the halls, enter and leave the rooms.

	The sounds in the background are indecipherable.

	SHOUTED ORDERS, CRIES, HOWLS. 

	SHOUTS, HALF-SPOKEN REMARKS, LAUGHS.

	SOMEWHERE A GRAMOPHONE IS PLAYING AT FULL BLAST. 

	The scene is tense. No pauses.
 
	When the paras are tired, they move to another room. 

	They sit down, stretch out on the floor, drink coffee or beer, and 
	smoke cigarettes while awaiting the next shift. Suddenly, the rhythm 
	of this routine, the timing of these images is upset. A para rushes 
	down the stairs, and asks cheerfully while running:

				MARC
		The colonel. Where's the colonel? 

				PARAS
		Why? What's happening?

				MARC 
		We know where Ali la Pointe is. One of 
		them "spoke" ...

	His voice echoes through the corridors, on the landings, from one 
	floor to another. The excitement is contagious. Many crowd around 
	the door of the kitchen.
 
	The Algerian who has "spoken" is there. He is young with a thin face 
	and feverish eyes. The paras are all around him: they help him stand 
	up, dry him, clean his face with a rag, give him some coffee in a 
	thermos cover. They are full of attention, sincerely concerned. One 
	of them tries to push away the others.

				PARA 
		C'mon, let him breathe!

	Meanwhile others who are arriving ask if it is true. 

				OTHER PARAS
		So he spoke? Does he really know where 
		Ali is?
 
				MARC 
		It seems so. We'll go see. Give him a 
		little coffee. 

	Marc is tall and husky, his eyes young and cheerful. One of the others 
	asks him with a shade of admiration:
 
 				PARA 
		Hey Marc, you made him talk?
 
 				MARC 
			(smiling)
		Sure.
 
	He then begins to smoke again, and moves aside to rest a bit. The 
	Algerian is trying to drink, but his hands are trembling. Someone 
	helps him and holds still the cover of the thermos, drawing it to his 
	mouth:
 
				LAGLOY 
		C'mon Sadek ... Drink, you'll feel better. 

	The Algerian drinks, but his stomach can't take it, causing him to 
	double over and vomit again. 

	Colonel Mathieu enters, elegant and graceful.
 
				MATHIEU 
			(smiling)
		At ease. Is it true? 

				MARC 
		I think so. Rue des Abderames three ...
 
	The colonel turns to the para, who had gone to call him, and who is 
	holding a pair of camouflage fatigues in his hands. 

				MATHIEU 
		Dress him.

	Then he goes near the Algerian, lifts his chin, inspects him for a 
	moment with curiosity.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Chin up, it's all over. Nothing can happen 
		to you now, you'll see. Can you stand up?
 
	The Algerian nods yes. The colonel turns to the paras who are holding 
	him up. 

				MATHIEU 
		Let him go.

	He takes the camouflage fatigues and hands them to the Algerian.

				MATHIEU 
		Here, put them on.
 
	The Algerian mechanically takes the fatigues, but he doesn't 
	understand. The colonel explains to him:

				MATHIEU 
		We're trying to help you. We're going to 
		the Casbah. Dressed like this, they won't 
		be able to recognize you. Understand? 
		We're going to see the place, then you'll 
		be free ... and under our protection ...

	The Algerian shivers from the cold. He is completely naked. He 
	laboriously puts on the fatigues which are too big for him. 

				MATHIEU 
		Go on, give him the cap.

	They give him a wide belt and buckle it. The other paras, one on either 
	side of him, pull up his sleeves to the elbows. A third places the cap 
	on his head and cocks it. 

				LAGLOY 
		Nationalized!
      
	The colonel turn to him angrily: 

				MATHIEU 
		Don't be an idiot, Lagloy!
     
	The Algerian is ready. The paras look at him repressing their laughter. 
	The Algerian continues to tremble. His breath is short, his eyes 
	glossy. He is crying.
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		Let's go.
 
	The Algerian looks around. He breathes deeply. Then, suddenly, 
	unexpectedly, he lets out a hoarse cry:
 
 				SADEK 
		No!
 
 	and tries to jerk forward toward the window.

	Marc seizes him immediately, and with his right hand grabs him by the 
	chest, almost lifting him. With his left hand he gives him two quick 
	slaps, not very hard.
 
 				MARC 
			(persuadingly)
		What do you think you're doing, you fool? 
		Do you want us to start all over again? 
		C'mon, be good. Don't make me look like 
		an idiot in front of the others.
 
	He makes a reassuring sign to the colonel. Then, he takes the Algerian
 	by the arms, and they move off.
 

2	STREETS OF ALGIERS. OUTSIDE. DAWN. OCTOBER 7, 1957. 

	The city is gray and white, by the sea which looks like milk. The dawn
	outlines her features sharply.
 
	The streets and wide avenues of the European quarters are empty.
	Silence, until gradually is heard ...
 
	A HUMMING OF MOTORS.
 
	One truck after another. Their headlights on, with an opaque glow, by 
	now useless.
 
	A line of trucks follow one another along the sea-front, all at the 
	same speed.
 
	They turn right and go up toward Place du Gouvernement. 

	Here, without stopping, the columns divide in two. The two lines enter 
	each of the two roads that lead up to surround the Casbah.

	In the brighter light, the Casbah appears completely white, limestone. 
	Enclosed by the European city, it stands at a greater height and 
	overlooks it.
 
	Mosaic of terraces. White pavement, pavement interspersed by the black 
	outlays of narrow alleys. Only a jump from one terrace to another ...

	Agile and silent, the paras jump one by one from the trucks in a hurry.
 
	SOUND OF TRUCKS.
 
	They arrange themselves geometrically, their movements synchronized. 
	They disperse and disappear in the alleys. 

	They reappear together, then once again scatter. 

	They meet without looking at one another; each one takes his own 
	course.
 
	In like manner without a sound, they are above, even on the terraces, 
	in perfect geometry. Even up here, the paras tighten their grip ...
 

3	RUE DES ABDERAMES. COURTYARD OF HOUSE. INSIDE/OUTSIDE. DAWN.
 
	Every three yards, there is a para, even at all four corners of an 
	intersection.

	They are also in the side streets as well as the main streets. 

	And also above, against the sky, many other paras appear. 

	Number three. The doorway is the height of a man. A squadron stands 
	ready in a semicircle with machine guns in firing position.

	Marc continues to hold up the Algerian by his arm. 

	The captain glances at his watch, then looks up at the terrace and 
	gives a signal.
 
	In a lowered voice, without turning around, he speaks to the para who 
	is at his back:
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		Fire ...
 
	The para nears the front door, his legs wide open, his machine gun, 
	clenched at his side, and aims at the lock.
 
 	MACHINE GUN FIRE.
 
	He moves the gun barrel in a circular direction. 

	Immediately the others hurl themselves against the door. 

	At the same time, the door of the terrace is broken down, and the paras 
	burst into the house below.

	The inner courtyard is square. In the center there is a well; above, a 
	patch of sky; on four sides, the arcades, columns, and majolica arches. 
	Beneath the porches, there is a door for every dwelling. And above, a 
	balcony with railings and other doors. The doors are wide open. The 
	paras quickly carry out their orders.

	ORDERS, CURT AND BRIEF.

	The people are used to all this and know how to obey. The scene takes 
	place exactly as if it were an arranged maneuver, a practice drill.
 
	The rooms are emptied in a few seconds. The people are crowded together 
	in the courtyard. 

	Eyes wide with fright.
 
	Men, women, and children with blankets and sheets thrown around their 
	shoulders. By now, it is almost day. A soft light is diffused from 
	above.
 
	The Algerian walks with his head lowered, Marc on one side, the captain
 	on, the other.
 
	They climb to the first floor and go along the balcony. 

	The Algerian stops in front of a door. 

	The captain murmurs softly:
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		Here?
 
 	The Algerian nods yes. They enter.
 

4	ALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN. 

	The room is badly lit. There is a mattress on the floor, and another on 
	the table, a cupboard against the wall, some chairs. Nothing else. At 
	the back of the room to the left, there is a dividing curtain hung by a 
	cord at medium height. The curtain is drawn and a large bed with brass 
	headboards is visible. The Algerian points in that direction; the 
	captain signals for him to go there.

	They go forward silently, and push aside the curtain. There is a small 
	light bulb hung on the wall beneath a small shelf covered with 
	postcards and photos.
 
	The baseboard all around is more than three feet tall and is covered by 
	majolica tiles.

	The Algerian points to a spot in the brick structure, on the back 
	wall, between the headboard of the bed and a corner of the room.

	Marc and the captain have their machine guns ready. The captain goes 
	near the wall, his breath drawn, and begins to examine it.
 
	He runs the fingernail of his thumb along the wall horizontally, 
	between one row of tiles and another.

	He taps the tiles at different places until he hears the plaster in the 
	interstices crumble. He looks at the bit of plaster that is left in his 
	nail.
 
	He squeezes it in his fingertips; it is soft, newly laid.

	Then he bends over, places his ear to the wall, and listens. 

	Suddenly he smiles.
 

5	ALI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE.
 
 	There isn't enough air in the hiding place. The four are forced to 
	breathe deeply. And in that small space their laborious breaths 
	resound like splashes.
 
	Ali la Pointe has his eyes fixed upon the square patch of wall that 
	seals the hiding place. His eyes are large, black, slanted, his eyelids 
	heavy, somewhat lowered, so that the black of the irises appears even 
	blacker in the shadows, deeper and more sullen.

	Petit Omar is with him, a boy of twelve, and Mahmoud who is eighteen. 
	There is also Hassiba, a Kabyle girl, blond, blue-eyed, and fair 
	skinned.

	The hiding place is only five feet high, and hardly holds them. They 
	are sitting or stretched out on the ground, close to one another.

	The entrance to the hiding place is blocked by the small patch of wall 
	which matches exactly the rest. It is held firm by a bar through an 
	iron ring attached at the center. On the other side of the cell, above 
	them, there is a hole for air. 

	They are tense and do not move. Their lips are dry, half-open, and 
	their breasts rise and fall in a difficult attempt to breathe.
 
				CAPTAIN 
			(off)
		Ali la Pointe ... the house is surrounded. 
		You haven't got a chance. Surrender. Let 
		the child and the girl come out, then you 
		and the other one. Leave your weapons 
		inside. It's useless to try anything. Our 
		machine guns are ready to fire -- you 
		wouldn't have time. Do you understand?
 
	Ali's face is motionless and hasn't changed its expression.
 
				CAPTAIN 
			(off)
		Ali, do you hear me? Listen! You are the 
		last one. The organization is finished. 
		All your friends are dead or in prison. 
		Come out. You'll have a fair trial. Come 
		out, surrender.
 
	SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS, OTHER VOICES, CHEERFUL, INCOHERENT: 

				VOICES PARAS
		Why are they breathing so heavily? 
		Fear ...
		Air ... 
		They haven't got enough air inside ...

	And again the voice of the captain, clear and somewhat distant:

				CAPTAIN 
			(off)
		Make up your mind, Ali? Do you want us to 
		wall you in, or do you prefer that we 
		blow you to pieces? ... Alright. So much 
		the worse for you.

	Ali's expression is still firm; his stare is dark and sullen.
 

6	VIEWS OF THE CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY. NOVEMBER 1, 1954. 

	The Casbah: compressed humanity, swarming in the alleyways, on the 
	steps, in the cafes, in the Arab baths, in the mosques, and in the 
	markets; a tangle of voices, gestures, faces, veiled women, eyes. 
	Someone is putting up a handbill, another distributes them.
 
				SPEAKER
		"National Liberation Front! Algerian 
		brothers! The time has come to break 
		loose at long last from the bonds of 
		misery in which one hundred and thirty 
		years of colonial oppression has kept us 
		chained. The moment of struggle is near; 
		our goal -- national independence ..."
 

7	VIEWS OF THE EUROPEAN CITY. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The European city: reinforced concrete, asphalt, steel, lights, shop 
	windows, buildings, automobiles. A steady rhythm of efficiency, music, 
	cordiality, an apéritif.
 
				SPEAKER
		"In order to avoid a fatal and bloody 
		conflict, we propose an honorable program 
		of discussion to the French authorities, 
		on condition that they recognize the right 
		of our people to self-government ..."

	And the Algerians who work in the European city, the dockers, waiters, 
	laborers, street-cleaners, farm-hands, and gardeners.

				SPEAKER
		"Algerians unite! Be ready for action! 
		The National Liberation Front calls you to 
		struggle." 

	Unemployed, peddlers, beggars, shoeshine boys ...
 

8	STREET CARD GAME. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	Two hands are moving; one over the other, they criss-cross with 
	incredible speed; at the same time, they are shifting three small 
	pieces of wood which appear to be identical. The hand movements are 
	marked by a kind of Algerian CHANT.

	From time to time, the pieces of wood are overturned for a split second 
	so that the other sides are visible. Robust hands, thick, unusually 
	agile for their size. The hands of Ali la Pointe, younger then, twenty-
	four years old.
 
	A European quarter of Algiers. Coming and going of people, automobile 
	traffic. On the sidewalk a small group of European and two Algerian 
	boys.
 
	Other passersby stop to watch. The group crowds around the stand where 
	Ali la Pointe is playing his game.

	The entranced eyes of all present are staring at the pieces of wood.

	Ali's hands seem to move by themselves.
 
	His glance, always a bit sullen, apparently distracted, indifferent, 
	passes from one face to another, and then to the street, from one side 
	to another.
 
	At fifty yards, a policeman. Two Europeans, a man and a woman, are 
	speaking to him in an excited manner, and nudging him along pointing to 
	Ali.
 
				WOMAN
		Look! Yes, that's him!
  
 	Ali is no longer singing. His hands have stopped moving. 

	A POLICE SIREN IS HEARD.

	Ali pushes his way through the crowd. 

	He breaks into a run.
 
	The policeman also begins to run.
 

9	STREET. ALI'S FLIGHT. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	The street is sloping. Ali flees, pursued by the policeman. He dodges 
	passersby with agility. He gains ground. But nearby are heard ... 

	SIRENS 

	and also in front of him.

	Another two policemen; they too are running. 

	There is an intersection. At the corner, a cafe. 

	GAY MUSIC.

	Young Europeans leaning against a shop window stop chattering and look.

	Ali reaches the corner, crosses the street, passes by the bar. 

	There is a blond youth, about eighteen, who seems to be a student who 
	stretches out his foot, and pushes a chair in front of him.

	Ali stumbles and falls.
 
	The youth attempts a laugh, and at the same time moves backward.

	Ali is lying face downward, but suddenly turns his head toward the 
	youth and stares at him. Then lifting himself by his arms, he turns to 
	look back. 

	The police are now twenty yards away.

	Ali gets to his feet. For a split second, he hesitates. He hurls 
	himself against the youth, headfirst.

	Using his head, Ali rams into the youth's face, striking him in the 
	nose and splurting blood everywhere.
 
	The youth is unable to shout. He opens his mouth in the attempt, but 
	the only result is a gurgling sound and blood. His friends intervene. 
	Ali is surrounded. The police arrive. A mass of people jump on Ali, 
	kicking him and striking him with their fists as long as they please. 
	Finally the police aid Ali and disperse the crowd.

	Ali is now in handcuffs and being led away.

	More people have arrived. They are yelling, shouting insults, and 
	spitting on Ali.
 
	Ali passes in their midst protected by the police. He pays no heed to 
	the fist blows, the shouts, the spits, but seems neither to see nor 
	hear, as if he were already resigned to having lost the battle this 
	time, and were preparing to wait patiently for a better chance.

	He is walking with an unfaltering step. His face is emotionless, oval, 
	swarthy. His hair black and wavy, his forehead low and wide; his eyes 
	large and slanted with eyelids somewhat lowered, his mouth firm and 
	proud.

10	PARIS 1955. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The air is clear and springlike. A 4CV Citroen delivery van is parked 
	in front of the Minister of the Interior warehouses. The rear door is 
	open, the motor is running, a policeman is at the wheel. Two workers in 
	overalls exit from the warehouses.

	Each one is carrying a box, and places it inside the van. The boxes are 
	made of seasoned wood, both of them rectangular. They are each about 
	eight inches long; one and two yards high respectively. The two workers 
	sit down inside the van, toward the rear. They are facing toward the 
	exterior. Their feet are dangling and almost touch the ground.

	The jolting movement of the van in motion causes them to laugh.

	STREETS OF PARIS. Spring. Girls with lightweight clinging dresses. The 
	two workers call them, whistle, gesture, and then move off in the 
	distance.
 
	ORLY AIRPORT. The van stops in front of a warehouse. The two workers 
	jump to the ground, place the boxes on their shoulders, and enter the 
	warehouse.
 
	The boxes are moving on a mobile ramp. There is a large label on each 
	one which says: REPUBLIC OF FRANCE. MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR. 
	DESTINATION: BARBEROUSSE PRISON. ALGIERS.
 

11	ALGIERS. BARBEROUSSE PRISON. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
	Barberousse prison is situated on the outskirts of the Upper Casbah. It 
	is an ancient fortress with thick, high surrounding walls, which appear 
	to vanish in contrast with the central building which dominates them. 
	The whole structure is covered with limestone like the other houses of 
	the Casbah. Only the bars on the windows and the big gate are black. 

	The gate opens. A covered jeep enters the prison courtyard. In the 
	stronghold of the jeep are the two boxes sent from Paris. 

	Early morning. The sky is pale blue. In the prison courtyard, the 
	workers open the two chests and assemble the guillotine. It is possible 
	to see it from the cell windows that face the courtyard. Faces of 
	prisoners appear between the bars of some windows.
 
	The workers have disappeared. Only the delicate, makeshift structure of 
	the guillotine is visible, its slender outline lengthened.
 

12	PRISON CELL. INSIDE. MORNING.
 
	In one of the cells there are about twenty prisoners. The cell is huge; 
	there are two very high windows that almost reach the ceiling.
 
	A prisoner is standing on the urine bucket, and looks outside through 
	the barred window. On the ground there are some mats which serve as 
	beds. Nothing else.
 
	About ten prisoners are in a group, seated on the ground, and they are 
	speaking in whispers. 

	AD LIB DIALOGUE IN LOWERED VOICES.
 
	Two of them are playing with some stones on a chessboard drawn in the 
	dirt; others are speaking among themselves. One is reading a Mickey 
	Mouse comic book and laughing to himself. But all of them, in 
	appearance and behavior, are distinguished from those who make up the 
	more numerous group. These solitary men are different in some way, they 
	are not ordinary delinquents.

	Ali la Pointe is alone, withdrawn from the others, seated on the 
	ground, his shoulders propped against the wall, his knees raised. He is 
	barefoot. On his left ankle, directly above his foot, are tattooed two 
	words in print: TAIS-TOI. His shirt is unbuttoned and on his chest are 
	other tattoos in a strange design.

	Ali looks at the group and seems to listen to their murmured words 
	absent-mindedly. His expression is taciturn, reserved, and indifferent.

	Ali turns to the prisoner at the window.
 
				PRISONER AT WINDOW
		Look at them!

	Ali jumps to his feet. Everyone moves toward the two windows.
 
 	Ali moves away two yards at a quick pace, then runs toward the window, 
	and grabbing hold of the bars, heaves himself up to it.

	The condemned man turns and looks up toward the windows. He seems to 
	smile although his face is motionless. In a soft voice, he speaks to 
	those faces which appear behind the bars: 

				CONDEMNED MAN
		Tahia el Djez-air! [Long live Algeria!]

	The political prisoners take up the phrase and recite it gutturally, 
	keeping time to the steps of the condemned man. 

				POLITICAL PRISONERS
		Tahia el Djez-air!
 

13 	PRISON COURTYARD. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	The condemned man walks toward the guillotine accompanied by guards and 
	a priest reading the Koran. There is also the executioner wearing a 
	black hood. The executioner tries to appear indifferent. The priest 
	recites his prayers. The entire ceremony seems improvised and hasty. 
	The epilogue is reached quickly. 

	PRAYERS.

	The condemned man bends. The executioner places his neck in the right 
	position, adjusts it, turns his head a bit, then pushes his body 
	forward. He releases the mechanism.
 
	The blade falls, the head rolls. There is no longer a chorus. No one is 
	chanting.
 
	Ali's eyes have remained motionless.
 
	Then from above, as the dismembered body is being carried away in a 
	basket, as the priest, the guards, and the officer are leaving, as the 
	workers dismantle the guillotine, from above, from the balconies of the 
	Casbah, suddenly the "ju-jus" of the women are heard, dense like the 
	cries of birds, shrill, metallic, angry.
 
				WOMEN
		Ju-ju ... 
 
 
14	SMALL SQUARE. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY. JANUARY 1956. 

	It is raining. The water runs along the gulleys of the narrow alleys. 
	The white houses have turned spongy gray. The children of the Casbah 
	are playing and spattering mud. Skinny and half-naked children with 
	bloated bellies and hair cropped because of sores.

	Their mothers call them in vain. They continue to run, play, and wallow 
	in the mud with a despairing gaiety. 

	CALLS. VOICES. SHOUTS.
 
	Petit Omar was then ten years old. He is slender, dressed in long pants 
	and a jacket which is too large for him and torn so that he seems 
	almost clownish. Calm and absorbed, he passes in the midst of the other 
	children, but doesn't notice them or their games.
 
	A small square on a sloping ascent.

	In the center, a fountain. On the elevated side of the square, on a 
	corner, there is a mosque. 

	SOUNDS OF CHURCH MUSIC.

	Standing still at the foot of the steps is an Algerian in white cloak, 
	and hood down to his eyes. Other people pass by. The Algerian is turned 
	to one side so as not to be seen. Petit Omar walks toward him and nears 
	his back. The Algerian turns; it is Ali la Pointe. He tells the boy 
	with a tone of boredom and curtness:
 
				ALI 
		Go away!
 
 				PETIT OMAR 
		Men have two faces: one that laughs and 
		one that cries ...
 
	Ali looks at him incredulously and asks:
 
				ALI 
		And they sent you!
 
	The child slips a hand under his sweater to his chest.
 
				PETIT OMAR 
		Sure, something wrong with that?
 
	Omar takes out a piece of paper folded in four, and hands it to Ali.
 
				PETIT OMAR 
		Take it. Everything's written here. 

	He turns away and begins to run. 

				ALI 
		Wait!

	Omar stops running and turns to Ali.

				ALI 
		Come here ... Come.
 
	Omar retraces his footsteps. Ali goes to meet him. 

				ALI 
			(in a brusque manner)
		Can you read? 

				PETIT OMAR 
		Sure ...

	Ali hands back the paper.
 
 				ALI 
		Read it.
 
 				PETIT OMAR 
		Here?
 
	Ali turns and looks around him. He squats on his heels in order to 
	reach Omar's height.
 
 				ALI 
		Here.
 
 	It is still drizzling. Omar unfolds the paper and begins to read it.
 

15 	RUE RANDOM. CAFE MEDJEBRI. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.
 
	The following day at 5 p.m., rue Random. The street is fairly wide for 
	a street in the Arab quarter and at this hour it is crowded with 
	people. There are Algerians in traditional costumes and others in 
	European clothes. Noisy and tumultuous background ...
 
	VOICES, SOUNDS, WORDS -- ALL MIXED TOGETHER. 

	Veiled women with intent glances. Silent women who seem to float 
	through the crowds, untouchable.

	An Arab cafe filled with customers at the tables and bar. Through the 
	large shop window, a smoky, steamy interior is visible. The cafe is 
	located in rue Random, number 40.
 
				OMAR 
			(off)
		There is an Arab cafe at rue Random 40. 
		The owner's name is Medjebri. He is a 
		police informer ...
 
 	Medjebri is standing behind the cash register, smiling, very busy. He 
	is wearing a traditional costume. He is very clearly visible through 
	the shop window above the heads of the customers.
 
	In a doorway near the cafe there is a clock hanging from a signboard in 
	front of a store. It is five o'clock. A French policeman enters the 
	cafe.
 
 				OMAR 
			(off) 
		Every day at 5 p.m., a French policeman 
		goes to see him. He stops for a few 
		minutes to get information with the 
		excuse of drinking a cup of tea. You have 
		to kill the policeman ...
 
				ALI 
			(off) 
		Not Medjebri?
 
 	Medjebri moves away from the register, still standing behind the bar, 
	to where the policeman is seated. He greets him, and hands him a cup of 
	tea.
 
 				OMAR 
			(off)
		No. It says the policeman.
 
 	The policeman is leaning on the bar. He is tall and husky, and is 
	wearing a scruffy uniform with a kepi pushed back somewhat. Now his 
	thick lips are sipping the scalding mint tea.

				ALI
			(off)
		Okay ...
 
	The large clock and store signboard. Standing in front, there is a 
	slender girl, veiled, her eyes darting in contrast with the rigid form 
	of her motionless body. Her arms are raised to form an arch, her hands 
	supporting the edges of a large basket balanced on her head.
 
				OMAR 
			(off) 
		At the corner, right in front of the 
		large clock, there will be a girl 
		carrying a basket. When the policeman 
		comes out, you will follow him together. 
		At the right moment she will give you a 
		pistol. You have only to shoot ... 
		quickly and in the back. 

	Now the policeman has finished drinking his tea. He makes a sign to 
	pay. Smiling, Medjebri refuses the money, and says good-bye.

	Ali approaches the girl. They exchange glances. The girl puts down her 
	basket which is filled with corn, and rests it by her side.

	She moves slowly toward the cafe. Ali walks beside her.
 
	The policeman is coming out of the cafe. He rudely bumps into those who 
	are entering.
 
	He makes his way along the sidewalk, and moves further away, balancing 
	his heavy body at every step.
 
	Ali and the girl are about a yard away from him. They follow him, 
	pushed along with the many others who are crowded on the sidewalk.

	Then the girl plunges her hand into the corn. In a second, she places 
	the revolver in Ali's right hand.

	He holds it under his cloak. The policeman's back is a hand's-bredth 
	away. But Ali does not shoot. 

	He moves forward to pass by the policeman.
 
	Alarmed, the girl looks at him, and tries to hold him back. She shakes 
	her head as if to speak. 

	Ali smiles at her. His eyes have a hard glint.

	He moves a few steps past the policeman. Suddenly Ali turns, lifts his 
	arm as if to push his way through, and then stretches out his hand with 
	the revolver aimed.
 
	The policeman stops; his eyes are wide with fear. Instinctively he 
	lifts his arms and opens his palms. 

	Terror paralyzes him.
 
	Ali glances about him. Many people are moving away hastily, but others 
	stand still in a circle and watch fascinated. Ali speaks to all of 
	them, in a loud voice. His eyes are alight.
 
 				ALI 
		Don't move! Look at him. You're not 
		giving any orders now! Your hands are up, 
		eh! Do you see him, brothers? Our masters 
		aren't very special, are they?
 
	A sharp, metallic click. Ali tries a second time, presses the trigger 
	again.
 
	SEVERAL CLICKS. REVOLVER EMPTY. 

	Ali rolls the gun barrel; it is empty.

	The policeman slowly lowers his hands. His right hand rushes to his 
	holster.
 
	Ali is ready to jump, throws away the gun, and starts to move forward.

	He knocks down the policeman, who is overwhelmed, and falls backward.
 
	The crowd moves away quickly. Ali starts to throw himself on the 
	Frenchman lying on the ground, but stops halfway. 

	A thought restrains him. He turns and sees the girl who has picked up 
	the revolver and hidden it again in her basket. 

	Then she moves away hurriedly.
 
	Ali curses angrily, then, kicks the policeman's head twice, and runs 
	after the girl.

	He reaches her, grabs her shoulder so roughly that she shouts.
 
				ALI 
			(in a whisper) 
		Bastard! ... Bitch!
 
	The girl struggles free from his grip. At the same time, they hear 
	behind them ...
 
 	POLICE WHISTLES.
 
	The girl quickens her step.
 

16 	SIDE ALLEY WITH FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. SUNSET. 

	The girl arrives at a side street, enters it, and breaks into a run.

	Ali is again beside her, but unexpectedly the girl enters a front door.

	She bends, places the basket on the ground, removes the revolver, and 
	hides it in her breast beneath her shawl. She gets up again, and leaves 
	the basket. Ali blocks her way.
 
				ALI 
		Tell me what this joke is all about.
      
	The girl attempts to push past him toward the door.
 
				DJAMILA 
		Let's move now or they'll catch us.
 
	Ali grabs her by the arm, shakes her, and shouts uncontrollably:

				ALI 
		I want to know who sent me that letter. 
		What's his name? 

				DJAMILA 
		He's waiting for you! 

				ALI 
		Where?
 
				DJAMILA 
		We're going there ... if you don't get us 
		arrested first.

	The girl nods toward the street where two policemen are passing by 
	hastily.
 
	Ali moves backward into the shadow of the doorway. He regains control 
	of his nerves, loosens his cloak, and lets it fall on the basket. He is 
	dressed in European clothes, trousers and pullover.
 
				ALI 
			(pushing her ahead)
		Move ... go ahead. I'll follow you.
 
	The girl takes a look outside, then goes out. Ali follows her a few 
	steps behind. By now it is dusk.
 

17	TERRACE. KADER'S HOUSE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	It is a starry night and there are few lights visible in the windows of 
	the Casbah. In the background, there is the triumphant neon of the 
	European city, the sea, the ships at anchor, the shining beams of a 
	lighthouse. Kader turns around gracefully, and goes to sit on the wall 
	of the terrace. 

				KADER 
		You could have been a spy. We had to put 
		you to the test.
 
	Ali looks at him sullenly. 

				ALI 
		With an unloaded pistol?
 
 				KADER 
		I'll explain.
 
	Kader is a few years older than Ali, but not so tall. He is slender 
	with a slight yet sturdy bone structure. The shape of his face is 
	triangular, aristocratic, his lips thin, his eyes burning with hatred, 
	but at the same time, cunning. He continues to speak in a calm tone 
	which has an ironic touch to it.
 
				KADER 
		Let's suppose you were a spy. In prison, 
		when the NLF contacts you, you pretend to 
		support the revolution, and then the 
		French help you to escape ...

				ALI 
		Sure. By shooting at me.

				KADER 
		Even that could be a trick. You escape, 
		then show up at the address which the 
		brothers in prison gave to you, and so 
		you are able to contact me ...
 
				ALI
		I don't even know your name yet ...
 
				KADER 
		My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... 
		In other words, in order to join the 
		organization, you had to undergo a test. 
		I could have told you to murder the 
		barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the 
		police would let you kill him, even 
		though he is one of theirs. By obeying 
		such an order, you still could have 
		been a double agent. And that's why I 
		told you to kill the French policeman: 
		because the French wouldn't have let 
		you do it. If you were with the police 
		you wouldn't have done it.
 
	Ali has followed Kader's logic a bit laboriously, and he is fascinated 
	by it. But not everything is clear yet. 

				ALI 
		But I haven't shot him.
 
 				KADER 
			(smiling)
		You weren't able to. But what's important 
		is that you tried.
 
				ALI 
		What's important for me is that you let me 
		risk my life for nothing.
 
 				KADER 
		C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders 
		were to shoot him in the back.
 
				ALI 
		I don't do that kind of thing. 

				KADER 
		Then don't complain.
 
				ALI 
		You still haven't told me why you didn't 
		let me kill him.
 
				KADER 
		Because we aren't ready yet for the 
		French. Before attacking, we must have 
		safe places from which to depart and find 
		refuge. Of course, there is the Casbah. 
		But even the Casbah isn't safe yet. There 
		are too many drunks, pushers, whores, 
		addicts, spies ... people who talk too 
		much ... people who are ready to sell 
		themselves, undecided people. We must 
		either convince them or eliminate them. 
		We must think of ourselves first. We must 
		clean out the Casbah first. Only then 
		will we be able to deal with the French. 
		Do you understand, Ali? 

	Ali doesn't answer.
 
	Kader has come down from the wall and looks toward the Casbah. Ali too 
	looks toward the Casbah, immersed in the night.
 
				ALI 
		And how many are we? 

				KADER 
		Not enough.
 

18 	AREAS OF CASBAH UNDERWORLD. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. MARCH 1956.
 
	A warm spring wind, large white clouds. At the western edge of the 
	Casbah, from the Upper to Lower Casbah, the street of the Algerian 
	underworld descends to the brothel quarter.
 
				SPEAKER
		"National Liberation Front, bulletin 
		number 24. Brothers of the Casbah! The 
		colonial administration is responsible not 
		only for our people's great misery, but 
		also for the degrading vices of many of 
		our brothers who have forgotten their own 
		dignity ..."
 
	Shady bars for gamblers and opium smokers, shops filled with tourist 
	trinkets, merchants, fences, pimps, children with adult faces, ghastly 
	old women, and young girls, whores standing in the doorways of their 
	houses.  The girls having their faces uncovered have put scarves on 
	their heads, knotted at the nape.
 
 				SPEAKER
		"Corruption and brutality have always 
		been the most dangerous weapons of 
		colonialism. The National Liberation 
		Front calls all the people to struggle 
		for their own physical and moral 
		redemption -- indispensable conditions 
		for the reconquest of independence. 
		Therefore beginning today, the 
		clandestine authority of the NLF 
		prohibits the following activities: 
		gambling, the sale and usage of all types 
		of drugs, the sale and usage of alcoholic 
		beverages, prostitution and its 
		solicitation. Transgressors will be 
		punished. Habitual transgressors will be 
		punished by death."
 

19	BAR. EUROPEAN CITY FACING CASBAH. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. SUNSET.
 
	It is dusk. In the European city, the first lights are visible. People 
	begin to crowd the bars for an apéritif.

	An Algerian shoeshine man leaves his workbox at the entrance of the 
	bar. He goes to the counter. He is tall and thin as a reed. He takes 
	from his pocket a handful of change; his hands tremble slightly as he 
	counts it.
 
	The barman recognizes him, fills a glass of wine, and places it in 
	front of him. The Algerian pays and takes the glass. It's probably not 
	his first; the trembling of his hands increases. The Algerian drinks 
	the wine in one gulp, then goes to the door. He waits patiently while 
	some Europeans enter. He goes out, picks up his workbox, and moves 
	away.
 

20 	RUE MARENGO AND STEPS. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
 
	The Algerian is standing at the top of some steep, almost vertical 
	steps that lead from the European quarters to the Casbah.

	Now he is in rue Marengo. There is still some daylight. The street is 
	crowded. The Algerian is unsteady on his legs. He stops and mutters 
	something to himself. It is obvious that he is trying to hide his 
	drunkenness.
 
	He begins to walk, his hand against the wall for support. He stumbles.
 
	The workbox falls, scattering brushes and cans of shoe polish on the 
	ground. The Algerian bends down, and begins to pick up his tools. He is 
	swearing.
 
	Others have seen him. A peddler points him out to a child of about ten. 
	It is Petit Omar, who nods yes, then whistles. 

	Another whistle answers him, then another and another. 

	There are other children, at every corner of the street. 

	They arrive in a run and gather together.

	Omar points to the drunk who is now moving away, and gives the order to 
	attack. It is evident that this is not a game for them, but a duty.

	There is a chorus of brief shouting, of insults, and whistles. 

	The drunk sees them approaching. He is terrified. 

	He tries to quicken his step.
 
	They reach him quickly and surround him. They attack him and then flee, 
	small yet elusive. They do not laugh even once; their faces are hard 
	and cruel.
 
	The drunk swings around holding his workbox by its strap. 

	Some children are hit; some fall.
 
	The drunk avails himself of this chance to escape, and retraces his 
	steps to the staircase.
 
	He begins to descend toward the European quarters. But the children are 
	again upon him.
 
	They are shouting more loudly now, and pushing him. He quickens his 
	step, and staggering jumps the steps two by two. 

	The children trip him and he falls.
 
	He is crying. He shields himself with his hands. 

	The workbox has fallen and is rolling down the steps. The children are 
	now on top of him, like small beasts on a carrion. They smother him, 
	push him and pull him. They are no longer shouting.

	All of them are intent upon their efforts. Only the drunk is shouting 
	despairingly.
 
	They succeed in moving him, and hurl him down the steps. He rolls 
	downward, trying in vain to grab something with his hands.
 

21	BAR CASBAH. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.
 
	Outside the sun's light is blinding. Inside the small bar there is 
	fresh air and shade.
 
	A young Algerian, with lifeless eyes and an idle expression, is rolling 
	an opium cigarette. He lights it. Two slaps cause the cigarette to fall 
	from his lips.

	Ali la Pointe is wearing a djellabah, a type of cloak without buttoning 
	which slips on over the head. There is an opening of about eight inches
 	at the waist.
 
	Ali has stretched his arm through the opening to slap the opium addict, 
	who recognizes Ali, smiles, and makes a dazed grimace.
 
 				OPIUM-ADDICT
		Ali la Pointe ...

				ALI 
		Wake up! Have you seen Hacene le Bonois?
 
				OPIUM-ADDICT 
			(shaking his head) 
		Not today ...
 
	Then he gets up laboriously, bends down, and looks for the cigarette 
	that had fallen from his hand.

	He doesn't reach it. Ali quickly crushes the cigarette with his foot. 
	He is wearing a pair of sneakers. He moves away and leaves the bar.
 

22 	STREET BAR. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	Ali continues to scour the streets. From time to time, without 
	lingering, he asks someone:
 
 				ALI 
		Seen Hacene le Bonois?
 
 	Then adds:
 
 				ALI 
		Tell him I'm looking for him ...
 

23 	BROTHEL QUARTERS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	OFF LIMITS 
	Entrance to the brothel quarters. The street widens, the alleys branch 
	off and seem to broaden. There are one or two Europeans, not only 
	tourists in search of adventure, but also elements of the international 
	criminal underworld who mingle here with the Algerians.

	Almost all the buildings house a brothel or other place of ill-repute. 
	On some doorways signs are hanging which read: 

			THIS IS AN HONEST HOUSE.
 

24	BROTHEL. INSIDE. DAY. 

	Ali has entered a brothel. It is morning and there are few clients. The 
	whores are Algerian and European. Some of them are pretty.

	The madam is an Algerian, dressed in European clothes. She is about 
	forty, heavily made up. When she spots Ali, she interrupts her usual 
	professional chant. She seems curious, yet glad.
 
				MADAM 
			(shouting) 
		Ali la Pointe!
 
 	She stops herself, already sorry for having spoken so quickly and 
	imprudently. Ali doesn't answer her, but approaches with a steady and 
	serious glance.
 
 				MADAM 
			(changing tone)
		Haven't seen you around for some time. I 
		thought you were still in prison.
 
	Ali leans against the counter, never once taking his eyes off her.

				ALI 
		Is Hacene le Bonois here?
 
				MADAM
		No. He left early this morning. You know 
		how it is with the boss ...

				ALI 
		I want to see him. If he shows up, tell 
		him that I'm around. 

	Ali moves away from the counter and turns. He leaves without a word. 
	The woman tries to understand what has happened, and follows him with a 
	worried glance.
 

25	SMALL STREET. HACENE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 				HACENE 
		Ali, my son ... Where have you been 
		hiding? 

	Ali turns suddenly, then pulls back so that his back is against the 
	wall of the alley.
 
				ALI 
			(in sharp voice)
		Don't move! 

	Then he glances at the others. 

				ALI 
		Hands still.
 
	The others are three young Algerians, Hacene's bodyguards. Hacene le 
	Bonois is tall with short legs out of proportion with his enormous 
	chest. He is somewhat corpulent. He has a wide face, a cheerful and 
	self-confident expression. His clothing is a strange combination of 
	Algerian and European which does not, however, appear ridiculous, but 
	imposing. At Ali's remark, his expression changes, becomes amazed and 
	baffled. But at the same time, his eyes give away the brain's attempt 
	to find an explanation and a solution.
 
 				HACENE 
			(astonished)
		You know I never carry weapons ...

	Ali keeps his arms and hands hidden under his djellabah.
 
				ALI 
		I know.
 
	Hacene laughs warmly, and stretches out his hands which are enormous, 
	thick and rough.
 
 				HACENE 
		You afraid of these ...?
 
 				ALI 
		Don't move, Hacene.

				HACENE 
		Why are you afraid? We've always been 
		friends. One might even say that I brought 
		you up ... Isn't it true, Ali? 

				ALI 
		It's true.
 
 				HACENE 
		What's happened to you? 

				ALI 
		The NLF has condemned you to death.

	Hacene is stunned. He speaks aloud his thoughts in a soft voice.
 
				HACENE 
		Ah, so its come to this ...
 
	Then he bursts into loud laughter, and seems to turn to the three 
	guards at his back.
 
				HACENE 
		I'm dying of laughter! Ha ... ha ... 
		ha ...
 
 	Ali doesn't speak. He continues to stare at Hacene. Hacene suddenly 
	stops laughing. His tone of voice changes, becomes brusque and hurried.
 
				HACENE 
		How much are they paying you?

				ALI 
		They're not paying me anything. They've 
		already warned you twice; this is the 
		last warning. Decide. 

				HACENE 
		What ... What must I decide?
 
 				ALI 
		You've got to change occupations, Hacene. 
		Right away! 

	Hacene makes a gesture as if to emphasize what he is going to say.
 
				HACENE 
			(with irony) 
		Okay, you convince me.
 
 	Then suddenly, unexpectedly, he lets out a SHRILL SCREAM, like fencers 
	who before plunging their swords, try to frighten their adversaries.
 
	Simultaneously, he hurls himself forward, head lowered and arms 
	outstretched.

	Ali steps aside, and releases a BLAST OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE.

	Hacene falls flat on his face. There is movement. Some passersby 
	approach. The three boys try to escape.
 
				ALI 
			(shouting)
		Stop!
 
	The barrel of the machine gun is visible through the opening in his 
	djellabah. Ali's voice is quivering angrily:
 
 				ALI 
		Look at him well! Now nobody can do 
		whatever he wants in the Casbah. Not even 
		Hacene ... least of all you three pieces 
		of shit! Go away now ... go away and 
		spread the word ... Go on!


26	WEDDING. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	Summer. There is a garland of flowers strung across an alley. A front 
	door is open, and the guests continue to arrive.
 

27	WEDDING HOUSE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	In the inner courtyard, there are benches and chairs arranged in rows. 
	In front of all of them, there are two chairs separated from the rest, 
	one next to the other. In front of them, there is a small table with a 
	pen and inkstand on top. The people remain standing, about twenty 
	Algerians, of all ages. They are speaking among themselves in thick 
	whispers. There is an expectant and ceremonious atmosphere. 

	BUZZING.

	Mahmoud was seventeen then. He has soft down on his cheeks, his first 
	beard. He is thin, his neck long and tense, his glance nervous. He 
	appears to be the protagonist of what is about to take place. His hair 
	is combed with care and covered with much hair cream. He is wearing a 
	clean and newly bought white costume.

	Many of the others come to speak with him; the younger ones are joking 
	and trying to provoke him. 

	AD LIB REMARKS.
 
	Mahmoud reacts comically with a grim frown with which he tries in vain 
	to hide his shyness. At the same time, he glances secretly, anxiously, 
	up to the empty balcony on the first floor. Much gay and lively 
	chattering can be heard from an open door above.
 

28	WEDDING ROOM. INSIDE. DAY.
 
 	In the room, a group of girls are busy preparing trays with cups of 
	coffee. They are little more than children, twelve or thirteen years 
	old, with soft complexions, white teeth, and shining eyes. They seem
	children who are playing, but beneath that veneer of gaiety, some 
	anxiety is noticeable, emotions in suspense. The faltering voice of an 
	old woman calls from the adjoining room.

	A girl leaves the group, lifts the dividing curtain, and nearing the 
	bed where the old woman is lying, she kneels beside her. The old woman 
	lifts her hand and places it on the girl's hair, caressing her 
	tenderly. She speaks in a wavering voice, and her small yet kind eyes 
	fill with tears. 

	OLD WOMAN'S SPEECH IN ARABIC.

	The girl nods yes, then she gets up and goes to rejoin her companions. 
	Passing before a mirror, she stops a minute to tidy her hair.
 

29	WEDDING HOUSE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	They appear on the balcony, then descend to the courtyard. The nervous 
	glance of Mahmoud scans their faces, then rests upon that girl who, 
	with lowered eyelids, also glances quickly at him. Meanwhile the trays 
	are being passed among the guests.

	Now the people turn to face the front door. A young man has entered 
	carrying a briefcase under his arm. Behind him are two boys who seem to 
	be his bodyguards, and are the only ones dressed in European clothes. 
	Both of them have their right hands under their jackets, which are old 
	and torn. They seem to be armed. They close the door, and remain 
	standing on either side of it.

	The man with the briefcase walks toward the table. All present look at 
	him respectfully. He smiles, responds to their greetings, shakes hands 
	with all. But he refuses coffee and seems to be in a hurry.

	He sits down, places his briefcase on the table, opens it, and takes 
	out a large notebook. From the open briefcase, the metallic butt of a 
	sub-machine gun appears.

	On the cover of the notebook is written: NLF -- ALGERIAN  AUTONOMOUS 
	ZONE. CIVIL RECORDS.
 
	He turns the pages of the notebook until he reaches the last written 
	page. Then he glances up toward the people who, in the meantime, have 
	taken their seats. He smiles, says a few words, then calls two names.
 
	Mahmoud walks forward stiffly, erect, his eyes staring straight ahead 
	of him.
 
	The girl also walks forward, with a perplexed expression. They sit down 
	next to each other, but without looking at each other. The ceremony 
	consists of a few words. Finally the two youths look at each other. 
	Mahmoud tries to smile, but he cannot.
 
	The girl's expression softens somewhat. Her glance is tender; she 
	lowers her face quickly. Meanwhile the others recite the verses of the 
	Koran in low voices. 

	CHORUS.
 

30	RUE D'ISLY. OUTSIDE. DAY. JUNE 20, 1956. 8:05 A.M.
 
	There is a French guard, no more than thirty years old. He has a blond 
	mustache, his beard recently shaved. There are few people in the 
	street. The guard walks slowly, glancing in the shop windows from time 
	to time to admire his reflection. He stops, adjusts his cap, and 
	smiles.
 
	An Algerian appears beside him; he is also young. The guard pretends to 
	be interested in the photographic equipment which is on display, then
	moves on.
 
	The Algerian's arm springs forward and returns quickly to its place. He 
	plunges the knife into the guard's neck.
 
	The guard opens his mouth wide to shout, but he cannot. The blood 
	gurgles in his gashed throat. None of the few passersby has seen what 
	happened. The guard falls flat on his face. Someone sees him and 
	screams.
 
	The Algerian hurls himself on top of the soldier, opens his holster, 
	takes his pistol, then gets up pulling the gun with him. The gun is 
	fastened by a leather cord. The cord gets tangled in the gashed neck of 
	the guard.

	The Algerian pulls in vain. He panics. He looks about him with 
	terrified eyes.
 
	People approach hurriedly. They are shouting. The Algerian pulls the 
	cord a second time, desperately.

	He regains his control, picks up the knife which is lying on the 
	ground, and cuts the leather cord, thus freeing the pistol. The others 
	have almost reached him and he is surrounded, but he manages to dodge 
	them, and escapes.
 

31	BOULEVARD BRU. OUTSIDE. DAY. 8:40 A.M.
 
	A group of zouaves on patrol, three soldiers and an officer. The street 
	is sloping; on the right there is a high fence covered with advertising 
	signs and cinematographic posters, all of them torn and full of holes; 
	the emptiness on the other side is visible through the holes.

	The soldiers are chatting among themselves and looking at the posters.

	A soldier stops because he sees something moving on the other side of 
	the fence.
 
	He points to it and shouts, but not in time. 

	MACHINE-GUN FIRE INTERRUPTED BY SINGLE SHOTS. 

	The soldier falls, the others remain motionless, unbelieving. They 
	begin to run and scatter and look for cover. 

	An Algerian appears on top of the fence. He moves like a cat, and jumps 
	from the other side.
 
	His invisible companions continue to shoot. He is unarmed, and runs to 
	the dead soldier. He grabs the machine gun and retraces his steps. The 
	action takes place in a second. 

	By now the soldiers too are shooting, but it is too late.
 

32	POLICE STATION. CHEMIN AIN-ZEBOUDJA. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. 9:10 A.M.
 
	A police station in the Casbah, a small prefabricated one-story
	building.
 
	At the main door there is a police guard. A group of five Algerians is 
	approaching. They are talking among themselves, and gesticulating.

	BUZZING.
 
	The policeman enjoys watching them, then asks what it's about. All five 
	of them answer him at once, trying to outdo one another.

	The policeman has to shout to make them keep quiet. Then, assuming a 
	very humble behavior, they enter silently. The oldest among them speaks 
	in a mournful voice. He seems to be crying and asks the sergeant 
	something.
 
	The policeman calls a colleague, and tells him to accompany the 
	Algerians. Four of them go with the policeman, while another remains in
 	the waiting room, saying that it is better because he is afraid of 
	losing his control.
 
	Then he begins to explain the reasons for the quarrel: it concerns a 
	will. The old man is his grandfather, but he has recently remarried. 
	Then from inside is heard ...
 
	MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
 
	The policeman reacts quickly and tries to draw his gun. But the 
	Algerian is faster and fires point-blank.

	The four reappear. One of them is wounded. All of them are armed with 
	revolvers, and carry at their sides a machine gun and two sub-machine 
	guns that they have taken from the armory. Other cries and shots are 
	heard behind them. 

	All five of them run out in haste.
 

33	RUE MARENGO. OUTSIDE. DAY. 9:45 A.M.
 
	Another police station. Two policemen are chatting in front of the 
	entrance.
 
	A black Renault is passing by at a walking speed, then slows down 
	almost to the point of halting completely.
 
	The right door opens and there is a burst of machine-gun fire. One of 
	the policemen has been, hit, and grabs the other so as not to fall.

	Another burst of ...
 
	MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
 
	The two policemen fall down together. The car motor is accelerated, the 
	tires screech and the Renault shoots forward.
 
	A military jeep arrives from the opposite direction, crashes into the 
	car and blocks its escape.
 
	An Algerian flees and is pursued. Another descends from the auto with 
	his hands raised. 

	The soldiers shoot and kill him.


34	AVENUE DU 8 NOVEMBRE. OUTSIDE. DAY. 1:10 P.M.
 
	A large garage with workshop and filling station. In front are some 
	automobiles and a military truck.

	A scooter with two Algerian boys passes by, rumbling noisily along the 
	road. Then at full speed, it makes a sharp turn, retraces its steps and 
	turns again. The boys seem to be showing off for fun.

	Meanwhile, the employees of the garage are leaving their work since it 
	is lunchtime. The attendant at the gasoline pumps is left alone.

	The scooter stops in front of the high-test gasoline pump. The attendant 
	is a European, an elderly man, who approaches them holding in one hand 
	some bread he has just unwrapped. He detaches the pump handle of high-
	test, and asks how many gallons.

	One of the Algerians points a revolver at the attendant, and tells him 
	to pour out the gasoline on the ground all around. The other, 
	meanwhile, goes to the other two gasoline pumps, detaches the handles, 
	and fastens them in an open position in order to empty them of
	gasoline. He uses two pieces of iron that he has brought with him to 
	clamp the handles open. He stretches the pump hoses as far as they can 
	go toward the garage and the parked cars.
 
	The gasoline flows all over the large square. The two youths are again 
	on the scooter; they tell the European to move away. They have soaked a 
	rag in gasoline and they light it. 

	The gasoline continues to flow from the two open pumps. The European is 
	by now far away, the scooter is already moving away, and at the same 
	time, the boys hurl the lit rag into the square. It immediately bursts 
	into flames.
 

35	COMMISSIONER's OFFICE. INSIDE. NIGHT. 

	The night of the same day, in an office of the police commissioner's 
	headquarters. On the desk, photos of the day's terroristic attempts are 
	piled in a heap. An employee is in front of his typewriter.

	The Assistant Commissioner is about forty years old, very robust. His 
	face is somewhat wide, ordinary, and with heavy features. He leafs 
	through the photos while speaking on the telephone. It is a very warm 
	night, and the window of the office is open. From outside is heard 
	the SOUND OF TRAFFIC.
 
 				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
			(on telephone) 
		Yes, sir, but they haven't received a 
		search-warrant yet. Rue d'Isly? We 
		followed them for a while, but then we 
		lost track ... Yes, sir, but it is in 
		another precinct. No, it wasn't in 
		theirs ... There are some suspects for 
		rue Marengo ... No ... the judge hasn't 
		given permission yet. He is requesting a 
		formal investigation first. Yes, sir, 
		yes ... Yes, sir, yes -- But we haven't 
		enough men. Of course, I understand ...
		If it were possible, sir, you should ... 
		but the Commissioner can't ... in ... But 
		couldn't you ... Alright, sir ...  We'll 
		let them cut our throats then!
 
 	He slams the receiver angrily and begins to dictate his report. His 
	voice is harsh, filled with rancor.
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER

		Patrol of the 3rd B.P.C. Place: Luciani

	The officer stops speaking, takes a glass from his desk, and goes near 
	the window. On the ledge, there is a bottle of beer, left there 
	evidently to keep it a bit cool. He takes it, fills his glass and 
	drinks.

	Then he speaks in a lowered voice, while looking outside, without even 
	giving any directions to the employee who waits with his hands poised 
	about the keyboard of his typewriter.
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
		I want to see the newspapers tomorrow. If 
		they're still talking about pacification 
		of our Moslem brothers!
 
	He returns to his desk.
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
		Where were we?

				EMPLOYEE
		Intersection, between Consular Street and 
		General Laquiere Avenue ...
 

36	VARIED FLASHES. POLICE STATIONS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	In front of police stations: Ain-Zeboudja ... rue Marengo ... and all 
	the others ... in the Casbah ... in the European quarters ... sandbag 
	entrenchments are being prepared, barbed wire is being stretched, 
	metallic lookout turrets are being set up. It is very hot. Workers and 
	policemen work in silence. There is an oppressive atmosphere.
 
				SPEAKER
		"Ordinance of the Prefecture of Algiers: 
		All police stations in Algiers, without 
		exception and until further notice, are 
		required to prepare and maintain external 
		protection devices. The shifting of guards 
		outside must continue uninterrupted 
		twenty-four hours a day. Sentinels must 
		be equipped with automatic weapons ..."
 

37	EUROPEAN AND CASBAH PHARMACIES. MUSTAPHA HOSPITAL. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.

	View of pharmacies in the European quarters and in the Casbah.

 	The shelves, medicines; people who are buying. The Mustapha hospital, 
	reserved for Algerians. The wards: hospitalized Algerians.

				SPEAKER
		"The Governor-General of Algiers decrees: 
		Article No. 1 -- The sale of medicinal 
		and pharmaceutical products, effective 
		for the cures of gunshot wounds, can be 
		made only to those who present written 
		authorization from the Commissioner of 
		Police.

		Article No. 2 -- Directors of all 
		hospitals and clinics must produce to the 
		police authorities an immediate listing 
		of all patients admitted to their 
		institutions for the care and treatment 
		of gunshot wounds."
 

38	CASBAH ROAD BLOCKS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	The Casbah is being closed off. Every point of entrance, every alley, 
	every street that joins the Casbah and the European quarters has been 
	blocked off with wooden horses and with barbed wire nine feet high.

	There are also workers, policemen, and soldiers who are working at the 
	barricades.
 
	Beyond them, on the other side of the barbed wire, the Algerians seem 
	to be encaged.
 
 				SPEAKER
		"The Prefecture of Algiers states: In 
		the course of these last few days, dozens 
		of assaults have been committed in this 
		city. We have reason to believe that the 
		assailants originate in the Casbah, and 
		that they have always found a speedy and 
		easy refuge in the alleys of the Arab 
		quarters. As a result, and in order to
		alleviate without delay the insecurity 
		that now reigns in the city, the 
		Prefecture of Algiers has decided that 
		entrance to the Casbah can only he 
		permitted at those points in the blockade
		under military control, where citizens in 
		transit must exhibit their documents at 
		request, and submit to eventual searches."
 
	The Casbah is imprisoned, like a huge concentration camp. Only five 
	streets have been left open, the widest streets. There are five exits 
	where the wooden horses serve to restrict passage, and where some 
	wooden posts for the guards are being built.

	Every exit is marked by a sign with large lettering.
 

39 	BLOCKADE MARENGO. OUTSIDE. DAY. AUGUST 10, 1956.
 
	At each blockade, there are two ramps, an entrance and an exit to the 
	Casbah. The Algerians and some Europeans crowd around in both 
	directions. The soldiers are wearing fatigues with helmets and machine 
	guns. The Europeans are not requested to show identity papers.

	The Algerians are often frisked, and accept this fact silently, 
	patiently, without any sign of intolerance. But if the soldiers attempt 
	to search a woman, then, it is different.
 
	A woman begins to shout, while waving her arms wildly, and pushes away 
	the soldier who had tried to search her. A stream of incoherent words.
 
	Other Algerians intervene; they push forward threateningly. The soldier 
	is young; he is timid and frightened. He looks over his back for help.

 	A police officer approaches. He has a different tone, and a very self-
	assured manner. He shouts at the Algerians to calm down.
 
				OFFICER
		Are you mad, touching one of their women? 
		Go on, go on, alright ... Go ahead, keep 
		moving!
 
 	The woman passes the blockade, but still continues her protest with a 
	shrill and unbearable voice.
 

40	RUE PHILIPPE. OUTSIDE. DAY. 8:35 A.M.
 
 	An Algerian woman walks along the sidewalk. She is elderly, fat, and is 
	wearing a traditional costume with her face veiled. She walks slowly 
	toward a bar, which has its tables outside, and already some customers.

	Near the bar, leaning against a wall, there is an Algerian who now 
	begins to move and goes to meet the old woman. They greet one another 
	with much warmth, like a mother and son who haven't seen each other for 
	a long time.
 
	They embrace, and the man searches at her breast among the folds of her 
	veil. He finds a revolver which is hung by a cord, and grabs it. They 
	are at ten or twelve feet distance from the bar. At a table, there is a 
	French soldier having coffee with cream, croissant, and an open 
	newspaper.
 
	The Algerian continues to embrace the old woman, and aims from above 
	her shoulders. Only one shot; the newspaper rips, the soldier tries to 
	get up again, his face full of blood. Then he collapses on the table.
 
	The Algerian has hidden the revolver in the woman's veil. The two 
	separate from their embrace. They seem terrified and surprised, and 
	move away from each other in different directions while the people are 
	rushing about and SHOUTING.
 

41	DE LA LYRE MARKET. OUTSIDE. DAY. 9:10 A.M.
 
 	The cries of the peddlers are loud and incoherent. An Algerian is 
	squatting on his heels in front of his wares scattered on the ground:
	clusters of aromatic herbs, jars of spices. A youth is in front of him, 
	and from time to time, he looks around him. He seems to be waiting.

	Now he bends down and begins to rummage through the herbs. He selects a 
	bunch of mint, weighs it in his hand, and argues the price with the 
	peddler.
 
	A policeman in the market passes nearby and watches. The youth waits a 
	second, then turns toward the back of the policeman, and stretches out 
	his arm.
 
	He has in his hand the bunch of mint; a revolver is hidden among the 
	greens. He shoots twice.
 
	The French policeman falls down. The youth drops the mint with the 
	revolver among the other herbs, and moves away in the midst of the
	crowd.
 

42 	RUE DE BAR-EL-QUED. OUTSIDE. DAY. 10:15 A.M.
 
	In front of the police station there are sandbags and a police guard at 
	duty with helmet and machine gun. The policeman jumps to attention and 
	salutes. An officer has come out of the station and returns his salute. 
	He moves away and walks along the sidewalk.
 
	There are few people. An Algerian seems to appear from nowhere, and 
	walks behind him. He is very young, is wearing a short-sleeved shirt 
	and blue jeans.
 
	The officer turns at the first corner. Further on, there is a row of 
	cars and a metallic sign which warns that the parking space is reserved 
	for police vehicles only.
 
	The officer hears the steps of the boy behind him, and summons him in a 
	brusque manner.
 
 				OFFICER
		What are you doing here? Where are you 
		going?
 
	The boy shrugs his thin, shoulders and lowers his head.
 
				BOY 
			(in servile tone)
		I'm going for a swim; my friends are 
		waiting for me.
 
	The officer curses under his breath and proceeds. He stops in front of 
	a Dyna-Panhard, parked not too far away. 

	The boy moves on a few yards past the automobile until he reaches a 
	metallic wastebasket which is fastened to the pole of a street lamp. He 
	stops there, then glances around. 

	The officer is not far behind him; he has taken his car keys from his 
	pocket, and is about to open the car door. The boy plunges his hand 
	into the basket, rummages among the torn papers, then suddenly turns, 
	points a revolver at the officer's back, and shoots.
 
	The man tries to clutch something, but slips and falls down. The boy 
	shoots again at the man on the ground, then plunges his hand again into 
	the wastebasket, drops the revolver, and glances around him. He breaks 
	into a run.
 
	The policemen come out of the police station hurriedly. 

	WHISTLES, ORDERS, EXCITED CRIES.
 
	They turn the corner. Some rush to the man lying on the ground. Others 
	jump into a jeep. Four of them jump on motorcycles that are lined up in
 	the rack. They move off in two directions.

	At the same time, wails of police sirens moving nearer are heard in the 
	distance. The street is deserted. There is no trace of the boy. 

	People are seen at their windows. The officer is lifted by his arms.
 
	An ambulance arrives and stops, its siren at full blast, its doors wide 
	open. The officer is placed inside.
 
	The motorcycles are racing through the sidestreets. The jeep converges 
	on them, then reverses its direction, moving while balanced on two 
	wheels.
 
	Passersby stop to watch, all of them Europeans. The siren's wail is at 
	a high pitch.
 

43	ADJACENT STREETS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	A deserted street, recently covered with wet asphalt. 

	A Moslem road worker is sitting on the ground next to a steamroller. 
	He is eating his lunch. The combined sounds of the siren's wail and the 
	rumbling of the motorcycles are heard approaching.
 
	Two motorcyclists appear in the street, passing by the road worker.

	One of them stops and turns around.
 
	The road worker moves backward to the street corner. He breaks into a 
	run. His eyes are burning with fear, his face is anxious, undecided.

	From the windows, the people point to him, and shout after him.

	A jeep appears in the street in front of him. 

	The motorcyclist approaches from the opposite direction. 

	The Algerian stops running; he doesn't know what to do. 

	From the windows, continuous SHOUTING.
 
	The Algerian leans against the wall, watches the scene, and begins to 
	cry. The policemen jump down from the jeep and leap at him. The 
	Algerian isn't able to speak, but only shakes his head.
 

44	POLICE STATION. INSIDE. DAY. 

	A room inside the police station. The Algerian's face is beaten from 
	right and left by a series of slaps.

	The room is filled with policemen. All of them are practically on top 
	of the Algerian; all of them are shouting. In the confusion can be 
	heard SHOUTS.
 
				VARIED VOICES
		Do you know he's dead, you bastard? Do you 
		know you killed him?

	They try to reach him, pushing against one another in order to get 
	closer and hit him. The Algerian is crying and speaks in broken-off 
	phrases, half Arabic and half French. His continual efforts to repeat 
	certain words are heard: 

				ALGERIAN
		No, no, no, no, ... me no ... Viva 
		France ...

	An officer arrives making his way.

				OFFICER
		Get out, go on, outside ... Get out of 
		the way! Go away ...

	They make way for him; he reaches the Algerian who tries to smile at 
	him, continually shaking his head: 

				ALGERIAN
		Sir ... sir ... sir ...
 
 				OFFICER 
		What's your name?
 
	The Algerian's mouth is dry; he tries to swallow.
 
				ALGERIAN 
		Sir ... sir ... sir ...
 
				OFFICER 
		What's your name?

				ALGERIAN 
			(straining, still 
			trying to swallow)
		Lardjane Boualem, sir ...
 

45	COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. INSIDE. NIGHT.
 
 	In the Commissioner's office, the Assistant Commissioner dictates:
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Guilty: Lardjane Boualem, manual worker, 
		married with three children. Resident in 
		rue de Thèbes, number eight ... So? How 
		many today?

	The employee removes the copies from the typewriter and begins to put 
	them in order. 

				EMPLOYEE
		Seven assaults, three dead.
 
	Then he moves to the desk, and hands over the various copies for 
	signature.
 
				EMPLOYEE
		Here, one for the Commissioner ... the 
		press offices ... the archives ... and 
		one for you, sir. 

	The Assistant Commissioner signs.

				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you 
		tomorrow.
 
				EMPLOYEE
		Good evening, sir.

	The employee salutes, then moves toward the door. He is about to go out 
	when the Assistant Commissioner stops him. 

				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Tell me ... Where is this rue de Thèbes?
 
				EMPLOYEE
		Rue de Thèbes? In the Upper Casbah, I 
		think ...
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
 
				EMPLOYEE
		Good evening, sir.

	The employee leaves and closes the door. The Assistant Commissioner 
	crosses the room to the large map of Algiers which covers the entire 
	wall. He moves his finger along the Casbah zone; as he moves it, he 
	follows it with his glance in that tangle of streets.

				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
			(to himself)
		Rue de Thèbes ... de Thèbes ... 

	He has found it. He observes it for a minute, then moves his finger 
	along the road leading to the European quarters. He finds the right 
	route, then concentrates in order to memorize it.

	He returns to the desk, lifts the receiver, and dials a number.

				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
    			(on the phone) 
		Hello, Engineer Henry Amaud, please ... 
		He's already left? Alright, yes, yes, 
		alright ... I have the number.
 
	He clicks the receiver, then dials another number. At the other end of 
	the line, a feminine voice is heard. The Assistant Commissioner 
	abandons his usual peremptory tone.
 
 				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
		Hello, Bernadette...Yes, right away. I'm 
		going to change my clothes first, and I'll 
		be right there. My wife is already there, 
		right? No, it's not important. But call 
		Henry for me. Just for a minute ... 
		Alright ... thanks ...
 
	He places the receiver on the desk, then puts on his jacket which is on 
	the back of his chair. He straightens his tie. Now from the receiver a 
	muffled voice is heard; the Assistant Commissioner picks up the 
	receiver.
 
 				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER
		Hello, Henry? ... Everything's okay. 
		Good. What are we going to tell our 
		wives? The club? Good idea, yes. I'll be 
		there right away. Just give me time to 
		change my clothes ... Ah, I've found the 
		address. No, it's better to talk in 
		person. Yes, it's the right place ... 
		Okay. Bye.
 
	He puts down the receiver, then goes to the coat-hanger and takes his 
	beret. He goes out after glancing again at the photos of the day's 
	assaults.
 

46	HENRY ARNAUD'S HOME. INSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	Two small children are kneeling in front of their beds.
 
				CHILDREN
		Notre Père, dans le ciel ...

	Two children, five or six years old, blond, charming, but not affected. 
	They seem to be twins, and are wearing identical pajamas.

	At the same time, a servant is preparing their beds for the night. She 
	is about fifty years old, her apron clean and ironed; she has gray 
	hair, her face that of a good woman. She is Algerian.  When the 
	children falter in their prayers, she helps them. When they have 
	finished she says with an Algerian accent:

				SERVANT
		Now, let's go to say good night.
 
 	In the dining room, there is a large open window. The beach, the sea, 
	and the sound of the surf are outside, not too distant. It is a starry 
	night. At a table, there are four men and four women, all of them well 
	dressed and tanned. It is the home of Henry and Bernadette Arnaud. The 
	Assistant Commissioner is in plain clothes. He and his wife seem ill at 
	ease, somewhat out of place.
 
	The maid and children have entered the room.
 
				BERNADETTE
		Come here, children. Say hello ...

				CHILDREN 
		Good evening ...

	The others smile. The servant accompanies the children to their 
	parents.

				CHILDREN
		Good night, daddy. Good night, mommy. 

				BERNADETTE 
		Good night, dear.
 
	They kiss. At the same time the women make the usual delighted 
	exclamations. One of the men attracts the Assistant Commissioner's 
	attention, points to his watch, and makes a sign.

	The Assistant Commissioner nods his head affirmatively.
 

47	ALGERIAN STREETS. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
 	A DS Citroen is crossing the city at high speed.

	The four men are inside. Arnaud is at the wheel. The Assistant 
	Commissioner is sitting in the back seat.
 

48 	CASBAH ENTRANCE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
 	The automobile arrives at Place du Gouvernement, takes a turn around 
	the square, then turns toward the blockade, and slows down.

	One of the soldiers moves to the center of the ramp, and raises the 
	phosphorescent flag. The car lowers its headlights and stops.

	The soldier goes to the driver's window. In his right hand, he is 
	holding a machine gun which hangs from his shoulders. He greets them.
 
	He bends to window level:

				SOLDIER 
		Good evening ...

	Arnaud responds in an innocent, cheerful tone: 

				ARNAUD
		Good evening ... Can we pass?

				SOLDIER 
		It's too late. No one is allowed to enter 
		the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.

				ARNAUD
		But it's not even midnight yet!

				SOLDIER 
		It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew 
		begins at midnight.

				ARNAUD
		Please, we just want to take a short ride. 
		A friend of mine has never seen the 
		Casbah.
 
				SOLDIER 
		I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of 
		the question.
 
	The Assistant Commissioner intervenes with the self-assured and 
	somewhat arrogant tone common to all policemen. He stretches his arm 
	toward the window and hands the soldier a card.
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		It's alright, they're with me. 

	The soldier examines the card by the glare of the headlights, hands it 
	back, and bringing his hand to his visor, he salutes. 

				SOLDIER 
		Okay, sir. Go ahead.
      
	The Assistant Commissioner salutes with his hand.
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Let's go, Henry. 

				ARNAUD 
			(he changes gears)
		Thank you. Good evening. 

	The soldier steps aside, and salutes again.

	The automobile begins to move, steadily increasing its speed.


49	CASBAH STREET. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. 

	The streets of the Casbah are deserted, almost completely blackened. 
	Some cats are frightened by the headlights and run close to the walls.
 
	Inside the car the four men are silent. They keep their eyes fixed 
	straight ahead of them, their faces concentrating, taut.
 
				ARNAUD 
		This way?

				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Yes, it's the first intersection ... or 
		the second.
 
 
50	RUE DE THÈBES. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	The automobile slows down at the first intersection. Arnaud leans out 
	the window and looks. There is an enamel nameplate -- RUE DE THÈBES.
 
				ARNAUD 
		Right or left?
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Try going to the right. 

	The car turns right, moving slowly.
 
	On one side of the street, the even numbers are getting higher: 26 ... 
	28 ... 30 ...
 
				ARNAUD 
		What number is it?
 
				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
		Eight.
      
	The man next to the Assistant Commissioner says:
 
				FRIEND
		Let's park here. It doesn't matter.
 
 				ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER 
			(in sharp tone) 
		It does matter. Go back, Henry. Let's go 
		to number eight.
 
	Arnaud puts the gears in reverse; the car moves back quickly and passes
 	the intersection: 16 ... 14 ... 12 ... 10 ... 8... it stops.

	Arnaud puts it in neutral. With the motor still running, he presses the 
	cigarette lighter on the dashboard.

	The Assistant Commissioner takes a large package that he is holding 
	under his legs on the car floor. It is wrapped in pieces of newspaper. 
	He lifts it forward. The man who is next to Arnaud takes it, leans it 
	against the back of his seat, touches it until he finds the right spot, 
	unwraps it from that part, and straightens a small plastic tube which 
	appears at the opening. It is a fuse.
 
				ARNAUD 
		How long do you want the timing device? 

				FRIEND
		Five minutes. Give me a match ...
 
	Arnaud takes the cigarette lighter from the dashboard.
 
	The other man has opened the car door. He takes the lighter and touches 
	it to the fuse which ignites immediately. The door of number eight is 
	very near, almost directly opposite the car door. 
 
	The man places the package in a shady area and returns to the car in a 
	run. Arnaud has already changed gears, releases the clutch, and the 
	automobile shoots forward.
 

51	RUE DE THÈBES. EXPLOSION. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. AUGUST 11, 1956. 12:20 A.M.

	The explosion is very violent. The fronts of buildings number eight, 
	ten, and twelve explode and collapse. 

	EXPLOSION.
 
	The echo of the explosion has ended. There is a long pause, only some 
	isolated noises resound. They are stressed, recognizable: a burning 
	beam, the thud of falling debris, broken glass ...

	Then suddenly and almost simultaneously with the other sounds, after 
	the shock, the human voices, the shouts and weeping are heard.

	VOICES, SHOUTS, WEEPING.
 

52	RUE DE THÈBES. OUTSIDE. DAWN.
 
	The dawn's light is clear and white. It dispels every shadow and 
	designs precisely every outline. Here and there, in the middle of the 
	sky, there are numerous clouds of dust, strangely motionless. In the 
	light, the human figures seem black. Seen from a distance, they seem to 
	be ants upon heaps of debris. There are women, motionless, weeping 
	softly, their voices similar to prayer. From time to time, there is a 
	sudden scream, a despairing sob, someone running.

	Another corpse is pulled out from the rubble, bodies mutilated or still 
	intact -- they are all dead.

	The people continue to rummage through the debris and to wait around 
	pitifully.
 

53	CASBAH STREETS. OUTSIDE. DAY.

	But there is no pity in the other streets and alleys of the Casbah, or 
	at the top of the steps. There is anger and hatred. The people are 
	running and shouting.

	They are shouting from their windows and balconies:
 
	JU-JU.
 
	They smother every other sound. The excitement increases. They run 
	where there is more shouting, more people. They don't know what to do 
	yet, but want to be together. Until there is a voice stronger and 
	clearer than the others which gives them a goal and direction.

	Ali la Pointe points below beyond the slopes of the alleys and 
	stairways. There below are the European quarters which widen near the 
	sea.
 
	The crowd is shouting, pushing, rushing forward with him, like a raging 
	stream, tumultuous and unrestrainable. Ali is together with his men, 
	five boys, one of them older than twenty. All of them are armed. The 
	crowd forces them to quicken their step to a run.

	Petit Omar is furthest in the rear. He is wearing a pair of short 
	pants, his chest bare; he is barefoot. He calls Ali with all his might, 
	but in vain.

	He tries to join Ali, to make his way through the legs of the others; 
	he runs, clinging to the others, pushes, passes near the walls; then, 
	turning into a side-street, he rushes into an alleyway, and finally 
	arrives in front. He runs to Ali, almost out of breath.
 
				PETIT OMAR 
			(shouting)
		Kader says to stop them! He says we've 
		got to stop them!
 
	Ali slows down as much as he can with the crowd pushing him from 
	behind.
 
				ALI 
		Where's Kader?
 
				PETIT OMAR 
		With the others. They are trying to stop 
		the people.
 
				ALI 
		Go away.

	Their voices can hardly be heard or understood amid the loud noises.
 
				PETIT OMAR 
		But he says that if we go on like this, 
		we're playing their game, and they'll 
		murder everyone ... Stop, Ali!
 
	Ali continues to run. His face is sullen, frowning, as always when he 
	must choose between instinct and reason. Omar calls him again. His 
	voice is hysterical, repeating again to stop. He is hanging on one of 
	Ali's arms. Ali jerks himself free violently; he strikes the child. 
	Omar sways and falls against the wall.

	With this movement, Ali seems to release his anger at not being able to 
	carry out his actions.

	He slows down, speaks to his men, a few words in Arabic, his voice cold 
	and bitter.
 
	Ali extends his arm and the others imitate him. Each man grabs another 
	by the arm, forming a chain. They check the flow behind them and hold 
	back the crowd that is pressing forward.
 

54 	KADER'S HOUSE. INSIDE. DAY. SEPTEMBER 30, 1956.
 
	Djamila, the girl who in January, in rue Random, gave the revolver to 
	Ali la Pointe, is now standing in front of a large mirror. She removes 
	the veil from her face. Her glance is hard and intense; her face is 
	expressionless. The mirror reflects a large part of the room: it is a 
	bedroom. There are three other girls.
 
	There is Zohra, who is about the same age as Djamila. She undresses, 
	removing her traditional costume, and is wearing a slip ...

	There is Hassiba who is pouring a bottle of peroxide into a basin. She 
	dips her long black hair into the water to dye it blond.

	Every action is performed precisely and carefully. They are like three 
	actresses preparing for the stage. But there is no gaiety; no one is 
	speaking. Only silence emphasizes the detailed rhythm of their 
	transformation ...

	Djamila's lightweight European dress of printed silk ...

	Zohra's blouse and short skirt to her knees ... make-up, lipstick, 
	high-heeled shoes, silk stockings ...

	Hassiba has wrapped her hair in a towel to dry it ... a pair of blue 
	jeans, a striped clinging tee-shirt ...

	Her blond hair is now dry. She ties it behind in a ponytail. Hassiba 
	has a young, slim figure. She seems to be a young European girl who is 
	preparing to go to the beach. 

	Continual silence. Djamila and Zohra have finished their preparations 
	and sit down to wait. Hassiba is still barefoot. She is putting on her 
	sandals, when someone knocks at the door.
 
	Djamila gets up and goes to open it. 

	It is Kader.

	A quick attentive glance; Djamila ... Zohra ... Hassiba ...

	Hassiba responds to his look with a gay and somewhat coquettish 
	expression; she says, stressing her French:
 
				HASSIBA
		Ça va, monsieur?
 
 	Kader smiles for a second, without any gaiety, but to please her. Then
	he speaks briefly and harshly in Arabic. And turning one at a time to
 	each of the three, he gives them three addresses.
 
				KADER 
			(to Djamila)
		Number three rue de Chêne.
			(to Zohra)
		Number fourteen rue Monseigneur Leynaud. 
			(to Hassiba)
		Number twenty-one rue de l'Hydre.
 
	Each one of the girls repeats, in turn, the address which he has given 
	her. Each one of the three responds emotionally. The atmosphere is 
	tense. Kader bids them farewell according to the Algerian custom, first 
	bringing his right hand over his heart. Then he embraces them.

	They look at him for a moment; they are embarrassed. Kader tries to 
	ease their discomfort, smiles, and answers Hassiba's previous remark.
 
				KADER 
		Ça va ... Et bonnes chances!
 

55	RUE DE L'HYDRE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. 5:45 P.M.
 
	At number twenty-one rue de l'Hydre, there is a bread store. Hassiba 
	has again covered her face with a veil, and is also wearing a white 
	cloak which covers her whole body. 

	She enters the store. There are other women who are buying bread. 
	Hassiba waits for them to leave, then says in Arabic to the shopkeeper:
 
				HASSIBA
		I've come to take the package ...
 
	The shopkeeper empties half a basket of bread; at the bottom, there is 
	a beach bag with a shoulder-strap, and he gives it to Hassiba.

	Hassiba hides it under her cloak, bends her head in a sign of farewell, 
	and leaves.
 

56	RUE MONS. LEYNAUD. INSIDE. DAY. 5:45 P.M. 

	At number fourteen rue Monseigneur Leynaud, there is a tailor shop and 
	clothing store. Zohra is also wearing the veil and white cloak. She 
	enters.
 
				ZOHRA
		I've come to take the package ...
 
	The tailor accompanies her to the back of the shop, where there is a 
	workroom and young girls who are sewing. He rummages in a closet, takes 
	out an Air France utility bag and gives it to Zohra who hides it under 
	her cloak, greets him, and leaves.
 

57	RUE DU CHÊNE. INSIDE. DAY. 

	Inside number three rue du Chêne, an Algerian craftsman is working in 
	filigree. Djamila takes a small leather cosmetic case.

	Djamila hides it, greets the man, and leaves.
 

58	ALLEY AND BLOCKADE. RUE MARENGO. INSIDE/OUTSIDE. DAY. 6:05 P.M. 

	At an intersection of rue Marengo, an alley, Hassiba enters a large 
	door, and shuts it. In a second, she has removed her veil and cloak. 
	Her face is made up; she is wearing pants and a jersey top. She places 
	the strap of her bag on her shoulder.
 
	Inside the bag, a towel and bathing suit are visible. 

	Hassiba goes out the door, proceeds down the alley until she reaches 
	rue Marengo. She approaches the blockade. 

	It is Saturday evening; there is a hurried bustle of Algerians and 
	Europeans. Soldiers and policemen, are very busy with their usual 
	requests for documents.

	Hassiba's arrival is quickly noticed for she is very pretty and 
	attracts much attention. Some soldiers whistle.

	An elderly Algerian woman looks at her with dislike. Hassiba is 
	indifferent and waits her turn. A French soldier approaches her.
 
				SOLDIER
		I'd like to search you, Miss ...

	For an instant, Hassiba is dismayed; then, she glances down at her 
	clinging shirt and pants.
 
				HASSIBA 
			(innocently)
		Where?
      
	The boy is young, handsome, and cheeky. 

				SOLDIER
		Not here. There's too many people.

				HASSIBA 
		But you don't understand. I was saying 
		that there's nothing to search.

				SOLDIER
		That's what you think!
 
	Some Europeans laugh, the Algerians seem not to see or hear, but it is 
	evident that they are scornful.

				SECOND SOLDIER
		Are you going for a swim, Miss ... all by 
		yourself?

				HASSIBA 
		No, with some friends.
     
	At the same time, she passes the blockade. 

				SECOND SOLDIER
		Lucky them. Next Sunday I'm free .... Shall
		we go together?
     
	Hassiba shrugs her shoulders, smiles again, and moves away.
 
 
59	BLOCKADE RUE DU DIVAN. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	At the rue du Divan blockade, Zohra too is dressed like a European, and 
	seems to be calm.
 
	There are not too many people. A soldier makes a sign for her to pass 
	in a hurried manner, and the girl passes.
 

60	BLOCKADE RUE DE LA LYRE. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	Djamila is tense, pale, her features are strained. Her eyes seem even 
	larger with make-up. Now, at the blockade at rue de la Lyre, the Casbah 
	exit is blocked. An Algerian has been discovered without documents. He 
	argues, shouts, and says that he wants to go back. 

	INCOHERENT VOICES.

	The soldiers try to catch him, he struggles to get free. 

	Meanwhile the people push forward in protest. Two soldiers catch the 
	Algerian, and drag him bodily into the guard posts. The flow of people 
	continues.

	Djamila steps forward, holding the cosmetic-case with both of her 
	hands. She doesn't know how to carry it, and from time to time she 
	changes her position. She realizes that she looks awkward.

	It's now her turn. The soldiers' tone is arrogant. The previous scene 
	has made them nervous. An officer signals her to pass, then points to 
	the cosmetic-case.
 
 				OFFICER 
		What's inside?
 
 	Instinctively, Djamila lifts the case and looks at it; she feels 
	herself failing, but makes an effort to answer.
 
				DJAMILA 
		Here?

 				OFFICER 
		There ...
 
	Djamila uses all her strength to smile and she succeeds. Her eyes light 
	up defiantly.
 
 				DJAMILA 
			(provocatively)
		Nothing. 

	The officer signals her to pass.
 

61	FISH-MARKET. INSIDE. DAY. 6:15 P.M.
 
	A large warehouse in the fish-market. There are enormous iceboxes with 
	cartons of frozen fish and tubs with running water and live fish. The 
	three girls are next to one another. 

	The three bags are on top of the counter, a few steps away. With them 
	is a thin Algerian about twenty-five years old. He has thick black 
	hair, straight and combed neatly. He is wearing glasses. With his rough 
	and nervous hands, he pulls out the towel and bathing suit from 
	Hassiba's bag, then delicately and carefully, a square wooden box. He
	opens it, and turning to the girl, signals her to move away a bit. The 
	girl steps back. In the box, there is a huge iron tube, sealed at both 
	ends by two clock dials. Inside the tube, two batteries with wires are 
	attached to the dials. The youth glances at his wristwatch, then 
	adjusts the hands of the dials to six forty-five. He puts the bomb back 
	into the box, closes it, and places it in the bag. He replaces the 
	towel and bathing suit, then hands the bag to Hassiba. He is smiling 
	slightly. 

	Hassiba takes the bag and goes away.

	The box fits perfectly into Djamila's cosmetic-case. The youth opens it 
	without removing it from the case, adjusts the two dials to six fifty, 
	puts everything back in its place, and hands the case to Djamila. He 
	smiles at her and she moves away. In the Air France bag, there are 
	newspapers and magazines on top, and the same box. The youth adjusts 
	the bomb to six fifty-five, arranges it again inside the bag, closes 
	the zipper, and hands the bag to Zohra. He smiles at her. His smile is 
	more genuine, less mechanical. There is less tension than before.

	The youth smiles at the girl and says in Arabic:
 
 				ALGERIAN
		May Allah protect you.
 
	Zohra thanks him in a whisper, bends her head, and moves away. The 
	youth takes a cigarette from his shirt pocket, places it between his 
	lips, and lights it. His hand is trembling a little.
 

62	CAFETERIA RUE MICHELET. INSIDE. DAY. 6:30 P.M.
 
	Cafeteria, rue Michelet 1. The club is very crowded. There are two 
	rooms; one at the entrance with an American-style bar, and one at the 
	back with tables. It is Saturday, and at this hour many European
	families go out to have an ice cream. There is not too much confusion 
	or uproar. The people are calm, they take their places at the bar and 
	small tables, and eat their ice cream while chatting quietly.

	Hassiba enters, glances at the large clock above the cash register. It 
	is half past six. She goes to the register and waits her turn. The 
	different orders mingle; she orders a Coca-Cola. They give her the 
	check. She pays.

	She goes to the bar; all the seats are taken. She gives her order and 
	the ticket to the waiter.
 
	A man moves aside, looks at her, then steps down from his stool and 
	offers it to her.
 
	Hassiba tells him that it doesn't matter, but the man insists. Hassiba 
	thanks him and sits down. The man is about fifty, well groomed. He 
	smiles again, and turns to chat with some friends.

	Hassiba settles herself more comfortably on the seat, then removes the 
	bag from her shoulder. Holding it by the strap, she places it on the 
	floor below the counter behind the brass railing used to lean one's 
	feet.
 
	The waiter has brought her the drink. Hassiba drinks slowly, from time 
	to time glancing at the clock. She finishes drinking. The bag is in a 
	vertical position.
 
	Moving her feet slowly and carefully, Hassiba lets the bag slip on its 
	side.
 
	She gets down from the seat, and points it out to the man who is 
	standing next to her. 

				HASSIBA
		I'm giving your seat back. 

				MAN
		Are you already leaving, Miss? 

	Hassiba smiles, nods yes. 

				HASSIBA
		Good evening ...

	The man sits down.
 
 				MAN
		Good evening ...
 

63	MILK BAR. RUE D'ISLY. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.
 
	Milk Bar, rue d'Isly, at the corner of Place Bugeand. The jukebox is 
	playing full blast. It is a bar for young people. There is much bustle 
	and confusion, much laughter. The girls are making plans for Sunday.

	Djamila enters and moves to the jukebox which is in the corner near the 
	door. There are playbills for various theater performances hanging on
 	the wall. Djamila stops to look at them and reads the bottom lines. She 
	places the cosmetic-case on the floor. Rising again she looks around 
	her, and pushes the case behind the jukebox with her foot ...
 

64 	AIR FRANCE. IMMEUBLE MAURETANIA. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	Maison Blanche, Immeuble Mauretania. The entire ground floor is filled 
	with ticket counters and a waiting room for the airlines. There are 
	some employees, stewardesses and some travelers.
 
	Zohra passes through the large glass door at the entrance, goes to the 
	Air France counter, takes a time schedule, then goes to sit down on a 
	sofa which runs along the opposite wall. She sits down and places the 
	airline bag on the ground in front of her, and begins to leaf through 
	the timetable, from time to time glancing around. Using her heels, she 
	pushes the bag under the sofa.

	She looks at the large electric clock which is hanging in the center of 
	the room; it is forty minutes past six.
 
 
65	CAFETERIA RUE MICHELET. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	It is six forty-four by the cafeteria clock. The second hand is moving.
 	There are more or less the same people. The old man is still seated on
 	the barstool, and continues to chat.

	Hassiba's bag is still at his feet; the second hand is racing. A five-
	year-old child hands a coin to the waiter:
 
				CHILD
		Ice cream ...

	The father and mother are watching him, delighted. The waiter smiles at 
	the child and points to the cash register. He speaks to the child in 
	the usual tone of a grownup when speaking to children:
 
 				WAITER
		You have to go there first ... and then 
		come back to me.

	The second hand reaches twenty-five, then thirty. The child goes to the 
	cashier and pays. The cashier smiles at him and gives him the check.
 
				CASHIER
		What a good boy ...

	The child returns to the counter. The waiter has already prepared the 
	ice cream for him, and hands it to him. The child is standing on
	tiptoes.
 

66	CAFETERIA MICHELET. EXPLOSION. INSIDE. DAY. 

	The second hand, the explosion: bodies flung into the air, arms, legs, 
	white smoke, screams.
 
	Bodies thrown outside, the doors unhinged, the windows broken, empty.

	The people watch from their windows, the passersby move closer, they 
	bend down to look at those who are writhing on the ground.

	Astonished and incredulous faces. No one speaks. Only screams and 
	weeping. Sirens which are drawing nearer. Firemen and police 
	arriving ...
 

67	MILK BAR. RUE D'ISLY. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The ambulance sirens on rue d'Isly, one car after another. 

	At the Milk Bar, the people go to the doors to look at the ambulances 
	which are racing toward Place Bugeand. The sirens fade in the distance 
	and move away. The jukebox is again loud: "Brigitte Bardot, Bardot ..." 

	The people re-enter the bar, chattering, to have their apéritifs. It is 
	six fifty: the explosion.
 

68 	MILK BAR. EXPLOSION. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	The jukebox is flung into the middle of the street. There is blood,
 	strips of flesh, material, the same scene as at the Cafeteria; the 
	white smoke and shouts, weeping, hysterical girls' screams. One of them 
	no longer has an arm and runs around, howling despairingly; it is 
	impossible to control her. The sound of sirens is heard again. The 
	crowd of people, the firemen, police, ambulances all rush to the scene 
	from Place Bugeand.

	The ambulances arrive at rue Michelet.

	They are already loaded with dead and wounded. The relatives of the 
	wounded are forced to get out. The father of the child who was buying 
	ice cream seems to be in a daze: he doesn't understand.

	They pull him down by force. The child remains there, his blond head a 
	clot of blood.
 
	The policemen try to bring order to the chaos, are forced to shout, 
	push, threaten. The wounded swarm around the ambulances. A Commissioner 
	sends off the first one.
 
 				COMMISSIONER
		What time is it?
 
 				POLICEMAN
		A quarter to seven.
 
 	The Commissioner goes to the second ambulance, pulls down a man who is 
	trying to enter by force, slams the door, and shouts to the driver. His 
	face is pale and drawn; the veins of his neck are swollen.
 
				COMMISSIONER 
		Go away, for God's sake!
 
	The auto leaves and now, the third explosion resounds in the distance. 
	It is heard clearly and violently from the Mauretania section.

	The Commissioner stops midway in his last gesture, and likewise, all 
	the others, who are paralyzed with fright, incapable of taking action
	again, of accepting such reality for a third time.

	In Place Bugeand, there also, the people are motionless. All of them 
	are looking in the same direction. Their faces are alike in their 
	terror, alike in their sense of impotence, alike in their deep sadness.


69	STREET. EUROPEAN CITY. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The sun appears, then hides behind black clouds. There is a cool wind.
 	It is ten in the morning, and the European city has its usual rapid and 
	efficient rhythm of every day at this hour, only there is terror 
	written on the face of every person. That same terror has remained, and 
	suspicion, and despairing impotence.

	Patrols of soldiers and policemen move around the city, search 
	Algerians and some Europeans, stop automobiles, trucks, buses, and 
	trams that they block at both doors. 

	At the entrance to every shop, the owner searches every customer before 
	letting him enter.
 
	He does so politely with a drawn smile, and methodically rummages 
	through every handbag, every package. 

	So too in the bars, in the offices, in workshops ... And now that it is 
	already late afternoon, also outside the brothels, the cinemas, the 
	theaters.
 

70	LEMONS STREET. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
 
	A young Algerian boy thirteen or fourteen years old, wearing sandals
	without socks, trousers that reach to his ankles, walks quickly 
	carrying a cardboard box tied with a cord. It is dusk.
 
	A European woman sees him pass in front of her, looks at him, and 
	follows him with her glance.
 
	On the sidewalk there are some youths. The woman points to the Algerian 
	boy, says something. The traffic is heavy. Her words are unclear. One 
	youth calls to the boy who is by now thirty feet away:

				YOUTH
		Hey, little rat ...
 
	The boy turns around for a second, his face frightened, and quickens 
	his step. The youths follow behind him and the boy begins to run. The 
	youths too begin to run and others join them, people who are passing. 
	They form a small mob and are shouting. The boy shoots into a
	sidestreet, drops his box, and races ahead.

	While some chase the boy, others stop around the box, make way, look 
	for a policeman, a soldier, an officer. A circle continues to form 
	around the box. A patrol arrives. One of the soldiers has a Geiger 
	counter. He moves near the box, carefully placing the counter above it, 
	then ceasing to be prudent, he takes his bayonette, cuts the cord, and 
	tears open the box: lemons.
 

71	STREET CORNER. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
 
	The boy has been cornered, surrounded, pinned down, kicked, hit with 
	umbrellas, until he is exhausted and can no longer defend himself. He 
	is no longer moving. He is lying on the ground, dead. The air is gray 
	now, and slowly all the colors unite to form gray. Lights are lit in
	the city and contrast with the whiteness of the Casbah high above. The 
	sky is still clear, the black profiles of the mountains, the straight 
	coasts on the sea, the sea itself that seems to be land until it 
	reaches the horizon where the moon rises between the clouds.
 
				SPEAKER
		"Following a lengthy discussion, the 
		General Assembly of the United Nations has 
		decided its agenda for the forthcoming 
		debates:
 
		(1) re-unification of Korea 
		(2) disarmament 
		(3) the Algerian question.

		Colombia has proposed that only the first 
		two points be discussed for the day. 
		However, the Afro-Asian nations opposed, 
		underlining the importance they attribute 
		to the Algerian question ..."
 

72	SEA-FRONT. OUTSIDE. DAY. JANUARY 10, 1957.
 
	The European crowd applauds, their eyes aglow, their mouths wide open, 
	shouting and yelling, their teeth flashing in the sun. Clapping of 
	applause on the sea-front of Algiers. Children, are held up to see, 
	waving small flags. The paratroopers of the Tenth Division march past.
 
				SPEAKER
		"Mr. Raymond Lefevre, Inspector General 
		of the Administration, has presided over 
		a meeting in which important decisions 
		have been taken with the aim of securing 
		public order and the protection of 
		persons and their property. In particular, 
		it has been decided to recall the 'Tenth' 
		Division of paratroopers to Algiers that, 
		until now, has been employed in the 
		antiguerrilla operations on the Cabiro 
		plateau. The Commander General of the 
		Tenth Division will assume responsibility 
		for the maintenance of order in Algiers, 
		and will have at his disposal in order to 
		achieve this goal, all civil and military 
		means provided for the defense of the 
		zone."
 
	Massu and the authorities are standing on the balconies of the 
	Prefecture building.
 
	The paras are marching, their sleeves rolled up, their faces sunburned. 
	Machine guns, bazookas, crew-cuts, the eyes of singing boys, silent 
	steps, one battalion after another. 

	The dragon "black berets" pass by ...

	The "red berets" of the 2nd Regiment of colonial paratroopers ...

	"Les casquettes" of the 3rd Regiment parade by; "les hommes-peints,"
	Mathieu's paras.
 
	Colonel Mathieu is at the head of the regiment. He is tall, slender, 
	over fifty. He has thinning gray hair, a lean face, blue eyes, and a 
	wide forehead. His face is lined with many wrinkles. Were it not for 
	the uniform, the weapons, his tanned skin, his manner of walking, and 
	his energetic voice when giving orders, he wouldn't seem a soldier, but 
	an intellectual.
 
 	The 3rd Regiment colonial paratroopers are now before the Commissioner. 
	Mathieu turns his head slightly and: 

				MATHIEU 
		3rd Regiment! Attention à droite ... 
		Droite!
 
				SPEAKER
		Family name: Mathieu; Name: Philippe; 
		Born in Rennes May 3, 1906; Rank:

		Politechnique-degree in Engineering; 
		Campaigns: Second World War, Anti-Nazi 
		Resistance Movement, Italian Campaign, 
		Indochinese War, Algerian War ...
 

73	VILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	In a villa in the military headquarters, a reception room is visible 
	through a large window on the first floor. There are about twenty 
	officers seated in rows of chairs as if for a lecture. Mathieu is in 
	front of them and he is speaking while standing next to a desk. At his 
	back there is a blackboard, and near it, a large map with pyramid 
	graphs, cells, arrows, crossmarks, and, above them, the title: 
	STRUCTURE NLF AUTONOMOUS ZONE OF ALGIERS.

	Mathieu's voice has nothing of the military and traditional. His tone 
	is neither harsh nor cold, but rather kind and pleasing; from it
 	emanates a superior authority imposed by reason and not by position.
 
				MATHIEU 
		The result is that in the last two 
		months, they have reached an average of 
		4.2 assaults per day, including 
		aggression against individuals, and the 
		explosions. Of course, the conditions of 
		the problem are as usual: first, the 
		adversary; second, the method to destroy 
		him ... There are 80,000 Arabs in the 
		Casbah. Are they all against us? We know 
		they are not. In reality, it is only a 
		small minority that dominates with 
		terror and violence. This minority is 
		our adversary and we must isolate and 
		destroy it ...
 
	While speaking, he goes to the window, and pulls down the shade. He 
	interrupts his speech, points to the rest of the window:
 
				MATHIEU 
		Draw it down there too ...
 
	Two or three officers stand up to perform the task. At the back of the 
	room there is a movie projector. 

	Next to it there is a para who is preparing to operate it. 

	The other shades are drawn, and gradually the room is darkened.

	Mathieu, meanwhile, has resumed speaking:
 
				MATHIEU 
		He is an adversary who shifts his 
		position above and below the surface with 
		highly commendable revolutionary methods
 		and original tactics. ... He is an 
		anonymous and unrecognizable enemy who 
		mingles with thousands of others who 
		resemble him. We find him everywhere: in 
		the alleys of the Casbah; in the streets 
		of the European city, and in working 
		places.

	Mathieu interrupts himself again and makes a signal to the back of the 
	room which is completely darkened.
 
				MATHIEU
		Go ahead, Martin.

	Martin turns on the projector. On the white wall next to the map and 
	graph appear pictures of the Casbah. There are the blockades, the 
	barbed wire, the metal screens, the Algerians who exit and enter, the 
	policemen and soldiers who examine documents and frisk someone. From 
	time to time, close-ups of the pictures are shown, enlarged to the 
	minutest details, close-ups of faces, motionless images that last only 
	for a few seconds.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Here is some film taken by the police. 
		The cameras were hidden at the Casbah 
		exits. They thought these films might be 
		useful, and in fact they are useful in 
		demonstrating the usefulness of certain 
		methods. Or, at least, their inadequacy.

	Hassiba is now seen and the soldiers who are wooing her, while she 
	laughs, jokes, flirts in a provocative manner, and passes the blockade.
 
				MATHIEU 
		I chose these films because they were 
		shot in the hours preceding some recent 
		terroristic assaults. And so, among all 
		these Arabs, men and women, there are the 
		ones responsible. But which ones are they? 
		How can we recognize them? Controlling 
		documents is ridiculous: one who has 
		everything in order is most likely to be 
		the terrorist.

	An Algerian is being dragged away while protesting, kicking, and trying 
	to free himself. And then the scene changes. There is another Casbah 
	exit, and an Algerian who is being searched.
 
 				MATHIEU 
			(smiling)
		Note the intuition of the cameraman. He 
		realized that in that box, there had to 
		be something of interest, and he paused 
		to focus it.
 
	The picture is enlarged. The small box which the Algerian is carrying 
	on his shoulder is seen in detail. It is opened. The box is swarming 
	with snakes; the soldier who had wanted to examine it jumps backward.

	The officers in the room burst into laughter.

				MATHIEU 
			(laughing)
		Maybe the bomb was hidden right there, in 
		a double bottom. Who knows? We'll never 
		know.
 
	Using the barrel of his machine gun, a soldier has closed the box. A 
	snake has managed to jump out, and fallen to the ground. The people are 
	terrified and move away. Others laugh, among them, Petit Omar, who 
	seems to be an ordinary child enjoying himself. 

				MATHIEU 
		That's enough, Martin ...

	The lights are again switched on in the room. Mathieu is again next to 
	the desk, and waits a second until the buzz of comments subsides.

				MATHIEU
		We must start again from scratch. The only 
		information that we have concerns the 
		structure of the organization. And we 
		shall begin from that ...

	He takes a wooden pointer from the desk in order to illustrate the 
	graph, while he speaks with the tone and precision of a university 
	professor.
 
				MATHIEU 
		It is a pyramid-like organization divided 
		into a series of sectors. At the top of 
		the pyramid is their General Staff. 

	He has moved near the blackboard, and taken some chalk, and slowly as 
	he speaks, he illustrates his speech. 

				MATHIEU 
		The military commander responsible for 
		the executive body finds the right man 
		and nominates him to responsibility for 
		a sector: number one. Number one in his 
		turn, chooses another two: number two and 
		number three ... And so they form the 
		first triangle.

	He has written high on the board a number one and below it, with some 
	space between them, the numbers two and three. He unites the three 
	numbers with lines and forms a triangle. 

				MATHIEU 
		Now number two and number three choose, 
		in their turn, two men each ... number 
		four and five, and so on ...
 
	Mathieu writes the new numbers, spacing them on the next line. Then he 
	unites two to four and five, and three to six and seven, forming two 
	new triangles.
 
	Mathieu has written other numbers and unites them to those of the 
	preceding line and thus forms other triangles. Now the blackboard is 
	covered by a series of triangles that form a large pyramid.
 
				MATHIEU 
		The reason for this geometry is so that 
		every militant will know only three 
		members in the entire organization: his 
		commander who has chosen him, and the two 
		members that he himself has chosen ... 
		Contacts take place only by written 
		instructions ... That is why we do not 
		know our adversaries: because, in 
		practice, they do not even know each 
		other.

	Mathieu leaves the blackboard and moves near the officers. The tone of 
	his voice changes. The explanation is now finished. He gives 
	directions ... 
 
				MATHIEU 
		To know them means to eliminate them. 
		Consequently, the military aspect is 
		secondary to the police method. I know we
 		are not fond of this word, but it is the 
		only word that indicates exactly the type 
		of work that we must perform. We must 
		make the necessary investigations in 
		order to proceed from one vertex to 
		another in the entire pyramid. The 
		reason for this work is information. The 
		method is interrogation. And 
		interrogation becomes a method when 
		conducted in a manner so as to always 
		obtain a result, or rather, an answer. 
		In practice, demonstrating a false 
		humanitarianism only leads to the 
		ridiculous and to impotence. I am 
		certain that all the units will 
		understand and react accordingly. 
		However, success does not depend solely 
		on us. We need to have the Casbah at our 
		disposal. We must sift through it ... and 
		interrogate everyone. And here is where 
		we find ourselves hindered by a 
		conspiracy of laws and regulations that 
		continue to be operative, as if Algiers 
		were a holiday resort and not a 
		battleground. We have requested a carte 
		blanche. But it is very difficult to 
		obtain. Therefore, it is necessary to 
		find an excuse to legitimize our 
		intervention, and make it possible. It 
		is necessary to create it ourselves --
		this excuse. Unless our adversaries will 
		think of it themselves, which seems to be 
		what they are doing.
 

74	ALLEY UPPER CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	It is not a song, but a type of spoken chorus, an assembly of young 
	voices, words whispered from the throat, both high and low, and sudden 
	silent pauses. It is monotonous; but it is just such a repetition, 
	always with the same pattern of tones -- high, low, then, silent -- 
	that manages to transform itself into a motif, reach an excited pitch, 
	and acquire breadth and solemnity. The sound fills the alleys, rises 
	toward the long rectangle of sky, and moves farther away as if it were 
	meant to be heard by all.

	The alley is narrow and sloping, with crumbling walls, tufts of grass,
 	and refuse. It is located at the outer periphery of the Casbah -- the 
	countryside is in the background. An Algerian is walking with large 
	steps; a five-year-old child is behind him, moving quickly, stumbling 
	from time to time on the pavement; although he does not cry, 
	occasionally he calls to his father, who proceeds forward, and does not 
	turn around. The chorus arises from behind them. It is incoherent. They 
	stop in front of a door; they have arrived. The door gives way and they 
	enter.
 

75	KORAN SCHOOL. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	A large room, like a shop or stable. Here too, on the ground and 
	pavement, there are tufts of grass. It is cold. The walls are 
	unplastered, the windows boarded. The roof is in sight, but not the 
	beams. The roof is made of tiles and covered with a coat of whitewash.
 
	There are about twenty children, five to eight years old, seated on the 
	floor. The teacher is in front of them; he too is seated. He is 
	prompting the verses in a low voice, almost in a whisper, and the 
	chorus repeats it.
 
	The Koran School: a bare, wobbling place.

	The Algerian who has entered takes the child by his hand, and 
	accompanies him to the teacher who is now standing; the chorus 
	continues; the other children, do not look at the two who have just 
	entered.
 
	The Algerian and the teacher greet each other, bringing their hands to 
	their hearts, and then to their mouths. At the same time, the teacher 
	takes an envelope from under his tunic, and hands it over to the other.
 
				SPEAKER 
		"To all militants! After two years of 
		hard struggle in the mountains and city, 
		the Algerian people have obtained a great 
		victory. The UN Assembly has placed the 
		Algerian question in its forthcoming 
		agenda. The discussion will begin on 
		Monday, January 28. Starting Monday, for 
		a duration of eight days, the NLF is 
		calling a general strike.  For the 
		duration of this period, all forms of 
		armed action or attempts at such are 
		suspended. We are requesting that all 
		militants mobilize for the strike's 
		organization and success."
 
	The Algerian has hidden the envelope inside his tunic, then presents 
	the child to the teacher, who makes him sit down with the other 
	children The teacher also returns to his place and sits down, and 
	suggests a new phrase; the chorus continues. The Algerian leaves the 
	school.
 

76	ALLEY UPPER CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	Having passed through the door, he again moves along the alley, this 
	time descending, with hurried steps. The chorus continues, again heard 
	from without, but its echo is now different.
 

77	VARIOUS VIEWS CASBAH. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY.
 
 	Bars, stores, market stalls, "Arab baths." Typewritten pieces of paper 
	are used to wrap purchases, or slipped inside bags, or used on the 
	blank side to add up bills and then handed to the customers.
 

78	VARIOUS VIEWS EUROPEAN CITY. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. 

	In the European city the Algerian workers: at the docks, the central 
	gas company; on the trams; the waiters in the restaurants, in the bars; 
	the shoeshine men
 
				SPEAKER
		"Algerian brothers! A great hope has 
		arisen for us. The world is watching us. 
		The next few days may be decisive for our 
		future and our freedom. The colonial 
		powers will attempt to demonstrate to the 
		UN that the NFL does not represent the 
		will of our people. Our response will be 
		unanimous support of the general strike."
 

79	SEA-FRONT. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	At the sea-front, there is a newspaper boy, about twelve years old, 
	barefoot. His voice is shrill yet cheerful. He is smiling.
 
				NEWSBOY 
		Le Monde! Le Monde! General strike! ... 
		Strike! 

	Some Europeans buy the newspaper, half-heartedly, grumbling
	disagreeably. The boy remains cheerful, places the change inside the 
	bag strapped to his shoulder, thanks them.
 
	Now he passes in front of a beggar, an elderly Algerian who is leaning 
	against a railing.

	The boy winks at him, while he continues to shout:
 
				NEWSBOY 
		Strike!

				SPEAKER
		"During the eight days of the strike, do 
		not frequent the European city, or leave 
		the Casbah. Provide lodgings in your 
		homes for the poor, the beggars, the 
		brothers who do not have homes. Store 
		provisions of food and water for eight 
		days!"
 

80	CASBAH STREETS AND SHOPS. INSIDE/OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	There is a strange atmosphere in the Casbah. People are greeting each 
	other in the streets; a thick buzz of voices, a festive mood, a sense 
	of brotherhood, and the children, who are taking advantage of the 
	situation and play and run everywhere.

	The shops are unusually crowded. The people enter and exit, loaded with 
	supplies. In the shops too, there is the same festive mood, almost as 
	if the supplies were for a trip to the country. The shopkeepers are 
	also cheerful.
 
	And the poor customers, instead of paying, hand over a ticket stamped 
	NLF.
 
 
81	CASBAH BLOCKADE. OUTSIDE. DAY. SUNSET. SUNDAY. JANUARY 27, 1957.
 
	Late afternoon, at the blockades of rue de la Lyre, rue du Divan, and 
	rue Marengo. The Casbah exit ramps are deserted, while the entrance 
	ramps are overflowing with people. Here too, there is an intangible air 
	of gaiety, witty remarks, laughter, ironic glances toward the soldiers 
	and policemen with cold faces, immobile -- helmets and machine guns --
	who stand at the entrances without intervening.
 
	The image is shortened and focused through the lenses of binoculars.
 

82	GOVERNMENT PALACE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. SUNSET. 

	A paratrooper officer looks at the blockades of rue du Divan from a 
	Government Palace balcony. Mathieu is beside him.
 
				MATHIEU 
		No one is leaving, eh?

	The officer hands him the binoculars. 

				OFFICER
		No. They continue to enter, the rats.
 
	Mathieu looks through the binoculars, and comments in a low voice, 
	smiling:
 
				MATHIEU 
		Rats in a trap, we hope ...

				OFFICER
		But do you believe that the strike will 
		be widespread? 

				MATHIEU 
		Without a doubt.
 
 	Behind the two officers, through a large open window, a room is 
	visible. There is a large table, and around it, other high officers of 
	the various armed forces, and some important officials in plainclothes.

	A general, who has his back to the balcony, turns and calls Mathieu:
 
				GENERAL
		Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...

				MATHIEU 
		A name?
 
				GENERAL
		Yes, a name for the operation.
 
	Mathieu moves the binoculars from the blockades and turns slowly around 
	the Government square, until he reaches an advertising sign for a brand 
	of champagne which now, in the dusk, lights up with a sporadic rhythm: 
	CORDON ... ROUGE.
 
	Mathieu pauses then turns toward the room, and enters smiling:

				MATHIEU 
		Champagne ... All right? 

	The general repeats absent-mindedly: 

				GENERAL
		Champagne ... Champagne. 
			(then, in a convinced voice) 
		Operation Champagne, yes, alright.
 
 
83 	RUE DU DIVAN BLOCKADE. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
 
	At the rue du Divan blockade, there is an incoherent, monotonous, and 
	irritating chant. There is a blind beggar. He is light-complexioned, 
	tall and thin, his beard long, his arms stretched out, a cane in his 
	hand. He arrives at last at the entrance ramp, tries to find the way, 
	but cannot. He tries again and again with his cane, continually 
	repeating his sorrowful chant, until a policeman takes him by his free 
	hand, placing the hand roughly on the metal screen.
 
 				POLICEMAN
		Go on! Go on!
 
	The beggar protests and waves his cane in a way that the policeman has 
	to duck to prevent himself from being hit. The policeman curses, 
	spitefully, coarsely.

	A soldier starts to laugh. The old man takes up his chant again, and 
	moves forward leaning on the metal screen. On the other side of the 
	blockade, behind the square, there is a group of veiled girls who have 
	seen the old man, and seem to be waiting for him.

	Two of them go to meet him, and each one takes one of his arms. At the 
	touch of their hands, the old man is again infuriated. Even the girls 
	laugh. Then, one of them speaks to him slowly in a loud voice.

	It seems that the old man has understood. He is convinced. He mumbles 
	something kindly and lets them accompany him.
 

84	CASBAH ALLEY. FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	A poorly lit alley. A group of unemployed men and beggars are standing 
	in front of a door.
 
	One of the three companions consults a list, then points to two in the 
	group. He signals them to enter.
 

85	KADER'S HOUSE. INSIDE. NIGHT.
 
 	Inner courtyard.
 
	In the inner courtyard, there is an elderly man who awaits them and 
	receives them kindly.
 
	They greet each other in the customary Algerian manner.
 
	Courtyard and balcony.

	On the terrace also, someone is looking toward the courtyard. Kader is 
	on the terrace together with a man about forty years old, dressed in 
	European clothes, he has narrow shoulders and a sunken chest. His face 
	is sensitive, his forehead high, and his hair and eyes black. His eyes 
	are kind and thoughtful and twinkle with irony.

	He is Ben M'Hidi, one of the four members of the CCE, the Central 
	Executive Committee.
 
				KADER 
			(to him)
		They are beggars and unemployed, homeless. 
		We have organized things in such a way 
		that during the strike they will be 
		guests of other families who have homes 
		and will provide shelter in the event of 
		possible reprisals ... But I didn't know 
		that they would be brought to this house 
		too. It is a mistake.
 
 				BEN M'HIDI 
		Why?
 
				KADER 
		Because you are here too. It would be 
		better for you to move to another house.
 
	Ben M'Hidi moves away from the parapet. 

				BEN M'HIDI
		All right ... You're the one who must 
		decide. 

	Kader follows him along the terrace.
 
				KADER 
		No, if I were the one to decide, you 
		wouldn't be in Algiers now.
 
	Ben M'Hidi looks at him, smiling.
 
				BEN M'HIDI 
		Why? Isn't it wise?
 
	Kader smiles too, and repeats:
 
 				KADER 
		It isn't wise.
 
	At the end of the terrace, there is a construction raised to a level 
	with the stairs that lead to the floor below. There is a large room; 
	through the open door, the lighted interior is visible. The walls have 
	high brick baseboards, and at the bottom of one of the four walls there 
	is a square opening that leads into a hiding place. The closure of the 
	hiding place, a square of very thick wall, is placed to one side. Ali 
	la Pointe is covering it with bricks.
 
	On the other side of the room next to the door, there are some cement 
	wash-basins, and a shed for rain water. Kader appears at the door.
 
				KADER 
		Ali, you must accompany Ben M'Hidi to the 
		Maison des Arbres.
 
	Ali doesn't answer immediately. He finishes placing the last brick then 
	turns to Kader.
 
 				ALI 
		Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
 
 				KADER 
		No, it's better if he doesn't. The house 
		is filled with new people.
 
	Ali gets up, wipes his hands on his trousers, at the same time 
	inspecting the work that he has just completed. 

				ALI 
		Here's another one ready. What a hideout! 
		It really looks like a wall. I'll dirty 
		it a bit, and it's perfect. Want to give 
		a look inside?
 
	Kader has taken a machine gun from one of the basins, and he tosses it 
	to Ali, who catches it. 

				KADER 
		No, go now. It's already late.

	They go out on the terrace. Ali releases the catch of his machine gun 
	so that the bullet slips into the barrel. 

				KADER 
			(to Ben M'Hidi)
		They are a family of militants from way 
		back. Everything will work out well, 
		you'll see ... C'mon, Ali, hurry up.

				BEN M'HIDI 
		Alright. See you tomorrow.

	They say good-bye, embracing one another. Ali has already climbed over 
	the terrace wall, and has jumped to the next one.

	Ben M'Hidi follows him; he is less agile and moves with a bit of 
	trouble.

	From the parapet, Kader says to him:

				KADER 
		Passing along the terraces only takes 
		five minutes ... and with Ali la Pointe, 
		you'll be safe ...

	While jumping, Ben M'Hidi loses his balance, and has to grab on to Ali 
	to prevent himself from falling. 

				BEN M'HIDI
		But it's he who won't be safe with me ...

	The two figures move away from terrace to terrace, and disappear in the 
	dark.
 

86	CASBAH VIEWS AND TERRACES. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	In the dark in front of them, a metallic reflection is visible and the 
	sharp and aggressive sound of an Algerian voice is heard.

	Ali responds to the password.
 
	A youth steps out from the shadows. He too is carrying a machine gun, 
	recognizes Ali, and greets him. Ali and Ben M'Hidi continue ...
 

87	MAISON DES ARBRES, TERRACE. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. 

	Until they arrive at a terrace which is separated from the next one by 
	an alley about ten feet wide. 

				ALI 
		Here it is ... we've arrived ... 

	Ben M'Hidi glances at the emptiness beneath them, looks at Ali, and 
	takes a deep breath.
 
				BEN M'HIDI 
		Not yet ...

	Ali has climbed onto the parapet, looks around him concentrating 
	attentively for a moment, and then jumps into the void, reaching the 
	opposite side. He bends, searches for something in the dark, and lifts 
	a type of gangplank.
 
	He hands it over to Ben M'Hidi, and together they place it between the 
	two terraces.
 
				ALI 
		Be careful now. Unless you know how it 
		works, it's better if you sit on the plank 
		and move forward like this ...

				BEN M'HIDI 
		Let's try ...

	He tries to stand up on the gangplank, but he lacks the necessary 
	steadiness. He can't hold his balance. He does as Ali has advised him; 
	he sits astride on the plank, and using the force of his arms, he 
	pushes himself forward. He stops halfway to rest for a minute. 

				BEN M'HIDI 
		It's good nobody is following us ...

				ALI 
		It's a question of habit ...

	And when Ben M'Hidi is closer, Ali helps him to get down to the terrace.

				ALI 
		It's better if I go first, to make sure 
		everything's okay ...

	Without waiting for an answer, he moves toward the stairway that leads 
	to the floor below; his movements are silent and graceful.

	Ben M'Hidi leans out from the terrace, and looks toward the European 
	city and the sea. At the port, two searchlights are lit, and their long 
	bright rays move slowly toward the Casbah ...

 	When Ali la Pointe returns, Ben M'Hidi is still leaning on the railing. 
	He seems not to hear the sound of Ali's footsteps, or his voice.
 
				ALI 
		Everything's okay ... They're waiting for 
		you ...

	Ali moves near him, and Ben M'Hidi turns and looks at him. 

				BEN M'HIDI 
		What do you think of the strike, Ali? 

				ALI 
		I think it'll be a success ...

				BEN M'HIDI
		Yes, I think so too ... It's been 
		organized well ... But what will the 
		French do?
      
	Both the question, and the answer seem obvious to Ali. 

				ALI 
			(shrugging)
		It's clear. They'll do everything 
		possible to make it fail.
 
 				BEN M'HIDI
		No, they'll do even more. We've given 
		them the opportunity to do a lot more ... 
		Do you understand what I mean? Starting 
		tomorrow, they won't be groping in the 
		dark any more; every shop and every 
		worker who strikes will be a known enemy, 
		a self-confessed criminal ... And they 
		will be able to pass to the offensive. 
		Have you thought of this?
 
	Ali has listened attentively. The effort with which he is trying to ask 
	himself the meaning of these words is visible on his face.
 
				ALI 
			(shaking his head)
		No ...
 
 				BEN M'HIDI
		But Kader told me that you weren't in 
		favor of the strike.
 
 				ALI 
		No, and neither were my men. 

 				BEN M'HIDI
		Why?
 
				ALI 
		Because they told us that we mustn't use 
		weapons, now, when the time is right.

 				BEN M'HIDI
		That's true ... Wars aren't won with 
		terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. 
		Terrorism is a beginning but afterward, 
		all the people must act ... This is the 
		reason for the strike, and its necessity: 
		to mobilize all Algerians, count them and 
		measure their strength ...

				ALI 
		To show them to the UN, right?
 
 				BEN M'HIDI 
			(smiling slightly)
		Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the 
		UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this 
		way, we'll give the UN the possibility of 
		evaluating our strength. 

	Ali breathes deeply, instinctively, unrestrainedly, Ben M'Hidi watches 
	him, smiles, and says:
 
 				BEN M'HIDI
		Do you know something Ali? Starting a 
		revolution is hard, and it's even harder 
		to continue it. Winning is hardest of all. 
		But only afterward, when we have won, 
		will the real hardships begin.
 
	He pats Ali's back fondly with his hand and continues, smiling:

				BEN M'HIDI
		Anyway, there's still a lot to be done 
		... you aren't already tired, Ali, are 
		you?
 
	Ali looks at him, and without reacting to his irony: 

				ALI 
			(with conviction)
		No!
 

88 	VARIOUS HOUSES. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. DAWN. JANUARY 28, 1957. 

	It is gray and smoky dawn, a slow reabsorption of the night, an opaque 
	light which is diffused, sprayed, frozen, to transparency, and 
	rediscovers its outlines and perspectives; and finally, the sun, golden 
	light, awakens all Algiers. To the north, the sea. To the south, the 
	mountains and the Casbah, situated halfway along the coast. The Casbah, 
	still, inert, expectant, on this first day of the strike ...

	The paratroopers are already at their places, one after another, at 
	equal distances like links of a very long chain, strung through every 
	alley, spreading to every sidestreet, twisting through the squares, 
	climbing up the stairways, dividing, joining, and lengthening again. 
	The silence is perfect; the camouflaged immobile forms seem to be part 
	of the landscape.

	Then a brief and sharp hiss, a hundred whistles together. 

	A signal releases the still forms: the attack begins. 

	Doors are beaten down, shots, screams, rifle fire, machine gun fire; 
	the doors opened or broken down; the courtyards, the houses, the rooms, 
	invaded; the men who are trying to escape and who protest and try to 
	save themselves.
 
 				VOICES
		Of course ... I was just going to work ...
 

89	BEN M'HIDI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAWN.

	Ben M'Hidi is inside the hiding place. From outside, an old man helps 
	him to place the square piece of wall over the entrance, and then, in 
	the spaces between the bricks, he adds a paste of plaster mixed with 
	coal dust. When the paras arrive, everything is in order.

	Still men are being seized, beaten, dragged; a cache of weapons; men 
	pushed down the stairs:
 
				SOLDIERS 
		Go on, go on, you little rats! Get to 
		work!


90	CASBAH. STREETS. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
	Women are clinging together after the beatings. 

	Someone is fleeing toward the terraces. We hear the deafening whirl of 
	the helicopters flying against the wind, their cabin doors open, paras 
	sitting on both sides with their legs dangling out, their machine guns 
	on their knees, a loudspeaker for every helicopter, microphones turned 
	on in such a way that the din of the motors is multiplied a hundred 
	times.
 
	The helicopters fly low again, they skirt the terraces. 

	The Algerians are fleeing in terror, the uproar begins to fade away, is 
	less intense; microphones are turned on, and off. The terraces are 
	emptied, men seized, beaten, dragged; all the men are forced outside in 
	the alleys, the streets, the squares, every man is forced to face the 
	wall, his hands up.
 

91	SHOPS. DOORS UNHINGED. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	A truck in reverse, a rope fastened to the hub of the wheels, its other 
	end to a door-latch. The motor is accelerated, clouds of exhaust 
	fumes ...

	Door latches pried open like lids of sardine cans, shop windows smashed 
	with machine-gun butts, the counters, the shelves, flung into the air, 
	the merchandise thrown into the streets; a game, a frenzied 
	excitement ...

	The Algerians watch, but can not intervene. Some shopkeepers rush to 
	the scene, crying despairingly, while others are dragged away forcibly, 
	tossed about, slapped, pushed, forced to open their shops.
 

92	CANDY SHOP. INSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	A shopkeeper is pushed behind the counter; he gets up, trembling with 
	fear.
 
	A para asks him for a bag of candy, pays politely, smiles, pats his 
	bald head, and asks him sweetly:
 
				PARA 
		And the strike, my friend?
 
	Then he distributes the candy among the children who are outside.
 

93	CANDY SHOP. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	The children take the candy silently, without thanking him, then eat 
	the candies slowly, their faces unfriendly and cold ...
 

94	PLACE DU GOUVERNEMENT. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
	The black sky, the trees, the advertising signs ... Cordon Rouge ...
	... an equestrian statue, a car radio, a loudspeaker. 

				LOUDSPEAKER
		"Attention, people of the Casbah! The NLF 
		wants to stop you from working. The NLF 
		forces you to close your shops. 
		Inhabitants of the Casbah, rebel against 
		their orders. France is your country. 
		France has given you civilization and 
		prosperity: schools, streets, hospitals. 
		People of the Casbah, show your love for 
		your mother country, by disobeying the 
		terrorists' orders. Algerians, return to 
		work!"

	And then Algerian music, a cheerful and rhythmical melody; the 
	Algerians are forced out of the Casbah in columns, and are pushed 
	toward the military trucks which clutter the southern side of the 
	square, and continue to arrive and depart.
 

95	CASBAH. EXIT. OUTSIDE. MORNING.

	Meanwhile the paras of the psychological divisions make their first 
	selection, randomly, or else deliberately, basing them on the slightest 
	suspicions. They evaluate each man by his appearance or behavior. They 
	block the Algerians from the exit ramp, and assault them with a battery 
	of questions: 

				PARA'S VOICES
		Who are you? What's your name? Occupation? 
		Where do you work? Why did you strike?
 		They forced you, eh? ... No ... Tell the 
		truth! You promised them, right? Then 
		you're the one who wants to strike. Do 
		you belong to the NLF? C'mon, answer me! 
		Are you afraid to say it? Never mind, it 
		doesn't matter.
 
	The Algerian does not answer, but stares into the para's eyes. The para 
	turns to his companions and shouts:
 
				PARA 
		Jacques! ... Jacques! ... Another one to 
		headquarters! 

	The Algerian is seized, and pushed toward the truck.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		"Attention, Algerians! The NLF wants to 
		stop you from working. The NLF forces you 
		to close your shops. The NLF wants to 
		starve you and condemn you to misery. 
		Algerians, return to work ... !"
 

96	THE PORT. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The port is deserted, the cranes still. A loaded ship sways lazily at 
	her moorings, the fork-lifts are filled with supplies ...

	The limestone is dried out, the bridges empty, dangling cables swing 
	slowly from the pulleys. There is silence in the docks ...

 	Then, the sound of motors approaching, clouds of dust, Arabs pushed out 
	of the trucks, into the shipyard.
 

97	STREETS OF ALGIERS. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	In the streets of the European city, there is an atmosphere of fear and 
	doubt. The shop windows have their shutters lowered halfway, the 
	shopkeepers are standing in the doorways, ready to close.

	The front doors of houses are shut. There are a few hurried passersby 
	but no automobiles; the trams are not running; on the sidewalks the 
	garbage is piled high, nearby the long brooms of the Algerian street 
	cleaners. 

				PARAS
			(yelling)
		Sweep, mes enfants, sweep.

	An Algerian with a very refined expression, a gentle appearance, says, 
	while excusing himself: 

				ALGERIAN 
		I don't know how, sir, I'm sorry ...

	They shove the broom into his hands, and shout to him:
 
				PARA 
		Learn!

				LOUDSPEAKER
		"French citizens! Europeans of Algiers! 
		The strike called by the NLF is a failure. 
		Do not be afraid. Return to your jobs. 
		General Massu guarantees your safety. 
		The Army will protect you!"
 

98	STREETS OF ALGIERS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	A jeep with loudspeaker precedes a row of military trucks loaded with 
	Algerians.

	In every truck there are two paras carrying machine guns by their 
	sides. The Algerians are standing crowded together one against the 
	other. Some of them are holding banners and signs:
 
		I AM GOING TO WORK BECAUSE I AM FREE. 

		WE ARE FREE.

		ARMY-POPULATION-PEACE. 

		THE ARMY PROTECTS OUR RIGHTS.

 	The trucks turn a corner, a youth jumps from the last truck, falls, 
	gets up again, and breaks into a run.

	The paras shout to him to stop, their voices mix with that of the 
	loudspeaker.
 
	The Algerian continues to run.

	A burst of machine-gun fire, then another.

	The Algerian jerks forward, his back curved, his arms raised. 

	He falls down.
 

99	COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. PRESS ROOM AND STAIRWAY. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	Noise, confusion in the Commissioner's office press room, ticking of 
	the teletype machines, throngs of journalists in the telephone room. 
	They are trying to transmit the first news. 

	VARIED VOICES.
      
	Shouting in every language is heard.
 
 				A JOURNALIST
		We are now in the fourth day and the 
		strike continues, with total support by 
		the Arab population. The city is very 
		calm. However -- Calm ... Are you deaf? 
		The city is peaceful. In the Moslem 
		quarters, in the outskirts of the city, 
		in the Casbah ... Bye, will call again, 
		I'm busy.
 
	Through the open door, Mathieu can be seen passing, accompanied by 
	another officer. Some journalists see him, and rush behind him. Some 
	others follow, four or five in all, trying to stop him.

				JOURNALISTS 
		Colonel, colonel ... Excuse me, colonel, 
		a statement ... We don't know anything ... 
		You promised us a press conference ...
		Now there is a meeting with the 
		Commissioner. 

				FIRST JOURNALIST
		Will you tell us what is happening? 

				MATHIEU 
		Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We are still 
		weighing the situation.

	They move to the landing and begin to ascend the stairway that leads to 
	the second floor. The journalists have difficulty keeping up with 
	Mathieu.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Look around. I've put everything at your 
		disposal. Go take a look with your own 
		eyes.

				2ND JOURNALIST
		The strike is a success; but ...

				MATHIEU 
		No. It has failed in its objective. 

				1ST JOURNALIST
		Insurrection? 

				MATHIEU 
		Insurrection.
 
				2ND JOURNALIST 
		But the NLF has always spoken of a strike 
		as a demonstration ...

				MATHIEU 
		And you believe the NLF?
 
				2ND JOURNALIST 
		They seemed to be plausible this time. A 
		general strike is a good argument for the 
		UN.

				MATHIEU 
		The UN is far away, dear sir. It is easier 
		to make oneself heard with bombs. If I 
		were in their place, I would use bombs. 

				1ST JOURNALIST
		Armed insurrection ... but what is it 
		exactly?
 
 				OFFICER
		It is an armed insurrection ...

	They have arrived at the second-floor landing, hurry along, and stop in 
	front of a large door, where there is a written sign: PREFECT. Mathieu, 
	at the same time, has continued speaking.
 
 				MATHIEU 
		It is an inevitable stage in revolutionary 
		war; from terrorism, one passes to 
		insurrection ... as from open guerrilla 
		warfare one passes to real war, the latter 
		being the determining factor ...
 
				3RD JOURNALIST
		Dien Bien Phu? 

				MATHIEU 
		Exactly.
 
 	Mathieu glances at the journalist, as if to see if there were any irony 
	in his remark, but the journalist's face is expressionless.
 
				MATHIEU 
		In Indochina, they won. 

				3RD JOURNALIST 
		And here? 

				MATHIEU 
		It depends on you.
 
				4TH JOURNALIST 
		On us? You aren't thinking of drafting us 
		by any chance, are you, colonel?

	Mathieu leans his hand on the door handle and smiles at the 
	journalists.

 				MATHIEU 
		No! We have enough fighters. You have 
		only to write, and well, if possible.

				1ST JOURNALIST 
		What's the problem then?

				MATHIEU 
		Political support. Sometimes it's there, 
		sometimes not ... sometimes, it's not
		enough. What were they saying in Paris 
		yesterday?

				5TH JOURNALIST
		Nothing ... Sartre has written another 
		article ...

	Mathieu gestures and makes an expression as if to say: "see what I 
	mean?" At the same time, he opens the door. But before entering, he 
	turns again to the journalists. 

				MATHIEU 
		Will you kindly explain to me why all the 
		Sartres are always born on the other side?

				5TH JOURNALIST
		Then you like Sartre, colonel ... 

				MATHIEU 
		Not really, but he's even less appealing 
		as an enemy.
 

100	PLACE DU GOUVERNEMENT AND RUE DU DIVAN BLOCKADE. OUTSIDE. SUNSET.
 
	Place du Gouvernement, dusk, the other side of the blockade is silent, 
	only the uncovered eyes of the Algerian women who await their men.
 
	The trucks continue to arrive: the men are forced to descend and 
	allowed to enter the Casbah. There is an atmosphere of sadness, for not 
	all the men have returned. The women look at them, scrutinize their 
	faces, from the first to the last in one glance, then slowly ... one 
	face at a time. Some women recognize their husbands, or their brothers 
	or their sons, and run to meet them ... 

	But others continue to ask for news in lowered, sorrowful voices.
 
				AD-LIB VOICES 
		Have you seen Mohamed? Where? When? Why
		hasn't he returned?
 
	A steady hum of voices in Arabic; then the monotonous voice of a 
	policeman who speaks in the microphone of the loudspeaker.
 
				LOUDSPEAKER 
		"The NLF wants to stop you from working. 
		The NLF forces you to close your shops, 
		inhabitants of the Casbah, disobey their 
		orders. France has given you civilization 
		and prosperity: schools, streets, 
		hospitals. People of the Casbah! Show your 
		love for your mother country by disobeying 
		the terrorists' orders."
 
	The loudspeaker is attached to one of the blockade posts, and from it a 
	long wire for the microphone is hanging. The policeman has a raspy and 
	bored voice; he stops speaking and leans the microphone on the table in 
	front of him. He gets up, lights a cigarette, and moves away a few 
	steps.
 
	Two children are among the women and behind the wooden horses 
	barricades. They were waiting for this moment.
 
	They bend, seem to be playing, but one of them lifts the barbed wire
 	as high as he can, from the ground. Petit Omar passes a wire 
	underneath, its farthest end bent in the form of a hook. He moves it 
	toward the microphone cord which is lying coiled on the ground. He 
	succeeds in clasping it and pulls it toward him slowly. The cord  
	unwinds, lengthens, stretches, until the microphone on the table begins 
	to move, until it reaches the edge of the table, and falls ...

	The noise re-echoes in the loudspeaker, but no one pays any attention 
	to it.
 
	Petit Omar waits a second, then begins to pull again. 

	The microphone is dragged along the ground -- a humming sound -- it 
	moves nearer, inch by inch, forward, under the barbed wire, until the 
	children are able to take it, and disappear with it behind the women.
 
				LOUDSPEAKER 
		"Algerians! Brothers! Do not be afraid! 
		Algeria will be free. Be courageous, 
		brothers! Resist! Do not listen to what 
		they are telling you ... Algeria will be 
		free ..."
 
	The voice is not violent, but gentle, somewhat breathless and hurried. 
	It extends to the whole square, so that all can hear it well: the 
	people stop what they are doing to listen. They are emotional, proud, 
	or angry, and look toward the sky where the voice seems to be diffused, 
	as if those words should be written up above.

	The officer is slow to realize what has happened, looks at the 
	loudspeaker, the cord, and now grabs it, cursing. He pulls and tugs it; 
	the wire yields, and he wrenches it from the microphone.
 
				LOUDSPEAKER 
		"Brothers--" 

	The voice is no longer heard, nothing more, silence. 

	Silence, only that something is changed in the women's eyes. The veils 
	that cover the lower half of their faces suddenly begin to tremble, 
	sway as if shaken by a breath, a light wind. There is no longer an 
	atmosphere of sadness, or silence.
 
	JU-JU.

	The ju-jus attack the air, invade it, shake it, make it vibrate as if 
	they were electric charges, or the sound produced by the wind on a 
	field of dry reeds, or the sound produced by a hundred, a thousand 
	fingernails that are scratching a window pane ...
 

101	HEADQUARTERS. PARA. OUTSIDE. DAY.

				PARA 
		One, two, three, four ... Inside! C'mon!
 
	The five Algerians indicated are forced to get up, taken, pushed, and 
	brought inside a large deserted house which is the paras' headquarters.
 
	The other Algerians, about a hundred of them, are sitting on the 
	ground, in the clearing in front of the house, and the paras of the 
	first regiment continue to guard them with pointed machine guns ...

	Suddenly from the villa, the music of a French song comes forth at full 
	blast.
 
	The Algerians look at each other nervously. Even a young para seems to 
	be upset.
 
				1ST PARA 
			(turning to other para)
		What are they doing?
 
 				2ND PARA 
			(smiling)
		Dancing inside ...
 

102	HEADQUARTERS. VILLA. INSIDE. DAY. 

	A para rushes through a corridor carrying a tape recorder, enters a 
	room where there are some sergeants and an Algerian.

	The adjoining room with white tiled walls and a sink is visible through 
	an open door. Two paras are sitting on the floor, smoking and chatting 
	between themselves in whispers. 

	The para places the tape recorder on the table. The Algerian is naked 
	to the waist. Signs of torture are visible. His face is swollen and 
	wet. The sergeant places the chair near him, and helps him to sit down, 
	then starts the tape recorder. He says to the Algerian who is 
	trembling:
 
				SERGEANT
		Go ahead! C'mon ... Repeat everything 
		from the beginning, and then we'll let 
		you go. Name ...
 
				ALGERIAN 
		Sid Ahmed.
 
				SERGEANT
		Second name.
 
				ALGERIAN 
		Sail.
 
				SERGEANT
		Which "district" do you belong to? 

				ALGERIAN 
		Second district ...

				SERGEANT
		Second district ... Explain better ...

				ALGERIAN 
		Second district, Casbah, West Algiers.
 
				SERGEANT
		What "group"? 

				ALGERIAN 
		Third group.

				SERGEANT
		Third group. What's your assignment? 

				ALGERIAN 
		Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
 

103	VILLA. HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAY.
 
 	In a room on the ground floor, a captain is bent over a large map with 
	graphs, and is writing the name Sid Ahmed Sail in one of the blocks at 
	the bottom of the pyramid ...
 
	At the same time, paras are seen through the large window, bringing 
	other Algerians to the villa, and immediately afterward, the music and 
	song are heard again very loudly.
 

104	CASBAH ALLEY. OUTSIDE. NIGHT. 

	Night, darkness, locked doors. The Casbah is silent. The paras tread 
	noiselessly on their rubber soles. Patrols. 

	A flashlight searches for the number of a door, then stops. A para 
	knocks discreetly. 

	NOISES INSIDE. VOICES.

				ALGERIAN VOICE
		Who is it?
 
 				PARA
		Sid Ahmed ... Sid Ahmed Sail.
 
	The door is opened, the paras break in.
 

105	ANOTHER ALLEY. CASBAH. OUTSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	Another alley in the Casbah, other paras. 

	Another door forced open, broken into.
 
	Algerians are crowded together in a courtyard which is illuminated with 
	electric flares. 

	They are being interrogated.
 

106	CASBAH STREET. OUTSIDE. DAY. RAIN. 

	A cloudy day, a light drizzle, a sloping street, Algerian music. A 
	company of zouaves walk two by two in the Casbah, through the alleys, 
	stop, play their music, and move on again, alternating Algerian music 
	and a French song.

	Behind them, a line of donkeys with baskets full of packages and bags, 
	and cheerful paras who are joking, as they distribute the supplies to 
	the starving women and children, who stand ashamed in front of their
	houses, their eyes lowered, their gestures too brusque, and hesitant.
 
				SPEAKER
		"At the General Assembly of the United 
		Nations, none of the motions presented in 
		the course of the debate has obtained the 
		necessary majority. At last an agreement 
		has been reached on a resolution that 
		excludes any form of direct intervention 
		by the UN in the Algerian question. The 
		Assembly of the United Nations has limited 
		itself to expressing the hope that in a 
		spirit of cooperation, a peaceful, 
		democratic, and just solution will be 
		found, that conforms to the principles of 
		the United Nations Charter ..."
 
	The monotony of the last words is drowned out and lost. It is raining 
	more heavily now. The water has begun to run along the sloping alleys. 
	The walls are gray, wet; the doors of the cafes and shops are barred 
	with signs nailed upon them. 

		THIS SHOP HAS SUPPORTED THE NLF STRIKE. 
		THE PREFECT HAS ORDERED ITS CLOSING UNTIL 
		FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. 

	The band of zouaves has stopped again, and now they are playing "La vie 
	en rose."
 

107	VILLA HEADQUARTERS. INSIDE. DAWN.
 
 	In some parts of the villa a gramophone is playing "La vie en rose."
 
	In the room on the first floor, through the large window, the whiteness 
	of the dawn is visible. The desk is cluttered with beer cans and 
	thermos. Mathieu and other officers have their eyes fixed on the graph, 
	where the captain is marking other small crosses at the bottom of the 
	pyramid. The scene is motionless; their expressions are dull. Everyone 
	seems to be incapable of movement, overcome by the dull apathy that
	always follows a sleepless night.

	Until Mathieu breaks the stillness of the scene. 

				MATHIEU
		Good ... Good work ... Now we can all go 
		to sleep. 

	And moving together with the others, he continues.
 
				MATHIEU 
		The end of the strike doesn't change 
		anything. The directives remain the same. 
		Give your men the usual shifts. We must 
		remain in the Casbah: twenty-four hours a 
		day! 

	He turns and points to the graph. 

				MATHIEU 
		We must cling to it, and work fast!

	Then he turns to the officers and smiling, says in another tone of 
	voice:
 
				MATHIEU 
		Have any of you ever had a tapeworm?
 
	The officers say "no" and laugh.

				MATHIEU 
		The tapeworm is a worm that can grow to 
		infinity. There are thousands of segments. 
		You can destroy all of them; but as long 
		as the head remains, it reproduces itself 
		immediately. It is the same thing with the 
		NLF. The head is the General Staff, four 
		persons. Until we are able to eliminate 
		them, we must always start again from the 
		beginning.

	While he is speaking, Mathieu takes his wallet from his back pocket, 
	opens it, takes out four photos.

				MATHIEU 
		I found these in the police archives. 
		They are old shots, but I made some 
		close-ups. Ramel ... Si Mourad ... 
		Kader ... Ali la Pointe. We must print a 
		thousand copies and distribute them to 
		the men.
 
	Meanwhile, the photos are passed around.

	There are photos taken from identification cards, or blown up from some 
	group shots, figures somewhat blurred, faded, smiling, peaceful ...
 

108	NLF LEADERS' HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	In the dim light, the four faces are barely illuminated. The shadows 
	tone down their expressions: Kader, Ali la Pointe, Ramel, Si Mourad. 
	They are crowded into the hiding place, sitting on the floor, 
	motionless, their eyes staring straight ahead, their breathing heavy. 
	From outside, noises, voices that are fading in the distance. Silence. 

	Then, a discreet knock, a remark in Arabic.
 
	The four breathe deeply, look at each other, then smile a little.

	Ali unslips the beam which, placed through an iron ring, is holding 
	shut the door of the hiding place. Using the soles of his feet, he 
	pushes against the square of wall: the light enters violently. It is 
	not electric light, but daylight.
 
	Kader blinks his eyes to accustom them to the light, then goes out on 
	all fours; after him, Ramel, and then the others. They leave the hiding 
	place that Ali built in the wash-house on the terrace.
 

109	COMPLEX OF KADER'S HOUSE. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	All of them have machine guns. Ramel is very tall and robust, about 
	thirty years old.
 
	Si Mourad is slightly older than Ramel. His movements are slow and 
	precise; his glance expresses patience and authority. Djamila is 
	waiting for them.
 
				DJAMILA 
		You can come out. Thank God. There were so 
		many this time, about ten.

	Ali recloses the hiding place.
 
 				KADER 
		Paratroopers? 

				DJAMILA 
		Yes.
 
 				KADER 
		What do you think? Did they come here on 
		purpose or by accident?
 
				DJAMILA 
		No. By accident. They asked some questions, 
		but they didn't touch anyone.
 
	Ali has come out of the wash-house. The sun is high, and helicopters 
	are seen passing one another in the sky. On some faraway terraces, 
	bivouacs of paras are visible. They are guarding the Casbah from above.
	
	The rumble of motors and the voice of the loudspeaker are heard more 
	clearly as they near the house.
 
				LOUDSPEAKER
		"Attention! Attention! Inhabitants of the 
		Casbah! The terrorist Ben Amin has been 
		executed this morning. Qrara Normendine 
		has been arrested. Boussalem Ali has been 
		arrested. Bel Kasel Maussa has been 
		arrested. Inhabitants of the Casbah! The 
		NFL has been defeated. Rebel against the 
		remaining terrorists who want to force 
		you to continue a bloody and futile 
		struggle. People of the Casbah, the 
		terrorist Ben Amin has been executed. 
		Help us to build a free and peaceful 
		Algeria. Inhabitants of the Casbah, the 
		NLF has been defeated. Rebel against the 
		remaining terrorists who want to force 
		you to continue a bloody and futile 
		struggle. Attention! Attention! 
		Inhabitants of the Casbah! The terrorist 
		Ben Amin has been executed this morning. 
		Qrara Normendine has been arrested. 
		Boussalem Ali has been arrested. Bel 
		Kasem Moussa has been arrested. 
		Inhabitants of the Casbah -- the NLF has
		been defeated ..."
 
 	The voice fades away and is no longer heard. At the same time, a woman 
	has come up from the floor below, carrying a tray of cups and a teapot.

	Ali looks at her quickly, but then watching her more closely, he sees 
	that she is crying. When she passes near him, he stops her, places his 
	hand kindly on her shoulder, and asks her in Arabic why she is crying.

 	DIALOGUE IN ARABIC BETWEEN ALI AND WOMAN. 

	The woman shakes her head, tries to smile, but says nothing. Then she 
	enters the wash-house silently and begins to serve the tea.
 
				KADER 
		It's better to split up, to increase our 
		chances. We must change hiding places, and 
		change them continually ... In the 
		meantime, we must make new contacts, 
		replace our arrested brothers, reorganize 
		our sections--
 
				ALI 
			(interrupting him)
		Yes, but we must also show them that we 
		still exist.
 
 				KADER 
		Of course. As soon as possible.
 
				ALI 
		No, immediately. The people are 
		demoralized. Leave this to me ...
 
 				KADER 
		No. Not you, or any one of us. As long as 
		we are free, the NLF continues to exist 
		in the Casbah. If they manage to take us 
		too, there won't be anything left ... And 
		from nothing comes nothing ...

				RAMEL 
			(intervening)
		But it's also necessary to do something ...
 
				KADER 
		And we will do something, don't worry. As 
		soon as we have reestablished contacts ...
 
 				MOURAD
		And our movements?
 
				KADER 
		For this too we've got to change methods.
 

110	MUNICIPAL STADIUM. OUTSIDE. DAY. FEBRUARY 10, 1957.

	The municipal stadium is crowded with people. There is a football game 
	between two European teams. It is almost the end of the first half. 
	From above to the right of the guest box, there is a very loud 
	explosion.
 
	Strips of flesh are hurled into the air. Thick, white smoke ... There 
	are screams of terror. The people try to move away in haste. They are 
	shoving, pushing, bumping into one another ... Then, calm returns. The 
	sirens of the ambulances are heard.

	The stretcher, the dead carried away, scores of wounded.
 

111	PREFECT'S OFFICE. PRESS HALL. INSIDE. DAY. FEBRUARY 25.
 
 	Ben M'Hidi is standing in front of the journalists with handcuffs on 
	his wrists and ankles. He is without a tie. He is smiling a little, his 
	glance ironical. There are two paras behind him with machine guns 
	ready. The picture is still for an instant; Ben M'Hidi's smile is 
	steady, so too his eyes, his entire face. Flashes, clicking of cameras.
 
				1ST JOURNALIST
		Mr. Ben M'Hidi ... Don't you think it is 
		a bit cowardly to use your women's baskets 
		and handbags to carry explosive devices 
		that kill so many innocent people?
 
	Ben M'Hidi shrugs his shoulders in his usual manner and smiles a 
	little.
 
				BEN M'HIDI 
		And doesn't it seem to you even more 
		cowardly to drop napalm bombs on unarmed 
		villages, so that there are a thousand 
		times more innocent victims? Of course, 
		if we had your airplanes it would be a lot 
		easier for us. Give us your bombers, and 
		you can have our baskets.

				2ND JOURNALIST
		Mr. Ben M'Hidi ... in your opinion, has 
		the NLF any chance to beat the French 
		army?

				BEN M'HIDI
		In my opinion, the NLF has more chances 
		of beating the French army than the 
		French have to stop history. 

	The press hall in the prefect's office is crowded with journalists of 
	every nationality. At the side and central aisles there are 
	photographers and cameramen.
 
	Ben M'Hidi is opposite them, standing on a low wooden platform. Mathieu 
	is next to him, seated behind a small desk. Mathieu now gets up, and 
	signals to two paratroopers. Another journalist simultaneously has 
	asked another question:
 
 				3RD JOURNALIST
		Mr. Ben M'Hidi, Colonel Mathieu has said 
		that you have been arrested by accident, 
		practically by mistake. In fact, it seems 
		that the paratroopers were looking for 
		someone much less important than yourself. 
		Can you tell us why you were in that 
		apartment at rue Debussy last night?
 
	The two paras have moved forward and they take Ben M'Hidi by the arms. 
	At the same time, he answers.
 
				BEN M'HIDI
		I can only tell you that it would have 
		been better if I had never been there ...
 
 				MATHIEU 
			(intervening)
		That's enough, gentlemen. It's late, and 
		we all have a lot of work ...
 
	Ben M'Hidi glances at him ironically. 

				BEN M'HIDI
		Is the show already over?
 
				MATHIEU 
			(smiling)
		Yes, it's over ... before it becomes 
		self-defeating.

	The paras lead Ben M'Hidi away. He moves away with short steps, as much 
	as he can with the irons that are tightened around his ankles. Mathieu 
	has turned to the journalists and smiles again.
 

112	PREFECT'S OFFICE. PRESS HALL. INSIDE. DAY. MARCH 4. 

	Colonel Mathieu is standing. On his face is a brief smile, motionless, 
	his eyes attentive, but half-closed somewhat, due to the camera 
	flashes.
 
 				1ST JOURNALIST
		Colonel Mathieu ... the spokesman for the 
		residing minister, Mr. Gorlin, has stated 
		that "Larbi Ben M'Hidi committed suicide 
		in his own cell, hanging himself with 
		pieces of his shirt, that he had used to 
		make a rope, and then attached to the 
		bars of his cell window." In a preceding 
		statement, the same spokesman had 
		specified that: "... due to the intention 
		already expressed by the prisoner Ben 
		M'Hidi to escape at the first opportunity, 
		it has been necessary to keep his hands 
		and feet bound continually." In your 
		opinion, colonel, in such conditions, is 
		a man capable of tearing his shirt, 
		making a rope from it, and attaching it 
		to a bar of the window to hang himself?
 
				MATHIEU 
		You should address that question to the 
		minister's spokesman. I'm not the one who 
		made those statements ... On my part, I 
		will say that I had the opportunity to 
		admire the moral strength, intelligence, 
		and unwavering idealism demonstrated by 
		Ben M'Hidi. For these reasons, although 
		remembering the danger he represented, I 
		do not hesitate to pay homage to his 
		memory.
 
		 		2ND JOURNALIST
		Colonel Mathieu ... Much has been said 
		lately not only of the successes 
		obtained by the paratroopers, but also of 
		the methods that they have employed ... 
		Can you tell us something about this? 

				MATHIEU 
		The successes obtained are the results 
		of those methods. One presupposes the 
		other and vice versa.
 
				3RD JOURNALIST 
		Excuse me, colonel. I have the impression 
		that perhaps due to excessive prudence ... 
		my colleagues continue to ask the same 
		allusive questions, to which you can only 
		respond in an allusive manner. I think it 
		would be better to call things by their 
		right names; if one means torture, then 
		one should call it torture.

				MATHIEU 
		I understand. What's your question?

				3RD JOURNALIST
		The questions have already been asked. I 
		would only like some precise answers, 
		that's all ...
 
 				MATHIEU 
		Let's try to be precise then. The word 
		"torture" does not appear in our orders. 
		We have always spoken of interrogation as 
		the only valid method in a police 
		operation directed against unknown 
		enemies. As for the NLF, they request 
		that their members, in the event of 
		capture, should maintain silence for 
		twenty-four hours, and then, they may 
		talk. Thus, the organization has already
 		had the time necessary to render useless 
		any information furnished ... What type 
		of interrogation should we choose? ... 
		the one the courts use for a crime of 
		homicide which drags on for months?
 
 				3RD JOURNALIST
		The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
 
				MATHIEU 
		And those who explode bombs in public 
		places, do they perhaps respect the law? 
		When you asked that question to Ben 
		M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, 
		gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious 
		circle. And we could discuss the problem 
		for hours without reaching any 
		conclusions. Because the problem does 
		not lie here. The problem is: the NLF 
		wants us to leave Algeria and we want to 
		remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite 
		varying shades of opinion, you all agree 
		that we must remain. When the rebellion 
		first began, there were not even shades 
		of opinion. All the newspapers, even the 
		left-wing ones wanted the rebellion 
		suppressed. And we were sent here for 
		this very reason. And we are neither 
		madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who 
		call us fascists today, forget the 
		contribution that many of us made to the 
		Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do 
		not know that among us there are 
		survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We 
		are soldiers and our only duty is to 
		win. Therefore, to be precise, I would 
		now like to ask you a question: Should 
		France remain in Algeria? If you answer 
		"yes," then you must accept all the 
		necessary consequences.
 

113	CASBAH HOUSES. TORTURE SEQUENCE. INSIDE. DAY.

	Casbah, bedrooms, kitchens, bathrooms.
 
	Sharp, white light; motionless faces, figures paused midway in 
	gestures.
 
	Women, children ... glassy eyes ...

	Background motionless like in a landscape.

	Algerians ... wild eyes ... animals being led to slaughter.

	Paras, their every gesture measured exactly, perfection achieved.
 
	An Algerian is lying down on the table, his arms and ankles bound with 
	belts.

	An Algerian, in the form of a wheel, an iron bar in the curvature of 
	his knees, his ankles tied to his wrists. 

	Electrical wires wrenched from their outlets, a generator with crank, 
	extended pliers with their prongs open wide, the tops of the wires held 
	between two prongs, the pliers applied to a naked body, the most 
	sensitive parts: lips, tongue, ears, nipples, heart, sexual organs ...

	Faucets, tubing, buckets, funnels, a mouth forced open, held open, with 
	a wooden wedge, tubing in the mouth, rags scattered around, water, a 
	belly that is swelling . .. The torture is precise in every detail, and 
	every detail points to a technique that is taken apart and reassembled.
 

114	UPPER CASBAH ALLEY. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The chorus of the Koran school like ceaseless wailing, like a stubborn 
	will to survive that seems to be spreading through the Casbah.

	Petit Omar looks up instinctively, his small face hardened and 
	taciturn, like that of an adult, then enters the school.
 

115	KORAN SCHOOL. INSIDE. DAY. 

	The children are sitting on the mats, motionless; only their lips are 
	moving. There is an oblique light, the teacher is in the shadow.

	RELIGIOUS CHORUS.

	Petit Omar approaches the teacher who shakes his head in denial. Omar 
	goes out.
 

116	CASBAH STREETS. PATROLS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	The Casbah is patrolled by paratroopers; helmets, machine guns, 
	portable radios, police dogs ...

	Paratroopers are erecting loudspeakers at every street corner. 
	Paratroopers with brushes and buckets of paint are marking the doors of 
	the Casbah with large numbers. From time to time, machine-gun fire is 
	heard in the distance.

	Algerians are standing against the wall, their hands up. There is a 
	dead man a few feet away, an Algerian youth. The paratroopers turn him 
	over and search him. A child with terrified eyes turns around a little.
 
	A para transmits the dead man's name into the portable radio.
 

117	CASBAH. OTHER STREETS. OUTSIDE. DAY.

	A car radio receives and transmits the same name; and then the name is 
	repeated by the loudspeakers scattered throughout the Casbah.

				LOUDSPEAKER
		"Inhabitants of the Casbah! The rebellion 
		gets weaker every day. The terrorist Ben 
		Amin has been executed. Kasem Moussa has 
		been arrested. He was commander of the 2nd 
		Sector NLF. Inhabitants of the Casbah! The 
		terrorists are not your true brothers. 
		Leave them to their fate. Rely on the 
		protection of the French army. Denounce 
		the terrorists and agitators. Cooperate 
		with us to reestablish peace and 
		prosperity in Algeria ..."
 

118	FOUR WOMEN. STREET. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
 	Four women, their faces veiled, meet a patrol of paras in a small 
	street.
 
	Two of the paras stop the last woman, and lift her dress, uncovering 
	her feet and ankles -- those of a man. The tear away her veil.

	The man is Ali. At the same time, there is ...
 
	MACHINE-GUN FIRE.
 
	The two paras fall to the ground. Ali grasps his weapon, visible 
	through the opening of his cloak. The other paras fling themselves to 
	the ground.
 
	The other three women flee, while Ali continues to shoot, then runs 
	away.
 
	The four flee through the narrow streets and alleys, climb a stairway, 
	and leap from one terrace to another. Behind them, shouts, whistles, 
	and machine-gun fire are heard. And moving nearer ...

	BARKING OF DOGS.


119 	COURTYARD WITH WELL. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The four enter a courtyard. Ali's three companions have also lifted 
	their veils. They are Kader, Mourad, and Ramel. 

	A woman rushes to shut the door while a man leads the four toward an 
	opening hidden by some boxes.
 
	The others who are in the courtyard, women and children, are also busy 
	helping, silently, hurriedly, in a tense atmosphere of solidarity with 
	the four fugitives. 

	Very near are heard ...
 
	BARKING OF DOGS AND PARAS' HURRIED FOOTSTEPS. 

	A woman runs toward the door and throws some large handfuls of pepper 
	under the cracks.
 

120 	STREET COURTYARD WITH WELL. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	The group of pursuers -- paras who are holding police dogs by leashes 
	-- slow down in front of the door. 

	BARKING DOGS.
 
	The animals sniff the ground, then move on together with the paras.
 

121	ARAB BATH. INSIDE. DAY.

	Petit Omar enters the large steamy room. He moves near the manager and 
	hands him an envelope. The manager slips it quickly under the counter.
 
				SPEAKER
		"To all NLF militants! Reorganize! Replace 
		your fallen and arrested brothers. Make 
		new contacts! This is a grave moment. 
		Resist brothers! The General Staff leaves 
		you free to take any and all necessary 
		offensives ...
 

122 	CASBAH HOUSE. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	All the inhabitants of a house. The men are in a row on the balcony of 
	the first floor, their hands crossed behind their heads, their backs to 
	the wall, while paras guard them with pointed machine guns.

	Two paratroopers lead an Algerian girl forward: she seems to be 
	exhausted, and can barely walk, her eyes half-closed. 

	They stop in front of the first man and ask her:
 
 				PARAS 
		Is this one?

				SPEAKER
		"Our hearts are breaking before such 
		outrages, our houses invaded, our 
		families massacred. Brothers, rebel! 
		Bring terror to the European city!"
 

123	ALGERIAN STREETS. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
 
 	The European city, evening, houses are being lit. People have finished 
	working. They are going to the bars, cinemas, or for walks, or crowding 
	the bus stops ...
 
	The wail of a siren at full blast, an ambulance, driven at frightening 
	speed.
 
	The people move aside, jump to the sidewalks. The cars squeeze to the 
	right, stop.
 
	The ambulance door is opened, a corpse is thrown out, falls, rolls into 
	the street.
 
	The people rush to it. It is a hospital attendant's in white uniform 
	with a knife stuck in his throat.
 
	The sound of the siren decreases in intensity; the ambulance is by now 
	far away.
 

124 	AMBULANCE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. EVENING. 

	In the driver's cab, there are two Algerian boys. Their hair is curly, 
	their shirts old and torn. They are sweating; their eyes wide open, 
	staring.
 
	The one who is driving barely reaches the height of the steering wheel. 
	He clutches it desperately. The other has a machine gun. He makes a 
	remark in Arabic shouting to be heard above the siren.

	The driver takes a hand off the steering wheel, places it on the 
	dashboard, and tries all the switches until he finds the one for the 
	headlights. The high beams.
 
	The other, meanwhile, is now on his knees on the seat. He is leaning 
	out the open window to his waist, and he begins to shoot.


125	ROUTE OF AMBULANCE. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
 
 	The pictures succeed one another in a dizzy rhythm; surprise, terror, 
	someone falls. 

	SHOTS. SIREN.
 

126	AMBULANCE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. EVENING.
 
	There is no more ammunition. The machine gun is thrown in the back of 
	the ambulance. The siren is still at full blast. The auto races ahead 
	at terrifying speed. The two boys don't know any more what to do, where 
	to go, and the one who is driving has his eyes almost closed, as if he 
	were dizzy. 

	They reach a square. 

	SIREN.
 
	The other points ahead to the left.
 

127	BUS SHELTER. OUTSIDE. EVENING.
 
 	The people are crowded in a bus shelter. The one who is driving doesn't 
	understand or doesn't want to.

	The other shouts to him again and again, the same phrase, then flings 
	himself on the steering wheel, and turns it in that direction.
 
	The bus shelter is nearer and nearer.
 
	The people are paralyzed. They have no time to move. They are run down, 
	rammed into. The ambulance crashes into a pillar.

	On the ground, all about, the bodies of dead and wounded. The boys' 
	bodies remain motionless, their foreheads resting on the smashed 
	windshield.
 
	But the sound of the siren does not stop, and is heard, mournful and 
	full of anguish.
 

128	RAMEL'S HOUSE. IMPASSE ST. VINCENT DE PAUL. 
	OUTSIDE/INSIDE. DAY. AUGUST 26.
 
	Impasse St. Vincent-de-Paul, noon. There are helicopters in the sky, 
	and paras fill the alley.
 
	Their faces are pale and tense, their eyes wide open, their hands 
	clutch their machine guns. There is a strange silence. Then a movement 
	at the back of the alley, a voice, a brief greeting. Mathieu has 
	arrived and he is saying to an officer:
 
 				MATHIEU 
		Now is not the time for heroes. Give me 
		the megaphone. 

	Mathieu takes the megaphone in his hands and approaches an open door. 
	Through the doorway the inner courtyard of the house is visible where 
	the corpses of four paras are strewn about.
 
	Ramel and Si Mourad are on the first-floor balcony, lying in wait 
	behind the railings, so they are able to watch the door, courtyard, and 
	the stairway that leads from the balcony to the terrace.

	On the terrace there are other paras who are facing the balcony. From 
	time to time they release a burst of machine gun fire.

	The voice of Mathieu is heard over the loudspeaker.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Ramel ... Si Mourad ... use your heads. 
		If you go on like this, I wouldn't want to 
		be in your place when you are captured ... 
		Because you will be captured in the end, 
		and you know it too. Surrender! If you do 
		it immediately, I promise that you will 
		not be harmed and you will have a fair 
		trial. Can you hear me?
 
	Ramel and Si Mourad look at each other.
 
 				MOURAD
		Who is speaking?

				MATHIEU 
		Mathieu. Colonel Mathieu.
 
 				MOURAD
		We don't trust you, colonel. Come 
		forward, show yourself.
 
	A moment of silence.

				MATHIEU 
		I don't trust you either. First stand up 
		so I can see you, and keep your hands 
		still and well in sight.

	Mourad hesitates an instant, glances at Ramel, then: 

 				MOURAD
		Okay. But we want your promise for a fair 
		trial in writing. Give us a written 
		statement, Mathieu, and then we'll 
		surrender. 

				MATHIEU 
		How can I give you this statement? 

				MOURAD
		We'll lower a basket from the window ...

				MATHIEU 
		Okay, I'll make the statement in 
		writing ...

	Mourad shows his companion the two large time-bombs that are on the 
	floor in front of him. He takes one, begins to prepare it, and 
	regulates the mechanism.

	At the same time, he tells Ramel in Arabic to go find the basket.
 
	Ramel crawls past the doors which are all closed, and asks for a basket.

	A door opens and an old woman appears. She hands him a basket with its 
	cord rolled up.
 
				MOURAD
			(without turning around)
		A newspaper too, or a piece of paper ...
 
	Ramel brings him the basket and newspaper. Mourad has loaded the time-
	bomb mechanism, and the tic-toc sound is sharp and clear.

	Now he has to move the second hand. Mourad's hands do not tremble, his 
	glance is attentive, concentrating. Ramel watches him without saying a 
	word; his fear is obvious. 

	Without moving, his eyes glued to the bomb dial:
 
				MOURAD
			(loudly)
		Are you ready, colonel?
 
				MATHIEU 
		Yes ... But let me first see you.

	Mourad moves one of the clock hands to precede the other one by a 
	minute. Immediately afterward he places the flat and rectangular bomb 
	in the bottom of the basket.
 
	The basket seems to be empty. The piece of newspaper protects its 
	bottom. Mourad tells Ramel to get up, and he too gets up. Their machine 
	guns are lying on the ground. Meanwhile, Mourad has begun to count to 
	himself silently, his lips moving: one, two, three, four ... 

	From the terrace, the paras can see Ramel and Mourad standing up not 
	very far away, their empty hands resting near the basket on the 
	railing. 

	A para shouts:
 
 				PARA 
		We see them. You can come.
 
	Mourad begins to lower the basket very slowly.
 
				MOURAD 
			(counting)
		60, 59, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 53 ...

	Mathieu enters the courtyard together with an officer and other paras. 
	He looks up toward the balcony, smiles, and shows them a folded piece 
	of paper.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Here it is ... you know that when I give 
		my word, I keep it ...
 
	Mourad does not answer, but looks at Mathieu as if to calculate the 
	distance and time, and slows down even more the basket's descent.

	Mathieu moves forward a few steps, as if to go for the basket that is 
	hanging on the other side of the courtyard, but suddenly he seems 
	perplexed for a second, and then changes his mind. He turns to the 
	nearest para, and gives him the note.
 
				MATHIEU
		You go ...

	Mourad's face has remained motionless. In his expression there is a 
	shade of disappointment. He sees Mathieu retrace his steps toward the 
	door, and is now surrounded by a group of paratroopers ...

				MOURAD 
			(counting) 
		25, 24, 23, 22, 21, 20, 19 ...

	The basket has stopped moving two yards from the ground. In order to 
	reach it, the para has to step over the corpses of his dead companions, 
	his face hardens, he reaches the basket, and extending his arm, he 
	throws in the note. The basket does not move; the para looks up.

				PARA 
			(muttering)
		Hurry up, black bastard!
 
	Mourad smiles at him, and mumbles something in Arabic, a phrase that he 
	doesn't manage to finish, for now is heard -- the explosion.
 

129	RUE CATON 4. FATHIA'S HOUSE. INSIDE. NIGHT. SEPTEMBER 2.

	Rue Caton number four. It is 11 p.m. A large, badly lit room is filled 
	with paratroopers and one of them is now being carried away on a 
	stretcher. Another three or four wounded are seated on the opposite 
	side of the room and are waiting their turn to be carried away.

	Two paras are by the door. They look out from time to time, and are 
	attentive, ready, with machine guns clutched by their sides.
 
	On the other side of the room opposite the door, the Algerians who live 
	in the house are standing against the wall. Mathieu is in front of 
	them, and he is asking a group of women:

				MATHIEU
		Which one of you is Fathia?

	A woman about forty years old raises her eyes toward him.
 
				MATHIEU
		Is it you?

	The woman nods yes.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Go up the stairs, and tell Kader that if 
		they don't surrender, we'll blow up 
		everything ... Do you understand? 

	The woman again nods yes, and without waiting for more words, she moves 
	toward the door, taciturn, silent. Mathieu follows her, he pushes past 
	her.

				MATHIEU 
		Try to convince him, if you care about 
		your house ... Wait a minute ... Do you 
		want to get killed? 

	He leans out the door and says loudly:
 
				MATHIEU 
		Kader, look. Fathia is coming ... I 
		wouldn't shoot ...
 
	Then he steps aside and lets the woman pass.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Go on ...
 
	Outside the door, there is a small landing, then a steep stairway, and 
	at the top, a corridor. Fathia climbs the stairs that are cluttered 
	with empty magazines, with cartridge boxes. The walls are chipped from 
	the shooting. The ceiling is parallel to the stairway at the same 
	inclination, for part of its distance. But for the last few yards, it 
	straightens out and lowers to become horizontal.

	The floor of the hiding place is open. Inside are Zohra and Kader.

	Fathia repeats to them in Arabic what Mathieu has said to her.

	Kader listens to her then answers, he too in Arabic. Then he smiles.
 
				KADER 
		Okay ... You can tell the colonel to blow 
		up whatever he likes. Go on, now.
 
	Fathia goes down the stairs, and reenters the room.
 
				FATHIA 
			(to Mathieu)
		He said that you can blow up whatever 
		you like ...

	She, then, rejoins the other women.

	Mathieu seems to be tired, he has lost weight, he is nervous. He turns 
	to his men, and slowly as he gives the orders, the paras begin to move.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Return to where the others are. Prepare 
		the plastic. It should be placed on the 
		ceiling of the stairway under the hiding 
		place ... a long fuse rolled up ... Take 
		cover ... keep shooting while you are 
		working. Quickly! Clear the house ... 
		Bring them outside, then check the rooms 
		again ... Hurry up!
 
	Kader gives Zohra a box of matches. She goes to the back of the hiding 
	place where there is a bundle of papers. She lights them, then returns 
	near to Kader who is inspecting the magazine of his machine gun.

	There are only two shots left. The other empty magazines are scattered 
	around. Kader turns to Zohra, and starts to speak, but suddenly his 
	words are blurred by the sound of shots. 

	Kader and Zohra have to step back a little, because the shells are 
	flashing at the edge of the opening.
 
	The shooting stops. From the stairway, one end of a long fuse is 
	thrown into the corridor. The other end is inserted into a plastic 
	charge fastened to the ceiling of the stairway, under the hiding place.
 
	Kader and Zohra can see two or three yards in front of them, below, 
	into the corridor, where the end of the fuse is glowing and burning.

	Kader too has lost weight, his beard is long. He looks at the fuse, 
	then at Zohra. A second passes in silence. Now Zohra too looks at him, 
	and Kader says calmly in his usual voice:

				KADER 
		It doesn't do any good to die like this ... 
		it doesn't help anybody ...

	He leans out from the hiding place.
 
				KADER 
			(shouting)
		Mathieu! If you give your word that you 
		won't touch any of the other people in 
		the house, we'll come out.
 

130	MILITARY CAR. INSIDE. NIGHT. 

	Inside a military automobile.

	In the back seat, Mathieu is sitting next to Kader who is handcuffed.
 
	Zohra is in the front seat, between the driver and a para who has in 
	his hand a large regulation pistol. The interior is lighted by the 
	headlights of a jeep which is following directly behind the auto a few 
	yards. Silence. Mathieu looks hastily at Kader, who is staring straight 
	in front of him, and appears to be sullen and downcast.

	Then Mathieu speaks in a pleasant tone, as if in friendly conversation.

				MATHIEU
		If you had let me blow you up, you would 
		have disappointed me ...

	Kader turns to him, and replies, trying to maintain his own voice at 
	the same level of indifference:
	 
				KADER
		Why?
 
				MATHIEU 
		For many months, I've had your photo on 
		my desk together with a dozen or so 
		reports on you ... And naturally, I am 
		under the illusion that I know you 
		somewhat. You never seemed the type, 
		Kader, inclined to performing useless 
		actions. 

	Kader doesn't answer right away, then speaks slowly as if expressing 
	the results of his doubts, a new point of view ...
 
 				KADER 
		You seem to be very satisfied to have 
		taken me alive ...
 
 				MATHIEU 
		Of course I am.
 
				KADER 
		That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I 
		credited you with an advantage greater 
		than I should have.

				MATHIEU 
		No. Let's just say that you've given me 
		the satisfaction to have guessed 
		correctly. But from the technical point 
		of view, it isn't possible to speak of 
		advantages. By now the game is over. The 
		NLF has been defeated.

	Zohra has turned around suddenly. She is crying and speaks hastily in 
	Arabic, violently, harshly.

	Mathieu doesn't understand, and turns to Kader to ask him politely, 
	although with a bit of irony:

				MATHIEU 
		What is she saying?

				KADER 
		She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
 

131	CROWDED BEACH. OUTSIDE. DAY. 

	Ali la Pointe's glance is sullen, heavy, motionless. He moves his head 
	slowly in such a way so that his glance also moves in a semicircle.

	White beach, fine sand, transparent sea, bodies stretched out in the 
	sun, golden skin of girls; girls in bikinis, sensual, smiling, young 
	men with narrow hips, with muscles well cared for, cheerful youth, 
	naturally happy, enviable. The children are building sand castles near 
	the water's edge; the beach is shaped like a half-moon with rocky reefs 
	at both ends ...
 
	A September Sunday, warm and calm. Ali is leaning on the wall. He is 
	wearing a white wool cloak. Only his eyes are visible ... the eyes of a
 	hungry tiger perched above a path, on the lookout for innocent prey. 
	Eyes that now gleam, cruel eyes, tension dilating the pupils ... Then
	again the calm, a gloomy calm, a gratifying tension. The place is 
	right, and the victims couldn't be better ones.

	Ali moves, leaves the wall, crosses the street to a large city 
	sanitation truck, one of those metallic trucks with no visible 
	openings.

	A young Algerian is at the steering wheel, a street cleaner. He is 
	leaning his thin face on the wheel. His hands are dirty, by now 
	unwashable from years of work.

	Ali has climbed into the cab. The truck is in motion and leaves.
 

132	SANITATION TRUCK. INSIDE. DAY.
 
	The name of the street cleaner is Sadek. He seems frightened. He looks 
	around, hesitates before speaking.
 
 				SADEK
		Then the beach is okay, Ali.

	Silence. Sadek looks at him again, waiting, but Ali does not respond.

 	Ali looks straight ahead at the street bathed in sunlight, the tar that 
	seems to be liquid, the villas that surround Algiers, the lemon trees, 
	the oleanders ... Then he speaks, but without turning to Sadek. He 
	speaks in a whisper, his eyes continually staring straight ahead. 

				ALI 
		We need two more, the biggest ones.
 
 				SADEK
		And the others?

				ALI 
		The others ... let's wait and see. 

	Sadek remains silent for a while.

 				SADEK
		I've looked, Ali, even where I work. 
		Nothing. The ones who have not been 
		arrested have left Algiers and gone into 
		the mountains ... And the others don't 
		want to hear any more about it ... 
		they're afraid ...
    
	Ali doesn't answer him. Silence.
 
				ALI 
		Can't you go any faster?
 
 				SADEK
		Yes, sure ... here.

	Sadek puts the truck in third gear, accelerates the motor, then shifts 
	back again into fourth gear. The truck increases its speed. The road is 
	straight, the outskirts of Algiers are visible.

 				SADEK
		If we don't find any others ... should we 
		call it off? 

	Ali turns suddenly to look at him but says nothing. Sadek can feel 
	those eyes on him, and tries to justify himself.
 
 				SADEK
		We can't plant all of them by 
		ourselves ... 

	Ali speaks to him in a dry and indifferent voice. 

				ALI 
		You don't have to plant anything. You 
		only have to carry them, that's all.
 

133	RUE DES ABDERAMES. ALI'S HOUSE. OUTSIDE/INSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	Night. At number three rue des Abderames, on the first-floor balcony, 
	the stove fires are glowing. The women are cooking outside on their 
	stoves built from tin containers. They are cooking in front of the 
	doors of their homes. The doorways are lit up.

	Ali passes along the balcony, passes by Mahmoud and his wife who are 
	speaking in whispers by themselves and leaning on the railing. It is a 
	warm and starry night. Mahmoud says some more words to his wife, still 
	speaking in whispers, tenderly. Then he follows Ali who has stopped in 
	front of the door.
 

134	ALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. NIGHT.
 
	In the room, there is Petit Omar who is cutting out some pictures from 
	a comic book.
 
	As soon as he sees Ali at the door, he stops, closes his book, puts the 
	scissors in his pocket. He seems to be embarrassed at being caught in 
	his childish game.
 
	In the center of the room, there is a dividing curtain, pulled halfway 
	to the side. On the other side, Hassiba is typing. Behind Hassiba, next 
	to the bed, the hiding place is open. Ali enters. He seems tired, 
	sweating. He removes his cloak, tosses it on the chair, and puts his 
	machine gun on the table.
 
				ALI 
			(turning to Petit Omar)
		C'mon, hurry. Go to sleep. Tomorrow we 
		four have a lot of work to do: Mahmoud, 
		Hassiba, you and I.
 
	Mahmoud has remained motionless at the door. Hassiba has stopped typing 
	and approaches them. Omar says nothing, but there is a satisfied look 
	in his eyes. He can't help stretching out his hand to touch the machine 
	gun.
 
	Ali sits down, at the table, moves the machine gun away from Omar, and 
	continues to speak, still talking to Omar.
 
 				ALI 
		Because we can't find anyone else, Sadek 
		will bring us there in the truck. You get 
		out first and plant the bomb where I tell 
		you ... then return here quickly. But be 
		careful that no one is following you. Then 
		Hassiba will get out, and after her, 
		Mahmoud. Then I will plant the ones that 
		are left. They'll know that we're still
		strong ... you can be sure of that.
 
 
135	ALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN. OCTOBER 7, 1957.
 
 	The room is badly lit by a small lamp which is on the other side of the 
	curtain. There is a mattress on the table and Petit Omar is lying on 
	top, asleep.
 
	Ali is lying on a mattress on the ground, fully dressed, with his 
	machine gun by his side. His eyes are open, and he is listening to the 
	far-away sound of a motor. He looks at his watch, gets up, and goes to 
	open the door. Outside there is the first gray light of dawn. The sound 
	is heard more clearly and seems to be moving nearer.
 
	Ali returns to Petit Omar, stays a minute looking at him, then shakes 
	him roughly. The child gets up immediately. He is trembling, as if he 
	had slept with taut nerves, and jumps down quickly from the table. His 
	eyes are open, but he is still sleepy.

	Ali smiles for a moment, and runs his fingers through Omar's hair.
 
				ALI 
		Omar, Omar. C'mon, wake up. Hurry, little 
		one. Today you're going to see fireworks.

	The child also smiles and his face relaxes, then brightens up. At the 
	same time, he extends his hand and pats Ali's side. Mahmoud enters the 
	room from the balcony. He is carrying a tray with four cups of coffee. 

				MAHMOUD
		It's almost time, isn't it? 

				ALI 
		Yes.
 
 	Then Ali turns to the curtain and calls:
 
 				ALI 
		Hassiba ...
 
				HASSIBA
		I'm ready.
 
	Ali sits down and puts on a pair of sneakers. Petit Omar has finished 
	dressing.
      
	The curtain is drawn, Hassiba appears, already dressed. 

				MAHMOUD
		I heard the sound of a truck before ...
 
 				ALI 
		Me too. But I don't think it was Sadek. 
		Otherwise he'd be here by now.

	Hassiba is dressed in European clothes, a skirt and blouse. She nears 
	the table and takes a cup of coffee. 

				HASSIBA 
			(smiling)
		How is your wife now?
      
	Mahmoud's face is expressionless. He shakes his head.
 
				MAHMOUD
		So-so ... 

	Ali has finished putting on his shoes. He takes a cup of coffee. In the 
	same moment, outside the door is heard: 

	MACHINE-GUN FIRE. 

	The four are startled. 

				ALI 
			(shouting)
		Inside! Inside!
 
	Simultaneously, all of them move toward the hiding place. 

	Mahmoud's wife appears at the door. Her face is despairing, but she 
	moves carefully, quickly, precisely. She closes the door. She puts the 
	coffee cups back on the tray, and hides everything in the sink.
 
	She goes to the other side of the curtain. Ali is entering the hiding 
	place. The other three are already inside. Ali pushes the movable piece 
	of wall toward him, and the woman helps him.

	Then, she takes a can from the night table; it is full of plaster mixed 
	with coal dust. The woman spreads the paste in the joints between the 
	bricks of the wall and the closure of the hiding place. At the same 
	time, shouting, shots, and the footsteps of paras are heard.

	As soon as she has finished, the woman slips into bed under the sheets.

	The paratroopers break into the room shouting, and make the woman get 
	up. They drag her outside on the balcony.
 

136 	ABDERAMES COURTYARD. OUTSIDE. DAWN.
 
	They drag Mahmoud's wife down from the balcony to the center of the 
	courtyard, where now all the inhabitants of the building are standing 
	-- men, women, children -- all of them with their hands to the wall, in 
	full sight of the paras who are guarding them.

	Sadek's head is lowered. He passes along the balcony between Marc and 
	the captain. He stops in front of the door.
 
				CAPTAIN 
			(mumbling softly)
		Here?
 
	The Algerian nods yes. They enter.
 

137	ALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN.
 
 	Sadek points toward the curtain. The captain signals him to go there. 
	The Algerian points to a spot in the brick baseboard.

	The captain examines it and with his thumb, he tests the fresh plaster. 
	He bends down and leans his ear to the wall. He smiles as he listens to 
	the ...

	HEAVY BREATHING.
 
	It is the same breathing that soon after Mathieu hears, bent in the 
	same position as the captain. The colonel gets up and looks around him.
 
	Four paras are ready with their machine guns aimed at the hiding place. 
	Others are arranging plastic charges along the wall, all of them 
	connected to a single fuse.
 
	In a corner, Sadek, wearing his cap and army camouflage fatigues, is 
	sitting on a chair.

	He is watching the scene with his eyes wide open. He is trembling. His 
	body is slouched forward. He seems to be lifeless, without nerves. If 
	it weren't for his face, he would seem to be a heap of rags.
 
				MATHIEU 
			(to the captain)
		Everything ready?
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		Yes, sir.
 
 				MATHIEU 
		He hasn't answered?
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		No, sir. Total silence. 

				MATHIEU 
		I thought so. It was obvious.
 
	Mathieu bends down again and leans his ear against the bricks. He gets 
	up again. He remains a minute in this position, lost in thought.

				MATHIEU 
			(loudly and markedly)
		Ali ... Ali la Pointe ... You're going to 
		be blown up. Let the others come out, at 
		least the child. We'll let him off with 
		reformatory school ... Why do you want to 
		make him die?

	Mathieu stops, and shakes his head. He turns to the captain: 

				MATHIEU 
		Let's go ...

	A paratrooper is unrolling a large bundle of fuse. 

				CAPTAIN 
		Bring it down there, till it reaches 
		outside ...
 
				PARA 
		Yes, sir ...

	Mathieu has stopped in front of Sadek. He looks at him.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Is this one still here? ... Take him away. 

	Two paratroopers grab the street cleaner by the armpits and almost 
	lifting him completely, they lead him away. Mathieu is about to go out, 
	then turns and takes the megaphone from the captain's hands, and places 
	it to his mouth. 

				MATHIEU 
		Ali! Ali la Pointe! I am giving you 
		another thirty seconds. What do you hope 
		to gain? You've lost anyway. Thirty 
		seconds, Ali, starting now.
 

138	ALI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. DAWN.
 
 	Ali la Pointe's eyes are staring at the square piece of wall that seals 
	the hiding place. His glance is taciturn, gloomy. The others are 
	watching Ali. Their lips are half-open, their breasts rise and fall in
 	laborious breathing.
 
 				ALI 
			(in deep, resigned voice) 
		Who wants to leave?
 
	Petit Omar presses against Ali's arm; he looks like a son with his 
	father.
 
	Mahmoud takes his head in his hands and squeezes it.
 
 				HASSIBA
		What are you going to do? 

				ALI 
		I don't deal with them.
 

139	ALI'S ROOM. INSIDE. DAWN.
 
 	Mathieu checks his watch; thirty seconds have passed. He moves to go 
	out. The four paras with machine guns are still in the room.
 
 				CAPTAIN 
			(to another paratrooper)
		You stay here by the door to signal the 
		others. When I call you, all of you come 
		down ...
 

140	RUE DES ABDERAMES. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	The sun has risen to the height of the terraces. 

	The terraces are swarming with people.
 
	The alley is empty and only the fuse is visible; it reaches to a small
	clearing full of paratroopers. Two more colonels and a general have 
	arrived.
 
	There is a paratrooper with an "Arriflex" ready to film the explosion.
 
	The atmosphere is that of a show. Two paratroopers are connecting the 
	ends of the fuse to the electric contact.
 
	On the terraces, there are Algerian women, children, and old people.

	Their eyes are motionless; someone is praying. There is an atmosphere 
	of suspense.
 
	There is also the wife of Mahmoud; her eyes seem blank. 

	Five paras come out of the house quickly, and pass along the alley 
	toward the clearing.

	The captain signals, and the para begins to lower the contact switch 
	slowly.
 
	The eyes of all are motionless. The camera is ready. But the explosion 
	does not occur.
      
	The paratrooper swears; he examines the wires.
 
 				CAPTAIN 
		Stand back! Ready, Pierre?
 
 	Pierre responds by mumbling something, and at the same time his hands 
	are moving frenziedly around the wires.
 

141	ALI'S HIDING PLACE. INSIDE. MORNING.
 
 	Ali la Pointe bends over Petit Omar as if to cover him. Hassiba has 
	stopped breathing, her eyes wide open; Mahmoud is crying ...

	A single image, a second and now: 

	THE EXPLOSION.
 

142 	RUE DES ABDERAMES. OUTSIDE. MORNING.
 
	The house collapses in a white cloud, as if its foundations had 
	suddenly been removed.
 
	Mathieu and the other officers move away. Behind them the echo of the 
	explosion continues to resound, then shouts, orders, and isolated 
	ju-ju.
 
	Mathieu's face is weary but his expression is relieved. He is smiling.
 
				GENERAL
		And so the tapeworm no longer has a head. 
		Are you satisfied, Mathieu? In Algiers 
		everything should be over.
 
				MATHIEU 
		Yes, I believe there won't be any more 
		talk of the NLF for some time.
 
				GENERAL
		Let's hope forever. 

	Another colonel intervenes:
 
 				1ST COLONEL
		At heart they are good people. We've had 
		good relations with them for a hundred and 
		thirty years ... I don't see why we 
		shouldn't continue that way.

				2ND COLONEL
		Yes, but Algiers is not the only city in 
		Algeria. 

				MATHIEU 
			(smiling)
		Bah, for that matter, Algeria isn't the 
		only country in the world ...
 
				GENERAL 
			(smiling)
		Why, yes, of course ... But for the 
		moment, let's be satisfied with Algiers! 
		In the mountains our work is always 
		easier.
 
	Gradually the officers move away down the slanting street toward their 
	jeeps, and their remarks fade away and are lost.
 

143	CASBAH STREETS. DEMONSTRATIONS. OUTSIDE. DAY. DECEMBER 1960.
 
	Like the cries of birds, of thousands of wild birds, the ju-jus invade 
	and shake the black sky. 

	JU-JU-JU ...

	And below, in the Casbah the white cloaks of the Algerians are like 
	streams, floods; through the alleys, down the stairways, through the 
	streets and the squares, they flow toward the European city.
 

144	PRESS HALL. PREFECT'S OFFICE. INSIDE. DAY.
 
 	In the press hall, the journalists are taking the telephones by force, 
	shouting at the top of their voices. An English journalist:
 
				JOURNALIST
		No one knows what could have been the 
		pretext. The fact is that they seem to be 
		unleashed without warning ... I telephoned 
		Lausanne ... yes, Lausanne. I spoke with 
		an NLF leader in exile. They don't know 
		anything there.
 

145	ALGIERS STREETS. DEMONSTRATION. OUTSIDE. DAY/NIGHT.
 
	In front, the adolescents, very young boys and girls, their mouths wide 
	open, their eyes burning, laughing, their arms stretched above them, 
	raised and lowered to mark the rhythm.
 
				VOICES
		Algerie! 
		Mu-sul-mane!
 		Algerie Musulmane!
 
 	The paratroopers jump down from the trucks, and rush forward.

	The policemen rush forward, soldiers, zouaves, the CRS ...

	Deployed in cordons, in a wedge, in turtle-like formations, in order to 
	divide, to scatter, to hold back ...

	But the demonstrators will not move back, or divide. They continue to 
	press forward, pushing against the troops, face to face.
 
				VOICES
		Free Ben-Bel-la! 
		Free Ben-Bel-la!
 
	The Europeans are closing their doors, lowering shutters. They too, the 
	younger ones, the more decisive, are grouping together, trying to 
	confront the Algerians. They are less numerous, but armed ...

	The first revolver shots resound in the streets, from the windows. Some 
	Algerians fall, but the others continue to advance. They are running 
	now, scattering.
 
 				VOICES
		Ta-hia Et-thou-ar! 
		[Long live the partisans!]
 
	The jeeps, the trucks, the sirens, the tear-gas bombs, machine gun 
	fire.
 
	And then the tanks. The turrets move slowly in a semi-circle. The 
	machine gunner fires the first burst at point-blank. 

 				VOICES 
		Ta-hia el-Djez-air! 
		Ta-hia el-Djez-air! 
 
	Meanwhile the sun has set, and shadows of night are visible.
 
				VOICE OF 
				ENGLISH 
				JOURNALIST 
			(off)
		Today the situation is tenser. In spite 
		of pressure from the more intolerant 
		colonialist group it seems that the 
		Government has given strict orders not 
		to use arms except in emergency 
		situations. But this afternoon there were 
		attempts to enter the European city by 
		force: as a result, the first casualties 
		... Now calm has returned, although from 
		the Casbah continue to be heard those 
		cries ... incoherent, rhythmic, 
		nightmarish cries ...

	And then, from time to time, in the by now dark night, the shrill and 
	angry ju-jus. 

	JU-JU-JU ...
 

146	ALGERIAN STREETS. FLAGS. OUTSIDE. DAY.
 
	Those cries continued until the following day.

	The following day is sunny; the scene begins again like the day 
	before. Only that ...
 
				VOICE OF 
				ENGLISH 
				JOURNALIST 
			(off) 
		This morning for the first time, the 
		people appeared with their flags -- green 
		and white with half moon and star. 
		Thousands of flags. They must have sewn 
		them overnight. Flags so to speak. Many 
		are strips of sheets, shirts, ribbons, 
		rags ... but anyway they are flags.
 
	Thousands of flags. All are carrying flags, tied to poles or sticks, or 
	waving in their hands like handkerchiefs. Waving in the sullen faces of 
	the paratroopers, on the black helmets of the soldiers.
 
				SPEAKER 
		"Another two years had to pass and 
		infinite losses on both sides; and then 
		July 2, 1962 independence was obtained --
		the Algerian Nation was born."
 
 				VOICES 
		Ta-hia el-Djez-air! 
		Ta-hia el-Djez-air! 
		Ta-hia el-Djez-air!

                                       Early Draft

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Epic beauty: cobalt mountains beneath a glowering purple sky 
               fringed with pink, as if the clouds were a lid too small for 
               the earth; a cascading landscape of boulders shrouded in 
               deep green grass; and the blue lochs, reflecting the sky. We 
               hear a voice, husky, Scottish...

                                     VOICE OVER
                         I will tell you of William Wallace.

               EXT. MACANDREWS FARM - DAY

               A farmhouse and a large barn lie nestled in a Scottish valley. 
               Riding down the roads that lead in from opposite sides are 
               Scottish noblemen in full regalia: eye-popping tartans, 
               sparkling chestplates. Even the horses are draped in scarlet. 
               Behind each nobleman rides a single page boy.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Historians from England will say I 
                         am a liar. But history is written by 
                         those who have hung heroes.

               Another noble rides in from the opposite side. Two more appear 
               down the road, converging on the barn.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         The King of Scotland had died without 
                         a son, and the king of England, a 
                         cruel pagan known as Edward the 
                         Longshanks, claimed the throne for 
                         himself. Scotlands nobles fought 
                         him, and fought each other, over the 
                         crown. So Longshanks invited them to 
                         talks of truce. No weapons, one page 
                         only.

               The nobles eye each other cautiously, but the truce holds.

               They enter the barn, with their pages...

               EXT. SCOTTISH FARM - DAY

               Nestled in emerald hills are the thatched roof house and 
               barn and outbuildings of a well-run farm. The farmer, MALCOLM 
               WALLACE, and his nineteen-year-old son JOHN, both strong, 
               tough men, are riding away from the farm. They hear hooves 
               behind them and turn to see a boy riding after them.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Among the farmers of that shire was 
                         Malcolm Wallace, a commoner, with 
                         his own lands and two sons: John...

               We FAVOR JOHN WALLACE, the nineteen-year-old sitting easily 
               on his horse, beside his father...

                                     VOICE OVER
                         ...and William.

               WILLIAM, a skinny eight-year-old riding bareback, catches up 
               to his father and older brother.

                                     FATHER
                         Told ya to stay.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I finished my chores. Where we goin'?

                                     FATHER
                         MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit 
                         when the truce was over.

               They ride on, over the lush hills.

               EXT. THE MACANDREWS FARM - DAY

               The horses are all gone; the place looks deserted. UP ON THE 
               HILL we see the three Wallaces, looking down.

                                     FATHER
                         Stay here.

               He means William. He and his elder son spur their horses.

               AT THE BARN - DAY

               The Wallaces ride up, looking around.

                                     FATHER
                         MacAndrews!... MacAndrews!?

               Malcolm finds a pitchfork, John the woodpile axe...

               INT. THE BARN

               POV from within as the door opens and a widening block of 
               sunlight illuminates the dusty shadows. Malcolm and John 
               Wallace step in, and are shocked to see...

               POV THE WALLACES

               Hanging from the rafters of the barn are thirty Scottish 
               noblemen and thirty pages, their faces purple and contorted 
               by the strangulation hanging, their tongues protruding.

               Malcolm stabs the pitchfork into the ground in useless anger; 
               John still grips the axe as he follows his father through 
               the hanging bodies of the noblemen to the back row, to see 
               the one man in commoner's dress, like theirs...

                                     FATHER
                         MacAndrews.

               A SHUFFLE; John spins; William has entered the back door.

                                     JOHN
                         William! Get out of here!

                                     WILLIAM
                         Why would MacAndrews make so many 
                         scarecrows?

               Before his father and brother can think of anything to say, 
               William, with a boy's curiosity, touches the spurred foot of 
               the hanged noblemen we first saw riding in. It's too solid; 
               he takes a real look at the face, and suddenly --

                                     WILLIAM
                         R -- real!!!... Ahhhhhgggg!...

               He turns to run, but knocks back into the feet of the hanged 
               man behind him! In blind panic he darts in another direction, 
               and runs into another corpse, and another; the hanged men 
               begin to swing, making it harder for William's father and 
               older brother to fight their way to him.

                                     FATHER
                         William! William!

               Then, worst of all, William sees the pages, boys like himself, 
               hanged in a row behind their masters!

               Finally his father and brother reach William and hug him 
               tight. There in the barn, among the swinging bodies of the 
               hanged nobles, Malcolm Wallace grips his sons.

                                     FATHER
                         Murderin' English bastards.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WALLACE FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

               The cottage looks peaceful, the windows glowing yellow into 
               the night. From outside the house we see John rise and close 
               the shutters of the kitchen, where men are gathered. We PAN 
               UP to the upper bedroom window...

               INSIDE THAT BEDROOM

               Young William is in nightmarish sleep. He mumbles in smothered 
               terror; he twitches. We see

               HIS NIGHTMARE

               In the blue-grays of his dream, William stands at the door 
               of the barn, gazing at the hanged knights. We WHIP PAN to 
               their faces, garish, horrible... Then one of the heads moves 
               and its eyes open! William wants to run, but he can't get 
               his body to respond... and the hanging nobleman, his bloated 
               tongue still bursting through his lips, moans...

                                     GHOUL
                         Will--iam...!

               WILLIAM tears himself from sleep; looking around, swallowing 
               back his tears and panic.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               A dozen strong, tough farmers have huddled. Red-headed 
               CAMPBELL, scarred and missing fingers, is stirred up, while 
               his friend MacCLANNOUGH is reluctant.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Wallace is right! We fight 'em!

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         Every nobleman who had any will to 
                         fight was at that meeting.

                                     MALCOLM WALLACE
                         So it's up to us! We show them we 
                         won't lie down to be their slaves!

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         We can't beat an army, not with the 
                         fifty farmers we can raise!

                                     MALCOLM WALLACE
                         We don't have to beat 'em, just fight 
                         'em. To show 'em we're not dogs, but 
                         men.

               Young Wallace has snuck down and is eavesdropping from the 
               stairs. He sees his father drip his finger into a jug of 
               whiskey and use the wet finger to draw on the tabletop.

                                     MALCOLM WALLACE
                         They have a camp here. We attack 
                         them at sunset tomorrow. Give us all 
                         night to run home.

               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY

               Malcolm and John have saddled horses; they are checking the 
               short swords they've tucked into grain sacks when William 
               comes out of the barn with his own horse.

                                     MALCOLM
                         William, you're staying here.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I can fight.

               These words from his youngest son make Malcolm pause, and 
               kneel, to look into William's eyes.

                                     MALCOLM
                         Aye. But it's our wits that make us 
                         men. I love ya, boy. You stay.

               Malcolm and John mount their horses and ride away, leaving 
               William looking forlorn. They wave; he waves back.

               EXT SCOTTISH HILLS, NEAR THE WALLACE FARM - DAY

               It's strangely quiet, until William and his friend HAMISH 
               CAMPBELL, a red-headed like his father, race up the hillside 
               and duck in among a grove of trees. Breathless, gasping, 
               they press their backs to the tree bark. William peers around 
               a tree, then shrinks back and whispers...

                                     WILLIAM
                         They're coming!

                                     HAMISH
                         How many?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Three, maybe more!

                                     HAMISH
                         Armed?

                                     WILLIAM
                         They're English soldiers, ain't they?

                                     HAMISH
                         With your father and brother gone, 
                         they'll kill us and burn the farm!

                                     WILLIAM
                         It's up to us, Hamish!

               Hamish leans forward for a look, but William pulls him back.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Not yet! Here he comes, be ready!

               They wait; heavy FOOTSTEPS. Then from around the edge of the 
               grove three enormous, ugly hogs appear. The boys hurling 
               rotten eggs. The eggs slap the snouts of the pigs, who scatter 
               as the boys charge, howling. We PULL BACK... as the sun goes 
               down on their play.

               EXT. THE WALLACE HOUSE - SUNDOWN

               The boys walk toward the house, beneath a lavender sky.

                                     HAMISH
                         Wanna stay with me tonight?

                                     WILLIAM
                         I wanna have supper waitin'.

                                     HAMISH
                         We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Aye, we'll get 'em.

               EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               William's face appears at the window, looking toward

               THE DISTANT HILLS

               of trees and heather, where there is no sign of life.

               INT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

               William has cooked stew in a pot, and now spoons up two 
               steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table. But he 
               is only hoping. He looks out the window again; he is still 
               all alone. So he leaves a candle burning on the table beside 
               the stew, and moves up the stairs.

               EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

               The house is silent, fog rolling around it in the dawn.

               INT. FARMHOUSE - DAWN

               William has been awake all night, afraid to sleep. He rises, 
               and in QUICK CUTS: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops 
               at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed 
               bed. He moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, 
               also unrumpled.

               IN THE KITCHEN

               He finds the two cold bowls of stew, beside the exhausted 
               candle. He spoons up his own cold porridge, and eats alone.

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

               William is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the 
               hogs, while he glimpses something coming.

               THE BOY'S POV

               An ox cart is coming down the curving lane. Its driver is 
               Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers 
               glance up at William, their faces grim...

               From his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors 
               have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart 
               stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where 
               more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the 
               ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. The butt 
               of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         William... Come down here, lad.

               William looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... 
               but the bodies are still there.

               EXT. HOUSE - DAY

               It's now surrounded by horses, wagons, and neighbors. The 
               undertaker arrives in his hearse.

               INT. THE SHED - DAY

               On a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is 
               preparing them. Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the 
               head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes.

               Softly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and 
               brother. Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but 
               what can he say now? The undertaker goes on with his work.

               William approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to 
               him. He sees the wounds. The dried blood.

               The undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the 
               blood. But the wounds remain.

               EXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY

               CLOSE on a grave, with a headstone marked ANNE WALLACE. We 
               INCLUDE the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see 
               the mourners gathered before them. The sight of the boy, 
               standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as 
               the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes 
               into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken.

               The local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin.

               The farmers who were secretly gathered in Malcolm Wallace's 
               kitchen the previous night are now glancing at William; but 
               no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy.

               Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his 
               youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a 
               beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her 
               own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of 
               death and might suck her parents in too.

                                     PRIEST
                         ...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen.

               With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, 
               pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment 
               of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies.

               The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so 
               shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its 
               way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a 
               way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a 
               Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and 
               places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand.

               William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue 
               eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies.

               Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill 
               above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, 
               he looks like the grim reaper.

               The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches 
               in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE 
               WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, 
               permanently furious.

                                     PRIEST
                         You must be the relative of the 
                         deceased... William, this is your 
                         Uncle Argyle.

               Argyle glowers at the man, dismounts, and glares at William.

               William stares up at this frightening figure. They are 
               interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a 
               dozen mounted English soldiers, armed with lances, are 
               approaching. Argyle rattles to the priest...

                                     ARGYLE
                         You were wise to hurry.

               The soldiers ride right in among the mourners and stare down 
               from their saddles, haughty, menacing, their LEADER brusque.

                                     LEADER
                         Someone dead from this household?

                                     ARGYLE
                         We just had a funeral, isn't that 
                         what it means in England as well?

                                     LEADER
                         What it means in England -- and in 
                         Scotland too -- is that rebels have 
                         forfeited their lands. We were 
                         ambushed last night. But the Scots 
                         dragged their dead away.

                                     ARGYLE
                         My brother and nephew perished two 
                         days ago, when their hay cart turned 
                         over.

                                     LEADER
                         Then we'll just have a peek at the 
                         wounds.
                              (to his men)
                         Dig 'em up!

                                     ARGYLE
                         They've been sanctified and buried 
                         in the holy rites of God's church, 
                         and any hand that disturbs them now 
                         takes on eternal damnation. So please -- 
                         do it.

               Outmaneuvered, the leader reins his horse away. Several of 
               the farmers spit on the ground. Argyle glares at them.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Funeral's over. Go home.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               William and Argyle are sitting at the table, eating. Argyle 
               has laid out a proper meal, with exact place settings.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Not that spoon, that one's for soup. 
                         Dip away from you. And don't slurp.

               Argyle sits down and begins to dine with the boy.

                                     ARGYLE
                         We'll sleep here tonight. You'll 
                         come home with me. We'll let the 
                         house, and the lands too; plenty of 
                         willing neighbors.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't want to leave.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Didn't want your father to die either, 
                         did ya? But it happened.

               Argyle pushes his food away; he has no appetite now.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Did the priest say anything about 
                         the Resurrection? Or was it all about 
                         Judgment?

                                     WILLIAM
                         It was in Latin, sir.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Non loquis Latinum? You don't speak 
                         Latin? We have to fix that, won't 
                         we?
                              (beat)
                         Did he give the poetic benediction? 
                         The Lord bless thee and keep thee? 
                         Patris Benefactum et --
                              (beat)
                         ...It was Malcolm's favorite.

               INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Argyle knows nothing about tucking a boy in bed; he stands 
               awkwardly idle as William scrubs his face at the washstand 
               and crawls into bed.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Good night, Uncle.

               Argyle grunts and starts out. Then he stops, turns back, 
               leans down over William... and with great tenderness the 
               grizzled old uncle kisses his nephew on his hair.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Argyle sits by the hearth, staring at the embers. He holds 
               the huge broadsword that belonged to his brother. He looks 
               at the handle, like a cross. He whispers...

                                     ARGYLE
                         "The Lord bless thee and keep thee..."

               Tears of grief spill down the old man's cheeks.

               INT. THE HANGING BARN - IN WILLIAM'S DREAM

               Once again the boy stands in the doorway of the barn, looking 
               at the garish, hanged faces in his nightmare. Then a mangled 
               hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder, William 
               gasps, but the hand holds him gently. He turns to see his 
               father, and his brother! They are wounded, bloody, but they 
               smile at him; they're alive! Weeping in joy, William reaches 
               to hug them, but his father stretches forth a forbidding 
               hand.

               William keeps reaching out helplessly. His father and brother 
               move past him to the hanged knights. Two empty nooses are 
               there. Before the boy's weeping eyes they put their heads 
               into the nooses, and hoist themselves up.

               William's grief explodes; his tears erupt and

               HE WAKES IN HIS BEDROOM

               tears flooding down his face. A dream! Still upset, still 
               grieving, he gets up and goes looking for his uncle.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               William moves down to the room where his uncle would be 
               sleeping. He opens the door. The bed has been slept in -- 
               but his uncle is not there. He moves downstairs to

               THE KITCHEN

               But his uncle is not there either. Then William hears a 
               strange, haunting sound-distant, carried by the wind. He 
               moves to the window and sees only moonlight. He opens the 
               window and hears it more clearly: bagpipes. William lights a 
               candle and throws open the door. Wind rushes in, blowing out 
               his candle. But he hears the pipes, louder in the wind.

               EXT. WALLACE HOUSE - NIGHT

               William is barefoot and in only his nightshirt; but the sound 
               of the pipes is growing louder. He moves through the 
               moonlight, drawn toward -- the graveyard! He stops as he 
               realizes this, then forces himself on.

               EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

               William moves to the top of the hill where his ancestors are 
               buried, and discovers a haunting scene: two dozen men, the 
               farmer/warriors of his neighborhood, are gathered in kilts -- 
               and among them, a core of bagpipers. The pipes wail an ancient 
               Scottish dirge, a tune of grief and redemption, a melody 
               known to us as "Amazing Grace." Uncle Argyle has heard them 
               and walked out too; he stands at the fringes of the 
               torchlight, still holding the massive broadsword. He glances 
               down, noticing William as the boy moves up beside him. William 
               whispers...

                                     WILLIAM
                         What are they doing?

                                     ARGYLE
                         Saying goodbye in their own way -- 
                         in outlawed tartans, with outlawed 
                         pipes, playing outlawed tunes.

               The farmers file by the graveside, crossing themselves, each 
               whispering his own private prayer. Argyle whispers, half to 
               William, and half to himself...

                                     ARGYLE
                         Your Daddy and I, we saw our own 
                         father buried like this, dead from 
                         fighting the English.

               William takes the sword from his uncle, and tries to lift 
               it.

               Slowly, Argyle takes the sword back.

                                     ARGYLE
                         First learn to use this.

               He taps William on the temple with the tip of his finger.

                                     ARGYLE
                         Then I will teach you to use this.

               With an expert's easy fluidity, he lifts the huge sword. It 
               glistens in the torchlight. The music plays, the notes hanging 
               in the air, swirling in the Scottish breeze as if rising 
               towards the stars...

               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY

               William and his uncle ride off in a farm wagon. William has 
               a bundle of clothes in his lap, and glances at his uncle as 
               if afraid of his disapproval if he looks back. But he does 
               glance back just once, to see the deserted farmhouse.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - ROYAL WEDDING - DAY

               Amid the scarlet and ermine robes of officiating lords, with 
               gemstones sparkling everywhere, we hear...

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Twelve years later, Longshanks 
                         supervised the wedding of his eldest 
                         son, also named Edward, who would 
                         succeed him to the throne.

               LONGSHANKS, King of England, stands in the jeweled light of 
               the ancient Abbey. Known as Longshanks because of the spindly 
               legs that make him almost seven feet tall, he has a hawk's 
               nose and a snake's eyes, punctuating a face of distinct 
               cruelty. Historians of his day considered him and the line 
               of Plantagenets from which he came to be devil worshipers.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         As bride for his son, Longshanks had 
                         chosen a relative of his rival, the 
                         king of France.

               GENEVIEVE, a nineteen-year-old virgin of stupendous beauty 
               moves down the aisle, the light in her face outshining her 
               blindingly white wedding gown. As she reaches the altar her 
               hands tremble, but she maintains her poise and control.

               She looks toward EDWARD, Prince of Wales. Pampered young men 
               surround him as his retinue. He takes her hand coldly and 
               goes through the ceremony under his father's stare.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         It was widely whispered that for the 
                         Princess to conceive, Longshanks 
                         would have to do the honors himself. 
                         That may have been what he had in 
                         mind all along.

               The ceremony concluding, attendants lift back the bride's 
               veil. Her wedding day, the ultimate moment -- and Prince 
               Edward ignores her, to turn back to his friends. But prompted 
               by one of the sour lords, he leans over and pecks his new 
               Princess on the cheek. For an instant, we see in her eyes 
               that her heart is dying. But she keeps her poise.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Having seen to his obligations to 
                         provide for a successor, Longshanks 
                         set about his fondest business -- to 
                         crush Scotland, and turn his power 
                         against France...

               CLOSE - A MAP OF THE BRITISH ISLES

               Longshanks' narrow finger jabs Scotland.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Scotland! Scot-land!

               We are in the --

               INT. ROYAL ENGLISH PALACE - DAY

               Longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the 
               outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly 
               afraid of him.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         The French will grovel to anyone 
                         with strength! But how will they 
                         credit our strength when we cannot 
                         rule the whole of our own island?!

               He punches the map, then sees the Princess enter softly.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Where is my son?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to 
                         come in his stead.

               Longshanks' eyes expand in fury; it is frightening to see.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         I sent for him -- and the little 
                         coward send you?!

                                     PRINCESS
                         Shall I leave, M'lord?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         If he wants his queen to rule, then 
                         you stay and learn how! I will deal 
                         with him.

               He spins back toward his generals. Ignored, the princess 
               settles silently onto the cushions of the window seat.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Nobles are the key to the Scottish 
                         door. Grant their nobles land here 
                         in England. Give our own nobles 
                         estates in the north. Make them too 
                         greedy to oppose us.

               One OLD ADVISOR speaks up hesitantly.

                                     OLD ADVISOR
                         Sire... Our nobles will be reluctant 
                         to relocate. New lands mean new taxes, 
                         and they are taxed already for our 
                         war in France.

               Longshanks glares at him, but takes the point. The wheels 
               grind in his brain; his dark eyes falling on the Princess, 
               he is inspired.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Perhaps it's time to reinstitute an 
                         old custom. Grant them prima noctes, 
                         "First night." When any common girl 
                         inhabiting their lands is married, 
                         our lords shall have sexual rights 
                         to her on the night of her wedding. 
                         That should fetch just the kind of 
                         lords we want in Scotland.

               INT. PRINCE EDWARD'S ROYAL APARTMENTS - DAY

               The prince and a muscular young friend, PHILLIP, are stripped 
               to the waist and fencing. They pay no attention to the

               KNOCK, or to the Princess as she enters. She watches them -- 
               they are dancing more than fencing. Edward loses his sword; 
               it clatters to the polished floor. He looks up at his wife, 
               as if angry at her for having seen his clumsiness.

                                     EDWARD
                         What is it?!

                                     PRINCESS
                         You directed me to report to you the 
                         moment the king's conference was 
                         ended.

                                     EDWARD
                         So I did! And what was so important 
                         about it?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Scotland. He intends --

               But Edward and his friend are fencing again, the clanging of 
               their blunted swords so loud that she can't hear herself.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He intends to grant --

               Edward loses his weapon again, and whirls on her.

                                     EDWARD
                         Shut up, would you! How can I 
                         concentrate?!

                                     PRINCESS
                         ...His majesty was quite keen that 
                         you should understand --

                                     EDWARD
                         All so very boring! He wants me to 
                         learn to fight too, so let me do it!

               For an instant, anger flares into her eyes. She glances at 
               Edward, and at the young man with him, then lowers her eyes 
               and starts to back out. But Edward has noticed.

                                     EDWARD
                         Stop there.

               She stops, but does not raise her eyes.

                                     EDWARD
                         Do you disapprove of Phillip?

               He lifts his hand and draws his friend Phillip to his side.

               Still the Princess does not lift her eyes.

                                     PRINCESS
                              (barely audible)
                         No, M'lord.

                                     EDWARD
                         Look at me. I said LOOK AT ME!

               She lifts her eyes. But she could not brace herself enough 
               for what she sees: Edward nuzzling Phillip, the prince's 
               bare chest to his muscular friend's bare back, both men 
               glistening with sweat and sexual excitement.

               The Princess's eyes quiver... but she does not look away.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, my flower, do you understand?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Yes. I had thought that... I was 
                         loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I 
                         may be excused, M'lord.

                                     EDWARD
                         You may.

               She starts to leave, as quietly as she came. But her husband 
               calls after her.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't worry, m'Lady, it is my royal 
                         responsibility to breed. And I assure 
                         you, when the time comes, I shall... 
                         manage.

               She closes the door softly, on her husband and his lover.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Now in Edinburgh were gathered the 
                         council of Scottish nobles...

               ESTABLISHING COUNCIL - DAY

               The picturesque heart of Scotland, with its CASTLE on a fairy 
               tale plateau above the Firth of Forth.

               INT. EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY

               The nobles are gathered around a huge table. They rise at 
               the entrance of young ROBERT THE BRUCE, a handsome young 
               man, full of intelligence and power.

                                     VOICE OVER
                         Among these was Robert, the 17th 
                         Earl of Bruce, a leading contender 
                         for the crown of Scotland.

               Robert strides to his seat in the center of the table, and 
               the others settle in respectfully. MORNAY, another young 
               warrior, gives him a bow, as does CRAIG, a grizzled noble.

                                     CRAIG
                         Young Robert, we are honored --

                                     ROBERT
                         My father hears that Longshanks has 
                         granted prima noctes.

                                     CRAIG
                         Clearly meant to draw more of his 
                         supporters here.

                                     MORNAY
                         The Balliol clan has endorsed the 
                         right, licking Longshanks' boots so 
                         he will support their claim to the 
                         throne. If we make a show of 
                         opposition, the commoners will favor 
                         us.

                                     ROBERT
                         It is too soon to step out alone. My 
                         father believes we must lull 
                         Longshanks into confidence, by neither 
                         supporting his decree nor opposing 
                         it.

                                     CRAIG
                         A wise plan. And how is your father? 
                         We have missed him at the council.

                                     ROBERT
                         He strained his leg so that it pains 
                         him to ride. But he sends his 
                         greetings -- and says that I speak 
                         for all the Bruces. And for Scotland.

               EXT. SCOTTISH VILLAGE, AT THE EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

               Flutes and dancing; laughter and garlands; village families 
               have gathered for a wedding celebration -- we see the happy 
               bride and groom. Farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of 
               cheese; villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of 
               smoked fish.

               And watching the people are ubiquitous English soldiers, 
               battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears.

               Riding along the road comes William Wallace. Grown now, a 
               man. He sits his horse as if born there, his back straight, 
               his hands relaxed on the reins. He has a look of lean, rippled 
               power. He looks dangerous.

               And the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes.

               He carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he 
               stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the 
               scene. Farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing 
               handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the 
               traditional Highland games -- and everyone is noticing 
               William's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters 
               of marriageable age.

               Among those watching William arrive is Campbell, grown older 
               now; and with his old rebel friend, MacClannough. William 
               dismounts and ties his horse to a willow. One of the English 
               SOLDIERS shoves William from behind.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Hey boy! You hunt this bird?

               William's eyes fix themselves on the soldier.

                                     SOLDIER
                         It's against the law for Scots to 
                         own bows. You shot this bird?

               His buddies, enjoying their role as intimidators, grab the 
               bird and begin to search it for evidence.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I hit it in the head. With a rock.

               They don't believe that -- but they can't find any puncture 
               wound on the bird. William reaches his hand out for the return 
               of the bird. The soldiers drop it onto the ground.

               Slowly, William picks it up, and heads into the clearing.

               The farmers watch him come.

               Among those noticing William's arrival, but pretending not 
               to, is MARION MacCLANNOUGH, grown now into a stunning young 
               woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long 
               ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her 
               back. Her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a 
               wildflower. She's the most beautiful girl in the village, 
               maybe in all of Scotland, and the soldiers who hassled William 
               notice her too.

               William reaches the food table and contributes his goose to 
               the feast. FARM WOMEN eye him; he nodes to one.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Miz MacDougal. You look well.

                                     FARM WOMAN
                         ...William? It's William Wallace, 
                         back home! -- Have you met my 
                         daughter?

               The daughter mentioned is missing teeth. William nods to 
               her. It's impossible for him to giver her a smile as bright 
               as her hopes, and she lowers her head in disappointment. But 
               then raises her face in surprise as William takes her hand 
               and gives her a respectful bow.

               He moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like 
               a stranger. Then he glances toward the knot of girls. He 
               sees Marion. She sees him, then looks away. Do they remember 
               each other? He moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes 
               downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him.

               They move closer and closer together. Just as they are about 
               to reach each other, a huge round stone THUMPS to the earth 
               at Williams' feet.

               He looks up to see one of Marion's suitors -- the broad, 
               muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in William's 
               way. Now everybody's looking to see how William will handle 
               the challenge. He tries to move around, but the guy cuts him 
               off. Then William thinks he recognizes the big red-head.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Hamish?

               It is his old friend, but Hamish won't admit it, or be put 
               off from the challenge. He points to the huge stone.

                                     HAMISH
                         Test of manhood.

                                     WILLIAM
                         You win.

                                     HAMISH
                              (blocks him)
                         Call it a test of soldiery, then. 
                         The English won't let us train with 
                         weapons, so we train with stones.

                                     WILLIAM
                         The test of a soldier is not in his 
                         arm. It's here.

               He taps his temple. Hamish stretches out his hand, as if to 
               show William something in his palm.

                                     HAMISH
                         No. It's here.

               With a sudden movement, he slams his fist into William's 
               jaw, dropping him. A few men move to interfere, but Campbell, 
               MacClannough, and the other farmers who are the true leaders 
               here, stop their neighbors from interrupting. Hamish stands 
               over William, waiting for him to get up.

                                     WILLIAM
                         A contest, then.

               William stands and hoists the huge stone, eighteen inches in 
               diameter. Straining with the effort, he lugs the stone to 
               the line scratched in the rocky field. Beyond the line are 
               the muddy dents from previous tosses. William takes a run 
               and heaves the stone. It flies past the other marks in the 
               field; people are impressed. William looks at Hamish.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I still say this is no test. A 
                         catapult can throw a stone farther 
                         than a man can.

                                     HAMISH
                         That depends on the man.

               Hamish walks out, lifts the stone, and lugs it back to the 
               line. He takes a run and heaves with a great groan! The stone 
               flies, passing William's mark by a couple of feet.

               People laugh and whistle. William nods, impressed.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Can you do it when it matters? As it 
                         matters in battle? Could you crush a 
                         man with that throw?

                                     HAMISH
                         I could crush you like a roach.

               William walks to the dent made by Hamish's throw.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Then do it. Come, do it.

               Hamish scowls at William, at everybody watching. He lifts 
               the stone and carries it back to the line. William stands 
               calmly. Hamish backs up for his run. William yawns.

                                     HAMISH
                         You'll move

                                     WILLIAM
                         I will not.

               Hamish backs up a few more feet, for a longer run.

                                     FARMER STEWART
                         That's not fair!

                                     CAMPBELL
                         He's tired, he should get a longer 
                         run.

               William seems completely unafraid. He leans down, picks up a 
               small smooth stone and tosses it up in the air casually.

               Stung by this show of calm, Hamish takes furious run, and 
               heaves! The stone flies through the air, just misses William's 
               head, and buries itself halfway into the earth behind him. 
               William never flinches. The people cheer.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Brave show!

               Hamish is miffed; it's like William won.

                                     HAMISH
                         I threw longer than last time!

                                     CAMPBELL
                         An ox is strong, but not clever.

                                     HAMISH
                         An ox is stupid enough to just stand 
                         in one place.

                                     WILLIAM
                         That's not the point.

               William turns, walks double the distance Hamish threw, and 
               turns and hurls the rock he holds! It whistles through the 
               air, hits Hamish in the forehead, and drops him like a shot.

                                     WILLIAM
                         That is.

               Everybody cheers and laughs! They surround William.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         A fine display, young Wallace!

               William takes a tankard of ale from a farmer, walks over and 
               tosses the cold liquid into Hamish's face; he wakes, and, 
               his eyes uncrossing, accepts William's hand, pulling him up.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Good to see you again.

                                     HAMISH
                         I should'a remembered the eggs.

               Grinning, they embrace. MUSIC plays, the dancing begins.

               William walks to the knot of young ladies... but passes 
               Marion, and moves to the girl with the missing teeth.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Would you honor me with a dance?

               She's thrilled to accept; they begin to dance.

                                     GIRL
                         You've taken over your father's farm?
                              (beat)
                         They say he died long ago. Fighting 
                         the English.

                                     WILLIAM
                         He died in an accident, with my 
                         brother. Their cart turned over.

               The musicians interrupt their playing; a group of heavily 
               armed horsemen, with banners and flying colors, ride up, 
               reining their horses into the middle of the celebration. In 
               the middle of the group is an English NOBLEMAN; he is gray, 
               in his fifties, and stops in front of the BRIDE and groom.

                                     NOBLEMAN
                         I have come to claim the right of 
                         prima noctes. As the lord of these 
                         lands, I will bless this marriage by 
                         taking the bride into my bed on the 
                         first night of her union.

               Stewart, father of the BRIDE, lunges forward.

                                     STEWART
                         No, by God!

               The horsemen point their lances at the unarmed Scots -- who 
               see that the English soldiers from the village have moved to 
               the edge of the gathering, as if to dare any resistance.

                                     NOBLEMAN
                         It is my noble right.

               Even unarmed, Stewart is about to attack -- but the bride 
               intervenes. She grabs her father and whispers to him. She 
               moves to her husband and does the same. Holding back tears, 
               she allows herself to be pulled up behind one of the horsemen. 
               Marion MacClannough is looking on, sobered by her friend's 
               courage and sickened by her fate -- and Marion is even more 
               unsettled as she notices that one of the soldiers, a 
               particularly nasty looking brute with a scarred face, is 
               leering at her. William Wallace sees this too.

               The noble and his escorts ride away, and as they do it begins 
               to rain. The celebration destroyed, the Scots gather the 
               food and disperse to their homes. But Wallace remains, 
               standing in the downpour, keeping his thoughts to himself.

               EXT. THE WALLACE FARMHOUSE - MAGIC HOUR

               The farmhouse looks lonely and forlorn. William stands at 
               the open door, and gazes out at the rain; it leaks on him, 
               through his roof; he doesn't seem to notice.

               EXT. THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR

               A thatched cottage, lit with a cozy fire, beneath the rain.

               A hand KNOCKS on the door, and MacClannough opens it to find 
               William, on a horse! MacClannough frowns.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Good evening, sir. May I speak with 
                         your daughter?

               Mrs. MacClannough shoulders up beside her husband, and Marion 
               appears behind her scowling parents.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Marion... Would you like to go for a 
                         ride on this fine evening?

                                     MOTHER
                         The boy's insane!

                                     WILLIAM
                         It's good Scottish weather, Madam, 
                         the rain is fallin' straight down.

                                     MOTHER
                         She absolutely may not, she'll -- 
                         Marion!

               Marion has grabbed a cloak off the back of the door; she 
               runs out to hop up behind William, and they gallop away.

               THE RIDE - MAGIC HOUR

               William and Marion race along the heather, up and down hills, 
               through swollen streams. The rain stops, as the sun sets; 
               the Scottish mists lift, revealing stunning natural beauty.

               William stops the horse and they look out over it all 
               together. He speaks, without turning to face her.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Your father doesn't like me, does 
                         he?

                                     MARION
                         It's not you. He dislikes that you're 
                         a Wallace. He just says... the 
                         Wallaces don't seem to live for very 
                         long.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Thank you for accepting.

                                     MARION
                         Thank you for inviting.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'll invite you again, but your mother 
                         thinks I'm crazy.

                                     MARION
                         You are. And I'll come again.

               He lingers; he wants to say something, or maybe he just 
               doesn't want the moment to end. Finally he spurs the horse.

               EXT. THE MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT

               They reach the door. William hops off the horse and reaches 
               up to help her down the moment she touches the ground, they 
               look into each other's eyes... but the door is snatched open 
               so quickly by her mother that there is not time for a kiss.

                                     MOTHER
                         Marion, come in!

               He walks her closer to the door. They turn and look at each 
               other again. She waits for him to kiss her...

                                     MOTHER
                         Marion, come in!

               She still hesitates; he isn't going to kiss her. She starts 
               in, but he grabs her hand. And into it he puts something he 
               has taken from his pocket; it is wrapped in flannel. He hops 
               on his horse, glances at her, and gallops away.

               She stands in the open doorway; she looks down at what he 
               left her. She unwraps the flannel; it is a dried thistle, 
               the one she gave him years before.

               EXT. WALLACE FARM - DAY

               William is re-thatching the roof of his barn, when he hears 
               riders approaching, and looks down to see that it is 
               MacClannough, backed by Campbell and Hamish. Uh-oh.

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         Young Wallace --

                                     WILLIAM
                         Sir, I know it was strange of me to 
                         invite Marion to ride last night. I 
                         assure you, I --

                                     CAMPBELL
                         MacClannough's daughter is another 
                         matter. We come to fetch you to a 
                         meeting.

                                     WILLIAM
                         What kind of meeting?

                                     CAMPBELL
                         The secret kind.

               William goes back to repairing his roof.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Your father was a fighter. And a 
                         patriot.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I know who my father was. I came 
                         back home to raise crops. And, God 
                         willing, a family. If I can live in 
                         peace, I will.

               Campbell shakes his head and reins his horse away, with 
               Hamish. MacClannough lingers.

                                     MACCLANNOUGH
                         If you can keep your intention to 
                         stay out of the troubles, you may 
                         court my daughter. If you break your 
                         intention, I'll kill you.

               MacClannough rides away. William sits down on the roof, and 
               looks out at the graves of his father and brother.

               EXT. MACCLANNOUGH HOUSE - NIGHT

               Outside the half-timbered house, William stands in the shadows 
               of moonlight and tosses a pebble against the wooden upper 
               window. Marion opens the shutters and slips out onto the 
               vines, dropping into William's arms.

               Giggling, suppressing laughter, they run to the trees...

               SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - NIGHT

               Hand in hand through the heather they run, silhouettes along 
               a ridge, their breath blowing silver clouds in the moonlight, 
               the Scottish wind whipping through their hair.

               They stop at a grove at the edge of a precipice, overlooking 
               a loch gleaming in the moonlight. So beautiful it's sacred.

                                     MARION
                         You've been here before?

                                     WILLIAM
                         Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly 
                         dreams I don't want. I started riding 
                         at night to fill up my mind so that 
                         when I did sleep I'd dream only of 
                         the ride and the adventure.

                                     MARION
                         Did it work?

                                     WILLIAM
                         No. You don't choose your dreams. 
                         Your dreams choose you.

               He looks at her. They kiss suddenly, so long and hard that 
               they tumble into the heather, rolling, devouring each other.

               Through their passion...

                                     WILLIAM
                         I want... to marry you!

                                     MARION
                         I... accept your proposal!

                                     WILLIAM
                         I'm not just saying it!

                                     MARION
                         Nor I!

                                     WILLIAM
                         But I won't give you up to any 
                         nobleman.

                                     MARION
                              (stopping)
                         You scare me.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I don't want to scare you. I want to 
                         be yours, and you mine. Every night 
                         like this one.

                                     MARION
                         This night is too beautiful to have 
                         again.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I will be with you, like this. 
                         Forever.

               They kiss again...

               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - DAY

               Marion moves through the market. English soldiers admire her 
               as she walks. She stops, looking at white lace and cloth.

               William casually passes, poking a note in her basket. Subtly 
               she withdraws his note, and reads:

               INSERT - HIS NOTE

               Tonight. By the trees.

               EXT. MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Marion slips out of the house and runs to the trees, where 
               William waits with horses. She fetches a bundle she's stashed 
               in the crook of a tree, and they mount and ride off.

               EXT. RUINS OF AN ANCIENT CHURCH - NIGHT

               The church is at the base of the precipice, beside the loch.

               INT. THE CHURCH - NIGHT

               This ancient Gaelic place of worship has been destroyed by 
               the occupying army, and yet it looks devoutly holy this way, 
               lit only by candles and moonlight through the open roof. The 
               village PRIEST whom we saw at the wedding celebration is 
               waiting at the altar. Marion steps into the confessional, as 
               William moves to the altar and kneels in prayer.

               Marion emerges; she's changed into the wedding dress she 
               made from the cloth she bought. William stands and watches 
               her float down the aisle; his whole life was worth this 
               moment.

               Together, the two lovers turn to the priest.

                                     PRIEST
                         You have come to pledge, each to the 
                         other, before Almighty God.

               From within his shirt, William withdraws a strip of cloth 
               woven in his family tartan. He and Marion each lift a hand 
               to the priest, and he binds their wrists with the cloth.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I will love you my whole life. You 
                         and no other.

               From her dress she takes a handmade handkerchief, embroidered 
               with a thistle to look like the one she first gave him those 
               years ago.

                                     MARION
                         And I you. You and no other. Forever.

               The Priest waits for them to go on, but neither can; they're 
               too taken with emotion, looking at each other. The Priest 
               intones holy phrases...

                                     PRIEST
                         Agus bhayd lauch... The Lord bless 
                         and keep thy love, now and forever.

               The lovers kiss. As they break their embrace, a figure 
               carrying something dark and spiky appears at the broken door 
               of the church, and William spins as if to attack, but the 
               Priest catches his arm; they see the man carries bagpipes.

                                     PRIEST
                         I trust him -- or I'd'a killed him 
                         me'self. A weddin' needs pipes.

               The piper begins to play, and the tune from his primitive 
               chanter is wispy, ethereal, beautiful. The lovers look into 
               each other's eyes, as the single melody of the pipes merges 
               into a swell of music, UNDERSCORING MONTAGE

               William and Marion ride the path to the top of the precipice, 
               where, in the shelter of the grove, they spend their 
               honeymoon. The MUSIC CONTINUES as, still sweaty from their 
               love-making, he returns her to her house just before dawn.

               She waves from her window, as William rides away, as we

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. VILLAGE OF LANARK - DAY

               It's Market Day in the village, busy with Highlanders, 
               merchants of all kinds, and a few special attractions like 
               jugglers and fortune tellers. Marion moves along a table 
               full of flowers and fruit... William, concealed behind hanging 
               baskets, watches her unseen, savoring the beauty of his 
               beloved, bathing his soul in the sight of her. Then she looks 
               up and spots him, her smile sudden and luminous, before she 
               remembers to conceal it. He moves up beside her.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I've missed you.

                                     MARION
                         Shush. It's only been a day.
                              (beat)
                         And it's seemed like forever.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Tonight then.

                                     MARION
                         My parents are growing suspicious! I 
                         can't keep meeting you every night!

               Playfully he pokes his finger under the collar of her dress, 
               pulling up the strip of checked cloth he gave her at their 
               wedding, which she now wears hidden around her neck.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Then when?

                                     MARION
                         ...Tonight!

               Tucking in the cloth strip, she hurries away, smiling.

               ANGLE - DRUNKEN ENGLISH SOLDIERS - BY AN ALE CASK - DAY

               They spot Marion moving through the fair, glowing, beautiful.

               The soldiers smirk at each other; as Marion passes, one of 
               them grabs her wrist. It's the soldier with the scar, the 
               one who's been staring at her.

                                     SOLDIER
                         Where are you going... lass?

                                     MARION
                         Let go.

               A second drunken SOLDIER pipes up.

                                     SOLDIER #2
                         Why don't you marry my friend here? 
                         Then I'll take the first night!

               The scarred soldier pulls Marion into his big arms; she shoves 
               him away with surprising strength, and he staggers back, to 
               the laughter of his friends. Then he snatches her again and 
               kisses her hard on the lips.

               She breaks free and SLAPS him fiercely, hard enough to draw 
               blood from his mouth. Tasting the trickle, he slings her 
               down against sacks of grain, and the soldiers are all over 
               her, pinning her down, ripping her clothes, a full scale 
               public gang rape. As the townspeople try to move in the three 
               soldiers waiting their turn at Marion pull their knives, 
               keep them townspeople back.

                                     SOLDIER #1
                         Bitch, who do you think you are?

               He slams his mouth down against hers for a long, awful time, 
               comes up clawing at her dress to rip it from her body... and 
               is hit in the face by a rock thrown at great speed!

               It takes a moment for the other soldiers to realize what 
               just happened, and in that instant William is on them. He 
               wrenches one soldier's arm in a direction it was never meant 
               to go, breaking the elbow, separating the shoulder, and 
               slinging the howling soldier into his comrades.

               Two of the soldiers leap at William, swinging their short 
               swords; William ducks, knocking their ale cask into their 
               knees; William lifts the whole table where they were sitting 
               and slams it into the faces of two more attackers.

                                     MARION
                         William!

               She shouts to warn him that the scarred soldier, now 
               bloodyfaced, has recovered from the rock and is behind William 
               with a knife. William sidesteps the first thrust, snatches a 
               leg from the shattered table and crushes the man's skull.

                                     MARKET WOMEN
                         Wallace Wallace! William Wallace!

               But there's no time for celebration. There's blood and ale 
               everywhere, and the fallen soldiers are yelling...

                                     FALLEN SOLDIER
                         Rebels! Help!

               MORE SOLDIERS hear the call and come running, reinforcements 
               converging from all over the village.

                                     VILLAGE FOLKS
                         Run, William! Run!

               Will sees the horse that pulled the flower cart and throws 
               Marion up onto its back. He slaps the horse's rump and it 
               plunges with Marion into the twisting village lanes. William 
               darts off through the crowd, as the MAGISTRATE and more of 
               his soldiers arrive -- dozens of them!

               William pauses out in the central street of the village, 
               just long enough to be sure they've spotted him, and darts 
               into a side lane in the opposite direction Marion went; 
               William weaves through the narrow streets of the medieval 
               town, knocking over baskets, jumping carts.

               As the soldiers stumble after him, the Magistrate looks down 
               at his mangled soldiers. The one with the ruptured arm is 
               lying in agony.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         What happened?

                                     SOLDIER
                         ...girl.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         What girl?!

                                     SOLDIER
                         ...on horse.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         The girl on the horse! Stop her!

               The shout rings through the village; Marion hears it, and 
               when she sees more soldiers at the far end of the lane she's 
               trying to take out of town, she urges the horse into an even 
               narrower back alley. She sees a clear route to freedom...

               But the flock of pigeons pecking on the scraps thrown there 
               behind the shops rise into the horse's face with a sudden 
               thrashing of wings, and the horse shies against a wall.

               Marion controls him, but a flap of her ripped dress has caught 
               on a crude nail, and as the frightened horse lunges forward 
               again, she is pulled off its bare back, her dress catching 
               and ripping at the same time, dropping her hard.

               WILLIAM

               reaches the edge of the town and slips into the trees by the 
               river; the soldiers are running every which way, but they've 
               lost him. Thinking Marion's made it too, William heads deeper 
               into the trees.

               IN THE TOWN, MARION

               recovers; her dress has torn free! She starts to get up; but 
               the soldiers' pikes appear over her, and the magistrate leers.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         So this is the little whore he was 
                         fighting for.

               EXT. THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY

               William moves into the shelters of the trees, expecting to 
               see Marion. He doesn't. He listens; only the rustling of the 
               wind through the treetops.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Marion!

               Nothing, except the wind.

               INT. ROYAL MAGISTRATE'S HEADQUARTERS - DAY

               Marion is thrown into a chair and her arms are bound with an 
               oak staff behind her elbows. She and two dozen soldiers are 
               in the tavern the English have commandeered.

               The Magistrate is a battlescarred veteran, a brutal pragmatist 
               angry with his CORPORAL.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         One Scot buggers six of us? Hell to 
                         pay when that gets round.

                                     CORPORAL
                         Burn the village.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         But he is free. You never catch 'em 
                         in the Highlands.

               He studies Marion, her mouth now stuffed with burlap. He 
               notices the strip of cloth around her neck, and touches the 
               weave curiously.

                                     CORPORAL
                         Clans weave that cloth in their own 
                         patterns.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         So why is this strip concealed?
                              (beat)
                         He fought for you, eh?

               EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

               The Magistrate and his men bring Marion into the village 
               center, and tie her to a post of the well. The townspeople 
               don't want to be near the soldiers, but they hang on the 
               fringes of the square, too curious to pull away.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         An assault on the king's soldiers is 
                         the same as assaulting the king!

               He looks down at Marion, her mouth bound, her eyes defiant.

               He jerks out his dagger and slices Marion's throat!

               Her eyes spring open like a doe's; then she sags, dead. The 
               townspeople are speechless; even some of the soldiers are 
               shocked. The Magistrate turns calmly to his men.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Now. Let this scrapper come to me.

               LONG SHOT - EXT. THE GROVE AT THE PRECIPICE - DAY

               From a distance, we see Hamish approaching the grove, the 
               same one where he and William played as boys. Hamish moves 
               reluctantly, forcing himself forward; as he reaches the grove, 
               William appears, hurrying out to him.

               We STAY IN THE LONG SHOT, seeing William asking anxiously 
               for any news, and seeing Hamish's great shoulders as he tells 
               him something that makes William step backwards...

               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - DAY

               At a barrier across the main road into the center of the 
               village are twenty professional soldiers, entrenched, fully 
               armed -- bows, pikes, swords. They hear A HORSE'S SNORT...

               THE ENGLISH SOLDIERS' POV - WALLACE, ON HIS HORSE

               He has stopped, rock still. The soldiers hush; there is 
               something unsettling about this man alone, staring at the 
               twenty of them, as if to steel himself for the butchery.

               Wallace raises his sword, screams... and charges!

               EXT. VARIOUS ANGLES - LANARK VILLAGE - DAY - THE FIGHT

               We FAVOR WALLACE'S SUBJECTIVE POV: the barrier as his horse 
               pounds toward it, the faces of the enemy soldiers with their 
               eyes white with fear... They stand to shoot at him with their 
               bows; the arrows WHISH toward the lens, fly past...

               The arrows tear through Wallace's clothes, but don't catch 
               his flesh. He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as 
               Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's 
               more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly 
               breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the 
               corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head!

               The soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his 
               horse leaps over them. One of them has sighted William's 
               back... But Hamish and his father crash into them! It's a 
               wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder 
               but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two 
               men -- and more Scots arrive! They overwhelm the soldiers.

               WALLACE RACES THROUGH THE VILLAGE - FAVORING HIS POV

               He dodges obstacles in the narrow streets -- chickens, carts, 
               barrels. Soldiers pop up; the first he gallops straight over; 
               the next he whacks forehand, like a polo player; the next 
               chops down on his left side; every time he swings the 
               broadsword, a man dies.

               Wallace gallops on; his farmer neighbors, and people from 
               the village, follow in his wake.

               EXT. IN THE VILLAGE - DAY

               The Magistrate hears the APPROACHING SHOUTS. He and thirty 
               more of his men are barricaded around the village square.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Don't look surprised! We knew he'd 
                         bring friends!

               The see Wallace gallop into sight; but he stops, then heads 
               down a side street.

               The Magistrate and his men don't like this; where did he go?

               Which way will he come from? And then they hear the horses, 
               and see the other Scots, at the head of the main street. The 
               soldiers unleash a volley of arrows at them.

               They are loading to fire again when Wallace runs in -- on 
               foot! -- and cuts down two soldiers! The other Scots charge!

               The startled soldiers break and run in every direction.

               The Magistrate, abandoned, runs too. Wallace pursues.

               Not far along a twisting lane, the bulky Magistrate falters.

               He turns to fight, and Wallace slashes away his sword.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         No! I beg you... mercy!

               IN THE TOWN SQUARE

               As the Scots see Wallace, they break off pursuing the English 
               soldiers and stop to watch; dragging the Magistrate by his 
               hair, Wallace hauls him back into the village square, slams 
               him against the well, and stands over him with heaving lungs 
               and wild eyes, staring at Marion's murderer.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Please. Mercy!

               Wallace's eyes shift, falling on

               THE STAIN OF BLOOD

               Marion's blood, in a dark dry splash by the wall of the well, 
               the stain dripping down onto the dirt of the street. Wallace 
               spins, jerks back the Magistrate's head, and cuts his throat 
               with the sword.

               ON THE OTHER SCOTS

               Silenced by what they've just seen and done. On old Campbell's 
               face is a look of reverence, and awe.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Say Grace to God, lads. We've just 
                         seen the coming of the Messiah.

               William staggers a few steps, and collapses to his knees.

               And then not just the Scottish farmers but the townspeople 
               too begin a strange, Hi-Lo chant.

                                     CROWD
                         AHHHHHHH-UHHHHHH! AHHHHHH-UHHHHHH!

               William's wild eyes slowly regain their focus. And there in 
               the dirt beside the well, he sees the severed cloth strip he 
               gave to Marion, now stained with her blood. He lifts it, 
               crushes it in his hand, as the Highlanders chant for war.

               EXT. LANARK VILLAGE - NIGHT

               The villagers are still excited by what just happened; at 
               the blacksmith's forge, men tend to Campbell's wound...

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Pour it straight into the wound. I 
                         know it seems a waste of good whiskey, 
                         but indulge me.

               They obey, then take a glowing poker from the fire and run 
               it through Campbell's shoulder, where the arrow went. There 
               is a terrible SIZZLE, and Campbell reacts to the pain.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Ah. Now that'll clear your sinuses, 
                         lads.

               Campbell looks down at his left hand. His thumb is missing!

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Well bloody Hell, look at this! Now 
                         it's nothing but a fly swatter.

               Wallace is sitting alone nearby, staring at nothing. Hamish 
               moves over and puts a hand on his shoulder. Wallace looks at 
               his friend, and looks away; killing the Magistrate did not 
               bring Marion back.

               SHOUTS of alarm: ARMED MEN are coming! The farmers scramble 
               for their weapons, ready to fight; even Campbell jumps up; 
               but what they see coming out of the darkness are twenty more 
               farmers, with hayhooks, knives, axes, anything they could 
               find for weapons. Their leader is MacGREGOR.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         MacGregor -- from the next valley!

               MacGregor leads his men into the circle of rebels.

                                     MACGREGOR
                         We heard about what was happenin'. 
                         And we don't want ya thinkin' ya can 
                         have your fun without us.

                                     WALLACE
                         Go home. Some of us are in this, I 
                         can't help that now. But you can 
                         help yourselves. Go home.

                                     MACGREGOR
                         We'll have no homes left when the 
                         English garrison at the castle comes 
                         through to burn us out.

               They all look at Wallace.

               EXT. ENGLISH MILITARY STRONGHOLD - NIGHT

               Furious preparations: armorers pound breastplates, hone 
               spears, grind swords in a shower of sparks. The garrison is 
               led by BOTTOMS, the English lord who claimed the right of 
               prima noctes. Now he shouts to his scurrying soldiers.

                                     LORD BOTTOMS
                         Gather the horses! Align the infantry!
                              (grabs a man)
                         Ride to the Lord Governor in Stirling.

               Tell him that I will hang five rebels for every good 
               Englishman killed! FORM FOR MARCH!

               The troops begin to scramble into the courtyard. At the same 
               time, the messenger gallops to the gate and nods for the 
               keepers to open it. They pull up the chains and the heavy 
               gate rises. The messenger spurs his horse to gallop through -- 
               and is hit in the chest with an axe!

               The Scots, hidden just outside the gate, come pouring through, 
               led by Wallace! Arrows pick soldiers from their perches, 
               Scots drop over the wall; the surprise is so complete that 
               it's over almost without a fight. Lord Bottoms looks around 
               in confusion...

                                     LORD BOTTOMS
                         Stop them... Don't let... Align...

               Scots drag Lord Bottoms off his horse; an arrow in a flexed 
               bow jabs right up to his eye, the archer ready to drive the 
               shaft through Bottom's eye socket and into his brain; but 
               Wallace's hand closes on the archer's fingers -- and Bottoms 
               sees that the archer at the other end of the arrow shaft is 
               none other than the Highland farmgirl he forced into his bed 
               on her wedding night. Beside her is her husband, holding a 
               scythe, red with English blood.

                                     WALLACE
                         On your way somewhere, M'lord?

                                     LORD BOTTOMS
                         Murdering bloody bandit!

               The point of Wallace's sword jumps beneath the Lord's chin.

                                     WALLACE
                         My name is William Wallace. I am no 
                         bandit who hides his face... Find 
                         this man a horse.

               The green eyes of the defiled highland bride flash fire.

               William takes his hand from her bow and looks at her, grief 
               for Marion in his eyes; for the sake of that she does not 
               release the string.

                                     WALLACE
                         Give him a horse.

               Hamish extends the reins of the Lord's thoroughbred.

                                     WALLACE
                         Not this horse. That one.

               He nods to a bony nag hitched next to a glue pot.

                                     WALLACE
                         Today we will spare you, and every 
                         man who has yielded. Go back to 
                         England. Tell them Scotland's 
                         daughters and her sons are yours no 
                         more. Tell them Scotland is free.

               As the Scots cheer, Wallace throws Lord Bottoms onto the 
               nag's back and slaps the horse's rear. IT shambles away, 
               followed by the English survivors, as the Scots chant...

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace, Wal-lace, Wal-lace!...

               CLOSE - A GRAVESTONE - EXT. HIGHLANDS - DAY

               The marker is carved with the name MARION MacCLANNOUGH, and 
               beneath her name A THISTLE is chiseled into the stone.

               Bagpipes wail like banshees and the Priest who married Marion 
               and William now mutters ancient prayers as her body, wrapped 
               in burial canvas, is lowered into the earth, under the sad 
               eyes of those who just fought in the battle.

               Opposite William stands old MacClannough; he stares across 
               the open hole that accepts the body of his daughter, his 
               eyes full of pain, and then staggers away.

               Wallace kneels at the graveside in unspeakable grief. From 
               within his shirt he withdraws the embroidered handkerchief 
               she gave him, and the bloodstained strip of cloth he gave 
               her. He places the strip over her heart, and as the 
               gravediggers fill the hole her returns the handkerchief to 
               its spot over his own heart.

               EXT. LONDON PALACE - DAY

               Prince Edward is in his garden, playing the medieval version 
               of croquet with his friend. The Princess, ignored, sits 
               watching. Longshanks marches through the game, furious.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Scottish rebels have routed Lord 
                         Bottoms!

                                     EDWARD
                         I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, 
                         nothing more.

               Longshanks slaps his son, knocking him down among the colored 
               balls and wickets. Everyone gasps, stunned.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You weak little coward! Stand up!

               Longshanks jerks him to his feet.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         I go to France to press our rights 
                         there! I leave you to handle this 
                         little rebellion, do you understand? 
                         DO YOU?!

               Longshanks grabs his son by the throat.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         And turn yourself into a man.

               The king leaves. The friends of the humiliated Prince hurry 
               to him and lift him; as the Princess moves to him too...

                                     EDWARD
                         Get away from me!

               He slaps her! Her personal guards, Frenchmen in distinctive 
               uniforms, jump from their seats at the edge of the garden, 
               but the Princess raises a hand to show she needs no 
               assistance, and curtseys to Edward, who shouts --

                                     EDWARD
                         Convene my military council!

               As Edward marches off with his entourage, NICOLETTE, a 
               beautiful raven-haired Handmaiden, rushes to the Princess, 
               who is wobbly, hurt more than she let show. Nicolette whispers 
               to her in French, with subtitles...

                                     NICOLETTE
                         They say this Wallace killed thirty 
                         men to avenge the death of his woman. 
                         I hope your husband goes to Scotland. 
                         Then you'll be a widow.

               INT. BRUCE'S CASTLE - BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

               Robert the Bruce is in bed with a young Nordic beauty with 
               vacant blue eyes. She drowses; but the lovemaking has not 
               defused the restlessness of Robert's spirit. He lies on his 
               stomach, turned away from her on the bed. Stirring, she kisses 
               his neck; but he doesn't respond.

                                     WOMAN
                         I wanted to please you.

                                     ROBERT
                         You did.

               But he is numb as she nuzzles him again. She sags back, and 
               he still stares away, lost in thought. Realizing her hurt, 
               he explains...

                                     ROBERT
                         In Lanark village, the king's soldiers 
                         killed a girl. Her lover fought his 
                         way through the soldiers and killed 
                         the magistrate.

               She looks at him blankly.

                                     ROBERT
                         He rebelled. He rebelled. He acted. 
                         He fought! Was it rage? Pride? Love? 
                         Whatever it was, he has more of it 
                         than I.

                                     WOMAN
                              (hurt)
                         You might have lied.

                                     ROBERT
                         I'm too arrogant to lie.

               CLOSE - ROBERT THE BRUCE

               On his FACE as he moves grimly up a dark castle staircase.

               He follows a servant who carries a candle against the gloom.

               They reach a door, which the servant unlocks. Young Robert 
               takes the candle, and enters --

               A DARKENED ROOM

               Robert wills himself forward, and places the candle on a 
               table in the center of the room. A SHUFFLE in the dark; then 
               moving into the light is a LEPER whose once-noble features 
               are decaying with the disease. Isolated in his disfiguration, 
               he looks at his visitor -- his son -- with the eyes of the 
               condemned. Young Robert forces himself not to look away.

                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE
                         Father. A rebellion has begun.

                                     THE LEPER
                         Under whom?

                                     ROBERT
                         A commoner named William Wallace.

                                     THE LEPER
                         A commoner? So no one leads Scotland?

               The old man thinks, and points a half finger at his son.

                                     THE LEPER
                         You will embrace this rebellion. 
                         Support it, from our lands in the 
                         north. I will gain English favor by 
                         condemning it and ordering it opposed 
                         from our lands in the south. Whichever 
                         way the tide runs, we will rise.

                                     ROBERT
                         This Wallace. He doesn't even have a 
                         knighthood. But he fights with 
                         passion, and he is clever. He inspires 
                         men.

                                     THE LEPER
                         You admire him. Uncompromising men 
                         are easy to admire. He has courage. 
                         So does a dog. But you must understand 
                         this: Edward Longshanks is the most 
                         ruthless king ever to sit on the 
                         throne of England, and none of us, 
                         and nothing of Scotland, will survive 
                         unless we are as ruthless, more 
                         ruthless, than he.

               Young Bruce rises heavily, and moves to the door.

                                     THE LEPER
                         Press your case to the nobles. They 
                         will choose who rules Scotland.

               With a last long look at his father, Robert leaves.

               EXT. SCOTLAND - MONTAGE - DAY

               -- Troops ride through the countryside, intimidating and 
               questioning civilians; all refuse to talk.

               -- Wallace's house burns, as soldiers dig up the graves of 
               his father and brother, and scatter their bones to dogs.

               -- The English search through the woods, finding nothing.

               EXT. WALLACE LANDS - NIGHT

               William and Hamish ride, to see the damage. They find the 
               smoking ruins, and the defiled family graves.

                                     HAMISH
                         Ah, William... I am so sorry.

               William is struck by an awful, urgent thought...

               EXT. UNDERBRUSH NEAR MARION'S GRAVE - DUSK

               We open on Marion's grave, with the thistle-carved marker, 
               looking peaceful; but up the hill in the underbrush, English 
               soldiers wait in ambush. Edgy, they perk up at the sound of 
               muffled hoofbeats -- then their eyes bug as a cloaked figure -- 
               Wallace -- suddenly looms up behind them, galloping and 
               swirling fire! He hurls burning torches into the clustered 
               soldiers, setting some of them on fire!

               MEANWHILE, HAMISH has crawled to Marion's grave and is digging 
               frantically. The new dirt parts easily and he pulls the 
               shrouded body out, cringing with the effort.

               MORE SOLDIERS rush from behind the rocks at the far side of 
               the graveyard. Wallace charges them, driving them back. He 
               grabs the reins of Hamish's horse, hidden among trees, and 
               gallops to him.

               Hamish hands the shrouded body up to William and bounds into 
               the saddle of his own horse. They spur the horses and ride 
               away, William clutching Marion's shrouded body to his chest.

               EXT. SECRET GROVE ON THE PRECIPICE - NIGHT

               William dismounts, stretching the body gently on the ground.

               Hamish dismounts too, with the spade he used to dig up the 
               old grave. He sees the emotion on William's face.

                                     HAMISH
                         I'll wait... back there.

                                     WALLACE
                         Hamish, I... thank...

               Hamish puts a hand on his friend's shoulder, then quietly 
               leads the horses away. William starts to dig...

               LATER IN THE GROVE

               William sits looking at the new grave, covered with leaves -- 
               completely hidden. He touches his hand to the earth.

               EXT. WOODS - BY THE STREAM - NIGHT

               Hamish is waiting as William comes out of the grove. There 
               is nothing to say. They mount their horses and ride away, as 
               the MUSIC of William and Marion's love haunts us...

               EXT. WOODS - ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               Wallace and his inner circle hare huddled around a small 
               fire. Other highlanders guard the perimeters. Old Campbell 
               is lovingly honing the broadswords to razor edges and sharing 
               a whiskey jug with Hamish, who stares at the fire. Wallace 
               is using a stick to draw diagrams in the dirt.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         What're ya doin'?

                                     WALLACE
                         Thinking.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Does it hurt?

                                     WALLACE
                         What do we do when Longshanks sends 
                         his whole northern army against us? 
                         They have heavy cavalry. Armored 
                         horses, that shake the very ground. 
                         They'll ride right over us.

               At a loss, Wallace looks up at the sky. HE SEES: the trees 
               stretching into the night like spikes to skewer the stars.

                                     WALLACE
                         We make spears. A hundred spears. 
                         Fourteen feet long.

                                     HAMISH
                         Fourteen? --

                                     SENTRY (O.S.)
                         Volunteers coming in!

               They look to see a half dozen new volunteers being led in, 
               blindfolded. When the guides remove the blindfolds, the new 
               recruits see Wallace and rush to him, bowing.

                                     RECRUIT (FAUDRON)
                         William Wallace? We have come to 
                         fight and die for you!

                                     WALLACE
                         Stand up, man, I'm not the Pope.

                                     FAUDRON
                         I am Faudron! My sword is yours! And 
                         I brought you this tarta --

               As he reaches into his cloak, both Hamish and Campbell 
               instantly draw their swords and put the points to his neck.

                                     SENTRY
                         We checked them for arms.

               Carefully, Faudron pulls out a beautiful tartan scarf, and 
               replaces Wallace's tattered old one.

                                     FAUDRON
                         It's your family tartan! My wife 
                         wove it with her own hands.

                                     WALLACE
                         Thank her for me.

               A loud voice interrupts...

                                     VOICE
                         Him? That can't be William Wallace! 
                         I'm prettier than this man!

               They all look at a slender, handsome young man, STEPHEN, who 
               is talking to himself -- or more accurately, seems to listen 
               to some unheard voice, then answer it...

                                     STEPHEN
                         All right, Father, I'll ask him!
                              (to William)
                         If I risk my neck for you, will I 
                         get a chance to kill Englishmen?

                                     HAMISH
                         Is your Poppa a ghost -- or do you 
                         converse with God Almighty?

                                     STEPHEN
                         In order to find his equal, and 
                         Irishman is forced to talk to God.
                              (quickly)
                         Yes, Father!...
                              (to Wallace)
                         The Almighty says don't change the 
                         subject, just answer the fookin' 
                         question.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Insane Irish --

               Stephen whips a dagger from his sleeve and puts it at 
               Campbell's throat.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Smart enough to get a dagger past 
                         your guards, old man.

               Wallace jerks his sword to the Irishman's throat, and grins.

                                     WALLACE
                         That's my friend, Irishman. And the 
                         answer's yes. You fight for me, you 
                         kill the English.

               Stephen grins, and happily tucks away the dagger.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm 
                         the most wanted man on the Emerald 
                         Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald 
                         Isle of course, more's the pity.

                                     HAMISH
                         A common thief.

                                     STEPHEN
                         A patriot!

               Wallace shakes his head and moves back to the fire, as the 
               sentries take the newcomers to find their own spaces.

               EXT. SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               A column of English light cavalry -- a hundred riders -- 
               moves through the picturesque beauty of the Highlands.

               English LORD DOLECROFT is in command, wearing a hat with a 
               pompous white plume. UP AHEAD, the English SCOUT sees five 
               Scots, including Hamish, walking out of the forest. The Scots 
               run; the Scout rides back to Dolecroft.

                                     SCOUT
                         Scotsmen, Sire! Headed west!

                                     DOLECROFT
                         They've blundered at last! After 
                         them!

               The English force charges off. Hamish and his men changed 
               direction but the English spot them crossing a hilltop and 
               ride after them. The Scots run for their lives; the English 
               horses gallop. The Scots run down one slope, up another; the 
               English follow, find their horses stumbling, and see...

                                     SCOUT
                         We're in a bog!

                                     DOLECROFT
                         Here, it's firm this way --

               But as they move toward the firm ground, fifty Scots appear 
               on the crest of the hill. Hamish leads them, smiling.

               Dolecroft wheels and looks to his rear; Wallace appears there, 
               with fifty more, and more Scots appear to the left and right 
               of the English, who are surrounded in the bog. Too late, 
               Dolecroft realizes his blunder. Wallace lifts his broadsword, 
               screams, and leads the charge...

               EXT. SCOTTISH WOODS - DAY

               The Scots are moving through deep woods; they are laden with 
               the booty they took from the English cavalry: extra weapons, 
               clothing, food -- and one man even wears the late Dolecroft's 
               plumed hat. Wallace is leading them, traveling with his heavy 
               sheathed broadsword across his shoulders.

                                     WALLACE
                         Stop here and rest.

               They collapse to the leaves and loam, greedily squeezing 
               water from sheep belly canteens.

               INT. STIRLING CASTLE - DAY

               LORD PICKERING, English commander, is handed news of the 
               disaster. He reads the message, and pales.

                                     PICKERING
                         Another ambush! My God! ...What about 
                         our infiltrator?

                                     ASSISTANT
                         He has already joined them, M'lord.

               EXT. SCOTTISH WOODS - NIGHT

               The moon is high above the Scots, encamped for the night.

               Most everyone is sleeping, but William sits leaning against 
               a tree, lost in lonely thoughts. Suddenly William freezes; a 
               shaft of moonlight illuminates a cloaked woman standing twenty 
               feet ahead of him. Something about her is familiar -- and 
               then she pulls off the hood, revealing her auburn hair, 
               cascading in the moonlight... It is Marion!

                                     WALLACE
                         Marion! Is... is it you?

               Joy explodes on his face, and he runs to her, but stops before 
               he touches her, as if she might evaporate.

                                     WALLACE
                         I'm dreaming.

                                     MARION
                         Yes, you are. And you must wake.

                                     WALLACE
                         I don't want to wake. I want to stay 
                         with you.

                                     MARION
                         And I with you. But you must wake.

                                     WALLACE
                         I need you so much! I love you!

                                     MARION
                         Wake up, William. Wake up!

                                     HAMISH'S VOICE
                         Wake up, William!...

                                     MARION/HAMISH
                         Wake up!...

               William clutches at Marion, but his arms can't enclose her.

               HE WAKES

               lying on his new tartan, in camp, with Hamish shaking him, 
               William's arms clutched empty to his chest.

                                     HAMISH
                         William! Hounds!

               Wallace jumps up, hearing the DISTANT BARKING that alarmed 
               Hamish. Stephen, the new Irish recruit, races up.

                                     STEPHEN
                         We must run in different directions!

                                     HAMISH
                         We don't split up!

                                     STEPHEN
                         They used hounds on us in Ireland, 
                         it's the only way!

                                     WALLACE
                         He's right, Hamish! Campbell! Divide 
                         them and run!

               Shoving groups of men in different directions, Wallace then 
               takes off. His group is about a dozen; they race through the 
               woods, dodging trees, running aimlessly. They stop and listen. 
               The BARKS are getting closer.

                                     WALLACE
                         Split again!

               Again they divide, and race in different directions.

               But no matter how they run and dodge, the BARKS grow nearer.

               We INTERCUT with the approaching of the dogs -- a large PACK 
               OF HOUNDS, with keepers like on a fox hunt, and behind the 
               dogs, Lord Pickering, with his soldiers, prepared for a long 
               chase, cloaked against the wet darkness, carrying torches.

               Wallace and others pause, hear the dogs, and run again, in a 
               new direction. The hounds are relentless. Wallace's group is 
               down to Hamish, Stephen, and Faudron.

                                     WALLACE
                         No matter how we go, they follow. 
                         They have our scent. My scent.

                                     FAUDRON
                         Run! You must not be caught!

               Faster now, faster. The barks are getting very close.

               Wallace and his friends are starting to panic. The blood 
               beats in their ears, their breath scalds their lungs. And we 
               MOVE IN on Wallace's eyes. He stops, gasping.

                                     STEPHEN
                         We can't stop!

                                     WALLACE
                         They've tricked us.

                                     STEPHEN
                         What's the crazy man saying, Lord?

                                     WALLACE
                         The dogs have a scent. My scent. 
                         Someone must have given it to them.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Who would do such a thing?

                                     WALLACE
                         Exactly.

               Wallace pulls out his dagger...

               THE DOGS

               bark frantically now; they smell a kill; they tug so hard at 
               their leashes that the handlers are almost dragged along.

                                     HANDLER
                         Be ready! We have them!

               The soldiers grip their weapons, ready to take their 
               prisoners. They burst into the little clearing; the dogs 
               find a body, stabbed, his throat cut; the dogs plunge their 
               snouts into the gore, yipping wildly. The handlers must fight 
               furiously to tear the dogs from the body.

               Lord Pickering approaches the body and looks down. It is 
               Faudron, mangled now but clearly identifiable -- with the 
               scarf he gave William, in place of William's own, tucked 
               into his shirt.

                                     LORD PICKERING
                         Damnation! Damnation!

               As Pickering rants, his men look at the darkness all around.

                                     LORD PICKERING
                         After him! Get them going again!

                                     HANDLER
                         Their noses are drowned in new blood, 
                         they'll follow nothing now!

               And just as the realization hits Pickering that he can't 
               pursue Wallace any further, a cloaked figure mixed in among 
               his men leans in from behind him to whisper...

                                     STEPHEN OF IRELAND
                         The Almighty says for you to give 
                         His regards to the Devil.

               Pickering's eyes go wide, then roll back as Stephen's dagger 
               slides expertly through his back ribs and into his heart. As 
               Pickering falls and his men realize what has happened, Stephen 
               has already run back into the trees.

               Pickering's men freeze at this sudden turn of events. Even 
               the dogs whimper, picking up the rising fear of the men around 
               them. Then from the darkness all around them comes a chorus 
               of demonic, bloodcurdling yells --

                                     WALLACE/HAMISH/STEPHEN
                         ARRRRRGGGGGGGHHHH!

               Three wild men tear out of the darkness from different 
               directions, their swords slashing. Pickering's men panic and 
               run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by 
               their torches, fell with them in all directions.

               Wallace, Hamish and Stephen are left alone in the heart of 
               the woods, howling, barking like dogs, snarling like wolves -- 
               and then laughing like hyenas!

                                     STEPHEN
                         I thought I was dead when ya pulled 
                         that dagger!

                                     WALLACE
                         No English lord would trust an 
                         Irishman!

                                     HAMISH
                         Let's kill him anyway.

               They laugh again; then Wallace's laughter leaks away, and he 
               stares into the trees, where he saw Marion in his dream.

               VARIOUS SHOTS - THE STORY SPREADS THROUGH SCOTLAND...

               Two men are talking in A VILLAGE...

                                     VILLAGER
                         ...and William Wallace killed fifty 
                         men! Fifty, if it was one!

               The same tale is exchanged by two farmers AT A CROSSROADS...

                                     FARMER
                         A hundred men! With his own sword! 
                         He cut a through the English like --

               The tale is repeated IN A TAVERN...

                                     DRINKER
                         -- Moses through the Red Sea! Hacked 
                         off two hundred heads!

                                     DRINKER #2
                         Two hundred?!

                                     DRINKER
                         Saw it with my own eyes.

               And the rumors are discussed even INSIDE THE PALACE GROUNDS 
               IN LONDON, where the Prince and his friends are trying on 
               elaborate attire presented them by fawning tailors, and the 
               Princess, ignored by her husband, strolls and chats with her 
               Handmaiden, Nicolette (in subtitled French).

                                     NICOLETTE
                         When the king returns he will bury 
                         them in those new clothes. Scotland 
                         is in chaos. Your husband is secretly 
                         sending an army north.

                                     PRINCESS
                         How do you know this?

                                     NICOLETTE
                         Last night I slept with a member of 
                         the War Council.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He shouldn't be telling secrets in 
                         bed.

                                     NICOLETTE
                         Ah, Oui! Englishmen don't know what 
                         a tongue is for.

               The Princess blushes, whacks her with her fan, and smiles.

                                     PRINCESS
                         This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He 
                         fights to avenge a woman?

                                     NICOLETTE
                         A magistrate wished to capture him, 
                         and found he had a secret lover, so 
                         he cut the girl's throat to tempt 
                         Wallace to fight -- and fight he 
                         did.

               The Princess is pained at such cruelty; Nicolette warms to 
               share the juicy gossip...

                                     NICOLETTE
                         Knowing his passion for his lost 
                         love, they next plotted to take him 
                         by desecrating the graves of his 
                         father and brother and setting an 
                         ambush at the grave of his wife. He 
                         fought his way through the trap and 
                         carried her body to a secret place! 
                         Now that is romance, Oui?

                                     PRINCESS
                         ...I wouldn't know.

               EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY

               A Highlander, a RUNNER, slips like a shadow up the hillside, 
               to a circle of ancient monoliths. There, hidden among the 
               stone pillars, he finds Wallace and his band resting.

                                     RUNNER
                         The English are advancing an army 
                         toward Stirling!

                                     WALLACE
                         Do the nobles rally?

                                     RUNNER
                         Robert the Bruce and most of the 
                         others will not commit to war! But 
                         word has spread and Highlanders are 
                         coming down on their own, by the 
                         hundreds -- by the thousands!

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Wallace rides down the road, followed by his band. As they 
               pass people on the road, the women, the children, all cheer.

                                     PEOPLE
                         Wallace! It's William Wallace! God 
                         bless Wallace and Scotland!

               At a crossroads, more of Wallace's men join them, in clusters. 
               One group carries something long, encased in wool covers. 
               Farmers in the field, blacksmiths at their forges, leave 
               their work and uncover their inevitable weapons and run after 
               the riders. They put on their forbidden tartans, kiss their 
               wives and head off to fight.

               EXT. STIRLING FIELD - DAY

               Stirling Castle perches on a hill high above a grassy field, 
               cut in half by a river, spanned by an old wooden bridge.

               SCOTTISH NOBLES have gathered on a smaller hill overlooking 
               the field; they wear gleaming armor, with plumes, sashes and 
               banners, and are attended by squires and grooms.

               The mists of morning shroud most of the field. But from the 
               opposite side of the bridge they hear the CLATTERING of a 
               huge army moving forward. LOCHLAN, a noble, gallops to Mornay.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         It sounds like twenty thousand!

                                     MORNAY
                         The scouts say it is ten.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         And we have but two!

               THE COMMON SCOTTISH SOLDIERS

               are wearing padded leather shirts, and carry pikes and 
               daggers. As through the mists they see the numbers arrayed 
               against them, a YOUNG SOLDIER tugs at a grizzled VETERAN.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         So many!

                                     SCOTTISH VETERAN
                         The nobles will negotiate. If they 
                         deal, they send us home. If not, we 
                         charge. When we are all dead and 
                         they can call themselves brave, they 
                         withdraw.

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         I didn't come to fight so they could 
                         own more lands that I could work for 
                         them!

                                     VETERAN
                         Nor did I. Not against these odds!

               He lowers his pike and starts to desert. At first one-by-one 
               and then in clumps, more highlanders follow.

               THE NOBLES see the desertion.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         Stop! Men! Do not flee! Not now! 
                         Wait until we have negotiated!

                                     MORNAY
                         They won't stop -- and who could 
                         blame them?

               Then, riding into the mob of men, comes Wallace, followed by 
               his friends. He's striking, charismatic, his powerful arms 
               bare, his chest covered not in armor but a commoner's leather 
               shirt, and unlike the heavy knights on their armored horses, 
               Wallace rides a swift horse, like he was born on it.

               The entire Scottish army watches in fascination as Wallace 
               and his men ride through them, toward the command hill. The 
               soldiers whisper among themselves...

                                     YOUNG SOLDIER
                         William Wallace?

                                     VETERAN
                         Couldn't be.

               The common soldiers, already having broken ranks, cluster up 
               the hill to see the confrontation. As Wallace and his captains 
               reach the nobles, Stephen laughs.

                                     STEPHEN
                         The Almighty says this must be a 
                         fashionable fight, it's drawn the 
                         finest people.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         Where is thy salute?

                                     WALLACE
                         For presenting yourselves on this 
                         battlefield, I give you thanks.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         This is our army. To join it, you 
                         give homage.

                                     WALLACE
                         I give homage to Scotland. And if 
                         this is your army, why does it go?

               Wallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen 
               men, now frightened, ready to desert. We play this picture, 
               Wallace sitting his horse, looking down in awe at this thing 
               that has grown beyond anyone's imagination.

               He glances at his friends: Campbell, Hamish, Stephen.

               They've got no suggestions, they're just as awed as he is.

                                     SCOTTISH VETERAN
                         We didn't come to fight for them!

                                     SHOUTS FROM MOB
                         Home! The English are too many!

               Wallace raises his hand, and the army falls silent.

                                     WALLACE
                         Sons of Scotland!... I am William 
                         Wallace!

                                     SOLDIER
                         William Wallace is seven feet tall!

                                     WALLACE
                         Yes, I have heard! He kills men by 
                         the hundreds! And if he were here, 
                         he would consume the English with 
                         fireballs from his eyes, and bolts 
                         of lightning from his ass!

               Many laugh -- all get the point.

                                     WALLACE
                         I am William Wallace. And my enemies 
                         do not go away. I saw our good nobles 
                         hanged. My wife... I am William 
                         Wallace. And I see a whole army of 
                         my countrymen, here in defiance of 
                         tyranny. You have come to fight as 
                         free men. And free men you are! What 
                         will you do with freedom? Will you 
                         fight?

                                     VETERAN
                         Two thousand, against ten? We will 
                         run -- and live!

                                     WALLACE
                         Yes. Fight and you may die. Run and 
                         you will live, at least awhile. And 
                         dying in your bed many years from 
                         now, would you be willing to trade 
                         all the days from this day to that, 
                         for one chance to come back here as 
                         young men, and tell our enemies that 
                         they make take our lives, but they 
                         will never take our freedom?

               Down on the plain, English emissaries in all their regal 
               finery gallop over the bridge, under a banner of truce.

                                     VETERAN
                         Look! The English comes to barter 
                         with our nobles for castles and 
                         titles. And our nobles will not be 
                         in the front of the battle!

                                     WALLACE
                         No! They will not!

               He dismounts, and draws his sword.

                                     WALLACE
                         And I will.

               Slowly, the chant begins, and builds...

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! WAL-LACE!

               BAGPIPERS play, pulling the mob back into companies. But 
               through the lifting mists they see the overwhelming enemy 
               army. Hamish, Campbell and Stephen move up beside William.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Fine speech. Now what do we do?

                                     WALLACE
                         Bring out our spearmen and set them 
                         in the field.

               Campbell, Hamish and Stephen ride off. Mornay reins his horse 
               over, lifts the reins of Wallace's horse, and extends them 
               to him: an invitation to join the pre-battle talks.

               Wallace mounts up and rides out with the Scottish nobles to 
               meet the English contingent.

               OUT ON THE FIELD, THE TWO GROUPS OF RIDERS

               meet like the captains of football teams before the kickoff. 
               CHELTHAM, head of the English contingent, glares at Wallace.

                                     CHELTHAM
                         Mornay. Lochlan. Inverness.

                                     MORNAY
                         Cheltham. This is William Wallace

                                     CHELTHAM
                         Here are the King's terms. Lead this 
                         army off the field, and he will give 
                         you each estates in Yorkshire, 
                         including hereditary title, from 
                         which you will pay him an annual --

                                     WALLACE
                         I have an offer for you.

                                     CHELTHAM
                         ...From which you will pay the King 
                         an annual duty...

               Wallace pulls his broadsword and snaps it at Cheltham, whose 
               eyes flash in disbelief at the bad manners.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         You disrespect a banner of truce?!

                                     WALLACE
                         From his king? Absolutely. Here are 
                         Scotland's terms. Lower your flags 
                         and march straight to England, 
                         stopping at every Scottish home you 
                         pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred 
                         years of theft, rape, and murder. Do 
                         that, and your men shall live. Do it 
                         not, and every one of you will die 
                         today.

               Cheltham barks at the Scottish nobles...

                                     CHELTHAM
                         You are outmatched! You haven't even 
                         any cavalry! In two centuries no 
                         army has won without it!

                                     WALLACE
                         I'm not finished. Before we let you 
                         leave, your commander must cross 
                         that bridge, stand before this army, 
                         put his head between his legs, and 
                         kiss his own ass.

               The outraged Englishman gallops back to his lines.

                                     MORNAY
                         I'd say that was rather less cordial 
                         that he was used to.

                                     WALLACE
                         Be ready, and do exactly as I say.

               They return to the Scottish lines. Wallace dismounts where 
               his men are breaking out new 14-foot spears. Hamish, eyebrows 
               raised, looks expectantly at Wallace; Wallace nods.

                                     HAMISH
                         Wish I could see the noble lord's 
                         face when he tells him.

               LORD TALMADGE, AT HIS COMMAND POST

               The husky English commander's blood boils from Cheltham's 
               report. Before he can respond, they see WALLACE'S SPEARMEN 
               taking up a position on the far side of the bridge. Suddenly 
               the Scots turn and lift their kilts and moon the English!

                                     TALMADGE
                         Insolent bastard! Full attack! Give 
                         no quarter! And I want this Wallace's 
                         heart brought to me on a plate!

               Cheltham spurs his horse to form up the attack...

               EXT. THE FIELD BELOW STIRLING CASTLE - DAY

               The English army moves forward toward the bridge. It's so 
               narrow that only a single file of riders can move across it 
               at any one time. The English heavy cavalry, two hundred 
               knights, cross uncontested, and form up on the other side.

               WITH WALLACE AND THE SCOTS

               Things look terrible. Stephen turns to William.

                                     STEPHEN
                         The Lord tell me He can get me out 
                         of this mess. But He's pretty sure 
                         you're fooked.

               ON THE ENGLISH SIDE

               Talmadge sees the Scots doing nothing.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Amateurs! They do not even contest 
                         us! Send across the infantry.

                                     GENERAL
                         M'lord, the bridge is so narrow --

                                     TALMADGE
                         The Scots just stand in their 
                         formations!

               Our cavalry will ride them down like grass. Get the infantry 
               across so they can finish the slaughter!

               The English leaders shout orders and keep their men moving 
               across the bridge. Talmadge gestures for the attack flag.

               THE CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

               The English knights see the signal banners, telling them to 
               attack. They take the lances from their squires, and lower 
               the visors of their helmets. Proud, plumed, glimmering; they 
               look invincible. Their huge horses, themselves draped in 
               scarlet and purple, look like tanks. The knights charge!

               Their hooves THUNDER; the horses are so heavy the ground 
               literally shakes with the charge.

               The Scots stand and watch them come on. It's difficult to 
               imagine the courage this takes; from the POV OF THE SCOTTISH 
               LINES we see the massive horses boring in... we feel the 
               RISING THUNDER of the charge, closer, closer...

               Wallace moves to the front of the lead group of Scots.

                                     WALLACE
                         Steady! Hold... hold... NOW!

               The Scots snap their 14-foot spears straight up in unison.

                                     WALLACE
                         FORM!

               Now the spearmen snap the spears forward in ranks, the first 
               line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above 
               the ground, the men behind them bracing theirs at a five 
               foot level, the men behind that bracing at seven feet.

               The English knights have never seen such a formation. Their 
               lances are useless and it's too late to stop! The momentum 
               that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on 
               foot now becomes suicidal force; knights and horses impale 
               themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers.

               TALMADGE

               can see it; but worse is the SOUND, the SCREAMS OF DYING MEN 
               AND HORSES, carried to him across the battlefield.

               WALLACE AND HIS MEN

               are protected, behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and 
               knights. Wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen 
               out onto the field, attacking the knights that are still 
               alive. Most are off their horses; a few have managed to pull 
               up their mounts. Wallace and his men are so much more mobile 
               than the knights; the field runs with blood.

               Wallace faces Talmadge in the distance.

                                     WALLACE
                         Here I am, English coward! Come get 
                         me!!

               TALMADGE is even more enraged -- and his judgment is gone.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Press the men across!

                                     CHELTHAM
                         But M'lord!

               Talmadge himself gallops forward.

                                     TALMADGE
                         PRESS THEM!

               WALLACE smiles. He grabs Hamish.

                                     WALLACE
                         Tell Mornay to ride to the flank and 
                         cross upstream. Wait! Tell him to be 
                         sure the English see him ride away!

               Hamish hurries off with the message.

               The English infantry keeps moving across the little bridge.

               The Scottish nobles watch from their positions on horseback.

               They have a few dozen mounted riders, none heavily armored.

                                     LOCHLAN
                         If he waits much longer --

               Hamish hurries up.

                                     HAMISH
                         Ride around and ford behind them!

                                     MORNAY
                         We should not divide our forces!

                                     HAMISH
                         Wallace says do it! And he says for 
                         you to let the English see you!

                                     MORNAY
                              (understanding)
                         They shall think we run away.

               Mornay leads his riders away.

               LORD TALMADGE

               sees the Scottish nobles ride off, and shouts to Cheltham...

                                     TALMADGE
                         See! Every Scot with a horse is 
                         fleeing! Hurry! Hurry!

               He drives half his army across the river.

               WALLACE

               lifts his sword.

                                     WALLACE
                         For Scotland!

               He charges down the hill...

               THE FIGHT AT STIRLING BRIDGE - VARIOUS SHOTS

               The Scots follow Wallace on foot, charging into the English.

               The English leaders are stunned by the ferocious attack.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Press reinforcements across!

               The English leaders try to herd more of their footsoldiers 
               onto the bridge, which only hams them up. Meanwhile, on the 
               other side of the bridge, Wallace and his charging men slam 
               into the English infantry with wild fury. The English fall 
               back on each other, further blocking the bridge.

               UP ON THE HILLTOP

               The nobles look back with grudging admiration.

                                     MORNAY
                         He's taking the bloody bridge! The 
                         English can't get across! He's evened 
                         the odds at one stroke!

               With rising desire to join the bandwagon, the nobles spur...

               DOWN ON THE PLAIN, Wallace and the attacking men drive the 
               English back, killing as they go. The Scots reach the bridge 
               itself. The waters below it run red with blood.

               Talmadge has begun to panic.

                                     TALMADGE
                         Use the archers!

                                     GENERAL
                         They're too close, we'll shoot out 
                         own men!

               ON THE BRIDGE

               the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers; 
               nothing can stop them. Wallace is relentless; each time he 
               swings, a head flies, or an arm. Hamish and Stephen fight 
               beside him, swinging the broadsword with both hands. Old 
               Campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an English 
               swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but 
               Campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs 
               him. Reaching the English side of the bridge, the Scots begin 
               to build a barrier with the dead bodies.

               The English are not without courage. Cheltham leads a 
               desperate counterattack. The Scots make an impenetrable 
               barrier of slashing blades. Still Cheltham keeps coming; 
               Wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet, 
               his hair, and his brain.

               TALMADGE has seen enough; he gallops away. The remaining 
               English General tries to save the army.

                                     GENERAL
                         We are still five thousand! Rally!

               The English try to form up; but the Scottish horsemen, fording 
               the river high upstream, come crashing into the English flank 
               and ride over the surprised English infantry.

               AT THE BRIDGE, WALLACE

               sees the Scottish nobles attacking. The English soldiers are 
               in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides.

               And the Scottish soldiers taste something Scots have not 
               tasted for a hundred years: victory. Even while finishing 
               off the last of the English soldiers, they begin their highlow 
               chant... Even the noblemen take up the chant!

               Wallace looks around at the aftermath of the battle: bodies 
               on the field; soldiers lying impaled; stacks of bodies on 
               the bridge; the bridge slick with blood.

               Before it can all sink in, William is lifted on the shoulders 
               of his men.

                                     SCOTTISH SOLDIERS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

               INT. CASTLE - GREAT HALL - DAY

               William kneels before one of Scotland's ancient elders, who 
               lifts a silver sword and dubs William's shoulders.

                                     ELDER
                         I knight thee Sir William Wallace.

               William rises and faces the Great Hall, crowded with hundreds 
               of new admirers, as well as his old friends in their new 
               clothes and armor. The crowd chants --

                                     CROWD
                         Wal-lace, Wal-lace!!

               Wallace lifts his eyes, taking it all in. At the rear of the 
               hall is a balcony, backed by a magnificent sunlit stained 
               glass window, and in the center of its rainbow corona he 
               sees a familiar form: Marion, so real to him in this moment 
               of triumph that he can see her, glowing like an angel, in a 
               gown worthy of the occasion. But the illusion won't last; in 
               the blink of an eye she is gone, and Wallace hears the chant, 
               and fingers the cloth she gave him.

               INT. SCOTTISH COUNCIL - DAY

               The nobles of Scotland are gathered in the huge chamber; a 
               massive table runs across the far end of the room, and aligned 
               on either side are the two rival factions of nobles, glaring 
               at each other. Old Craig is in the center, with young Robert 
               the Bruce on his right. There is a general MURMUR along the 
               nobles, and Robert whispers to Craig...

                                     ROBERT
                         Does anyone know his politics?

                                     CRAIG
                         No. But his weight with the commoners 
                         could unbalance everything. The 
                         Balliols will kiss his ass, so we 
                         must.

               A court STEWARDS steps in and formally announces...

                                     STEWARD
                         Lords of Scotland: Sir William 
                         Wallace!

               The nobles on each side of the table try to outdo each other 
               in their acclamation as Wallace strides in, flanked by Hamish, 
               Campbell, and Stephen, splendid in their tartans.

               Old Craig rises.

                                     CRAIG
                         Sir William. In the name of God, we 
                         declare and appoint thee High 
                         Protector of Scotland! And thy 
                         captains as aides decamp!

               The nobles rise; court attendants hurry to Wallace and drape 
               a golden chain of office around his neck. Wallace takes the 
               three smaller chains they bring and drapes them around the 
               necks of his friends, as once again the nobles applaud.

               Almost before the applause dies, a member of the BALLIOL 
               clan, who has kept an open seat beside him, speaks up...

                                     BALLIOL
                         Sir William!! Inasmuch as you and 
                         your captains hail from a region 
                         long known to support the Balliol 
                         clan, may we invite you to join us?

               But Wallace's gaze has locked onto Robert the Bruce, who 
               stares back, the two young lions instantly recognizing the 
               leadership power of each other.

                                     WALLACE
                         You are Robert the Bruce.

                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE
                         I am.

                                     WALLACE
                         My father fought in support of yours.

               The Balliols shrivel. The nobles on the Bruce side can barely 
               keep from grinning. Suddenly the men on the other end of the 
               table change their attack.

                                     BALLIOL
                         With this new success, the result of 
                         all of Scotland's efforts, now is 
                         the time to declare a king!

                                     MORNAY
                         Then you are prepared to recognize 
                         our legitimate succession!

                                     BALLIOL
                         You're the ones who won't support 
                         the true claim! I demand consideration 
                         of these documents!

               Wallace glances again at the Bruce, who suddenly feels ashamed 
               of the bickering.

                                     MORNAY
                         Those were lies when they were 
                         written! Our documents prove 
                         absolutely that --

               Suddenly Wallace turns his back and walks toward the door.

                                     CRAIG
                         Sir William! Where are you going?

                                     WILLIAM
                         We have beaten the English! But 
                         they'll come back, because you won't 
                         stand together. There is one clan in 
                         this country -- Scotsmen. One class -- 
                         free. One price -- courage.

               He turns again and strides toward the door.

                                     CRAIG
                         But... what will you do?

                                     WALLACE
                         I will invade England. And defeat 
                         the English on their own ground.

                                     CRAIG
                         Invade?! That's impossible, it --

               Wallace slings out his broadsword and moves down the length 
               of the table, bashing the succession documents into the laps 
               of the nobles.

                                     WALLACE
                         LISTEN TO ME! Longshanks understands 
                         this! This!

               He brandishes the broadsword.

                                     WALLACE
                         There is a difference between us. 
                         You think the people of this country 
                         exist to provide you with position. 
                         I think your position exists to 
                         provide the people with freedom. And 
                         I go to make sure they have it.

               Wallace bangs through the door. Suppressing smiles, his 
               friends file out behind him.

               INT. EDINBURGH CORRIDOR - DAY

               Wallace and his men are marching away, as Robert the Bruce 
               runs out after them.

                                     ROBERT
                         Wait! ...I respect what you said. 
                         But remember, these men have lands, 
                         castles. Much to risk.

                                     WALLACE
                         And the common man who bleeds on the 
                         battlefield, does he risk less?

                                     ROBERT
                         No. But from top to bottom this 
                         country has no sense of itself. Its 
                         nobles share allegiance with England 
                         and its clans war with each other. 
                         If you make enemies on both sides of 
                         the border, you'll end up dead.

                                     WALLACE
                         We all end up dead. It's only a 
                         question of how. And why.

               Wallace walks; Robert catches up and speaks to him in an 
               urgent half whisper, so that no one else can hear.

                                     ROBERT
                         I'm no coward! I want what you want! 
                         But we need the nobles.

                                     WALLACE
                         Nobles? What does that mean -- to be 
                         noble? Your title gives you claim to 
                         the throne of our country. But men 
                         don't follow titles, they follow 
                         courage! Your arm speaks louder than 
                         your tongue. Our people know you. 
                         Noble and common, they respect you. 
                         If you would lead them toward freedom, 
                         they would follow you. And so would 
                         I.

               Wallace walks away, leaving Robert the Bruce alone.

               THE SCOTTISH ARMY - DAY

               Wallace rides at the head of his army, moving through the 
               countryside of northern England. It is autumn, the foliage 
               is beautiful, the wheat fields gold with harvest.

               EXT. ESTABLISHING YORK CITY - DAY

               A medieval city guarded by a fortress.

               INT. THE FORTRESS - MAP ROOM - DAY

               The ROYAL GOVERNOR is a spoiled young man, Longshanks' nephew. 
               He is studying maps and written appeals for help; his CAPTAIN 
               of defenses strides in with another note.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Message from your cousin, the Prince. 
                         He says London has no more troops to 
                         send.

                                     GOVERNOR
                         Every town in Northern England is 
                         begging for help! Where will Wallace 
                         strike first?

                                     CAPTAIN
                         I should think these smaller 
                         settlements along the border...

               They hear shouts as a rider arrives and dismounts. They look 
               out to see a panicked RIDER, who shouts up...

                                     RIDER
                         He advances!

                                     GOVERNOR
                         To what town?

                                     RIDER
                         He comes here!

                                                                  SMASH TO:

               CARTS, RUMBLING IN PANIC DOWN A ROAD

               as civilians flee the walled city in the distance.

               THE SCOTTISH ARMY

               has cut a huge tree and placed it on wheels. It rumbles 
               ominously TOWARD CAMERA...

               THE CIVILIAN PANIC CONTINUES as more people join the swell 
               of those leaving York.

               THE SCOTTISH ARMY keeps coming on.

               INSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY - DAY

               The governor is furious and confused.

                                     GOVERNOR
                         We will not allow a bandit to panic 
                         the greatest city in Northern England! 
                         Close off the escapes! Let no one 
                         leave!

                                     CAPTAIN
                         The city has emptied already, Sire. 
                         Only the Scottish civilians remain.

               The Governor turns to his captain with a look worthy of his 
               uncle, Longshanks the King.

               ON THE BATTERING RAM

               as it picks up speed and SLAMS into the wooden gate of the 
               city. With the collision, THE BATTLE IS ON. It's a night 
               battle: torches, flaming arrows, pots of boiling oil being 
               splashed down at the attackers, who swarm the gate.

               The oil beats the first wave of Scots back, but Wallace rushes 
               forward, grabbing the ram cart with his own hands; the 
               attackers rally to him, helping him slam the gate again and 
               again. It breaks; but behind it is an awful tangle of carts, 
               broken sheds, impenetrable rubbish. Wallace grabs a torch, 
               throws it into the wooden tangle, and shouts --

                                     WALLACE
                         Back! Wait for it to burn!

               INSIDE THE CITY

               The Captain hurries into the tower room.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         They've breached the wall!

                                     GOVERNOR
                         Then do as I ordered.

               OUTSIDE THE WALLS

               The Scots wait, biding their time as the barrier burns.

               Suddenly they look up in horror; the English are throwing 
               the bodies of hanged Scots over the wall.

               They stare at this in mute shock. Wallace is frozen, his 
               eyes reflecting his boyhood reaction. His men rush forward.

                                     WALLACE
                         STOP! NOT YET! LISTEN TO ME!
                              (beat)
                         They wish to frighten us! Or goad us 
                         into attacking too soon! Don't look 
                         away! LOOK!

               The Scots look at the hanging bodies.

                                     WALLACE
                         Behold the enemy we fight! We will 
                         be more merciful than they have been. 
                         We will spare women, children, and 
                         priests. For all else, no mercy.

               Wallace draws his broadsword. The burning debris inside the 
               gate collapses, leaving a tunnel through the fire. Wallace 
               screams, and leads the charge through the burning barrier.

               INT. THE PALACE IN LONDON - DAY

               Prince Edward and Phillip, his fencing friend and lover, 
               hear a contingent of horsemen clatter into the courtyard 
               below; they look out the window and see the arrival of 
               Longshanks.

               They lean back into the room and Edward begins to pace 
               nervously.

                                     PHILLIP
                         It is not your fault! Stand up to 
                         him.

               Edward shows Phillip the dagger he has concealed in his belt 
               behind his back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I will stand up to him, and more.

               Longshanks bangs the door open and stalks in angrily. First 
               he glares at Phillip with obvious loathing, then turns his 
               piercing stare to his own son.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         What news of the north?

                                     EDWARD
                         Nothing new, Majesty. We have sent 
                         riders to speed any word.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         While I am in France fighting to 
                         expand your future kingdom I learn 
                         that Stirling castle is lost, our 
                         entire northern army wiped out! And 
                         you have done nothing?!

                                     EDWARD
                         I have ordered conscriptions...

               A messenger enters and hands the prince a message. Edward 
               reads it and nearly loses his balance.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wallace has sacked York!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Impossible.
                              (to messenger)
                         How dare you bring a panicky lie.

               The messenger has also brought a basket. He approaches the 
               central table with great dread and places the basket on it, 
               uncovering its contents. Prince Edward is closest; he looks 
               in, then staggers back, stunned. Longshanks moves to the 
               sack coldly, looks in, and withdraws the severed head of his 
               nephew, York's (former) Governor.

                                     PHILLIP
                         Sire! Thy own nephew! What beast 
                         could do such a thing?!

               The king drops the head back into the sack, unmoved.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         If he can sack York, he can invade 
                         lower England.

                                     PHILLIP
                         We would stop him!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Edward, who is this shitpoker who 
                         speaks to me as if I needed his 
                         advice?

                                     EDWARD
                         I have declared Phillip my High 
                         Counselor.

               Longshanks nods as if impressed. He moves to Phillip and 
               examines the gold chain of office that the young man wears.

               Then Longshanks grabs him and throws him out the window, the 
               same one Edward and Phillip were looking out, six stories 
               above the courtyard. We hear Phillip's SCREAM as he falls.

               Edward rushes toward the window in horror. He looks out at 
               the result, turns back toward his father in shock and hatred, 
               and only then remembers the dagger and goes for it.

               He stabs at Longshanks; the old king smiles at the attack, 
               parrying, letting his arms be cut.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You fight back at last!

               Then Longshanks unleashes his own hateful fury; he grapples 
               with Edward, knocking the dagger away and hurling him to the 
               floor; then Longshanks kicks his son, again and again. He 
               exhausts his fury on him.

               Edward is a bloody mess; Longshanks coughs up a bit of blood.

               He ignores it and his son's wreckage, and goes back to the 
               discussion, as if this fight was normal business.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         We must sue for a truce, and buy him 
                         off. But who will go to him? Not I. 
                         If I came under the sword of this 
                         murderer, I would end up like my 
                         nephew. And not you, the sight of my 
                         faggot son would only encourage an 
                         enemy to take over this country. So 
                         whom do I send?

               Longshanks calculates.

               EXT. WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY

               A full encampment, across an English field; campfires chase 
               the dawn chill. Soldiers sharpen swords and spear points.

               Wallace is huddled with his inner circle, all except Campbell, 
               who receives a report from a scout.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         A royal entourage comes, flying 
                         banners of truce, and the standards 
                         of Longshanks himself!

               Wallace buckles on his sword.

               AN ENGLISH PAVILION TENT - YORKSHIRE - DAY

               Set up for a meeting in a sunny meadow. Wallace and his men 
               ride in, wary, ready for ambush. They surround the tent.

               There are two dozen royal soldiers there, but they make no 
               threatening moves.

               No sound from the tent. Wallace rests his hand on the handle 
               of his broadsword, ready.

                                     WALLACE
                         Longshanks! I have come.

               Servants pull back the sides of the tent door, and a tall, 
               slender, shapely female figure appears there. There in the 
               shadows, she looks just like Marion! William is not the only 
               one who notices the resemblance; he glances at Hamish and 
               Campbell and sees them haunted by it too. Is this another 
               dream? He pales, as she steps into the morning sun. She moves 
               toward him, her face lowered. It is Marion!

               She reaches him, lifts her face... and he sees the Princess!

               William is relieved -- and yet as he sees the Princess more 
               closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she 
               carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair.

               The Princess is struck with Wallace, too -- tall, powerful, 
               and commanding. Wallace dismounts, and moves to face her.

               Their eyes hang on each other. She sees something that she 
               has not seen in the face of a man in her whole life.

               She surprises him by bending at the knee, in a half-submissive 
               yet proud curtsey.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I am the Princess of Wales.

                                     WALLACE
                         Wife of Edward, the king's son?

               She nods; somehow she is already ashamed.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I come as the king's servant, and 
                         with his authority.

                                     WALLACE
                         It's battle I want, not talk.

                                     PRINCESS
                         But now that I am here, will you 
                         speak with a woman?

               She leads him under the pavilion, a purple canopy shading 
               rich carpets laid on the bare ground. Watching the gorgeous 
               walk, Stephen lies back on his saddle and twitches his leg 
               like a horny dog. Hamish backhands him; Campbell, Hamish and 
               Stephen quickly dismount and follow the procession, 
               shouldering their way in beside the Princess's French guards, 
               so they can watch Wallace's back. The rest of the Scots 
               surround the tent, ready for ambush.

               Nicolette is among the royal attendants there; seeing Wallace, 
               she shoots a glance at the Princess that says Ooo-La-La! The 
               servants have brought a throne for the Princess, a lower 
               chair for Wallace. She sits; he refuses the chair.

               She studies him, taking in his anger and his pride.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I understand that you have recently 
                         been given the rank of knight.

                                     WALLACE
                         I have been given nothing. God makes 
                         men what they are.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Did God make you the sacker of 
                         peaceful cities? The executioner of 
                         the king's nephew, my husband's own 
                         cousin?

                                     WALLACE
                         York was the staging point for every 
                         invasion of my country. And that 
                         royal cousin hanged a hundred Scots, 
                         even women and children, from the 
                         city walls.

                                     PRINCESS
                         That is not possible.

               But knowing Longshanks' family, she glances at a richly 
               dressed Advisor, a CRONY of the king, who averts his eyes.

                                     WALLACE
                         Longshanks did far worse, the last 
                         time he took a Scottish city.

               The Crony mumbles to her in LATIN, WITH SUBTITLES...

                                     CRONY
                              (Latin)
                         He is a murdering bandit, he lies.

                                     WALLACE
                              (Latin!)
                         I am no bandit. And I do not lie.

               They are startled at Wallace's fluency in Latin.

                                     WALLACE
                         Or in French if you prefer that: 
                         Certainmous et ver! Ask your king to 
                         his face, and see if his eyes can 
                         convince you of the truth.

               She stares for a long moment at Wallace's eyes.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Hamilton, leave us.

                                     CRONY (HAMILTON)
                         M'lady --

                                     PRINCESS
                         Leave us now.

               He reluctantly obeys. Seeing that she wants the exchange to 
               be private, Wallace turns and nods for his men to leave.

               Stephen, who has been admiring the lady's beauty non-stop, 
               leans in and whispers to William...

                                     STEPHEN
                         Her husband's more of a queen than 
                         she is. Did you know that?

               Stephen moves off with Hamish and Campbell. Wallace and the 
               princess are left alone.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Let us talk plainly. You invade 
                         England. But you cannot complete the 
                         conquest, so far from your shelter 
                         and supply. The King proposes that 
                         you withdraw your attack. In return 
                         he grants you title, estates, and 
                         this chest with a thousand pounds of 
                         gold, which I am to pay to you 
                         personally.

                                     WALLACE
                         A Lordship. And gold. That I should 
                         become Judas.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Peace is made is such ways.

                                     WALLACE
                         SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!

               The outburst startles even those watching from a distance.

               The Princess is mesmerized by Wallace's passion.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I understand you have suffered. I 
                         know... about your woman.

                                     WALLACE
                         She was my wife. We married in secret 
                         because I would not share her with 
                         an English lord. They killed her to 
                         get to me. And she was pregnant.

               The Princess is stunned; Wallace is dead still.

                                     WALLACE
                         I've never told anyone. I don't know 
                         why I tell you -- except because you 
                         look... much like her. And someday 
                         you will be a queen, and you must 
                         open your eyes!
                              (beat)
                         Tell your king that William Wallace 
                         will not be ruled. Nor will any Scot, 
                         while I live.

               The Princess rises slowly from her chair, moves in front of 
               him, and lowers herself to her knees. The Crony and her other 
               attendants, seeing this from a distance, are shocked.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Sir. I leave this money, as a gift. 
                         Not from the king, but from myself. 
                         And not to you, but to the orphans 
                         of your country.

               She lifts her face. Their eyes hold a moment too long.

               LATER, EXT. FIELD - DAY

               Wallace and his captains sit on horseback at the head of 
               their company and watch as the Princess' procession leaves.

               Hamish studies Wallace's face; Wallace notices and gives him 
               a non-committal shrug. As the carriage rolls away, its window 
               curtains lift back slightly. All they see are the Princess' 
               fingers, but they know she looked back. Wallace reins his 
               horse away, to ride back to camp.

               INT. EDWARD'S PALACE - DAY

               The doors open; the Princess enters Longshanks' war council; 
               Prince Edward is there, among a dozen others.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         My son's loyal wife returns, unkilled 
                         by the heathen. So he accepted our 
                         bribe.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No. He did not.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Then why does he stay? My scouts say 
                         he has not advanced.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He waits. For you. He says he will 
                         attack no more towns -- if you are 
                         man enough to come fight him.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You spoke with this Wallace in 
                         private. What kind of man is he?

                                     PRINCESS
                         ...A mindless barbarian. Not a king 
                         like you, M'lord.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         The Scottish nobles have sent him no 
                         support. His army starves. Our stall 
                         has worked, he must withdraw. You 
                         may return to your embroidery.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Humbly, M'lord.

               She barely curtseys, and starts out.

                                     EDWARD
                         You brought back the money, of course?

               He already knows she didn't; Hamilton is standing near him.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No. I have it to ease the suffering 
                         of the children of this war.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                              (glances at son)
                         This is what happens when you must 
                         send a woman. And a fool.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Forgive me, Sire. I thought that 
                         generosity might demonstrate your 
                         greatness to those you mean to rule.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         My greatness is better demonstrated 
                         with this.

               From a box at his feet the king withdraws a crossbow and 
               throws it onto the table. Most of those there are shocked.

                                     EDWARD
                         The weapon has been outlawed by the 
                         Pope himself!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         So the Scots will have none of them, 
                         will they? My armorers have already 
                         made a thousand.

               Longshanks smiles. No one notices that the Princess is deadly 
               pale.

               EXT. WALLACE ARMY CAMP - DAY

               The Scots are lining up to leave their encampment. Wallace 
               is about to give the signal to start the march when Hamish, 
               beside him, comes alert; a small group of riders in 
               distinctive attire are coming toward them; what can this be?

                                     HAMISH
                         William -- French guards?

               The riders stop at a distance, and out from their ranks comes 
               a single rider, sitting sidesaddle. It is Nicolette.

               Wallace and Hamish recognize her from the Princess's visit.

               She trots her horse the rest of the way, while the French 
               guards stay back. Hamish helps her from her horse. She moves 
               to Wallace, and opens the heavy folds of her heavy riding 
               cape.

               Secreted there, hung from a rope at her neck, is a crossbow.

               EXT. A FIELD IN SCOTLAND - DAY

               Wallace has gathered the nobles, among them Robert the Bruce, 
               Mornay, and old Craig, for a demonstration. Hamish and Stephen 
               have placed a spearman's chestplate against a bale of hay. 
               As William cranks the crossbow to its full cocked position 
               and places a bolt in its slot, Stephen tucks a melon behind 
               the armor.

               William aims... and fires. The bolt slashes through the air 
               and punches through the armor and the melon, leaving no doubt 
               what it would do to a man's heart. The nobles pale.

                                     CRAIG
                         That is why the Pope outlawed the 
                         weapon! It makes war too terrible.

                                     MORNAY
                         How many does Longshanks have?

                                     WALLACE
                         A thousand.
                              (beat)
                         You have made me Guardian of Scotland. 
                         So I tell you this is what we face.

                                     CRAIG
                         We must sue for peace.

                                     WALLACE
                         Peace?!

                                     CRAIG
                         We cannot defeat this --

                                     WALLACE
                         With cavalry -- not heavy, like the 
                         English, but light, fast horsemen, 
                         like you nobles employ -- we could 
                         outmaneuver their bowmen!

                                     CRAIG
                         It is suicide.

                                     ROBERT
                         Sir William --

               The Bruce sees Wallace about to explode, and tries to 
               intervene -- but Wallace's anger is too great.

                                     WALLACE
                         We won at Stirling and still you 
                         quibbled! We won at York and you 
                         would not support us! Then I said 
                         nothing! Now I say you are cowards!

               The nobles grip their weapons; Wallace, Hamish and Stephen 
               are ready to finish this quarrel right here. Robert the Bruce, 
               backed by Mornay, steps between the two sides.

                                     ROBERT
                         Please, Sir William! Speak with me 
                         alone! I beg you!

               The nobles stalk away, and Robert draws Wallace away, to the 
               target Wallace shot, so they are alone.

                                     ROBERT
                         You have achieved more than anyone 
                         dreamed. But fighting these odds 
                         looks like rage, not courage. Peace 
                         offers its rewards! Has war become a 
                         habit you cannot break?

               The question strikes deep.

                                     WALLACE
                         War finds me willing. I know it won't 
                         bring back all I have lost. But it 
                         can bring what none of us have ever 
                         had -- a country of our own. For 
                         that we need a king. We need you.

                                     ROBERT
                         I am trying.

                                     WALLACE
                         Then tell me what a king is! Is he a 
                         man who believes only what others 
                         believe? Is he one who calculates 
                         the numbers for and against him but 
                         never weighs the strength in your 
                         own heart? There is strength in you. 
                         I see it. I know it.

                                     ROBERT
                         I must... consult with my father.

                                     WALLACE
                         And I will consult with mine.

               Robert the Bruce walks off the field, heading the way the 
               other nobles went. Wallace rejoins Hamish and Stephen. They 
               look to him; what do we do now?

                                     WALLACE
                         Remember when the English turned 
                         their hounds on us? Maybe we should 
                         introduce them to our dogs.

               INT. THE DARKENED ROOM OF BRUCE THE ELDER, THE LEPER

               In the faint nimbus of the single candle, young Robert sits 
               across from his leper father. The son grips his own head, as 
               if stunned by a blow.

                                     ROBERT
                         This... cannot be the way.

                                     THE LEPER
                         You have said yourself that the nobles 
                         will not support Wallace, so how 
                         does it help us to join the side 
                         that is slaughtered?

               Heartsick, the father reaches across the table, then stays 
               his arm, unwilling to touch his son with his leprous hand.

                                     THE LEPER
                         My son. Look at me. I cannot be king. 
                         You, and you alone, can rule Scotland. 
                         What I tell you, you must do -- for 
                         yourself, and for your country.

               Young Robert holds his father with his eyes, and does not 
               look away.

               EXT. THE BATTLE OF FALKIRK - DAY

               The Scottish army moves out onto the hilly plain, covered in 
               the gray mists. They see glimpses of the enemy in the 
               distance. Wallace deploys the Scots: Campbell with the 
               schiltrons (spear formations), Stephen with the infantry, 
               the noble Mornay leading the cavalry, and with Wallace and 
               Hamish on horseback, looking over the field. Hamish sees 
               gazing up at an empty hill above the field.

                                     HAMISH
                         The Bruce is not coming, William.

                                     WALLACE
                         Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.

               He'd better, the odds look long. And it's nasty ground; one 
               side of the field is ankle deep in water, and the English 
               are covering it with a layer of burning oil, releasing thick 
               smoke to hide their movements.

                                     WALLACE
                         Stephen ready?

                                     HAMISH
                         Aye.

               The Priest from their home village is moving through the 
               Scottish ranks, dispensing absolution. He reaches the two 
               friends, who accept the Host, say their own last prayers, 
               and give each other a look of goodbye. Hamish rides off to 
               join the schiltrons.

               LONGSHANKS AND HIS GENERALS

               on the opposite side of the field, send their army forward.

               WALLACE AND THE SCOTS

               see them through the smoke; Wallace spots what he's looking 
               for: there they are, the ranks of crossbowmen!

               And as they draw nearer, Wallace hears a haunting noise. He 
               sees the bowmen more clearly, and the English infantry. Some 
               are wearing kilts and marching to bagpipes.

                                     WALLACE
                         Irish troops!

               STEPHEN OF IRELAND, WITH THE SCOTTISH INFANTRY

               He stares at the approach of his countrymen. Wallace appears 
               beside him. Stephen sees him, and is ashamed.

                                     STEPHEN
                         So that's where Longshanks got his 
                         soldiers. Irishmen, willing to kill 
                         Scottish cousins for the English.

                                     WILLIAM
                         Their families are starving, they'll 
                         feed them however they can. If you 
                         don't want to fight them --

                                     STEPHEN
                         No. I'll stand with you.

               Loyal to the end. Wallace signals to Hamish and Campbell, 
               among the schiltrons. The formations, bristling with spears, 
               move forward. Hamish looks back at Wallace; both men know 
               the spearmen are the bait here. Wallace and Stephen see the 
               English heavy cavalry advancing.

                                     STEPHEN
                         They can't be that stupid to attack 
                         the schiltrons again.

               Wallace is scanning the battlefield. He sees the English 
               cavalry charge, but before they reach the bristling spears, 
               they pull up, and crossbowmen, moving up behind the knights.

                                     WALLACE
                         It's only a faint to shield the 
                         crossbows!

               The crossbowmen fire a volley, too hurriedly. We see the 
               hailstorm of bolts slash through the air in unison -- you 
               can actually see them coming. The bows fall short of the 
               front ranks of the schiltrons.

                                     WALLACE
                         Now! Give 'em the dogs!

               Stephen signals, and up the slope behind them come handlers 
               with ten war dogs.

               Huge mastiffs, they wear steel collars, with razor sharp 
               protrusions. Their handlers hold them at the end of long 
               catch poles. The crossbowmen are distracted from their 
               reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the 
               Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash 
               the dogs, fear races through the English line.

               The dogs tear into them. It is chaos; the bowmen can't flee, 
               and as the dogs mix among them, the bowmen fire frantically, 
               mostly hitting each other. The dogs' collars slash legs; 
               their jaws crush bones; even when their back legs are hacked 
               off, the frenzied dogs keep killing.

               Wallace signals to Mornay with the Scottish cavalry. Mornay 
               does nothing. The crossbowmen, though taking great punishment, 
               are beginning to overwhelm the dogs by sheer numbers, and 
               are regrouping.

                                     WALLACE
                         Now! Charge! Charge them!

               Mornay tugs his reins and leads his cavalry away.

               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND

               Longshanks and his officers see Mornay and his cavalry melt 
               away. The English general looks knowingly at Longshanks.

                                     GENERAL
                         Mornay?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         For double his lands in Scotland, 
                         and matching estates in England.

               WALLACE, WITH STEPHEN

               They see the Scottish army abandoned.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Betrayed!

               Wallace glances to the other hilltop; still no sign of Bruce.

               He looks on in agony as the crossbowmen unleash another 
               volley. The Scottish spearmen, bunched in a tight group, are 
               helpless. The bolts fall, cutting through their helmets and 
               breastplates like paper. Wallace has no cavalry -- and his 
               men are being slaughtered! He spurs his horse, and Stephen 
               and the infantrymen race behind him.

               The English heavy cavalry surge to meet them, but Wallace 
               weaves through them, dodging with his horse, slashing with 
               the broadsword, cutting down on knight, another, another...

               The Scottish infantry claws in, dragging down the horses, 
               hacking the knights as they run by.

               The English bowmen are about to fire again, but they see the 
               Scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim; 
               the bolts cut into the infantrymen; one bolt tears off the 
               armor of Wallace's left shoulder. He wobbles on his horse, 
               regains his balance, and keeps up the charge.

               AT THE ENGLISH COMMAND

               Longshanks and his generals are watching the action.

                                     GENERAL
                         My God, and still they come!

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Use the reinforcements! But take 
                         Wallace alive!

               The General signals and the English reinforcements surge 
               into the battle.

               IN THE THICK OF THE BATTLE

               On horseback, Wallace fights his way into the watery edge of 
               the field, where English infantry is now overrunning the 
               schiltron. He hacks men down left and right, reaches the 
               Scottish center, and finds Hamish bending over another 
               soldier. Wallace dismounts.

                                     WALLACE
                         Hamish! Ham --

               And Wallace sees that Hamish is holding his father, fallen 
               in battle. Wallace has no time to react; he cuts down and 
               English swordsman moving in to hack Hamish's back. Wallace 
               lifts Campbell across the saddle, and shouts at Hamish...

                                     WALLACE
                         Get him away!

               Hamish obeys, jumping onto the horse and galloping back toward 
               the rear. Wallace fights with new vengeance, swinging the 
               double-edged broadsword with deadly accuracy.

               Rallied by Wallace's presence, the Scots surge back. Then 
               Wallace sees the English reinforcement cavalry coming.

                                     WALLACE
                         A charge! Form up! Form up!

               The Scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron.

               The spears bristle out, ready... the English horsemen thunder 
               in. But before the spears impale the horses, another flight 
               of crossbow bolts cuts down half the Scots still fighting.

               Hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp 
               body of his father to the Scottish monks who are attending 
               to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying...

               Still Wallace fights back, meeting the English charge. The 
               Scots hold their own. An English knight tries to ride over 
               William; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams 
               into him, William also unseats the rider.

               The rider rolls to his feet. William struggles up to meet 
               him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce.

               The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment, 
               looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he 
               understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of 
               Scotland. As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the 
               muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it.

               Bruce is horrified at the sight of Wallace this way. He 
               batters at Wallace's sword, as if its use would give him 
               absolution.

                                     ROBERT
                         Fight me! Fight me!

               But Wallace can only stagger back. Bruce's voice grows ragged 
               as he screams.

                                     ROBERT
                         FIGHT ME!

               All around, the battle has decayed; the Scots are being 
               slaughtered. Another bolt glances off Wallace's helmet; a 
               third rips into his thigh plate, making his legs collapse.

               Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!

               He hits Robert from behind, knocking him down, and jumps to 
               the ground to try and lift William onto the horse!

               Robert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up, sighting out 
               Wallace, taking careful aim! Bruce leaps up and helps Stephen 
               sling Wallace onto the back of the horse, even covers him 
               with his shield, deflecting another bolt fired at Wallace, 
               as Stephen mounts too.

               As the horse plunges away into the smoke, Robert falls to 
               the water. His own troops reach him, realize who he is, see 
               the horrible expression on his face, and race on after the 
               Scots.

               Robert is left alone, on his knees in the water, the fire 
               and noise of battle now dim to him, as if his senses have 
               died along with his heart.

               LONGSHANKS

               Looks over the battlefield, strewn with the bodies of the 
               Scottish dead. For now, he is satisfied.

               EXT. ROAD - SUNSET

               Remnants of the defeated army straggle past. Wallace and 
               Stephen are trying to help Hamish carry his father, but now 
               old Campbell says...

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Son... I want to die on the ground.

               But as they tilt old Campbell onto the ground, he grabs at 
               something that starts to fall from the wound in his stomach.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         Whew. That'll clear your sinuses. 
                         Goodbye, boys.

                                     HAMISH
                         No. You're going to live.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         I don't think I can do without one 
                         of those... whatever it is...

               Hamish is too grief-stricken to speak.

                                     WALLACE
                         You... were like my father...

               Old Campbell rallies one more time for this.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         ...And glad to die, like him... So 
                         you could be the men you are. All of 
                         ya.

               The last three words to Hamish, telling him he's a hero too.

                                     CAMPBELL
                         I'm a happy man.

               Hamish is weeping. When he looks up again, his father has 
               died. We PULL BACK from them in tableaux, with the army, the 
               people of Scotland, the whole gray world in defeat.

               INT. EDINBURGH CASTLE - DAY

               Wallace, still bloody and in his battered armor, removes the 
               chain of office from beneath his breastplate, lays it onto 
               the table in front of Craig and the other nobles, and walks 
               from the room. Hamish and Stephen see the satisfaction on 
               the nobles' face, and follow William out.

               INT. CASTLE CORRIDOR - DAY

               Hamish and Stephen move out into the hallway after Wallace -- 
               but he is gone.

               EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

               Wallace is in the woods, in the grove of trees, looking at 
               Marion's hidden grave. The rain falls on his face, like tears. 
               But he has no tears of his own. The cold, the icy rain, the 
               wounds, nothing seems to touch him.

               With his fingertips he carefully draws her embroidered cloth 
               from beneath his breastplate; hanging in his trembling hands, 
               filthy with the grime and gore of battle, it looks impossibly 
               white, something from a better, purer world.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. PALACE IN LONDON - NIGHT

               Thunder, the sound of driving rain. Snug by a massive fire 
               are Longshanks, his son Edward, and other advisors. On the 
               far side of the room, away from the fire, the Princess stands 
               at the window and watches the rain against the panes.

                                     ADVISOR
                         Their nobles have sworn allegiance, 
                         M'lord. Every last one.

               Longshanks savors the victory -- and gloats to his son.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Now we kill two birds at one stroke. 
                         We recruit from Scotland for our 
                         armies in France.

                                     EDWARD
                         The Scots will fight for us?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         What choice do they have? Now they 
                         must serve us or starve.

                                     EDWARD
                         But if we have not caught Wallace --

                                     LONGSHANKS
                              (exploding)
                         He is gone! Finished! Dead! If he 
                         has not yet bled to death or had his 
                         throat cut for him, he will not 
                         survive the winter. It is very cold -- 
                         is it not, our flower?

               From the other side of the window, we see the Princess as 
               she hears him, but doesn't turn around. She looks at the 
               window, we snow swirling among the raindrops outside. Her 
               eyes glisten, and her breath fogs the glass.

               INT. BRUCE'S DARKENED CHAMBER

               The elder Bruce, his decaying features sagging from his face, 
               stares across the table at his son.

                                     LEPER
                         I am the one who is rotting. But I 
                         think your face looks graver than 
                         mine.

                                     ROBERT
                         He was so brave. With courage alone 
                         he nearly won.

                                     LEPER
                         So more men were slaughtered 
                         uselessly!

                                     ROBERT
                         He broke because of me. I saw it. He 
                         lost all will to fight.

                                     LEPER
                         We must have alliance with England 
                         to prevail here. You achieved that! 
                         You saved your family, increased 
                         your lands! In time you will have 
                         all the power in Scotland!... Yet 
                         you grieve.

                                     ROBERT
                         In my heart I had begun to hope that 
                         he would never break.

                                     LEPER
                         All men lose heart. All betray. It 
                         is exactly why we must make the 
                         choices we make.

               INT. MORNAY'S CASTLE - NIGHT

               Mornay, in an opulent bedchamber hung with tapestries and 
               carpeted with eastern rugs, lies in bed, tossing in the 
               restless sleep of a tortured soul.

               He thinks he hears galloping. In SUBLIMINAL FLASHES he DREAMS 
               of Wallace riding toward him.

               He wakes, and listens to a strange noise. It is hoofbeats!

               Coming closer. He hears shouts too, screams from below -- 
               and those strange, approaching hoofbeats...

               WALLACE, ON HORSEBACK

               rides up the circular stairs inside Mornay's castle! His 
               horse bounds up the stone -- Mornay's guards are behind him, 
               on foot, pursuing.

               At a landing, Wallace cuts down a guard, and gallops higher.

               IN HIS BED, MORNAY

               sits up gawking as the door explodes inward and Wallace rides 
               through! Mornay is frozen. Wallace slashes him down.

               Out in the corridor, the guards gather; they have Wallace 
               trapped. He covers the horse's eyes with a cloth and spurs 
               his flanks. The blind animal runs through the window!

               EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT - SLOW MOTION

               The horse and rider plunge past the sheer walls of the 
               castle... and into the loch! Mornay's guards and the castle 
               servants cluster at the windows to see Wallace and the horse 
               surface, and swim to the shore, escaping!

               EXT. SCOTTISH VILLAGE - DAY

               The news has spread through the countryside. In the town 
               square, drunken Scotsmen chant...

                                     PEOPLE
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

               Old Craig rides past them, heading toward the Bruce's castle 
               on the hill above the town.

               INT. BRUCE CASTLE - DAY

               Robert is in his central room; he hears the chanting from 
               far below. Old Craig enters.

                                     ROBERT
                         Is it true about Mornay?

               Craig hands him the bloody nightshirt Mornay was wearing.

                                     ROBERT
                         And he rode through the window? My 
                         God.

               He can't hide his admiration. From below, he still hears the 
               people CHANTING...

               EXT. LONDON - GARDENS - DAY

               Longshanks and Edward are in the royal gardens, resplendent 
               with spring. Longshanks pulls a new flower, and crushes it.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         His legend grows! It will be worse 
                         than before!

                                     EDWARD
                         You let Wallace escape your whole 
                         army. You cannot blame me for this.

               Longshanks glowers at his son; the Princess arrives.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Good day to you, M'Lords.

                                     EDWARD
                         You mock us with a smile?

                                     PRINCESS
                         I am cheerful with a plan to soothe 
                         your miseries. All of England shudders 
                         with the news of renewed rebellion.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wallace's followers.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Wallace himself. If you wish to 
                         pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers 
                         in every Scottish town, I leave you 
                         to your hauntings. If you wish to 
                         take him, I know a way.

               Edward snickers in derision -- but his wife is steel.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I have faced him. Have you?

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         Let her speak.

                                     PRINCESS
                         He will fight you forever. But what 
                         does he fight for? Freedom first, 
                         and peace. So grant them.

                                     EDWARD
                         The little cow is insane --

                                     PRINCESS
                         Grant, as you do everything else, 
                         with treachery. Offer him a truce to 
                         discuss terms, and send me to my 
                         castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. 
                         He trusts me. Pick thirty of your 
                         finest assassins for me to take along. 
                         And I will set the meeting, and the 
                         ambush.

                                     LONGSHANKS
                         You see, my delicate son? I have 
                         picked you a Queen.

               EXT. THE PRINCESS' SCOTTISH CASTLE - DAY

               Locharmbie is a small, picturesque castle on a hillside. As 
               the queen's entourage moves through the gates, they close 
               behind her. She steps out of the carriage and moves into

               INT. CASTLE - THE GREAT HALL - DAY

               Inside the great hall are thirty killers, led by their CHIEF 
               ASSASSIN, a cutthroat with a mangled eye.

                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
                         We came in small groups, so the rebels 
                         would not suspect.

                                     PRINCESS
                         And you have reached Wallace's men?

                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
                         We tell the villagers, and the 
                         traitors pass it on. All that's left 
                         is for you to say where.

               EXT. MARION'S GROVE - NIGHT

               Wallace is in the grove of trees where Marion is buried.

               Drinking in the silence, his own isolation. He hears a RUSTLE 
               behind him, and spins, drawing the broadsword. Then his face 
               registers... it's Hamish and Stephen.

               Hamish is unsure if he did the right thing in coming here -- 
               unsure, until Wallace moves to them, and hugs them.

               INT. CAVE - NIGHT

               They are in the old secret cave; rain is falling, but it's 
               dry inside, with a campfire smoldering at the entrance.

                                     WALLACE
                         Thanks for the food and drink. And 
                         for bringing 'em yourselves.

                                     HAMISH
                         We're here to stay. We don't care to 
                         live, if we can't fight beside ya.

               Stephen pulls a jug of whiskey from his pocket. He swigs, 
               hands it to Hamish for a chug, then to Wallace, who declines, 
               but smiles for the first time in many weeks.

                                     HAMISH
                         There is... one thing, William. 
                         Longshanks is offering a truce. He 
                         has dispatched his daughter-in-law 
                         as his emissary, and she has sent 
                         word that she wishes to meet you -- 
                         in a barn.

               Wallace frowns; a barn?

               EXT. A BARN IN THE SCOTTISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               Hauntingly similar to the one in Wallace's childhood. As he 
               sits on his horse and looks at the place, surmounted by a 
               white flag of truce, it gives him a chill. But in full view 
               of the barn, he hands Hamish his sword and rides forward.

               INSIDE THE BARN

               are the assassins, killing knives ready.

                                     CHIEF ASSASSIN
                         It's William Wallace, sure! And... 
                         he's given up his sword! Be ready!

               They position themselves at every entrance.

               OUTSIDE THE BARN

               Wallace reaches the barn, dismounts, and moves toward the 
               door. But suddenly, instead of entering, he grabs the heavy 
               bar and seals the door! At this motion, Scots spring from 
               the woods in all directions. The assassins inside realize 
               the ambush is being turned on them, but it's too late; they 
               hear the entrance being sealed from the outside.

               More Scots, led by Stephen, scramble up from hiding, place 
               tinder-dry brush and pitch against the barn, and set it on 
               fire. In moments the entire barn is blazing. The Scots stand 
               back and watch the barn burn, their faces lit by the flames. 
               After awhile, there are no more screams from inside.

               EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT

               The Princess sees the burning off in the distance, like a 
               bonfire. She stands on the wall, looking out at it. And then 
               she sees, on a hillside, silhouetted against the night and 
               the fire, a rider, just sitting there on his horse, looking 
               at the castle. She runs into the castle, up the stairs, and 
               stands on the pinnacle of the castle, so that she too is 
               silhouetted, and he can see her.

               The lone rider is William Wallace.

               CLOSE - A CANDLE

               being placed in a window of the stable cottage, built into 
               the outer wall of the castle. AT A DISTANCE, the candle burns 
               like a tiny beacon. And William sees it.

               INSIDE THE STABLE COTTAGE, THE PRINCESS

               sits alone, wondering if her signal is going to work.

               OUTSIDE THE CASTLE

               Wallace climbs the castle wall, hand over hand up the mortared 
               stones, to the window twenty feet above the ground.

               He reaches the safety of the window cove and kneels on the 
               ledge. He looks through the window, and sees her inside.

               INSIDE THE ROOM, she looks up, and sees him there. The first 
               glance frightens her, and yet she expected him, prayed for 
               him to come. Now, for a long, long moment the two of them 
               look at each other through the glass, each realizing the 
               implications of this moment.

               She moves to the window and opens it. The wind rushing through 
               extinguishes the candle, and he slips inside. They face each 
               other in the darkness. Then she strikes a match and relights 
               the candle, and they look at each other.

                                     WALLACE
                         A meeting in a barn. It had to be a 
                         trap. And only you would know I would 
                         be aware of it.

                                     PRINCESS
                         It does me good to see you.

                                     WILLIAM
                         I am much diminished since we met.

               She wants to say something -- but instead she says something 
               else.

                                     PRINCESS
                         There will be a new shipment of 
                         supplies coming north next month. 
                         Food and weapons. They will trav --

                                     WILLIAM
                         No. Stop. I didn't come here for 
                         that.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Then why did you come?

                                     WALLACE
                         Why did you?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Because of the way you're looking at 
                         me now. The same way... as when we 
                         met.

               He turns his face away. Gently, she pulls it back.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I know. You looked at me... and saw 
                         her.

               He twists back toward the window.

                                     PRINCESS
                         You must forgive me what I feel. No 
                         man has ever looked at me as you 
                         did.

               Surprised, he looks at her now.

                                     WALLACE
                         You have... you have a husband.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I have taken vows. More than one. 
                         I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, 
                         and sworn to give him a son. And I 
                         cannot keep both promises.

               Slowly, it starts to dawn on him what she's asking, and an 
               unexpected smile plays at his lips. Her smile lights too.

                                     PRINCESS
                         You understand. Consider, before you 
                         laugh and say no. You will never own 
                         a throne, though you deserve one. 
                         But just as the sun will rise 
                         tomorrow, some man will rule England. 
                         And what if his veins ran not with 
                         the blood of Longshanks, but with 
                         that of a true king?

                                     WALLACE
                         I cannot love you for the sake of 
                         revenge.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No. But can you love me for the sake 
                         of all you loved and lost? Or simply 
                         love me... because I love you?

               Slowly, he reaches to the candle flame, and pinches it out.

               IN THE SHADOWS OF THE COTTAGE BED

               we see the surging, pent-up passion... and

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE LOVERS

               Their bodies limp, they lie asleep, entwined. The first rays 
               of morning spread yellow light through the room and across 
               their faces.

               Wallace wakes suddenly; sunlight! He grabs for his clothes, 
               as she wakes, covers herself in the blanket and jumps out of 
               bed, rushing to the window to look out.

                                     PRINCESS
                         No one! Hurry!

               He reaches her, throws the window open, and sees a clear 
               path down the wall to safety. He stops and looks at her, and 
               touches her face in gratitude. She has to ask...

                                     PRINCESS
                         When we... did you think of her?

               Pausing to look straight into her eyes, he kisses her -- 
               her, not Marion -- and climbs out. She watches him go.

               EXT. GROVE OF TREES - NIGHT

               Wallace stands alone in the grove where Marion lies.

               MONTAGE

               -- Wallace and fifty men gallop through a village on the way 
               to an English fortress; the villagers drop what they're doing 
               and run to follow them; we see Wallace's face, relentless, 
               as he hacks men down in the attack; with the fortress sacked 
               and smoking in the background, we see Wallace lead his men 
               away, the people cheering him...

               EXT. FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               Once again, Wallace stares at the fire, beside his friends.

                                     HAMISH
                         Rest, William.

                                     WALLACE
                         I rest.

                                     HAMISH
                         Your rest is making me exhausted.

               Stephen offers the jug; Wallace declines.

                                     STEPHEN
                         Come, it'll help you sleep.

                                     WALLACE
                         Aye. But it won't let me dream.

               Pulling a tattered tartan around himself, he lies down.

               LONGSHANKS, INT. HIS PALACE - NIGHT

               He sits by a palace hearth, where a huge blaze burns; still 
               he's huddled beneath a blanket, and coughing blood. But he 
               ignores the ice in his lungs; his mind is plotting.

               THE PRINCESS, EXT. THE WALLS OF HER CASTLE - NIGHT

               she walks the parapets alone, lost in her own thoughts.

               ROBERT THE BRUCE, IN A STONE ROOM OF HIS CASTLE

               sits staring at... the stone coffin of his father. The coffin 
               is closed; on its top is a lifesize stone carving of his 
               father as a knight in final repose. Ranks of candles light 
               the scene, and Robert's face, cold as the stone. A SHUFFLE... 
               Robert looks up to see old Craig.

                                     CRAIG
                         May he rest in peace... You have 
                         already sealed the coffin?

                                     ROBERT
                         He was a modest man.

                                     CRAIG
                         It will not be long before Longshanks 
                         too is encased in stone, and his 
                         crowns divided for others to wear.

               Craig sits next to Robert, and keeps his voice low.

                                     CRAIG
                         Our nobles are frightened and 
                         confused... Wallace has the commoners 
                         stirred up again, from the Highland 
                         clans to the lowland villages. In 
                         another six months Christ and the 
                         Apostles could not govern this 
                         country.

               Robert only stares at his father's stone coffin.

                                     CRAIG
                         Longshanks knows his son will scarcely 
                         be able to rule England, much less 
                         half of France. He needs Scotland 
                         settled, and he trusts you, after 
                         Falkirk. If you pay him homage, he 
                         will recognize you as king of 
                         Scotland. Our nobles have agreed to 
                         this as well.

               He shows Robert a parchment bearing the noblest names in 
               Scotland. The Bruce barely glances at it.

                                     ROBERT
                         If I pay homage to another's throne, 
                         then how am I a king?

                                     CRAIG
                         Homage is nothing. It is the crown 
                         that matters!

                                     ROBERT
                         The crown is that of Scotland. And 
                         Scotland is William Wallace.

                                     CRAIG
                         That is another matter. There is a 
                         price to all this, required both by 
                         Longshanks and our nobles. Pay it, 
                         and you will be our king. And we 
                         will have peace.

               Robert turns from his father's coffin, to look at Craig.

               EXT. FOREST ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

               A commotion; the nobles, their heads hooded, are led in on 
               horseback by guerrillas from the village. The nobles stop, 
               feel their hoods pulled off, and see Wallace.

                                     CRAIG
                         Sir William. We come to seek a 
                         meeting.

                                     WALLACE
                         You've all sworn to Longshanks.

                                     CRAIG
                         An oath to a liar is no oath at all. 
                         An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. 
                         Every man of us is ready to swear 
                         loyalty to you.

                                     WALLACE
                         So let the council swear publicly.

                                     CRAIG
                         We cannot. Some scarcely believe you 
                         are alive. Other think you'll pay 
                         them Mornay's wages. We bid you to 
                         Edinburgh. Meet us at the city gates, 
                         two days from now, at sunset. Pledge 
                         us your pardon and we will unite 
                         behind you. Scotland will be one.

               Wallace glances at Hamish and Stephen, who can barely hide 
               their contempt. Wallace looks at the nobles.

                                     WALLACE
                         I will meet you, but only one way -- 
                         if Robert the Bruce is there, and 
                         puts his hand on my Bible, and swears 
                         his loyalty to Scotland.

                                     CRAIG
                         He has already agreed to come.

               EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

               Wallace stands alone, looking at the moon and stars. Hamish 
               moves up and sits down beside him.

                                     HAMISH
                         You know it's a trap.

                                     WALLACE
                         Probably. But we can't win alone. We 
                         know that. This is the only way.

                                     HAMISH
                         I don't want to be a martyr.

                                     WALLACE
                         Nor I! I want to live! I want a home 
                         and children and peace. I've asked 
                         god for those things. But He's brought 
                         me this sword. And if He wills that 
                         I must lay it down to have what He 
                         wants for my country, then I'll do 
                         that too.

                                     HAMISH
                         That's just a dream, William!

                                     WALLACE
                         We've lived a dream together. A dream 
                         of freedom!

                                     HAMISH
                         Your dreams aren't about freedom! 
                         They're about Marion! You have to be 
                         a hero, because you think she sees 
                         you! Is that it?

                                     WALLACE
                         My dreams of Marion are gone. I killed 
                         them myself. If I knew I could live 
                         with her on the other side of death, 
                         I'd welcome it.

               EXT. ROAD INTO EDINBURGH - SUNSET

               William, Hamish, and Stephen are on their horses, looking 
               down at the road leading into the city. Wallace hands his 
               dagger to Stephen, and unbuckles his broadsword and gives it 
               to Hamish.

                                     HAMISH
                         Keep these. We're going too.

                                     WALLACE
                         No. One of us is enough.

               Wallace hugs them, first Stephen, then Hamish. Tears roll 
               down Hamish's cheeks. With one last look at his friends, 
               Wallace rides away.

               EXT. LARGE ESTATE HOUSE - SUNSET

               The house looks quiet as Wallace rides toward it.

               INT. ESTATE HOUSE - DAY

               Robert the Bruce and Craig stand at the hearth, tense.

                                     CRAIG
                         He won't come.

                                     ROBERT
                         He will. I know he will.

               They hear the approach of a single horse. The Bruce looks 
               out to see Wallace arriving.

                                     ROBERT
                         Here. And unarmed. My God, he has a 
                         brave heart.

               OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

               Wallace dismounts and enters.

               INT. THE HOUSE

               Wallace appears at the doorway into the main room, and stops.

               Bruce faces him. The eyes of BOTH MEN meet, saying everything. 
               Wallace steps into the room. He sees something flicker onto 
               Bruce's face -- shame -- just as henchmen in the rafters 
               drop a weighted net and it envelopes Wallace.

               English soldiers spring from the closets, run down the stairs, 
               and tumble over him, ripping at his clothes, searching as if 
               broadswords might spring from his boots.

               They bind Wallace hand and foot. He stares at Robert the 
               Bruce, who averts his eyes. The soldiers hurry Wallace out 
               the back, where others are bringing up horses. Robert grabs 
               the English Captain of the soldiers.

                                     ROBERT
                         He is not to be harmed. I have your 
                         king's absolute promise that he will 
                         be imprisoned only!

               The Captain looks at Bruce the way the High Priest must have 
               looked at Judas, and leaves.

                                     CRAIG
                         Now we will have peace.

               Robert the Bruce spots something on the floor that must have 
               fallen from Wallace's clothes as they grabbed him; Bruce 
               lifts the white handkerchief, and sees the familiar thistle 
               embroidered on it.

               EXT. ROAD - NORTHERN ENGLAND - DAY

               A procession of heavily armed English soldiers winds its way 
               toward London, Wallace strapped to an unsaddled horse, his 
               head bare to the sun. Country people come out to jeer...

                                     PEOPLE
                         Don't look so fearsome, does he?!

               A thrown rock careens off Wallace's check; rotten fruit slaps 
               his shirt. His lips are so parched they bleed.

               INT. ROYAL PALACE - LONGSHANKS' BEDROOM - DAY

               Edward inspects his father, who lies semiconscious in bed, 
               breath rattling ominously in his chest. Edward approves.

               INT. THE PALACE HALLWAY - DAY

               The Princess hurries up to her husband as he leaves the king's 
               bedroom, and follows him down the hall to his own.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Is it true? Wallace is captured?

                                     EDWARD
                         Simply because he eluded your trap, 
                         do you think he is more than a man? 
                         My father is dying. Perhaps you should 
                         think of our coronation.

                                     PRINCESS
                         When will his trial be?

                                     EDWARD
                         Wallace's? For treason there is no 
                         trial. Tomorrow he will be charged, 
                         then executed.

               With a faint smile, he shuts his bedroom door in her face.

               INT. ROBERT THE BRUCE'S CASTLE - DAY

               The Bruce is incredulous, yelling at Craig.

                                     ROBERT
                         Longshanks promised!

                                     CRAIG
                         You are surprised he would lie? 
                         Balliol was murdered in a church 
                         yesterday. You are Longshanks' new 
                         designate. You will be king.

               INT. TOWER DUNGEON

               Wallace stands in medieval restraints worthy of Hannibal 
               Lecter. Before him are six scarlet-robed royal magistrates.

                                     ROYAL MAGISTRATE
                         William Wallace! You stand in taint 
                         of high treason.

               We PUSH IN on the iron mask that binds his face. We can only 
               see his eyes -- but they are bright.

                                     WALLACE
                         Treason. Against whom?

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Against thy king, thou vile fool! 
                         Hast thou anything to say?

                                     WALLACE
                         Never, in my whole life, did I swear 
                         allegiance to your king --

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         It matters not, he is thy king!

                                     WALLACE
                         -- while many who serve him have 
                         taken and broken his oath many times. 
                         I cannot commit treason, if I have 
                         never been his subject!

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Confess, and you may receive a quick 
                         death. Deny, and you must be purified 
                         by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU 
                         CONFESS?!

                                     WALLACE
                         I do not confess.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Then on the morrow, thou shalt receive 
                         they purification... And in the end, 
                         I promise you'll beg for the axe.

               EXT. ESTABLISHING - THE TOWER

               The stone prison, and the wretched stone section known to 
               this day as the Wallace Tower.

               INT. PRISON - NIGHT

               Wallace is alone in his cell, still in the garish restraints.

               We can only see his eyes, as he prays.

                                     WALLACE
                         I am so afraid... Give me strength.

               OUTSIDE THE CELL DOOR

               The jailers jump to their feet as the Princess enters.

                                     JAILER
                         Your Highness!

                                     PRINCESS
                         I will see the prisoner.

                                     JAILER
                         We've orders from the king --

                                     PRINCESS
                         The king will be dead in a month! 
                         And his son is a weakling! Who do 
                         you think will rule this kingdom? 
                         Now OPEN THIS DOOR!

               The jailer obeys. The Princess can barely contain her shock 
               at the sight of Wallace; the jailers snatch him upright.

                                     JAILER
                         On your feet, you filth!

                                     PRINCESS
                         Stop! Leave me!
                              (they hesitate)
                         There is no way out of this hell! 
                         Leave me with him!

               Reluctantly the jailers shuffle out of the cell, but they 
               can still see her back and hear her. Looking at Wallace's 
               eyes through the mask, she can't quite hold back her tears -- 
               dangerous tears, that threaten to say too much. Wallace tries 
               to distract her.

                                     WALLACE
                         M'lady... what kindness of you to 
                         visit a stranger.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Sir, I... come to beg you to confess 
                         all, and swear allegiance to the 
                         king, that he might show you mercy.

                                     WALLACE
                         Will he show mercy to my country? 
                         Will he take back his soldiers, and 
                         let us rule ourselves?

                                     PRINCESS
                         Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps 
                         even live in the Tower. In time, who 
                         knows what can happen, if you can 
                         only live.

                                     WALLACE
                         If I swear to him, then everything I 
                         am is dead already.

               She wants to plead, she wants to scream. She can't stop the 
               tears. And the jailers are watching.

                                     WALLACE
                         Your people are lucky to have a 
                         princess so kind that she can grieve 
                         at the death of a stranger.

               She almost goes too far now, pulling closer to him -- but 
               she doesn't care. She whispers, pleading...

                                     PRINCESS
                         You will die! It will be awful!

                                     WALLACE
                         Every man dies. Not every man really 
                         lives.

               She pulls out a hidden vial, and whispers...

                                     PRINCESS
                         Drink this! It will dull your pain.

                                     WALLACE
                         It will numb my wits, and I must 
                         have them all. If I'm senseless, or 
                         if I wail, then Longshanks will have 
                         broken me.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I can't bear the thought of your 
                         torture. Take it!

               On the verge of hysteria, she presses the vial to the air 
               hole at his mouth and pours in the drug. The jailers, seeing 
               suspicious movement, shift inside the cell; she backs up, 
               her eyes wide, full of love and goodbye. From inside the 
               mask, he watches her go. When the door CLANGS shut, he spits 
               the purple drug out through the mouth hole.

               INT. LONGSHANKS' BEDCHAMBER - NIGHT

               Longshanks lies helpless, his body racked with consumption.

               Edward sits against the wall, watching him die, glee in his 
               eyes. The Princess enters, and marches to the bedside.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I have come to beg for the life of 
                         William Wallace.

                                     EDWARD
                         You fancy him.

                                     PRINCESS
                         I respect him. At worst he was a 
                         worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou 
                         great king... and win the respect of 
                         your own people.

               Longshanks shakes his head.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Even now, you are incapable of mercy?

               The king can't speak. But hatred still glows in his eyes.

               The princess looks at her husband.

                                     PRINCESS
                         Nor you. To you that word is as 
                         unfamiliar as love.

                                     EDWARD
                         Before he lost his powers of speech, 
                         he told me his one comfort was that 
                         he would live to know Wallace was 
                         dead.

               She leans down and grabs the dying king by the hair. The 
               guards flanking the door start forward but the Princess's 
               eyes flare at them with more fire than even Longshanks once 
               showed -- and the guards back off. She leans down and hisses 
               to Longshanks, so softly that even Edward can't hear...

                                     PRINCESS
                         You see? Death comes to us all. And 
                         it comes to William Wallace. But 
                         before death comes to you, know this: 
                         your blood dies with you. A child 
                         who is not of your line grows in my 
                         belly. Your son will not sit long on 
                         the throne. I swear it.

               She lets go of the old king. He sags like an empty sack back 
               onto his satin pillows. Without even a look at her husband 
               she strides out of the room, with the rattling breath of the 
               dying king rasping the air like a saw.

               EXT. LONDON TOWN SQUARE - EXECUTION DAY

               The crowd is festive; hawkers sell roast chickens, and beer 
               from barrels. Royal horsemen arrive, dragging Wallace strapped 
               to a wooden litter. As they cut him loose and lead him through 
               the crowd, the people begin to jeer and throw things at him: 
               chicken bones, rocks, empty tankards.

               We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in 
               terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street 
               and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.

               Wallace's eyes capture the soldier, and hold him, piercing 
               his soul. The soldier looks away in shame, even as the rest 
               of the crowd jeers more.

               Grim magistrates prod Wallace and he climbs the execution 
               platform. On the platform are a noose, a dissection table 
               with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an 
               enormous axe. Wallace sees it all.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         We will use it all before this is 
                         over. Or fall to your knees now, 
                         declare yourself the king's loyal 
                         subject, and beg his mercy, and you 
                         shall have it.

               He emphasizes "mercy" by pointing to the axe. Wallace is 
               pale, and trebles -- but he shakes his head. The CROWD grows 
               noisier as they put the noose around Wallace's neck...

               WE INTERCUT:

               -- THE PRINCESS, in helpless agony, hearing the DISTANT NOISE 
               from her room in the palace...

               -- Hamish and Stephen, disguised as peasants among the crowd, 
               helpless too, but there, as if to shoulder some of the pain.

               -- Longshanks, rattling, coughing blood, as Edward watches.

               -- Robert the Bruce paces along the walls of his castle in 
               Scotland. His eyes are haunted; he grips the embroidered 
               handkerchief that belonged to Wallace.

               ON THE EXECUTION STAND

               a trio of burly hooded executioners cinch a rope around 
               Wallace's neck and hoist him up a pole.

                                     CROWD
                         That's it! Stretch him!

               In the SCORE, AMAZING GRACE, wailed on bagpipes, carries 
               through all that happens now... Ties hand and foot, Wallace 
               is strangling. The Magistrate watches coldly; even when the 
               executioner gives him a look that says they're about to go 
               too far, he prolongs the moment; then the Magistrate nods 
               and the executioner cuts the rope. Wallace slams to the 
               platform; the Magistrate leans to him.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Pleasant, yes? Rise to your knees, 
                         kiss the royal emblem on my cloak, 
                         and you will feel no more.

               With great effort, Wallace rises to his knees. The Magistrate 
               assumes a formal posture and offers the cloak.

               Wallace struggles all the way to his feet.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Very well then. Rack him.

               The executioners slam Wallace onto his back on the table, 
               spread his arms and legs, and tie each to a crank. Goaded by 
               the crowd, they pull the ropes taut. They crowd grows quiet 
               enough to hear the groaning of Wallace's limbs. Hamish and 
               Stephen feel it in their own bodies.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         Wonderful, isn't it, that a man 
                         remains conscious through such pain. 
                         Enough?

               Wallace shakes his head. The executioners cut off his clothes, 
               take hot irons from a fire box. The crowd grows silent; we 
               see them, not Wallace, as the irons are touched to his body, 
               but we hear the burning of flesh. Then the Magistrate signals; 
               Wallace wants to say something.

                                     WALLACE
                         That... will... clear your sinuses.

               Everyone hears; Hamish smiles, even through his tears.

               Rebuffed, the Magistrate nods to the executioners, who lift 
               the terrible instruments of dissection.

               We are spared seeing the cutting: we are ON WALLACE'S FACE 
               as the disembowelment begins. The Magistrate leans in beside 
               him.

                                     MAGISTRATE
                         It can all end. Right now! Bliss. 
                         Peace. Just say it. Cry out. "Mercy!" 
                         Yes?... Yes?

               The crowd can't hear the magistrate but they know the 
               procedure, and they goad Wallace, chanting...

                                     CROWD
                         Mer-cy! Mer-cy! Mer-cy!

               Wallace's eyes roll to the magistrate, who signals QUIET!

                                     MAGISTRATE
                              (booming)
                         The prisoner wishes to say a word!

               SILENCE. Hamish and Stephen weep, whisper, pray...

                                     HAMISH AND STEPHEN
                         Mercy, William... Say Mercy...

               Wallace's eyes flutter, and clear. He fights through the 
               pain, struggles for one last deep breath, and screams...

                                     WALLACE
                         FREEEEE-DOMMMMMM!

               The shout RINGS through the town. Hamish hears it. The 
               Princess hears it, at her open window, and touches her tummy, 
               just showing the first signs of her pregnancy. Longshanks 
               and his son seem to hear; the cry STILL ECHOES as if the 
               wind could carry it through the ends of Scotland; and Robert 
               the Bruce, on the walls of his castle, looks up sharply, as 
               if he has heard...

               IN THE LONDON SQUARE

               the crowd has never seen courage like this; even English 
               strangers begin to weep. The angry, defeated magistrate gives 
               a signal. They cut the ropes, drag Wallace over and put his 
               head on the block. The executioner lifts his huge axe -- and 
               Wallace looks toward the crowd.

               THE CROWD, WALLACE'S POV

               He sees Hamish, eyes brimming, face glowing...

               SLOW MOTION - THE AXE

               begins to drop.

               WALLACE'S POV

               In the last half-moment of his life, when he has already 
               stepped into the world beyond this one, he glimpses someone 
               standing at Hamish's shoulder. She is beautiful, smiling, 
               serene.

               She is Marion.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               ROBERT THE BRUCE

               His face has changed. He is standing AT THE OPEN GRAVE WHERE 
               MARION LAY, the headstone carved with the thistle still there. 
               He holds the handkerchief. As he tucks it into his own pocket, 
               and we MOVE IN on his eyes, we realize the VOICE OVER belongs 
               to him.

                                     ROBERT (V.O.)
                         After the beheading, William Wallace's 
                         body was torn to pieces. His head 
                         was set on London bridge, where 
                         passerby were invited to jeer at the 
                         man who had caused so much fear in 
                         England.
                              (beat)
                         His arms and legs were sent to the 
                         four corners of Britain as warning.

               EXT. SCOTTISH TOWNS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

               We see the people, as the remains of William Wallace are 
               displayed in a box. The faces of the young men are fiery.

                                     ROBERT (V.O.)
                         It did not have the effect that 
                         Longshanks planned.

               More young men put on tartans, take up their weapons, and 
               gather into fighting units. Among them is Hamish, carrying a 
               shield emblazoned with a cocked arm holding a broadsword, 
               and the words "For Freedom."

               EXT. SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY

               Robert the Bruce, flanked by the noblemen and the banners of 
               the Scottish throne, and backed by a ragtag army of Scots, 
               sits on his horse and looks down at the English generals in 
               their martial finery. The English are haughty, victorious, 
               at the head of their colorful, polished army, awaiting the 
               ceremony of submission from Scotland's new king.

                                     ROBERT (V.O.)
                         And I, Robert the Bruce, backed by a 
                         body of Scottish veterans, rode out 
                         to pay homage to the armies of the 
                         English king, and accept his 
                         endorsement of my crown.

               FROM BELOW, ON THE OPEN PLAIN - DAY

               The Scots -- the remains of William Wallace's army -- look 
               so ragged and defeated that it hardly seems worth the wait. 
               One ENGLISH COMMANDER turns and jokes with another...

                                     ENGLISH COMMANDER
                         I hope you washed your ass this mornin -- 
                         it's never been kissed by a king 
                         before.

               UP ON THE HILL, Robert the Bruce sits on his horse, and waits. 
               He looks down at the English generals, at their banners, 
               their army. He looks down the ranks at his own.

               He sees Hamish. Stephen. Old MacClannough is there, his eyes 
               watery, his weapon sharp. The Scottish bride Lord Bottoms 
               took is there, among the ragtag archers, her husband beside 
               her. Robert knows none of them -- yet he knows them all.

               Old Craig, among the other Scottish nobles mounted beside 
               the Bruce, grows impatient.

                                     CRAIG
                         Come, let's get it over with.

               But Robert holds something -- uncurling his fist, he looks 
               at the thistle handkerchief that belonged to Wallace. The 
               nobles start to rein their horses toward the English.

                                     ROBERT
                         Stop.

               Robert the Bruce tucks the handkerchief safely behind his 
               breastplate, and turns to the Highlanders who line the hilltop 
               with him. He takes a long breath, and shouts --

                                     ROBERT THE BRUCE
                         You have bled with Wallace! Now bleed 
                         with me!

               Bruce's broadsword slides from its scabbard. A cry rises 
               from Highlanders, as from a tomb, rising --

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

               The chant builds to a frenzy; it shakes the earth. The 
               Scottish nobles can scarcely believe it; the English are 
               shocked even more. Robert the Bruce, king of Scotland, spurs 
               his horse into full gallop toward the English, and the 
               Highlanders hurl their bodies down the hill, ready to run 
               through hell itself. In SLOW MOTION we see their faces...

               And OVER THIS, we hear the voice of William Wallace...

                                     WALLACE'S VOICE
                         In the year of our Lord 1314, patriots 
                         of Scotland, starving and outnumbered, 
                         charged the fields of Bannockburn. 
                         They fought like warrior poets. They 
                         fought like Scotsmen. And won their 
                         freedom. Forever.

               On Wallace's army behind Robert the Bruce, charging down the 
               hill to victory and glory, we slow to FREEZE FRAME and hear 
               their chant, huge, echoing...

                                     SCOTS
                         Wal-lace! Wal-lace! Wal-lace!

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, NORTH CAROLINA. DAY

               ON A BLACK SCREEN: Credits.

               A RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMERS) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE LANGUAGE.

               A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES: shrouded in a blue mist 
               like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small 
               town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to 
               the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack.

               Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack.

               A ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked 
               forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a 
               stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian. 
               Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the 
               ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet, 
               the blood pouring from his nose.

               His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge.

               A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes 
               down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary 
               field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants 
               grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and 
               its two exotic passengers passes by.

               The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the 
               severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self-
               conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts 
               of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt 
               to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by 
               her. An angel in this wild place.

               Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to 
               translate into English:

                                     SWIMMERS VOICE (V.O.)
                         You will be lonely. You will howl 
                         like a dog as you walk alone. You 
                         will carry dog shit cupped in your 
                         hands. You will be smeared with dog 
                         shit. Your spirit will wane and 
                         dwindle to blue, the colour of 
                         despair... 

               As the Cabriolet passes, SWIMMER takes the ball an with a 
               whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. The game 
               resumes. Ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, 
               sticks and fists flailing.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. NIGHT

               A SIDE OF BEEF turns on a huge barbecue. The battered teams 
               eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, 
               illuminated by a roaring bonfire. Swimmer is sewing up a 
               gash in Inmans cheek as he continues to translate:

                                     SWIMMER
                         ...This is your path. There is no 
                         other. That's a curse you can use on 
                         the Yankee before battle.

                                     INMAN
                         And that works?

                                     SWIMMER
                         You have to say it in Cherokee.

                                     INMAN
                         You said it to me in Cherokee.

               During this, Monroe and Ada have arrived, escorted by SALLY 
               SWANGER, a local woman, middle-aged, kindly, and her husband, 
               ESCO, a glorious curmudgeon. The Monroes are introduced to 
               various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the 
               crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from 
               Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's 
               preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches 
               Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches, 
               and winces with pain.

                                     SWIMMER
                         So keep your head still.

               Sally collects plates for the Monroes. Hands them to Ada and 
               her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware. Esco takes 
               a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it. Monroe 
               pluckily follows suit.

                                     INMAN
                              (to Swimmer)
                         Anyway, there won't be any war. And 
                         if there is, they say it won't last 
                         a week.

               CAPTION: PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA. JULY 30TH, 1864. IN THE FOURTH 
               YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR.

               A STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT 
               surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty.

               A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into 
               open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE 
               CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON 
               THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in 
               the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The 
               Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and 
               it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world 
               of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches.

               IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water 
               for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a 
               large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the 
               stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole. 
               Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling.

               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN.

               A dark hole. Some evil place. A scraping sound. Shapes 
               burrowing forwards at a crouch. A silent purpose.

               Young OAKLEY, freshly recruited, approaches a group of men, 
               like him Highlanders from Company F of the 25th North Carolina 
               Regiment. He doles out breakfast. Inman, loading his heavy 
               LeMats pistol, its nine rounds, is not hungry. Oakley serves 
               another, ROURKE, last seen in the scrum at Cold Mountain. 
               Oakley keeps his head low as he serves.

                                     ROURKE
                         Don't worry, son. Those Yankee boys 
                         keep store hours. They ain't open 
                         yet.

               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN

               Shadows and shapes. A BARREL rumbles along the tunnel. It 
               reaches a kneeling figure, who rolls it forwards. A relay 
               team. At the end of the tunnel, where it widens, a man, naked 
               to the waist, crouches, stacking the barrels.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. PREDAWN

               A RABBIT, scared up, darts along the trench. Rourke sees it, 
               beckons to another Cold Mountain boy, Butcher.

                                     BUTCHER
                         That's fresh breakfast. Shoot him!

                                     ROURKE
                         I'm not firing, start the damn war 
                         off.

               Butcher chases after the rabbit, Rourke in raucous support.

               INT. TUNNEL. PREDAWN

               The crouching man has wrapped FUZE WIRE around the last 
               barrel, and now retreats, paying out the wire as he does so, 
               as each man in the tunnel crawls backwards behind him.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN

               Rourke weaves through the gun emplacements, laughing.

                                     ROURKE
                         That's my rabbit!

               Great sport. Inman, fifty yards away, looks over, amused, 
               goes back to his gun.

               INT. TUNNEL. DAWN

               The fuze wire is lit. It fizzes towards the barrels.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DAWN

               Rourke is running BUT NOW THE GROUND BUCKLES UNDER HIM AND 
               HE'S BEING LIFTED SLOWLY INTO THE AIR, the earth swelling.

               AN APOCALYPTIC EXPLOSION. FOUR TONS OF DYNAMITE RIP THE GROUND 
               OPEN IN A CRATER 135 FEET LONG, 90 FEET ACROSS, 30 FEET DEEP.

               HORSES, GUNS, MEN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES AND THROWN UP INTO THE 
               AIR.

               INMAN DISAPPEARS UNDER DIRT AND DEBRIS.

               Pandemonium. The Confederates are in complete disarray. The 
               Federals pour forwards across NO MANS LAND, through the 
               peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. They 
               flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a 
               dense and impenetrable WALL OF SMOKE.

               THEN THEY'RE INSIDE THE GREAT GASH OF CRATER AND CAN'T GET 
               OUT AGAIN, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud.

               The Confederates regroup. Orders are yelled. Chaos developing 
               into battle.

               The Confederates begin firing into the crater. Guns and mortar 
               wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death 
               trap.

               Inman gets to his feet. Oakley with him, and rushes through 
               the smoke to the pit, emptying his LeMats into the crater.

               LATER: A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the attack. Bodies 
               falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their 
               comrades even tighter. The Confederates make a pincer movement 
               outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in. It's 
               Medieval.

               No escape.

               THE CONFEDERATES jump into the pit to engage the Federals. 
               Hand to hand fighting. Too close for rifles, just bayonets, 
               and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that 
               hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which 
               does a terrible damage. Primitive. Unutterable carnage. Men 
               killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against 
               soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. An oozing 
               layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning 
               in slick.

               YOUNG OAKLEY loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case, 
               clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with 
               a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal.

               INMAN GOES AT IT. He's a warrior, punching and stabbing and 
               firing. A coldly efficient killer. He's grabbed from behind 
               and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle.

               He falls and lands on top of Oakley, and he and his Federal 
               opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their 
               pillow. The slaughter continues over and around them, the 
               sound, the sound of hell and madness. The boy has his arm 
               around Inman, like lovers.

               LATER: The Confederates run after the retreating Union 
               soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. Inman stands, 
               the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. The 
               crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. The victors are 
               yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. Butcher comes alongside 
               Inman.

                                     BUTCHER
                         That was something! That's hell and 
                         we've been there! Kicked old Nick's 
                         asshole.

               A WOUNDED BLACK SOLDIER sits up as Butcher celebrates.

               Butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket. 
               He looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons,

               tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not 
               loaded. The wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself 
               like a crab away from Butcher. Inman yells at him, appalled.

                                     BUTCHER
                         You got a charge?

               He picks up another musket. It fires. The wounded Federal 
               slumps back, dead.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. DUSK

               THE AFTERMATH. The dead being piled up for burial, divided 
               into allegiance. Wounded prisoners able to walk are led away.

               A great deal of casual looting. Of boots, of equipment, of 
               personal items. Inman sees a soldier in the crater, lining 
               up wounded Federals, putting their heads in a row. THE MAN 
               EXTRACTS A HAMMER FROM HIS BELT AND, SATISFIED HE HAS AN 
               ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENT, PROCEEDS DOWN THE LINE, SMASHING EACH 
               SKULL.

               Inman turns away, sees another Rebel, extravagantly costumed, 
               a strange FIDDLE head protruding from his knapsack. This is 
               STOBROD THEWES. He's bent over a dead Federal, examining his 
               mouth. He reaches behind his back and roots around in the 
               knapsack, producing A PAIR OF PLIERS, WHICH HE INSERTS INTO 
               THE CORPSE'S MOUTH. He's yanking away when A SWINGING BOOT 
               connects with his head and knocks him to the ground.

               Startled, he looks up to see Inman hovering over him.

                                     STOBROD
                         That's gold in his mouth he got no 
                         need for.
                              (shrugs)
                         We take his boots.

               He examines his fiddle for damage. Some orderlies pass, 
               lifting OAKLEY away on a gurney.

               Oakley's pale as a maiden, the life leaking from him. Inman 
               walks a way with him. Oakley looks up, desperate to be brave.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I got a few. You saw?

                                     INMAN
                         I saw.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I know you don't recognise me. I'm 
                         Mo Oakley's boy.
                              (Inman finds this 
                              incredible)
                         It's okay. I was thirteen when you 
                         all left. Am I going to die?

               Inman flicks his eyes to the Orderly, whose look confirms 
               the boy's wounds are certainly mortal.

               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT

               Inman sits on the ground beside Oakley's cot. Around them, 
               the wounded are certainly dying, makeshift care, oil lights, 
               groans.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I'd like to hear some music while I 
                         go.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

               Inman walks around the campfires. He hears some fiddle music. 
               It's Stobrod.

               Stobrod sees Inman. Inman stares, his expression an 
               instruction, the turns and walks away.

               INT. FIELD HOSPITAL. NIGHT

               Stobrod stands over Oakley. Consults with Inman.

                                     STOBROD
                         What about Bonaparte's Retreat? That's 
                         one I play.

                                     OAKLEY
                         Play me something sweet. Like a girl's 
                         waiting for me.

               Stobrod looks at Inman, confused.

                                     OAKLEY
                         Play me something like there's nothing 
                         to fear from a merciful Lord.

                                     INMAN
                              (to Stobrod)
                         You heard him.

                                     STOBROD
                              (nervous)
                         I only know a couple of tunes.

                                     OAKLEY
                         Like when you're thirsty up at 
                         Bishop's Creek and the water is so 
                         cool.

               Inman glares at Stobrod. And Stobrod starts to play.

               Hesitant, then with gathering confidence, improvising, 
               increasingly expansive, as if he's as surprised as everyone 
               else. Oakley's lips move. A whisper. Inman leans in.

                                     OAKLEY
                         I'm reaching Cold Mountain before 
                         you.

               Stobrod plays. It's wrenching. Oakley stills. Inman abruptly 
               puts his hand on the neck of the fiddle, stopping Stobrod. 
               The boy is dead. Inman gets to his feet and walks away.

               INT. CONFEDERATE TENT. NIGHT

               A dozen men in the tent. Inman has a BOOK, its cover gone, 
               rolled up and tied with a leather strap. His bookmark is A 
               FADED TINTYPE PHOTOGRAPH of a solemn young woman. He unwraps 
               the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next 
               to his bedroll. An OFFICER comes into the tent, approaches 
               Inman, who makes a stand.

                                     OFFICER
                         Don't get up, soldier. You are 
                         mentioned tonight in my report. You 
                         are a credit to the Highlands, to 
                         North Carolina and to the Cause.

                                     INMAN
                              (tight)
                         Do you have news, sir, on my 
                         application for transfer?

                                     OFFICER
                         I know. A bloody day. It's what our 
                         General said: Good thing war is so 
                         terrible else a man might end up 
                         liking it too much.

                                     INMAN
                         Sir. It was my understanding the 
                         medical corps was desperate for 
                         volunteers.

                                     OFFICER
                         Right now, soldier, it's me who is 
                         in need of volunteers. There's a 
                         dozen Yankees in that stand of trees 
                         between us. Stuck there from the 
                         retreat. Come daylight they can shoot 
                         us down for sport.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

               A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others, 
               including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to 
               one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide 
               arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to 
               the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the 
               ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses.

               He slithers over them.

               They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN 
               FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing. 
               Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate 
               lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting 
               against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep.

               As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the 
               Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his 
               rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing 
               him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another.

               The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party 
               and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from 
               the trees.

               A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate 
               trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A 
               BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed 
               at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own 
               lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the 
               trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold 
               your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost 
               home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly 
               he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him.

               Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty 
               yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK.

               He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying 
               on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly 
               fade to black, all sound fading with them.

               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. 3 YEARS EARLIER. DAY

               A WOODEN JOIST swings across the view of the Blue Ridge. Men 
               are swarming over the roof of an unfinished CHAPEL, below 
               which appears the small town of COLD MOUNTAIN. Among the 
               workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a 
               rafter, is Inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. Rourke 
               and Butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around 
               and Oakley, barely a teenager.

               Below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, 
               ADA amongst them. She has the circumspect air of the blue 
               stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, 
               the men's radar for her every move. Inman watches her as 
               Sally Swanger approaches.

                                     SALLY
                              (to Ada, as Monroe 
                              moves off)
                         Ada, how are you settling in? Are 
                         you liking the farm?

                                     ADA
                         Very much. It's beautiful country.

                                     SALLY
                         So listen -- if you would say hello 
                         to one of these fools, I'll get a 
                         field cleared this weekend.

                                     ADA
                         Anyone? Like a forfeit?

                                     SALLY

               UP ON THE ROOFBEAMS OF THE CHAPEL, the men are preoccupied

               Inman swings down. He feels the other men staring, burning a

               He drops down to ground level, takes the lemonade, scowls at 
               the other guys. They're breaking for lunch and as they make 
               their way to the trestle tables -- they enjoy jostling Inman.

                         So, was there something in particular 
                         you wished to say to me?

                                     INMAN

                         Not that comes to me.
                              (hands back the glass)
                         I'll say thank you for the lemonade.

               And he turns and joins the other men gathering round the 
               tables for lunch. Ada watches him, intrigued. Rourke and co. 
               approach ESCO SWANGER, a known sympathizer with the North, 
               to give him a bad time.

                                     ROURKE
                         Esco loves the Yankees.

                         I prefer a Yankee to a halfwit.

               Inman arrives just as Rourke points a warning finger at Esco.

               He pushes the finger down to get by. Esco continues:

                                     ESCO
                         What is it you think you'd be fighting

                         And what's that when it's at home?

               Esco's sons, ELLIS AND ACTON, who're working at the other 
               end of the building, have now arrived at the table.

                                     ACTON
                         Pop, you causing trouble?

                                     ESCO
                         No.

                                     ELLIS
                         That means yes.

                         for good old King Cotton. Now you 
                         want to fight for him. Somebody has 
                         to explain it to me.

                         Don't even try.

               The others are desperate to tease Inman.

                         How's the lemonade? Sweet?

               Ada, at the lemonade stand again, watches them laughing at 
               Inman, who keeps his head fixed on the table.

               EXT. CONFEDERATE LINES. NIGHT

               INMAN, ON A GURNEY, carried, someone with a cloth to his 
               neck, which is soaked through with blood. They start to run 
               with him, heading for the field hospital, worried that he 
               will die before the wound can be staunched, cauterized.

               Throughout, A STRANGE MUSIC PLAYS, discordant notes jangling:

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               -- from A PIANO, lashed to a cart, as it bounces along the 
               lane, passing the Swanger Farm. Sally comes out to look. 
               It's Ada riding next to one of the farmhands, a second boy 
               keeping watch over the piano. Sally goes over.

                                     SALLY

                              look)
                         Inman's down in the bottom field, 
                         clearing his debt.

                         twice, by two different men. Both of 
                         them -- they were hunting for a 
                         simile, what was I like -- and thistle 
                         came right to them.

                         why not go down and say hello.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Inman's working in the field, stripped to his undershirt, 
               hot work, wielding a scythe. He hears something and looks up 
               at the edge of the lane, ADA IS PLAYING THE PIANO, which is 
               still strapped to the cart. She briefly raises a hand to 
               Inman, then nods to the farmhand who sets them on their way 
               again. Inman smiles, waves back, watching as the cart rumbles 
               off down the track.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               It's pouting with rain. INSIDE THE FARMHOUSE, ADA IS PLAYING 
               THE PIANO.

               Men and women crowd into the parlour, in best clothes, 
               celebrating the completion of the Chapel. Inman is outside 
               on the porch, his coat soaked, water pouring off his hat. He 
               looks at Ada. She finishes. Monroe steps in front of the 
               applause, smiling. His words of thanks leak through the window 
               to Inman, who stands, watching, listening.

               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Monroe circulates, with Ada. He nods at a group of men, who 
               congregate in one part, not mingling. Their leader, TEAGUE, 
               might be a minister himself, favouring a black dress coat, a 
               black crow in the corner, eyes flashing. Ada doesn't know 
               them. Esco comes by. Monroe puts a hand on his arm.

                         all belonged to his grand-daddy. 
                         Teague wanted this place bad. You 
                         got it. He's here sniffing out an 
                         advantage.

                         There's no advantage here, but to

               Ada appears at the door opening it onto the porch. She's 
               carrying a tray with drinks. Acknowledges Inman.

                                     MONROE
                         What can I do for you?

               Inman hovers, awkward. Ada appears, awkward.

                                     INMAN
                         I have some sheet music. Belonged to 
                         my father. No use to me.

               Ada comes forward, takes the package.

                                     MONROE
                         You must come in.

                                     INMAN
                         I should probably get along.

                                     ADA
                         Mr. Inman is more comfortable 
                         outdoors. Perhaps we might take a 
                         walk.

                                     MONROE
                         A splendid idea.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Monroe and Inman and Ada touring the farm. It's a biggish 
               property, over three hundred acres. And well-tended by the 
               dozen slave farmhands who work it, some of whom are dotted 
               about in the landscape. Rolling mountains dominate the view.

                                     MONROE
                              (expansive)
                         I want to get sheep into this field. 
                         A big field doesn't look right without 
                         sheep. You're a lucky fellow, Mr. 
                         Inman, you've had this view all your 
                         life.

                                     INMAN
                         I think so.

                                     MONROE
                         It's a special view. I dragged my 
                         poor daughter to Cold Mountain from 
                         Charleston because of my Doctors -- 
                         they say my heart is weak -- so the 
                         air's meant to do me good. But it's 
                         the view I think heals.

               Ada walking behind, comes alongside the two men, threading 
               her arm into her father's but, by so doing, also arriving 
               next to Inman.

                                     MONROE
                         I have to get on my visits. Can I 
                         offer you a ride back into town?

               Inman looks at Ada. No word.

               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               From the window Ada watches the Cabriolet head towards town.

               At the piano, she unwraps the leather lace from the package 
               of music. Inside the first book of music, there's a 
               DAGUERREOTYPE OF INMAN with his LeMats, a typical Confederate 
               pose. Some of the music has left its imprint on the picture, 
               the notes like a melody over Inman's face. Ada picks them 
               out on the piano.

               The ebullient sound of Shape Singing. A noisy choir letting 
               rip --

               INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN, MAY 20TH, 1861. DAY

               -- THE WHOLE CHURCH IS SINGING, MEN TO ONE SIDE: WOMEN TO 
               THE OTHER. Monroe conducts, sings. Inman is there, as is 
               Ada. He fixes on her neck, the way the hair falls.

               The door bursts open. Young OAKLEY, apologetic nod to Monroe, 
               sits at the back, then leans forward, as the singing 
               continues, to say something to Rourke, who says something to 
               Butcher, the news spreading like wildfire. Rourke gets up, 
               leaves. Butcher gets up next, follows. Another man. Another.

               Depleting the male voices, until only women and some of the 
               older men are singing and one side of the church is 
               practically empty.

               Inman, remains, fixed on Ada. Who does not look round.

               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Those left in the congregation now spill out into what has 
               become a melee as the NEWS OF SECESSION goes up. Enormous 
               excitement, particularly among the boys, who now seem 
               curiously attractive to the girls. Inman blinks out into the 
               sun, Ada finds him. They're awkward as they watch other 
               sweethearts embracing.

                                     ADA
                         Well, you have your war.

               TEAGUE AND HIS MEN COME RIDING UP THE STREET, their horses 
               clearing a path amongst the celebrating crowd. Teague reins 
               in his horse and rides it up against Esco Swanger.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Those who follow Lincoln, or preach 
                         abolition, best keep one eye open 
                         when they're sleeping, Old Bogey Man 
                         might get you!

               Inman steps between Esco and Teague, holding the reins of 
               Teague's horse, easy and dangerous.

                                     INMAN
                         Are you the law all of a sudden?

               Teague produces a document, which he waves in the air.

                                     TEAGUE
                         That's right, son. Home Guard for 
                         Haywood County. I'm the law from 
                         today. You all go fight now. We'll 
                         watch your sweethearts.

               And he spurs on his horse, his fellow Home Guard falling in 
               behind, riding on over the ridge. Inman walks to Ada.

                                     INMAN
                         You might be safer back in Charleston.

                                     ADA
                         But then who'll be waiting for you?

               She puts a hand on his arm for a second. They both want to 
               get to the point of declaration but don't know how. They 
               stand, people noisy around them, those about to leave, those 
               about to be left.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm going to walk back inside the 
                         Chapel.

               And he does so, making his meaning clear for her to follow.

               INT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Inman walks inside. Stands with his back to the door. It 
               opens and closes. Inman turns. It's Monroe.

                                     MONROE
                         Did you want a quiet word?

               Now the door opens again and it's Ada. She's dismayed to see 
               her father.

                                     INMAN
                         Just some quiet.

                                     MONROE
                         Of course Ada.

               He indicates they should both leave. Inman sits at a bench.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Monroe and Ada come into town in their cabriolet. They pass 
               under banners proclaiming the Confederate cause: Old Rip's 
               Awake! Watch out Yankees! The trap draws up by the Cold 
               Mountain General Store. Monroe lets Ada down.

                                     MONROE
                              (of his appointment)
                         I'll daresay Dr. O'Brien'll want to 
                         do a test or two.

                                     ADA
                         And then there'll be a coffee or 
                         two, a brandy or two...

               Monroe smiles in acknowledgement, gets back in the trap. Ada 
               heads into the store.

               INT. BEDROOM. ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               INMAN SITS ON HIS BED, wearing pants and a vest. His room is 
               like a monk's cell. Nothing in it. Inman's trunk is packed.

               He's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. One hand inside 
               the boot, the other blacking it. There's a knock at the door.

               He opens it. It's Ada. He abruptly closes the door on her.

               INT. HALLWAY, ROOMING HOUSE. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Ada waits outside. She's not sure what's happening. Then 
               Inman opens the door. He's buttoning his shirt. His boots 
               are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished. Somebody 
               walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl. They separate 
               as the man passes them. They're tender, awkward.

                                     ADA
                         I found you this book. William 
                         Bartram. They tell me it's good. I 
                         think he writes about these parts, 
                         the author, so...

               Inman takes it.

               She has something else. Wrapped in paper.

                                     ADA
                         And this...
                              (hands it to him)
                         I'm not smiling in it. I don't know 
                         how to do that, hold a smile, so now 
                         I'm solemn...

                                     INMAN
                         Ada...

                                     ADA
                         What?

               HE KISSES HER, pressing into her, his arm circling her waist.

               Below them the sound of a MARCHING BAND. It's the RECRUITMENT 
               PARADE and brings Rourke and Butcher racing down the stairs.

               Inman pulls away from Ada as the boys hurtle for the front 
               door.

                                     ROURKE
                         Let's go!

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Rourke, Butcher, and then Inman appear in the doorway of the 
               Rooming House, and then fall in with the motley crew of 
               Volunteers AS THEY MARCH BY WITH THE BAND AND THE ENLISTED 
               SOLDIERS. The town is out to wish them well, parents, younger 
               brothers, sweethearts walking alongside their brave men. Ada 
               comes to the door of the Rooming House. Inman looks back and 
               sees her, but almost immediately loses her in the crowd. THE 
               DRUMMERS DRUM, THE CROWD CHEERS, THE RECRUITS MARCH UP THE 
               HILL --

               EXT. BEHIND CONFEDERATE LINES, VIRGINIA. DAY

               -- AND THE WOUNDED AND THE WRETCHED STRAGGLE ALONG THE 
               RAILROAD.

               A TRAIN with the seriously injured snakes past the back of 
               the Confederate lines -- its suburbs of supplies, arriving 
               and departing troops -- and into peaceful country. FIDDLE 
               PLAYS, THEN A BANJO.

               INT. BOX CAR. DAY

               A CROWDED WAGON. It's a cauldron, and those able smash through 
               the wooden walls to make a breathing hole. Some have their 
               heads thrust out like crated poultry. INMAN IS IN THERE, 
               neck bandaged, its ugly seepage making a bloody necklace. 
               The light plays black and white through the boarded sides of 
               the boxcar, flashing on Inman's face as he drifts in and out 
               of consciousness. He focuses and sees the strange head of 
               STOBROD'S FIDDLE. Stobrod is serenading him, accompanied by 
               an angel-faced and extremely heavy child-man, PANGLE, whose 
               grin of delight seems permanent even in this claustrophobic, 
               grim world. Inman is panicked, puts a hand to push the fiddle 
               away. His voice is a croak, spoiled.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm not dying.

                                     STOBROD
                              (to Pangle)
                         What'd he say?

                                     PANGLE
                         Says he ain't about to die.

                                     STOBROD
                              (to Inman)
                         Truth to tell they say you are, 
                         Soldier. We'll meet again, in the 
                         better world.

               He changes his tune, and the tempo, finding a foot-slapping 
               rhythm, the two musicians grinning at each other. Inman lapses 
               back into unconsciousness. The rhythm becomes a hammering 
               sound...

               EXT. CHAPEL, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               -- AS A MAN HAMMERS A TINTYPE OF HIS SON'S FACE into the 
               wooden porch of the Chapel, where it joins many other 
               portraits of those lost to the war. Monroe presides. One of 
               the slaves from Black Cove holds the ladder for the bereaved 
               father. Other families wait, with their own daguerreotype to 
               mount. It's a memorial service without bodies.

               Riders approach. Home Guard. Teague brings his horse up 
               alongside Monroe at the Chapel door, tips his hat in 
               condolence to the bereaved families. With him is a young, 
               intensely beautiful and flamboyant rider, BOSIE, his hair 
               long, a single fingernail bizarrely overgrown. Somehow 
               sinister.

                                     TEAGUE
                         My condolences to you all.

                         Keep an eye on the negro. They want 
                         what the white man got -- all of you 
                         watch out your brave boys give their 
                         lives to war and meantime your slaves 
                         carry murder, rape and arson to your 
                         firesides.

                         Christians and I'll vouchsafe for 
                         them.

               EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Cold Mountain at its loveliest. The CABRIOLET with Monroe 
               and his daughter heads towards the farm. At a bend they meet 
               a couple of riders, TWINS, from Teague's Home Guard, riding 
               furiously past them. Monroe reins in the trap and lets them 
               thunder past before continuing on their way home. Monroe is 
               intrigued by Ada, as if he's never looked at her before.

                                     ADA
                         What?

                                     MONROE
                         You're looking -- at this moment, I 
                         don't know why -- you're looking 
                         exactly like your mother.

                                     ADA
                         Every time you see the doctor you 
                         get melancholy.

                                     MONROE
                         He listens to my heart and I get 
                         emotional.

                                     ADA
                         He gives you alcohol and you get 
                         emotional.

               She squeezes his arm.

                                     MONROE
                         We commiserate about the folly of 
                         this terrible war.
                              (they ride in silence)
                         Do you worry when there's no word 
                         from him?
                              (no response)
                         From Mr. Inman?

                                     ADA
                         Yes. But then I've tried counting 
                         the number of words which passed 
                         between Mr. Inman and me.
                              (looking ahead, seeing 
                              smoke)
                         Is that a bonfire? So close to the 
                         barns.

               Then they see THE FAMILY OF SLAVES turn off the road as their 
               cabriolet approaches, running away into the fields.

                                     ADA
                         What's going on?

                                     MONROE
                              (shouting at the 
                              disappearing slaves)
                         Hey! Stop there! Hey!

               Monroe gets out of the cabriolet and runs into the fields 
               after the retreating family, who are carrying bundles, chairs, 
               personal items, all loaded up. Ada has already taken the 
               reins and has driven up to the house. THE BARN IN WHICH THE 
               SLAVE FAMILY HAD LIVED IS ON FIRE. Monroe catches one of the 
               women, remonstrates with her. She's upset, distressed, one 
               of her sons comes back, pushes Monroe to the ground. They 
               hurry away. Monroe gets up, hurries to the fire.

               A FIGURE SWINGS IN THE HEAT OF THE FLAMES, HANGING FROM A 
               BEAM. Monroe spies it as he catches up with Ada.

                                     MONROE
                         Dear God.

                                     ADA
                         No, Daddy, it's not real.

               The figure swings round. IT'S AN EFFIGY, A GROTESQUE 
               CARICATURE OF A BLACK MAN.

                                     MONROE
                              (appalled)
                         What is wrong with us all?

               Ada turns and runs off.

                                     ADA
                         I'll get help.
                              (shouting over her 
                              shoulder)
                         Keep away from the flames.

               Monroe stands and considers the flames. Ada turns back once 
               more to see him -- a small man silhouetted against the blaze.

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

               INMAN lies; bandaged, eyes closed, in THE BALLROOM OF A 
               COLONIAL MANSION, co-opted as one ward of a Confederate 
               hospital. Rows of beds, the wounded and the dying, are lodged 
               between some vestiges of the room's former glory.

               SOME LOCAL WOMEN, conscious of their duty to the cause, are 
               brought through by an exhausted doctor, who's lost all his 
               grace. The windows are open, but it's still insufferably 
               hot, the muslin curtains barely moving.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Most of these men will be dead by 
                         the morning or, if they're stubborn, 
                         by nightfall. I have other men outside 
                         in the quadrangle waiting for the 
                         beds.

               The women try to process this, the attitude.

                                     DOCTOR
                         So, any kind word will be a blessing.

               One woman is overpowered by the stench, gags.

                                     DOCTOR
                         It's the heat. I'm sorry. They rot.

               The women begin to approach the beds.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Don't pray. If they're not God fearing 
                         you can stir up a hornet's nest.

               MRS. MORGAN, nervous, decent, sits next to INMAN. His mouth 
               is moving. She doesn't know what he's saying.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         I'm sorry, you want water?

               She bends to him again. His voice is a faint croak.

                                     INMAN
                         Pigeon River. Little East Fork.

               The Doctor is on his exit, stops at the bed.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         I'm sorry. I don't know what he's 
                         saying.

                                     DOCTOR
                         They ramble. Names of loved ones.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                              (listening to Inman)
                         Pigeon River. Is that a place? Cold 
                         Mountain?

               The Doctor shrugs, not a detective, moves on, stops at the 
               man in the next bed. Has a brief look, calls to a nurse.

                                     DOCTOR
                         This man is dead.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. LATE AFTERNOON

               Monroe and Ada are outside, a picnic at the summer table, 
               autumn leaves blowing up around them. Nearby the charred 
               skeleton of the barn. Ada gets up, clears away.

                                     MONROE
                         Thank you.
                              (staying her for grace)
                         For your Providence, Oh lord, we 
                         thank you.

                                     ADA
                         Amen. That was the last of the ham.

                                     MONROE
                         It was delicious.

                                     ADA
                         I have to learn how to cook.

                                     MONROE
                         I was going to say something in 
                         Chapel. Perhaps some of the womenfolk 
                         will volunteer.

                                     ADA
                         I can't have people coming here and 
                         cooking for me!

                                     MONROE
                         It's my fault. I should have raised 
                         you less like a companion and more 
                         like a young woman. I'm sorry.

                                     ADA
                         I'm not sorry, but I don't know how 
                         we'll get through another winter.

                                     MONROE
                         Will you play me something? Something 
                         peaceful while I look over my sermon.

               Ada takes the dishes away. He gets out his papers, his pen 
               and ink.

               INT. PARLOUR, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               ADA PLAYS THE PIANO. Chopin's Prelude in E Minor. Outside in 
               the garden, Monroe has adjourned to his striped campaign 
               chair, and is hunched over his notes. The door of the parlour 
               is open and the music floats over to him as he works.

               Ada plays. A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN appear at the window. Then 
               the steady drumming of a summer shower.

                                     ADA
                              (still playing)
                         Daddy, bring the tablecloth in with 
                         you!

               She plays some more. Monroe hasn't come in. The rain splashes 
               on to the window..

                                     ADA
                         Daddy, come inside before you drown!

               After a few more bars, she stops playing and, curious, goes 
               to the door. She stands at the doorway. MONROE'S SERMON IS 
               CAUGHT IN THE WIND AND BLOWS AROUND HIM, THE INK RUN TO

               ABSTRACTIONS, his hand dropped and visible to Ada as, with 
               dread, she approaches. SHE CATCHES THE SODDEN PAPERS, CHASING 
               AFTER THEM, THEN REACHES HER DEAD FATHER.

               He's like a fish, his face shining with the rain, and glass 
               eyed. She leans in to him, her head to his heart, then runs, 
               oblivious to the rain, her dress already drenched, runs down 
               the lane.

                                     ADA (V.O.)
                         Dear Mr. Inman...

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT

               INMAN'S FACE as he drifts in and out of consciousness. Mrs. 
               Morgan, the hospital volunteer, sits by Inman's bed. She 
               holds ADA'S UNOPENED LETTER, badly weather damaged, the pages 
               stuck together, the writing blurred where the ink has run.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         It's come to you by way of Virginia.

               There are various dates, which she decodes.

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         It's not too recent -- written this 
                         past winter. I'm afraid I can't read 
                         who it's from. Dear Mr. Inman,

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada is writing at her father's desk. A lonely room.

                                     ADA (V.O.)
                         -- I'm still waiting, as I promised 
                         I would, but I find myself alone and 
                         at the end of my wits --

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. NIGHT

               Mrs. Morgan reads to Inman, trying to decipher the letter:

                                     MRS. MORGAN
                         -- at the end of my wits, so now I 
                         say to you, plain as I can, come 
                         back to me. Come back to me is my 
                         request.
                              (can't read the next 
                              bit)
                         Then something I can't read, 
                         something, come back to me.

               Inman is very still. Then, eyes glinting with determination, 
               gives a TINY NOD.

                                     OFFICIAL (O.S.)
                         By order of Zebulon Vance, Governor 
                         of this great state of North Carolina: 
                         any soldier turned deserter is guilty 
                         of treason and shall be hunted down 
                         like a dog. 

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Ada walks down the hill from the Chapel. There is an absence 
               of young people, but the older folk are gathered round the 
               General Store where a UNIFORMED OFFICIAL is reading from a 
               document.

                                     OFFICIAL
                         -- Any man takes in a deserter is 
                         likewise guilty of treason.

               The Official is flanked by Teague, Bosey and the twins, puffed 
               up with self-importance. Ada has to walk around him to enter 
               the store.

                                     OFFICIAL
                         The Home Guard is powered to enter 
                         any place it sees fit, without notice 
                         or constraint. Names of all deserters 
                         will be posted in every town, 
                         published in every newspaper.

               INT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               The Official continues outside as Ada enters. Ada approaches 
               Mrs Castlereagh, the owner.

                                     ADA
                         Is there a letter for me?

                                     MRS. CASTLEREAGH
                         Nothing -- we're getting no post 
                         through at all -- although if you 
                         slip out back the material you ordered 
                         has arrived.

               They go to the back of the store, to a screened-off area. 
               Mrs. Castlereagh hands her over a packet of material. There's 
               another, more furtive, transaction to take place. Mrs 
               Castlereagh hands over a second parcel as if it were 
               narcotics. Ada tears at the wrapping. It's a parcel of books.

                         The sooner we lose this war the

                         in ten from these mountains is coming 
                         home again and most of them are

               EXT. GENERAL STORE, COLD MOUNTAIN TOWN. DAY

               Ada emerges, almost collides with Teague. She wriggles past 
               him, tries to make her package invisible.

               EXT. APPROACH TO BLACK COVE FARM - DAY

               IT'S WINTER. A solitary RIDER jogs his horse through the 
               frost, towards Black Cove farm.

               Ada is working at a handpump, failing to coax water from the 
               well. She's wrapped in blankets. The farm is somewhat unkempt 
               and so is she. The hem of her skirt is frayed. She rips at 
               it tearing off a strip of material, which she binds around 
               the handle in an attempt to thaw the mechanism. Then she 
               looks up to see the horseman approaching. It's Teague. Ada 
               immediately heads inside the house.

               Teague arrives at the house, takes a brace of RABBITS from 
               his saddlebag. He heads for the gate. The gate needs oiling, 
               the path is overgrown, he looks at the pump handle, the 
               abandoned pitcher.

               Ada opens the door, pinning her hair.

               Ada takes them. She is very queasy with these dead animals.

               He turns and stops at the gate, runs his hands through his 
               hair and uses the grease to ease the hinge. Then steps up 
               onto his horse, and rides away. Ada watches him. Shudders.

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada comes into the kitchen. A weak oil-lamp reveals THE TWO 
               RABBITS, partially covered on a plate, flies buzzing around 
               them, a little liquid leaking from them. Ada takes a knife 
               and contemplates skinning gutting them. Suddenly she gathers 
               them up and runs out.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               ADA BURIES THE TWO RABBITS. The wind howls. She covers the 
               little hole with soil and stones. Pumps out water to wash 
               her hands. Thinks she hears a noise, listens, alert to any 
               unfamiliar sounds, then hurries back to the house.

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada comes inside, she closes the door. Locks it. Puts a chair 
               against it. Goes upstairs, to her bedroom.

               INT. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada enters her bedroom. It's a chaos of books, clothes, 
               dishes. She closes the door, sets another chair against it.

               Then drags her armchair up against that, books and papers 
               spilling onto the floor. She props up Inman's portrait, on, 
               the chair, as if he were guarding her. Sits on the bed and, 
               desolate, begins to write:

               THERAPY FOR WOUNDED SOLDIERS. Some of those convalescing 
               swim or are helped to paddle in the healing sea. There are 
               rudimentary wheelchairs. Inman, a long way from home, is 
               amongst those sitting in one of these, very still, grey and 
               sick -- but alive. He pulls at the dressing on his neck, 
               exposing the still raw and livid wound to the sea air.

               Inman has his Bartram, his bookmark is the battered and foxed 
               picture of Ada, which he considers, before continuing to 
               read.

               Behind him A HUNDRED SLAVES AT WORK IN THE FIELDS, and behind 
               them the Mansion which has become the hospital. A series of 
               bells, of shouts, and the slaves stop working, prepare for 
               the long walk home, congregating, then forming a line, herded 
               by the foremen.

               Inman eases his position to bend over and dip his bandage in 
               the seawater. He brings the wet bandage to his neck, considers 
               the ocean, his fellow ragtag of wounded, the slaves, the 
               great fields, the Mansion. The whole meaning of this war 
               around him. A GRAVEL VOICE STARTS TO SING THE BLUES, CONTINUES

               -- A tintype of OAKLEY is added to the Chapel's votives, 
               hammered in alongside Rourke and Butcher. There are fifty or 
               more images now, the paint flaking around them. The exterior 
               of the Chapel, three years on, has taken on the burden of 
               recording history.

               There is no minister, no services, just the votives, 
               daguerreotypes or simply the names of those missing in action, 
               accompanied by tiny vases of wildflowers. The town shrouded 
               in mist, and quiet.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. SPRING. DAY

               EVERYWHERE SIGNS OF PROFOUND NEGLECT, like a Grimm's fairy 
               tale of a deserted house. The fields are overgrown with weeds, 
               the gardens abandoned. The chickens have deserted the henhouse 
               and are wandering around the outbuildings, scuffing at the 
               packed dirt.

               Sally and Esco come up the overgrown path, avoiding the 
               chickens, and knock at the door.

                                     SALLY
                         Ada! Ada, It's Sally.

               They're seen from ground level, through a boxwood, as their 
               feet patrol the ground, turn away from the door, and then 
               retreat, their voices drifting away. Ada is there, crouching 
               in her hidey-hole, a blanket on the ground, her book. She 
               wants to reveal herself, but is too embarrassed.

                                     ESCO
                         Will you look at the state of this 
                         place!

                         Poor soul. She's got nobody and 
                         nothing and three hundred acres of 
                         misery.

               During this a ROOSTER, black and gold, struts into the 
               boxwood. As the rooster approaches, Ada shudders, tries to 
               shoo it away without alerting her presence. Ada peers through 
               the boxwood as Sally and Esco close the gate and recede. The 
               rooster comes at her again. She rises up, kicking out at it, 
               while he flares his wings, spurs flaying at her. Ada runs 
               from the boxwood, tormented by the triumphant rooster, which 
               continues to fly and scratch, driving her into the house.

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada dabs at the scratches, her dress rolled down to the waist 
               to reveal her arms and shoulders. Now she shucks off the 
               dress completely and tries to find a clean replacement. There 
               isn't one, so she hunts through the overflowing laundry basket 
               for something less dirty.

               INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada enters her father's room, wearing undergarments.

               Everything as he left it and, in contrast to the rest of the 
               house, extremely tidy. She opens a wardrobe, finds one of 
               his coats, puts it on. It's much too big, and she rolls up 
               the sleeves, catches her pinched face and disheveled face in 
               a swivel mirror. She turns the mirror away and the image 
               swings into --

               EXT. GATES OF HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAY

               -- the figure of Inman walking, frail, grey. A kind of 
               lurching walk, as if his balance isn't guaranteed. He gets 
               close to the gate and interests a Guard, on the lookout for 
               would-be deserters. A BLIND MAN IS SELLING PEANUTS which he 
               roasts over a small fire. He's always singing. Inman 
               approaches. When Inman speaks, his voice is a croak.

                         said ten minutes. It's having a thing 
                         and then the loss I'm talking about.

                                     INMAN
                         Then we don't agree. There's not 
                         much I wouldn't give for ten minutes 
                         of someplace.

                                     BLIND MAN
                         Someplace or someone.

                                     INMAN
                         Same difference.

                         You watch yourself. They're shooting 
                         men who take themselves a walk.

               EXT. TREE PROMENADE, CHARLESTON. DAY

               Inman and a bunch of other walking wounded make their way, 
               under supervision, towards the town. The grandeur of the 
               approach, the carriages. The sorry state of the soldiers.

               INT. COURTHOUSE, CHARLESTON. DAY

               TWO GREAT TRESTLE TABLES, LOADED WITH CLOTHES. Underneath 
               the tables, boots -- laced together, origins various. The 
               charitable womenfolk are helping match clothes to recovering 
               soldiers, some of whom are still on crutches, or in 
               wheelchairs. Inman finds a black dresscoat, some pants, a 
               pair of boots. He accumulates a little pile. On his way out, 
               AN ELDERLY AND STAUNCH CONFEDERATE GENTLEMAN shakes his hand 
               and gives him an apple from the barrel.

               EXT. TEMPORARY BARBERSHOP, CHARLESTON. DAY

               Inman emerges from the Courthouse and joins the line for a 
               shave at the makeshift barbershop set up outside the 
               Courthouse. Two barbers, two chairs. A VERY ELEGANT SQUARE, 
               SOME STUCCO-FRONTED BUILDINGS, A GLIMPSE OF THE MONEYED SOUTH 
               IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE MODEST TOWN OF COLD MOUNTAIN. AN 
               AUCTION HOUSE OPPOSITE ADVERTISES SLAVES, CATTLE, LAND...

                                     BARBER
                         Next.

               Inman settles in the seat. The Barber contemplates his scraggy 
               beard, the livid, scabbed wound on his neck.

                                     BARBER
                              (nervous)
                         I'll cut your hair, but I ain't about 
                         to shave you. That thing opens up, 
                         your head's liable to falloff.

               INT. HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. PREDAWN

               It is almost dawn. The window by Inman's bed is a frame giving 
               onto the still dark world. The Night Guard passes by on its 
               patrol of the perimeter. A CLEAN-SHAVEN INMAN IS FULLY DRESSED 
               UNDER THE COVERS. He gets his hat, pushes his book into his 
               knapsack and, with one step up, WALKS OUT OF THE WINDOW AND 
               INTO THE WORLD.

               EXT. THE OCEAN BY THE HOSPITAL, CHARLESTON. DAWN

               Inman, his footprints in the sand, as he hurries along by 
               the edge of the ocean, away from the hospital...

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               -- as Ada walks, the wind kicking up around her, past the 
               Swanger place. She's bent and curiously dressed in her 
               father's coat.

                                     SALLY (V.O.)
                         Ada...

               Sally Swanger calls out from the field. She's concerned at 
               Ada's gaunt, ragged appearance. Ada waits for her approach.

                                     SALLY
                         You're skinny as a whippet, girl -- 
                         you're coming indoors with me.

                         I can't. I'm not -- I need to clean 
                         some clothes.

                                     SALLY
                         Great God, you ever looked at my 
                         husband! I can't get him to wear 
                         decent Church clothes Christmas 
                         morning. Hang on to me, the wind'll 
                         blow you over.

               And she folds her arm into Ada's. They walk up the lane.

               INT. SWANGER FARM. AFTERNOON

               Ada eats. Esco across from her contemplating her evident 
               appetite, the oversized man's jacket. Sally ladles more food 
               onto Ada's plate.

                         not worth anything.

                              other)

                         but it's what folks do, like when 
                         they dangle a needle over the belly 
                         to see if you're carrying a boy or a

               EXT. YARD, SWANGER FARM. LATE DAY

               AN IMAGE -- DISTORTED, WATERY. IT'S HARD TO RESOLVE BUT COULD 
               BE A CORRIDOR OF TREES. THE SUN LOW AT ONE END, THE SILHOUETTE 
               OF A FIGURE WALKING SLOWLY FORWARDS, A SUDDEN DISTURBANCE OF 
               CROWS.

               Ada is bent backwards over the well, a hand mirror glinting 
               down into the blackness. The reflection is elusive against 
               the bright evening sky, the sun almost set, and low.

                                     ESCO
                         See anything?

                         I tried many a time, never saw a 
                         dickybird.

               The image is clearer. The trees sharpen, the figure walking, 
               the steep incline of the corridor, all fiercely black and 
               white as if it were a carpet of snow and black hieroglyphs 
               of trees, and crows flying. The trick of the glass and the 
               watery disc of the well surface. A buzzing in Ada's ears, 
               something like a distant music. Then the figure seems to 
               suddenly pitch forwards, but at that moment, Ada -- canted 
               over, getting dizzy has to move and the image flies away, 
               replaced with the sky, the flash of the setting sun.

                         You all right?

               Ada's faint. She sits up, blank, a little shaken.

                         Yesterday I found myself crouched

               EXT. PLANTATION. DAY

               Inman walks along an expanse of marshland. Great cranes fly 
               heavily over him.

                         I thought I saw you there, walking 
                         back to me --

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. LATE AFTERNOON

               Ada is writing in her father's campaign chair, a blanket 
               wrapped around her, a rake propped next to her.

                                     ADA (V.O.)
                         -- or wished I did.

                         That cow wants milking.

               Ada looks up from her writing with a start. She covers her 
               letter, guiltily, instinctively. In front of her, at the 
               gate, is A YOUNG RAWBONED, FERAL WOMAN, OF INDETERMINATE 
               ORIGINS. She is barefoot, and dressed in a hand-dye_ shift 
               of blue. Her name is RUBY.

                         help. Here I am.

               Ada is instantly defensive, intimidated.

                         name.

                                     ADA
                         The rake: there's a rooster devil, 
                         I'm sure of it. He's Lucifer himself. 
                         I go near him he's at me with his 
                         spurs.

                                     RUBY
                         I despise a flogging rooster. Where 
                         is he?

               Ada gets up, nods to the corner of the yard. Ruby goes over.

               The Rooster gathers himself up for a new opponent.

               IN ONE MOVEMENT SHE PICKS UP THE BIRD AND TWISTS OFF ITS 
               HEAD.

                                     RUBY
                         Let's put him in a pot.

               EXT. CORNFIELDS. DAWN

               Inman's walking on a track which passes through cornfields, 
               the crop high and thick around him. He stops, hearing 
               something. Riders. He wades into the field, seeking cover in 
               the tall crop, lying in the dirt. Horses appear. HOME GUARD 
               MEN ON PATROL, A CHAIN GANG OF PRISONERS: SLAVES, DESERTERS 
               IN TOW, A COUPLE OF FEDERAL SOLDIERS. They have dogs, which 
               sniff and growl, intrigued by the fields, called back by the 
               Home Guard.

               Inman waits until they're well out of sight. AS HE GETS TO 
               HIS FEET IN THE GREAT FIELDS, ANOTHER BODY APPEARS, THEN 
               ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER, ALL SLAVES ON THE RUN 
               DOTTED AROUND THE FIELD. He walks to the road, paying no 
               heed to them. They assemble, paying no heed to him and move 
               off in the opposite direction. Inman turns, looks at them.

                                     INMAN
                         Hey!
                              (they stop, turn)
                         I'd pay a dollar for an egg. A piece 
                         of cheese.

               They look at him, then continue on their way.

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN

               Ada wakes up to persistent knocking.

                                     RUBY
                         Ada? Ada? You up?

                                     ADA
                         Yes.
                              (opening her eyes)
                         It's still dark.

                                     RUBY
                         Tell the cows that. It's late.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN

               Ada enters blearily, clutching her novel. Ruby already busy.

                                     ADA
                         I have to eat something.

                                     RUBY
                         Then you have to get up earlier.
                              (at Ada's book)
                         What's that?

                                     ADA
                         A novel.

                              (heading outside)
                         You want to carry a book carry one 
                         you can write in --

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

               Ruby emerges, followed by Ada, chewing on a tomato.

                                     RUBY
                         -- we got our own story. Called Black 
                         Cove Farm: a catastrophe.

               She looks back at Ada for a reaction.

                                     RUBY
                         I can spell it, too. C-a-t-a-s-t-r-o-
                         phe. Learned the same place you did, 
                         in the schoolroom. That's one of the 
                         first words they taught me. Ruby 
                         Thewes, you are a ca-t-a-s-t-r-o-p-h-
                         e...

               They're heading for the stable.

               INT. STABLE, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby's already pitching hay. Turns to Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         You mucking out?

               Ada half-asleep, obedient, stunned by this energy.

                                     RUBY
                         Three years I was in school before 
                         my daddy -- saying God rest his soul 
                         is like wishing him what he had in 
                         life, cause he lived to rest, he was 
                         born tired -- before my daddy decided 
                         there was better use for my backside 
                         than have it sat all day in front of 
                         a blackboard.

               EXT. A FIELD OF WEEDS, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby dictates a list to Ada as they bustle along.

                                     RUBY
                         Number One -- layout a winter garden 
                         for cool season crops: turnips, 
                         onions, cabbage, greens.

               Ada scribbles, walks, scribbles.

               EXT. BARN, BLACK COVE FARM

               Ruby up a ladder, inspecting the roof.

                                     RUBY
                         Number Two: patch the shingles on 
                         the barn roof. Do we have a maul and 
                         froe?

                                     ADA
                              (writing, holding the 
                              ladder)
                         Maul?

                                     RUBY
                         M-a-u-l.

                                     ADA
                         I have no idea.

               INT. COLD HOUSE, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby cleans out leaves and detritus from the stone channel, 
               allowing the stream to flow free and cool.

                                     RUBY
                         Number three: clay crocks for 
                         preserves. Tomatoes. Beans. Jams.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               Ruby doing her version of soil analysis, scrunching the earth, 
               tasting it, spitting it out. Ada makes a face.

                                     RUBY
                         Clear and turn this field. No harm 
                         done letting it go fallow, now we'll 
                         do well.

               EXT. OUTBUILDINGS, BLACK COVE FARM. AFTERNOON

               Ruby looks up. Ada catches up with her.

                                     RUBY
                         Number fifteen

                                     ADA
                         Sixteen.

                                     RUBY
                         Number sixteen: let's get a martin 
                         colony going in the Gourd House. 
                         Keep away crows. You got one thing 
                         in abundance on this farm and that's 
                         crows.

                                     ADA
                         What's a Gourd House?

               EXT. APPLE ORCHARD, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               Ruby, delighted, contemplates the bounty of apples.

                                     RUBY
                         There's survival. On them trees.
                              (turns to an exhausted 
                              Ada)
                         You got a cider press or would that 
                         be wishing on a blessing?

                                     ADA
                         Actually, yes, I think we do.

               Ruby whoops, jogs away. Ada, exhausted takes a bite of an 
               apple, watches her.

               EXT. A BLUFF. NIGHT

               INMAN WALKS A ROCKY TRACK, FALLING AWAY TO THE RIVER AT ONE 
               SIDE, A STEEP CLIFF TO THE OTHER, the way itself broken and 
               precarious, bad country to meet an enemy.

               Inman sees A LIGHT in the distance, a torch flicking in and 
               out of view, like a star to follow. He stops, narrows his 
               eyes to focus on the view, listening hard. He pulls out the 
               Lemats.

               A MAN, ALL IN BLACK, A HORSE IN TOW, IS AT THE EDGE OF THE 
               GORGE.

               The horse has a burden -- a sack or wrapped bundle draped 
               over either side of the saddle. The attempts to heave the 
               bundle onto his shoulders. He can't, and the bundle slips to 
               the ground, cover falling enough to glimpse an arm, a head. 
               IT IS THE BODY OF A BLACK GIRL. The man tries again to lift 
               her. He's clearly upset, despairing, his hat comes off to 
               reveal long, dandy's hair, all extravagant curls. He staggers 
               with the weight of the girl, heading for the lip of the deep 
               gorge.

               He kisses the girl again and again, cheeks, mouth, mumbling 
               to her. He's at the edge now and can just let her go. THEN 
               INMAN'S GUN IS AT HIS TEMPLE.

                                     INMAN
                         Don't let go. Just back up, nice and 
                         steady, do this all in reverse, you're 
                         going to end up with her draped back 
                         over your animal.

                                     VEASEY
                         Don't pull that trigger. I am a man 
                         of God.

                                     INMAN
                         I've killed several of them.

                                     VEASEY
                         I mean I am God's minister.

                                     INMAN
                         What part of God's business is 
                         throwing a woman down a gorge.

                                     VEASEY
                         A slave woman, can you see that in 
                         this light? She's black as a bucket 
                         of tar.

               He's retreating, on his way back to the horse.

                                     INMAN
                         Is she dead?

                                     VEASEY
                         Drugged her. Like you would a 
                         butterfly. And I care for her, that's 
                         the heartbreak of it.

               He has the girl back on the horse. Inman brings the torch up 
               to his face. It's tear-stained.

                                     VEASEY
                         She's got my bastard in her belly. 
                         What kind of pistol is that I never 
                         saw the like of it?

               EXT. VEASEY TOWN. NIGHT

               Inman leads the horse, with Veasey ahead of him, hands tied 
               behind his back, desperate for a reprieve.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm begging you. It's better you 
                         blowout my brains than return me to 
                         this place.

                                     INMAN
                         Where does she live?

                                     VEASEY
                         In our house. She sleeps in our 
                         kitchen. You don't know me, friend, 
                         but the good Lord punished me with 
                         want. I am all appetite. That's all 
                         I do all day is want: food, the female 
                         parts...

                                     INMAN
                         Shut your mouth. I don't want a sermon 
                         every time I ask a question.

               They're in the town's main drag now. There's a Chapel and 
               next to it, a small house.

                                     INMAN
                         This your place?

                                     VEASEY
                         Dear God of misery.

                                     INMAN
                         You're going to put her back where 
                         she sleeps.

                                     VEASEY
                         I do that the Members will lynch me. 
                         Consorting with a nigger, adultery, 
                         siring a bastard while serving as 
                         their preacher. We're a strict 
                         congregation we've churched men for 
                         picking up a fiddle on the sabbath.

                                     INMAN
                         So you reckoned to kill her.

               Disgusted, Inman approaches the front door of the house.

                                     VEASEY
                         There's a back door. Have pity.

               And he leads Inman down a side path.

               INT. VEASEY HOUSE. NIGHT

               Veasey comes in, now carrying the girl. Inman comes behind, 
               the gun trained on Veasey as he sets her down by the fire.

                                     VEASEY
                              (whispering)
                         Thank you. I was going to do a 
                         grievous wrong.

               He looks longing at the girl as he puts the blanket around 
               her shoulders. He turns to Inman.

                                     VESEY
                         You tasted dark meat? Sweet as 
                         liquorice. I think I should go back 
                         up to my wife. She wakes at the 
                         slightest noise.

               Inman is incredulous that he thinks he can just go to bed...

                                     INMAN
                         You find me some paper and a pen.

               EXT. CHAPEL, VEASEY TOWN. DAWN

               INMAN HAS TIED A VERY DISTRAUGHT VEASEY TO A TREE IN FRONT 
               OF HIS CHAPEL. Inman is pinning a sheet of paper above 
               Veasey's head. It's covered in handwriting. A dog barks.

                                     VEASEY
                         You're not entitled to judge me! 
                         You're nothing but an outlier, plain 
                         as daylight!

               Inman has pulled a handkerchief from Veasey's jacket. He 
               stuffs it into his mouth, cutting this diatribe short. And 
               then he walks away leaving Veasey tied to the tree, cursing 
               through the handkerchief.

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN

               Ada asleep. Ruby enters, shattering the calm.

                                     RUBY
                         Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in 
                         the woods?

                                     ADA
                         No. What? No. We bought our hams.

                                     RUBY
                         There's a world more to a hog than 
                         the two hams! Lard, for example, 
                         we'll need plenty --

               She picks up some discarded laundry, contemplates the 
               overflowing laundry basket.

                                     RUBY
                         The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's 
                         laundry.
                              (marching out)
                         I can feel you shutting your eyes.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada and Ruby working with the horse to make the beginnings 
               of A SPLIT RAIL FENCE. As they struggle with a heavy rail, 
               Ruby is testing Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         What's this wood?

                                     ADA
                         I don't know. Locust?

                                     RUBY
                         Where's North?

                                     ADA
                         North is, North is --

                                     RUBY
                         Name me three herbs growing wild on 
                         this farm.

                                     ADA
                              (frustrated with Ruby 
                              and with herself)
                         I can't! I can't! All right? I can 
                         talk about farming in Latin. Will 
                         that do? I can read French. I know 
                         Harmony and Counterpoint. I know my 
                         Bible. I can name the principal rivers 
                         of Europe, but don't ask me to name 
                         one stream in this county. I can 
                         embroider, but I can't darn, I can 
                         arrange cut flowers, but I can't 
                         grow them. If a thing has a function, 
                         if I might do something with it, it 
                         wasn't considered suitable.

                                     RUBY
                         Why?

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty 
                         much everything to do with me.

               They manage to get the first line of rail set down.

                                     ADA
                         This fence is about the first thing 
                         I've ever done that'll produce an 
                         actual result.

                                     RUBY
                         So you never wrapped your legs around 
                         this Inman?

               An old-fashioned look from Ada...

               EXT. SUNKEN FOREST. DAY

               Inman finds himself in A SUNKEN FOREST OF PINE. He moves 
               warily, his beard longer, his figure gaunt, his clothes 
               weathering to a uniform smudge of charcoal.

               He hears DOGS BARKING IN THE DISTANCE, FAINT SHOUTS. He picks 
               up his pace, skirts round the swampy lake.

               EXT. CAPE FEAR RIVER. DUSK

               Inman comes to the bank of a HUGE RIVER. The water, as the 
               light begins to go, is the color of mud, with bubbles, 
               belching to the surface, full of ugly prominent. Inman is 
               almost jogging now, an ear tracking his still distant 
               pursuers. The river is too wide to contemplate swimming and 
               now it begins to curve left, forcing him -- against his 
               judgment, to circle back. He approaches A SMALL JETTY.

               A sign: Ferry $5. Yell Loud.

               On the far bank there's A CABIN ON STILTS above the highwater 
               mark. Inman calls out, reluctantly, his voice still a kind 
               of growl. Then again.

               A TINY FIGURE steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping 
               into a small canoe. The canoe heads against the current, the 
               rower's back bent with the effort. As the canoe approaches, 
               Inman sees that the ferryman is, in fact, A YOUNG GIRL, not 
               eighteen. She doesn't look at him. He produces five dollars. 
               She eyes the bill with contempt.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         For five dollars I wouldn't give a 
                         parched man a dipper of this 
                         riverwater.

                                     INMAN
                         Sign says ferry, five dollars.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         This look like a ferry? My Daddy's 
                         dead, or gone off to the Federals, 
                         don't matter which. I'm the way across 
                         now.

                                     INMAN
                         What's the name of this thing?

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Nothing but the mighty Cape Fear 
                         River, is all.

               A dog barks in the distance. Getting closer. Inman turns to 
               the sound. The Ferrygirl is well aware of her leverage.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Nobody crosses this water unless 
                         they're running from someplace. Some 
                         cross one way, some the other: makes 
                         no difference, they're all running. 
                         You want to wait for your friends?

                                     INMAN
                         I can give you thirty dollars script.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Let's go.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Hey! Hey! Wait!

               Inman is astonished to see VEASEY stumble out of the trees. 
               His head is shaved, his face bruised and swollen, his clothes 
               castoffs and ill-fitting, cinched at the waist with rope. He 
               stumbles towards Inman, urging him to get on with the journey.

                                     VEASEY
                         Keep going. We're both in trouble.

               He gets straight into the canoe.

                                     INMAN
                         No. Get out.

                                     VEASEY
                         It's Homeguard. Made me tell them 
                         all about you.

                                     INMAN
                         I should have shot you when I had 
                         the chance.

               Shouts, more barking. Inman jumps in the canoe, and they're 
               off. The Ferrygirl turns the boat around, rows them away 
               from the jetty with the grace of someone doing something for 
               the thousandth time.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm not looking for revenge, by the 
                         way. For what you did to me. No, I'm 
                         a Pilgrim now, like you, traveling 
                         the road, paying our dues, relying 
                         on the kindness of strangers.

                                     INMAN
                         You're nothing like me and the last 
                         thing I want right now is a 
                         conversation.

                                     VEASEY
                              (to Ferrygirl)
                         You recall Job in the scriptures? I 
                         will give free utterance to my 
                         complaint. I will speak in the 
                         bitterness of my soul. That's our 
                         friend here...
                              (to Inman)
                         They cut off my hair. Which was hard. 
                         I was vain about my hair.
                              (to Ferrygirl)
                         I had good curls. But I deserved it. 
                         I'm the Reverend Veasey. Have I seen 
                         you in church?

               Inman sits, scouring the bank for sign of his pursuers. The 
               sun is sinking fast.

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         I'm saving for a cowhide, and when I 
                         get it I aim to get a saddle made, 
                         and when I get me a saddle I'll save 
                         for a horse, and when I got a horse 
                         I'll throw on the saddle, and then 
                         you won't see my sorry ass round 
                         this swamp again.

               She has no love for the river. Another gurgle of viscous 
               bubbles around the canoe.

                                     VEASEY
                         What's that?

                                     FERRYGIRL
                         Catfish. 'gator. Keep your hand in 
                         the boat. Already looks like some 
                         critter chewed his neck.
                              (she looks at Inman)
                         Thirty more dollars, we can go to 
                         the cabin. I'll pull this dress over 
                         my head.

                                     VEASEY
                              (excited)
                         Have we got thirty dollars?

               A sharp sound, a tiny thwack of ball on meat. The Ferrygirl 
               SUDDENLY SLUMPS BACK and falls into the water.

               Veasey grabs out at the oar, but it goes, too. The girl sinks 
               quickly, A BLOODY GAP to the side of her head. Inman, on his 
               knees and stretching, can't help her. Then a second noise as 
               A HOLE THE SIZE OF A FIST appears in the canoe, just at 
               waterlevel. Water pours into the canoe. Dogs bark, and now 
               FIGURES are visible at the jetty. HOME GUARD. One of them 
               has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot. Inman 
               can see him sighting the rifle. They lie flat in the canoe.

               ANOTHER GREAT FIST OF WOOD is gouged out. Now the boat is 
               almost full of water. Veasey spits out a foul mouthful. INMAN 
               ROCKS THE CANOE AND LETS IT TURN OVER ONTO THEM, Veasey 
               surfaces from under it, clutching the wood as a raft, but 
               the canoe CATCHES INMAN A BLOW TO HIS HEAD and he sinks. 
               Veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong, 
               holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets the 
               current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, then 
               up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver its 
               assault, another shot into the boat, another into the water 
               near to Veasey's arm.

               THE GIRL'S BODY comes by them, carried by the river, the 
               dress billowing out almost covering her head. The sun has 
               gone, the light fading, the canoe sliding downriver away 
               from their aggressors.

               EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CAPE FEAR. NIGHT

               In the moonlight, the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and 
               Veasey drags a half-drowned Inman to land, both of them 
               retching with the vile river water. AN ALLIGATOR eases into 
               the river not ten feet from where they lie, lungs heaving. 
               They get up. Veasey to his feet, Inman to his knees.

                                     VEASEY
                         You okay?

               Inman nods, coughs. And Veasey AIMS A KICK at Inman's head, 
               knocking him back into the mud.

                                     INMAN
                         Jesus, god!

                                     VEASEY
                         I figure that righteous, given our 
                         history. Otherwise I'd bear a grudge 
                         on our journey.

                                     INMAN
                         There's nowhere I'm going with you 
                         except to Hellfire!

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM. BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada, her hair plaited in a new and simpler configuration, is 
               working on Ruby's hair, while Ruby experiments with some 
               earrings.

               A pile of Ada's jewelry on the bed beside them.

                                     ADA
                         Agricola poetis viam non monstrat.

                         Which means?

                                     ADA
                         The farmer does not point out the 
                         road to a poet.

                                     RUBY
                         Which means? Should be the other way 
                         round

                                     ADA
                         Which means, I suppose, which means 
                         the poet should know where he's going.

                                     RUBY
                              (of Ada's hairdressing)
                         It's no wonder you're helpless and 
                         hopeless if it takes this long to 
                         fix your hair.

                              knows all these 
                              phrases by heart)
                         It's appalling what's in my head.

                         No, it means: A change of place does 
                         not change a character.

                                     RUBY
                         Well that's surely true even in 
                         English.

                         You can keep those earrings.

                                     RUBY
                         We can't keep anything.

                         I have to keep the bangles. They 
                         were my mother's.

                                     RUBY
                         Well that's all. The rest is for 
                         trading. Else they can bury you in 
                         your finery.

                         You're done.

               There's a small mirror on a stand. It has Inman's picture 
               stuck in it. She picks it up, removing the tintype, and 
               holding it up for Ruby to see her hairstyle.

                                     RUBY
                         Good God! Okay.

               She takes the mirror and shows Ada her simple plait.

                                     ADA
                         I like it.

                         Takes two minutes. That's what I 
                         like.

               She puts the earrings back in the pile.

                                     RUBY
                         How much do you love that piano?

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               THE PIANO jangles down the rutted lane on the back of Mr. 
               Roy's cart. Ada watches, A SMALL FLOCK of sheep milling around 
               her in the path. Ruby is dragging a big sow towards the yard. 
               Ada picks up one of two sacks and staggers towards the house.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               Ada arrives in the kitchen. They've got it under control 
               now, scrubbed and orderly. She puts the sack down next to 
               another one. Her hands are calloused, the finger nails cracked 
               and ruined, stripes of earth under them. Ruby comes in, 
               struggling with the last sack, pleased.

                                     RUBY
                         We're careful we'll get through the 
                         winter now. I made old man Roy give 
                         me ten of those sheep on account of 
                         I said they were so small put together 
                         they were no bigger than six proper 
                         sheep.

                         My father always wanted sheep on 
                         this land.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm sorry you had to lose your piano. 
                         I cut off my hair once, for money. 
                         My daddy got two dollars for it. 
                         Made a wig for a rich feller in 
                         Raleigh.

               They're working as they talk, taking the sacks into the 
               larder, putting out stuff for the evening meal.

                                     RUBY
                         Stobrod called himself a musician -- 
                         my daddy -- he could play six tune 
                         on a fiddle. Got himself shot dead 
                         at Petersburg. I was like his goat 
                         or some creature tethered to a post. 
                         He left me once, up the mountains. I 
                         was eight. He was gone over two weeks.

                                     ADA
                         Oh Ruby.

                              (defiant)
                         I was all right! He'd walk forty 
                         miles for liquor and not forty inches 
                         for kindness.

                                     ADA
                         And your mother?

                                     RUBY
                         Never met her. We're the same in 
                         that regard. He said she was -- he 
                         told me a thousand stories -- she 
                         was a wolf or an indian or a donkey. 
                         Don't say much for him, except you 
                         know he'd be fast to work up a sweat 
                         on a tree if he thought there was 
                         pleasure in it.

               There's a pause. Ruby not easy with her emotions. Abruptly 
               she jumps up.

                                     RUBY
                         There's cows to milk.

               EXT. RIVER, EN ROUTE TO SALISBURY. DAY

               Inman stands in the river, hoping to catch a fish, trying to 
               concentrate. Veasey presides, complaining...

                                     VEASEY
                         Used to be as regular as morning 
                         prayers. Matter of fact I could set 
                         my watch by my bowels. That beeswax 
                         you fed me, day before yesterday, it 
                         stops a man up. Open my gut now they'd 
                         find turds stacked up like little 
                         black twigs.

               On a parallel track across the river, RIDERS... impossible 
               to say whether Home Guard or a Federal Raiding Party. Inman 
               splashes out of the water, pushes Veasey down, silencing 
               him. The riders pass.

               Veasey spots something shining in the grass, picks it up. 
               IT'S A LONG TWO-HANDED SAW.

                                     VEASEY
                         Hey! Look at this!
                              (flexing it)
                         This is a good saw.

                                     INMAN
                              (getting up)
                         It's not yours. You take it, you 
                         make us another enemy. You're a 
                         Christian -- don' t you know your 
                         commandments?

                                     VEASEY
                         You'll find the good Lord very 
                         flexible on the subject of property. 
                         We could do a lot with this saw...

               Inman is vexed, walks away. Veasey follows, experimenting 
               with the saw's music when flexed. Inman stalks on.

               EXT. NEAR A FORD. DAY

               Inman way ahead, full of purpose. Veasey still has the saw, 
               trots to catch up.

                                     VEASEY
                         Why you in such a hurry the whole 
                         time?
                              (no answer)
                         Hurry or slow the destination is 
                         always the same. It's only the journey 
                         that is different. That's either in 
                         the Good Book or I made it up.

               Inman suddenly stops, scowling, puts up a hand, listens.

               Inman carefully scouts the track then, with great caution, 
               edges towards the river bank.

               A HEAVY SET MAN labours in the water. He's contemplating THE 
               HUGE BLACK CARCASS OF A BULL which has slipped into the ford 
               and died. The man is wet and exasperated.

                                     VEASEY
                         Good day to you!

               The man turns, his spirit evidently lifted by the prospect 
               of help. His name is JUNIOR. He's working on roping the 
               animal.

                                     JUNIOR
                         My old bull, wandered off and died 
                         in this here creek. Fouled up our 
                         water is how I found it.

               Veasey is immediately an authority on bull removal.

                                     VEASEY
                         This is a tricky one.

               The three men contemplate the carcass, swatting away the 
               swarms of flies. Junior offers a swig from a jug of liquor.

               Inman refuses, Veasey takes a long pull, shudders happily.

                                     VEASEY
                         The name for the Bull's member is a 
                         tassel. I learned that and never 
                         forgot it.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Reckon I need a train of mules.

                                     VEASEY
                              (walking away)
                         I'm getting an idea. My saw is the 
                         remedy. Let's saw up some wood and 
                         make levers.

                                     INMAN
                         Then what?

                                     VEASEY
                         Lever him out. This'll work!

               He walks into the wood.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Where you two sports heading?

                                     INMAN
                              (inscrutable)
                         I don't know where he's heading. I'm 
                         going down the road. And I got a 
                         good way to go before nightfall.

                                     JUNIOR
                              (acknowledging his 
                              attitude)
                         Charitable of you to make a stop. 
                         Ain't for me to be curious.

                                     VEASEY

                              woods)
                         How do you work this damn thing?

                                     INMAN
                              (to Veasey)
                         Give me that saw.
                              (to Junior)
                         Come on.

               He takes the saw, walks to the bull, gets on one side, 
               indicates Junior should go to the other.

                                     INMAN
                         Let's do this in chapters.

               And they begin to SAW OFF THE BULL'S NECK.

               LATER, and they're in A VILE STEW OF BLOOD AND INNARDS. The 
               stomach opens and its contents gush into the creek. Veasey 
               is disgusted, draws back. The two other men haul up the rest 
               of the animal onto the banks. They're exhausted.

                                     INMAN
                         You might want to leave off that 
                         water for a day or two.

                                     JUNIOR
                         There'll be a tang, I'd imagine.

               EXT. TRACK APPROACHING JUNIOR'S CABIN. EVENING

               Junior, Inman and Veasey come around a bend and there's A 
               BIG CABIN LOOMING. It's in such poor repair that one end has 
               slipped from the stones which serve as it's foundation and 
               STANDS BADLY TILTED OVER. Junior roots up another hidden jug 
               of liquor, which he drinks from, then hands to Veasey.

                                     JUNIOR
                         There's my place. Hope you can stomach 
                         a yard chock-full of females. Brought 
                         my woman home, she showed up with 
                         her three so-called sisters and their 
                         brats. The noise in that place is 
                         something awful. It's why I go 
                         hunting.

                                     VEASEY
                              (considering the wild 
                              camber)
                         Looks a bit crooked.

                                     JUNIOR
                         It is on a bit of a tilt. Them 
                         females. They all roll down one end 
                         each night!

                                     VEASEY
                         -- Roll me over!

                                     JUNIOR
                         -- In the clover

                                     VEASEY
                         One good fart -- that'll tip over!

               They guffaw, delighted in the alcohol haze. Veasey suddenly 
               exclaims, hand in the air, rushes into the bushes.

                                     VEASEY
                         Oh God of my God! Hallelujah! 
                         Hallelujah!

                                     JUNIOR
                         What's up?

                                     VEASEY
                         The Israelites! The tribes of Israel 
                         are about to flee from the banks of 
                         Egypt! Hallelujah!

                                     INMAN
                              (explaining to Junior)
                         He's got a shit coming on. It's 
                         overdue.

                                     JUNIOR
                              (bewildered)
                         And he's a Preacher? Like a Christian?

                                     INMAN
                         Like a Christian.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Good God.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK

               The three men arrive at the yard. DOGS AND CHILDREN MILL 
               AROUND THE VISITORS. FOUR WOMEN COME OUT, one after the other 
               each of them in simple shifts which seem to emphasis their 
               voluptuousness, or so it seems to Veasey. They freely stare.

                                     JUNIOR
                         These two boys is stopping for supper. 
                         They're on the road to Atonement.

               The women consider the men, then disappear back inside.

                                     VEASEY
                         Atonement is not a place.

                                     JUNIOR
                         So what is it when it's at home?

                                     VEASEY
                         Those are fine examples of the female.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Take them all and leave the saw. Be 
                         a sight more use.

                                     SHYLA
                              (reappearing)
                         If they want to get in a tub there's 
                         an hour before food.

                                     JUNIOR
                         They love to scrub a man.
                              (to Shyla)
                         Put the water on the boil.
                              (back to the men)
                         It's my liquor, gets their titties 
                         swinging.

                                     VEASEY
                              (excited)
                         God damn!
                              (to Inman)
                         I was right about sheep droppings 
                         those stools -- like rock hard. Quite 
                         astonishing.

               INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DUSK

               No real furniture. Veasey is shaving. Inman stows his knapsack 
               behind the woodburning stove, on which a big kettle of boiling 
               water steams away. Then he gets in the tub, his back to the 
               door.

               Shyla comes in, brings the kettle over to the tub, pours in 
               the steaming water. She appraises Inman. It's intensely 
               sexual.

                                     SHYLA
                         That's battered flesh.
                              (of his neck wound)
                         I could work a finger in there.

                                     VEASEY
                         He's a hero. Took that wound at 
                         Petersburg.

                                     INMAN
                         He doesn't know what I am.
                              (uncomfortable with 
                              her stare)
                         Thanks.

                                     SHYLA
                              (to Veasey)
                         He's shy, ain't he?

                                     VEASEY
                         Wait up a few minutes, I'll be in 
                         that tub, then we'll see who's a shy 
                         one.

                                     SHYLA
                         I want to poke my thumb in his holes.

               A second woman comes to the door. Dolly.

                                     DOLLY
                         Lila says supper's up.

               INT. JUNIOR'S CABIN, NIGHT

               LILA, JUNIOR'S WIFE, spoons out stew from a vast pot. The 
               table crammed with customers -- her three sisters, the three 
               men, the herd of dogs and filthy children. Nobody speaks. 
               Each time Lila bends over to spoon out of the pot, her 
               cleavage strains against the flimsy fabric of her dress. 
               Veasey's mesmerized. Inman is also getting drunk, his eyes 
               increasingly glazed. When Lila makes to sit down next to 
               Junior, he slides a hand up her dress, exposing a naked 
               buttock, which he strokes and pinches as he pulls away.

                                     LILA
                         Hey!

               Junior grins, looks over at Inman, then nudges Veasey.

                                     JUNIOR
                         He's gone now. Look! His eyes have 
                         gone.

                                     INMAN
                              (vaguely, drunk)
                         What?

                                     VEASEY
                         Dolly?

                                     DOLLY
                         S'me.

                                     VEASEY
                         Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae. That's a 
                         poem. That's a poem.

               He begins to recite, has a verse in his mind.

                                     VEASEY
                         Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae
                              (but he can' t summon 
                              it)
                         Da-da da-da da-da dae...
                              (vague)
                         ...there's a poem there.

                                     JUNIOR
                         I'm leaving soon as I'm full.

                                     VEASEY
                         Really. Goodbye.

                                     JUNIOR
                         Got a bunch of traps needs visiting. 
                         I'll be back tomorrow, before dark. 
                         You'll still be here?

                                     VEASEY
                         That's my fervent prayer.

                                     JUNIOR
                         My house is your house.

                                     INMAN
                              (suddenly)
                         Like to wash their hands and pray.

                                     VEASEY
                         Say again?

                                     INMAN
                         Dolly, Lila, Shyla and Mae.

                                     VEASEY
                         That's Job. Don't say much but even 
                         liquored up there's a preacher in 
                         him.

               Inman gets up suddenly, sways.

                                     INMAN
                         I'll say my goodbyes, got miles and 
                         miles to go before sunset.
                              (head spinning)
                         I'll just quickly lie down.

               And he stumbles over to the fire where he instantly curls 
               up.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm heading for that smokehouse and 
                         I'm ready to be washed clean of my 
                         dirt.

               He gets up, wanders out of the door. Junior's eyes glint. He 
               jerks his head towards the girls then in the direction of 
               the smokehouse.

                                     JUNIOR
                         You go tend to him.
                              (to Lila)
                         I'll be seeing you.

               He picks up his gun and leaves Dolly gathering up the children 
               and herding them out.

                                     DOLLY
                         Come on you -- get!

               Shyla stays, Mae having gone off after Veasey. Lila waits 
               until the children have gone. They consider Inman supine by 
               the fire.

                                     LILA
                         He's mine. You can go rub yourself 
                         off on the Preacher.
                              (of Inman)
                         Gonna make him hug me till I grunt.

               Lila shepherds Shyla out, shuts the door, swigs from the 
               jug, walks over to Inman, then turns to the big table and 
               pushes pots and plates way down to one end to make a playing 
               field.

               Then she bends over the prostrate Inman.

                                     LILA
                         Hey!

               Inman stirs, glazed.

                                     LILA
                              (kneeling down to him)
                         You want to see what Mamma's got for 
                         you?

               SHE SLIPS A SLEEVE OF HER DRESS TO REVEAL A FULL BREAST.

               Inman is drunk, doesn't think he's awake. She takes her breast 
               to his mouth, and Inman suckles. Then she puts his hands 
               under the dress which rides up as his hands move between her 
               legs. She's naked.

                                     LILA
                         That's good. Ain't that sweet?

               SHE PULLS INMAN TO HIS FEET, KISSES HIM, THEN TURNS HER BACK 
               AND LIES FACE DOWN ON THE TABLE, HER BARE ASS UNDULATING IN 
               THE AIR.

                                     LILA
                         You just get on and ride me all the 
                         way to China.

               He doesn't move, except to sway, eyes glazed. She turns.

                                     LILA
                         You shy? You need a hand?
                              (goes to his buttons)
                         Let's have a look see what we can 
                         muster.

               She's kneeling now, her dress hunched up around her middle, 
               working the front of Inman's pants. He's in a swoon, 
               surrendering to her, getting aroused, his hand cupping her 
               head. ON CUE, THE DOOR CRASHES OPEN AND HE'S STARING DOWN 
               THE BARREL OF JUNIOR'S SHOTGUN.

               As Lila turns, Junior KICKS HER violently in the head, 
               knocking her over.

                                     JUNIOR
                         You little bitch! Look at you! Cover 
                         yourself up!

               NEXT HE SWINGS THE SHOTGUN BARREL AGAINST THE SIDE OF INMAN'S 
               HEAD. Inman falls back. Junior goes to the door and whistles.

               AND WITH THAT THE ROOM FILLS UP WITH A GROUP OF HOME GUARD 
               BRISTLING WITH WEAPONS AND PURPOSE. THEY SEIZE INMAN, DRAG 
               HIM OUT AS JUNIOR SPITS AND KICKS AT HIM.

               INT. SMOKEHOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Lila enters the smokehouse, hand to her bruised head. VEASEY'S 
               ON THE FLOOR, WITH DOLLY ASTRIDE HIM, HIS ARM CRUSHING A 
               NAKED MAE INTO AN EMBRACE. He considers Lila, beams:

                                     VEASEY
                         I had a special prayer you'd come 
                         visit.

               THREE MEN BURST IN BEHIND HER, RIFLES RAISED.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Veasey led out, a CHAIN GANG waiting -- a bedraggled 
               collection of prisoners, slaves, deserters -- and now INMAN. 
               Veasey is joined to the line. It starts to rain.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Ruby and Ada at the door of the Swanger house. They both 
               wear Monroe's clothes by now, like two little men. THEY'RE 
               CARRYING A SMALL SACK, A PIE UNDER A CLOTH. Ruby hammers at 
               the door, a little impatient. Sally Swanger opens it, has to 
               decode who it is under the clothes, the hats.

                                     SALLY
                         Ada Monroe and Ruby Thewes! Look at 
                         you both!

                                     RUBY
                         Look at us both what?

                                     SALLY
                         Like a coupla scarecrows after a 
                         thunderstorm.

                                     RUBY
                         We need a scarecrow, birds eating up 
                         half our winter garden.

                                     ADA
                         Sally's right. We should both stop 
                         toiling and stand a while with our 
                         arms stretch out. I'll volunteer.

                                     RUBY
                         We got something for you.

                                     ADA
                         For all your kindness. Coffee. And a 
                         pie.

                                     RUBY
                         That's real coffee. It ain't hickory 
                         and dirt.

                                     SALLY
                              (taking the gifts)
                         Thank you both.
                              (of the pie)
                         Ruby, I look forward to this. We all 
                         do. Esco and me.

                                     RUBY
                              (grinning at Ada)
                         She made it.

                                     ADA
                         I made it.

                                     SALLY
                         Good God in Heaven.

                                     RUBY
                              (by way of 
                              recommendation)
                         I'm still alive.

               Sally's strangely awkward, lingering at the door, staring at 
               the gifts...

                                     RUBY
                         We'll be getting along.

                                     SALLY
                              (nodding)
                         I know Esco's going to be real sorry 
                         he missed you. You all take care.

               They all kiss, then the girls walk back down the path. Ruby 
               is vexed.

                                     RUBY
                         That strike you as odd?

                                     ADA
                         What?

                                     RUBY
                         Stood at her front door?

                                     ADA
                         Sally?

                                     RUBY
                         Number one -- I know that woman all 
                         my life. I never stood outside her 
                         house -- she'd invite a wolf inside 
                         if it knocked on the door.

                                     ADA
                         Perhaps, I don't know, perhaps she 
                         was busy.

                                     RUBY
                         Number two -- Old Man Swanger was 
                         inside that house: I could smell his 
                         pipe burning. Number three -- look 
                         at these fields.

                                     ADA
                         What about them?

               She contemplated the stubble fields they're passing.

                                     RUBY
                         We came by here a week ago, they 
                         were waist high in hay.

               EXT. A PATH. DRIVING RAIN. NIGHT

               The Home Guard ride, bent under their oilskins, as the rain 
               tips down. Between the horses, unprotected and drenched, 
               their prisoners trudge along the muddy path. Inman and Veasey 
               among them. Veasey has grown some beard.

               AN OLDER MAN COLLAPSES, lies where he falls, not moving.

               There's a domino effect and so Inman falls on top of him. He 
               picks himself up, then tries to pull up the older man. He 
               doesn't move.

                                     INMAN
                         He's dead.

               The horses plough on. Inman shouts to BROWN, the leader.

                                     INMAN
                         This man's dead!

               Nobody pays any attention. He has to drag the body.

               EXT. VEASEY TOWN. DAY

               THE HOME GUARD ESCORT THE PRISONERS PAST VEASEY'S OLD CHURCH.

               More days have gone by and taken their toll on the prisoners, 
               Veasey and Inman are haggard and filthy and reduced. The 
               Home Guards stop for food, a wash, a break, chain the 
               prisoners to a horse rail.

               Citizens go by, Veasey knows them all. Some of them spit 
               contemptuously at the Deserters. None of them recognise 
               Veasey.

                                     VEASEY
                         Am I so altered that they don't see 
                         me?

               Somebody walks by with a young child.

               Veasey looks at Inman.

                                     VEASEY
                         I christened that child.

               The child stops, looks without recognizing, is tugged away 
               from the chain gang by his mother. One of the other prisoners, 
               SHEFFIELD, leans in to Inman, his voice low.

                                     SHEFFIELD
                         I'm looking to get out of this. They 
                         drag us back to fight -- we're just 
                         target practice for the Federal boys.

                                     INMAN
                         You run, we're all running with you, 
                         the lame and the stupid, of which we 
                         number both.

                                     SHEFFIELD
                         Either way we're fucked. Run or don't 
                         run.

                                     INMAN
                         Just give me some warning so I can 
                         tell the guard -- I'm not getting 
                         shot again for some cause I don't 
                         believe in.

               A GROUP OF SLAVES ARE WALKING BY, CARRYING SACKS. One of the 
               women is pregnant. Veasey studies the group, sees the pregnant 
               woman, recognizes her.

                                     VEASEY
                              (mesmerized)
                         That's Rebecca. That's Rebecca.
                              (he hisses)
                         Rebecca!

               In daylight it's apparent that Rebecca is a real beauty. She 
               turns at the sound of her name, stops, is confused. She sees 
               Veasey and approaches, appalled at his condition.

                                     REBECCA
                         Mas?

                                     VEASEY
                         Is it well with you?
                              (Rebecca nods)
                         I've been repenting for what I did. 
                         I've walked the road of atonement.

                                     REBECCA
                         Your curls is all gone.

               THE GUARD KICKS HIM.

                                     GUARD
                         Hey!

                                     VEASEY
                              (holding his head, to 
                              Rebecca)
                         God Bless you.

               Rebecca, reluctant, rejoins the other slaves, walks away 
               with them, but then turns back to look at Veasey. She clearly 
               cares about him. And seeing her has somehow broken his heart.

               He turns away from Inman, towards Sheffield.

                                     VEASEY
                         I'm with you. I got a baby coming.

               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY

               THE CHAIN GANG TRUDGES DOWN THE TRACK, horses on either side 
               of them, steep banks forming a V for the railroad. A TRAIN 
               IS COMING. Brown rides up to the prisoners, herds them off 
               the track. The train approaches quite slowly -- the boxcars 
               full of wounded soldiers. Some of the Home Guard dismount, 
               take out pipes. The prisoners wait, one of them sits down.

               Sheffield says something to Veasey, who casually yanks up 
               the sitting prisoner. Inman suddenly understands what's going 
               to happen. The train is almost on them.

                                     INMAN
                         No!

               But it's too late. SHEFFIELD JERKS FORWARD IN FRONT OF THE 
               TRAIN, PULLING ALL THE OTHERS WITH HIM, their reluctance 
               tempered by the possibility of being crushed by the oncoming 
               train.

               SOMEHOW THE CHAIN GANG GETS ACROSS THE TRACK, stumbling and 
               chaotic, the chains yanking tight, then loose, the tight 
               causing a collapse, the loose a recovery.

               They run alongside the train, blocking themselves from the 
               fire of the Guard, Sheffield screaming tactics -- and then, 
               as the train starts to pull past them, they run up the bank, 
               now all as a unit scrambling to the steep summit.

               ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRAIN THE HOME GUARD HAVE REMOUNTED 
               THEIR HORSES AND ARE RIDING HARD ALONGSIDE IT. Then they 
               have sight of the escaping prisoners silhouetted at the top 
               of the bank like a line of paper dolls stretched out along 
               the ridge. Sheffield's yelling with adrenaline, Veasey joins 
               in, elated. One of the guards raises a rifle, steadies himself 
               on his horse, FIRES. He catches Veasey, who crumples, spinning 
               round and falling down the bank, until Inman uses all his 
               strength and practically lifts him in the air. The chain 
               recovers and works back up the bank.

               But then A SECOND BULLET catches another prisoner and this 
               time the effect is catastrophic -- THE WHOLE GANG JUST FLIPS 
               OVER AND PLUMMETS DOWN THE BANK. The Home Guard approach, 
               firing randomly at the bodies as they tumble into the ditch 
               by the side of the track. Until all movement ceases. Inman 
               has a wound to his head which bleeds profusely, almost 
               completely covering his face. Brown arrives, considers the 
               carnage.

                                     BROWN
                         Get these sacks of shit under the 
                         ground.

               INT. BARN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

               Ada's milking. It's barely daylight. She's slowly becoming a 
               country girl. Ruby appears in the doorway.

                                     RUBY
                         Someone's been in the corncrib.

                                     ADA
                         You sure?

                                     RUBY
                         It's a coon or possum. Scratched out 
                         a fist hole in the side. This place! 
                         I'm telling you -- we grow, others 
                         eat. I'll go into town, take the 
                         last of the cider and trade for a 
                         trap.

               INT. MONROE'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada is in Monroe's bedroom, looks out as Ruby goes off to 
               town, jugs of cider swung either side of the horse. Ada goes 
               over to Monroe's closet, pulls out some clothes.

               EXT. THE WINTER GARDEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada buttons Monroe's dress coat and completes the SCARECROW 
               she's spent the day making, save for the hat, which she now 
               fixes on, pushing in a hat pin to secure it. She's made a 
               stern black thing and steps back to consider it.

               Horsemen come riding along the lane. It's Teague and his 
               men.

               He doesn't stop but raises his hat to Ada.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada looks out at the Winter Garden. From that distance it 
               really does look like her father out in the field, arms 
               outstretched as if waiting for her to run to him. She finds 
               it unbearable, her tears coming, runs out into the fields, 
               attacks the scarecrow, pulling off the hat, the clothes...

               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. MORNING

               THE SOUND OF TINY BELLS. A misty drizzle. A GOAT snuffles 
               around in the freshly turned dirt: A hand, pale and wet, 
               protrudes from the thin layer of earth covering the bodies 
               of the murdered Chain Gang.

               SOMETHING SHIFTS UNDER THE DIRT, breaking the surface. Inman 
               wedged under three or four corpses -- their limbs and chains 
               wrapped around him, has regained consciousness. He coughs, 
               can't breathe properly, tries to work himself some air, 
               spitting out dirt. He makes a noise to distract the goat, 
               rattling the chains. Inman rears up, the bodies slithering 
               off him, but even then the animal only retreats a yard or 
               two. VEASEY SLIDES FACE UP, A BULLET IN HIS FOREHEAD LIKE A 
               MYSTICAL THIRD EYE. Inman feels a surprising loss and 
               tenderness. He heaves again, groaning with the pain of new 
               and old wounds.

               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ruby rides back from town along the river. An ugly looking 
               trap tied over the horses and three or four bulging sacks. 
               By an abandoned mill she sees the Home Guard under the trees.

               She slows up.

                                     TEAGUE
                         What you looking to catch?

                                     RUBY
                         What?

                                     TEAGUE
                         With that trap.

                                     RUBY
                         We got some critter stealing our 
                         corn.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Still but the two of you up there, 
                         is it?

                                     RUBY
                         You know it.

                                     TEAGUE
                         When we get a cold night, camped 
                         out, trying to keep the rule of law, 
                         protecting girls like you from 
                         Federals and deserters, that's a 
                         thought warms us
                              (to his men)
                         ain't it? -- the two of you up there 
                         on my Grand-daddy's farm, dressed in 
                         men's clothes. Warms us right up. 
                         What you got in the sacks?
                              (to the men)
                         Looks like human heads! Eh? Looks 
                         like a bunch of heads. We got 
                         competition!

               Ruby rides on. She rides around the bend -- she's not far 
               from the Swanger farm.

               EXT. RAILROAD TRACK. DAY

               Goats, their bells tinkling, munch around the tracks. One of 
               them turns at a noise -- a GROTESQUE VISION -- A MOVING, 
               SEETHING MOUND OF DIRT. It's Inman, inching along the 
               embankment, the chain of dead bodies in tow, a macabre tug 
               of war. He considers the goats, they consider him. He rears 
               up and finds himself STARING DOWN THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Sally is pinning out white sheets, they're filling out like 
               sails in the afternoon wind. Ruby rides up. Sally seems a 
               little vexed to see her. She walks down to the gate.

                                     SALLY
                         Ruby...

                                     RUBY
                         I'm not stopping, Sally. I'm not 
                         snooping neither. Just you should 
                         know Teague and his boys are lurking 
                         down by Pigeon River, the old mill.

                                     SALLY
                              (after a beat)
                         You tell Ada that was a good pie.

               Ruby rides off. Sally watches, then goes inside the house, 
               her energy changing immediately, as if she might faint.

               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. AFTERNOON

               HARSH WHISTLES. A secret place, in the heart of a forest. 
               There's the answering sound of SMALL BELLS, a chorus of them. 
               Inman is dragged into view on a makeshift litter. Goats 
               appear, they herd around the figure dragging the litter. 
               IT'S AN OLD WOMAN, silver haired, her face a leather map, 
               her clothes leather, everything about her like old leather. 
               HER NAME IS MADDY.

               She and Inman round a bend and there's Maddy's house -- AN 
               OLD CARAVAN, long grown into the ground and plaited with 
               vines and creepers. Inman tries to sit up. An old whiskered 
               BILLYGOAT butts up against Inman, knocks him down. Maddy 
               pays no attention to the struggle, heads inside her caravan.

                                     MADDY
                         Mind that Billy, he's the jealous 
                         kind.

               She emerges, with a bowl of water, rags, washes his face, 
               pushing back his hair to look at his wound, puts a finger to 
               the gash on his neck professional in her appraisal. Inman is 
               barely conscious, he groans, trying to defend himself.

                                     MADDY
                         Pay no attention to me. What happened 
                         to your head?

                                     INMAN
                         Fighting.

                                     MADDY
                         And your neck?

                                     INMAN
                         Different fighting.

                                     MADDY
                         You're the color of a cadaver. I'll 
                         fix you. I can fix you up.

                                     INMAN
                              (speaking of his spirit)
                         Mister -- you could fix me I'd be in 
                         your everlasting debt.

                                     MADDY
                         Debts, fighting -- them words don't 
                         mean much round here. For the record, 
                         I'm a female of the species.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby rides up to the farm. She rides past the winter garden, 
               admires THE SCARECROW -- WHICH NOW PARODIES ADA, the same 
               outfit she once wore to visit Inman, the same dress, same 
               hat. Ruby grins as Ada comes over from the field.

                                     RUBY
                         The hat's a nice touch.

               Ruby gets off the horse, and they start unloading sacks.

                                     RUBY
                         You're quiet.

                                     ADA
                         I cried for my Daddy. I dressed up 
                         the scarecrow in his suit and he 
                         came back, his arms out, said you 
                         never cried enough, you never cried 
                         enough.

                                     RUBY
                         Well now you did.

                                     ADA
                         Then I thought, it's not my Daddy, 
                         it's my sweetheart. I saw him once 
                         that way, when I looked down Sally's 
                         well. So I dressed the scarecrow in 
                         the dress I wore the day he left. In 
                         case his spirit flies over looking 
                         out for me.
                              (of the vicious looking 
                              trap)
                         That looks terrible.

               Ruby opens the sacks.

                                     ADA
                         Cabbages.

                                     RUBY
                         I bargained like Lucifer. We can 
                         make all kinds of good eating.

                                     ADA
                         Such as?

                                     RUBY
                         Cabbage. Slaw, sauerkraut, cabbage 
                         soup, fried cabbage, stuffed 
                         cabbage...

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               TEAGUE'S MEN RIDE UP TO THE FARM. Esco's out in the field, 
               labouring away, but with his shotgun by him. Teague stops 
               alongside the field, the rail between him and Esco. Esco 
               stops working, picks up his shotgun and goes over. Teague 
               has four men with him. MO and JO, the twins, huge, and with 
               the appearance of having less than one brain between the two 
               of them, GRAYLING, a reluctant-looking man, funereal in his 
               bearing, and BOSIE.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Afternoon.

               The riders slowly fan out, almost as if choreographed.

                                     ESCO
                         Don't spread out. Why they spreading 
                         out?

                                     TEAGUE
                         I'm not spreading out. I'm sitting 
                         here.

               Esco comes over the rail fence, his gun loose in his hands.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Never knew a man worked in his field 
                         with a shotgun.

                                     ESCO
                         There's a war on.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Got to watch out for the Bogey Man.

               He starts to fish out a tobacco pouch. Esco's gun swings up.

               Teague shows him the leather pouch, shrugs, starts to make a 
               cigarette.

               INT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               From inside the house, Sally watches everything. Her view 
               impaired by the sheets.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Mo dismounts. Ambles past Esco, looks behind the sheets. 
               ESCO KICKS OUT AT HIM, the shotgun rigid and pointing.

                                     ESCO
                         Get off my land.

               Mo examines his breeches for a dust mark, wipes it off, 
               retreating in a turkey walk of examining and dusting.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Your boys come back.

                                     ESCO
                         Ain't seen my boys in four years. 
                         They're fighting other boys, not old 
                         men and women.

                                     TEAGUE
                              (to his men)
                         He means us. He's referring there to 
                         us.
                              (to Esco)
                         So you won't care if we take a look 
                         around?

                                     ESCO
                         What I gotta give you? A chicken? A 
                         lamb?

                              (shrugs)
                         Sure.

                                     ESCO
                         Right then.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Thing is -- you got one barrel and 
                         there's five of us. Not a fair fight.

               BOSIE SUDDENLY DROPS OFF HIS HORSE, ROLLS ON THE GROUND.

                                     BOSIE
                         Bogey Man! Bogey Man!

               Esco is momentarily distracted and, in that instant, Mo kicks 
               out at him, knocking the gun from his hands, which fires 
               into the air, a shocking sound.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby and Ada digging a trench by the smokehouse, laying in 
               the pale heads of cabbage. They hear the distant shot.

                                     RUBY
                         What's that?

               They stop. Listen. Look at each other, start running.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               Jo sets on Esco, knocking him-backwards into a sheet, where 
               it gets twisted, while Jo kicks and punches, little spots of 
               blood staining the sheet with each blow. MO PULLS OUT HIS 
               SABRE AND RUNS ESCO THROUGH, LEAVES THE SABRE IN DEEP, PINNING 
               ESCO TO THE SHEET, THEN SPINNING HIM ROUND IN THE SHEET SO 
               THAT IT TIGHTENS. A stain grows out from the blade, huge and 
               spreading. Teague walks to Esco.

                                     TEAGUE
                         You're harbouring deserters. I can 
                         confiscate every animal on this farm, 
                         every plate, every sheet, every little 
                         pellet of chicken shit -- I can 
                         confiscate your old lady's asshole, 
                         so don't offer me a bird.

               Sally runs out, screaming. She tries to pull out the sabre.

               MO REVERSES HIS RIFLE AND CLUBS HER TO THE GROUND.

                                     TEAGUE
                              (sharply)
                         Hey!

               Mo backs away. Sally is screaming. She watches, helpless, as 
               Esco dies in front of her, the sheet growing a darker red.

                                     TEAGUE
                         You got your bait. Set it on the 
                         hook.

               BOSIE, SMILING, FETCHES A ROPE FROM HIS HORSE, ALREADY NOOSED 
               AT ONE END. HE FLIPS THE LOOP OVER SALLY'S HEAD.

               INT. BARN, SWANGER FARM. DAY

               ELLIS AND ACTON SWANGER emerge from their hiding places, 
               unable to bear the sound of their mother's screams. They're 
               carrying an axe, a pitchfork, mad for revenge.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DAY

               BOSIE IS DOING SOME SORT OF DANCE ALONG THE FENCE RAIL. He's 
               very graceful, his hair flying, his hands out, one finger 
               nail extremely long, his boots stamping down on the fence.

               UNDER HIS STOMPING FEET, THE RAIL POST IS PRESSED ON SALLY 
               SWANGER'S THUMBS. She can't scream any longer, because the 
               noose has practically strangled her. The rope's tied off to 
               Bosie's horse, which yanks on the noose with every slight 
               movement. Sally is prostrate in the dirt.

               Her two boys come running from the barn. TEAGUE CASUALLY, 
               SHOOTS ELLIS WITH HIS RIFLE. BOSIE LETS ACTON GET ALL THE 
               WAY TOWARDS HIM AND THEN SHOOTS HIM FROM A YARD AWAY, THE 
               GUN SUDDENLY SPRINGING INTO HIS HAND. AS ACTON FALLS, BOSIE 
               DOES A FLIP TO DIVE OFF THE POST AND LAND ON HIS FEET NEXT 
               TO ACTON'S BODY.

               EXT. SWANGER FARM. DUSK

               Ada and Ruby, riding together on the horse, arrive at the 
               Swangers.

               SALLY IS STILL PINNED UNDER THE FENCE POST. The noose around 
               her neck has been tied off to the post so that she can't 
               move. There's a bloody sheet draped over the edge of the 
               well. Blood on the ground. Ruby heaves at the fence.

                                     RUBY
                         I can't get this damn thing off her.

                                     ADA
                              (at the well, looking 
                              down)
                         Dear Lord in heaven.

                                     RUBY
                         Ada, I can't get this off her!

               Ada runs over. They struggle, can't lift it. Sally's lips 
               are moving.

                                     RUBY
                         What darling? What?

               She bends down, listens to her. Looks up at Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         She's saying don't bother.

                                     ADA
                         Wait!

               She grabs a thick log off the stack, staggers back and in a 
               second they've inserted it into the fence and levered it up 
               and away from Sally's hands. They fall back onto the dirt.

               Ruby cradles Sally. Ada nods towards the well.

                                     ADA
                         There's someone down there. I think 
                         it's Esco.

               Ruby looks over at the well, then at Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         This world won't stand long. God 
                         won't let it stand this way long.

               INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY

               An exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs, 
               wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary 
               store. Inman wakes up. He finds himself in a small cot, 
               wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck. He doesn't know 
               where he is or how long he's been there.

               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DAY

               Maddy's sitting on a stool. There's a circle of stones where 
               her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it. Inman emerges 
               from the caravan. He's pale and unsteady.

                                     INMAN
                         How long have I been sleeping?

                                     MADDY
                         Not long enough.

                                     INMAN
                         I can't stop here. I'm a deserter. 
                         They find me here things could be 
                         bad for you.

                                     MADDY
                         What they going to do? Cut short my 
                         young life? Sit down before you fall 
                         down.

               She calls over a little goat. It ambles over affectionately 
               and nuzzles into her hand. She strokes it and scratches under 
               the chin. The creature gets increasingly tranquil.

                                     INMAN
                         How long you been up here?

                                     MADDY
                         What year are we? '63?

                                     INMAN
                         Last time I checked it was '64.

                                     MADDY
                         I'd say twenty six years.

                                     INMAN
                         Twenty six years!

                                     MADDY
                         I could move on anytime. I've seen 
                         most of the world anyway, Richmond 
                         in the North, south almost to 
                         Charleston. You're going somewhere 
                         or you are somewhere, what's the 
                         difference?

               She's still stroking the goat. It looks as if it's asleep.

                                     MADDY
                         I've learned a person can survive 
                         off pretty much of a goat. I can't 
                         abide a chicken, but a goat gives 
                         you company and milk and cheese and 
                         then, when you need it, good meat.

               In a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has SLIT 
               THE THROAT OF THE GOAT, putting the bowl underneath its neck 
               to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as 
               if it were only surprised and not dying.

                                     MADDY
                         So you've been fighting?

                                     INMAN
                              (as if he might break)
                         I could be at killing for days 
                         sometimes, in the hand to hand, my 
                         feet against the feet of my enemy 
                         and I always killed him and he never 
                         killed me.

                                     MADDY
                         He gave it a try, to look at you.

                                     INMAN
                         I guess he did.

                                     MADDY
                         See I think there's a plan. There's 
                         a design. For each and every one of 
                         us.

               During this she's shucked the skin off the goat with the 
               authority of someone who's done this a thousand times.

                                     MADDY
                         You look at nature, a bird flies 
                         somewhere, picks up a seed, shits 
                         the seed out, a plant grows. Bird's 
                         got a job, seed's got a job.

               And the goat is now thin and pink, eyes bulging, a piece of 
               meat.

               INT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. EVENING

               A woodburning stove with a single cooking plate -- on which 
               pieces of the goat meat, sprinkled with herbs, are sizzling 
               in a pan.

               INMAN IS EATING LIKE A MAN POSSESSED, WRAPPING THE MEAT IN 
               CORN FRITTERS AND PUSHING THEM INTO HIS MOUTH. Maddy watches 
               him, adds another mound of meat to his plate. Inman nods in 
               thanks, but -- doesn't look up.

               She opens a jar and takes out a handful of dried poppy heads, 
               puts them near the stove, then dips into another jar and 
               pulls out what look like old cheroot stubs.

                                     MADDY
                         Take one of these now with your food.

               Inman is circumspect, views the stub lozenge with suspicion.

                                     MADDY
                         Swallow it. If you die I'll give you 
                         your money back.

               Inman puts it in his mouth, gags at the taste of it. She 
               hands him a beaker with milk to wash it down.

                                     MADDY
                         Our minds aren't made to hold on to 
                         the particulars of pain, the way we 
                         do bliss.

               She starts steaming the poppies.

                                     INMAN
                         It's true...

                                     MADDY
                         What is?

                                     INMAN
                         What you remember.

                                     MADDY
                         What's her name?

                                     INMAN
                         Ada.
                              (At the food)
                         -- Sometimes I think I'm crazy when 
                         I'm just hungry --
                              (another mouthful)
                         Ada Monroe.

                                     MADDY
                         And is she waiting for you?

                                     INMAN
                         She was. I don't know. Or if she'd 
                         know me. I'm like the boy who goes 
                         out in winter for firewood comes 
                         back in the spring with a whistle.

               Maddy pricks open the poppies and collects their opium, then 
               hands Inman the liquid.

                                     MADDY
                         Now drink this. It visits the pain. 
                         And you'll sleep.

               He drinks the laudanum she's made.

                                     INMAN
                         I've had to put myself in the way of 
                         people's kindness.

                                     MADDY
                         I hope you found it.

               She dips a cloth in the steaming water, unbuttons his shirt. 
               She has a crock of what looks like treacle and vaseline. She 
               smears this salve over the neck wound and into his scalp. 
               Inman surrenders to the drug.

                                     INMAN
                         The passenger pigeons fly south, the 
                         berries ripen. Whether I see them or 
                         not, whether a man dies, or a war is 
                         won.

                                     MADDY
                         That's the laudanum getting to you. 
                         That's good. Say something more.
                              (she kneels to his 
                              leg)
                         Raise that up for me.

               He obliges. She grimaces at the state of it, where the chain 
               has chewed into the flesh. Gets to work.

                                     INMAN
                         She gave me a book. Ada Monroe. Man 
                         by the name of Bartram. Wrote about 
                         his travels. I carried that book 
                         through every battle. I left it 
                         someplace, got to get it back. 
                         Sometimes just reading the name of a 
                         place near home -- Sorell Cove, Fire 
                         Scale Ridge -- was enough to bring 
                         me to tears. Thing is I've been 
                         thinking -- those places belonged to 
                         people before us, to the Indian -- 
                         and he had a different name. What 
                         did he call Sorell Cove? How can a 
                         name not even the real name break 
                         your heart? It's her, she's the place 
                         I'm heading. And I hardly know her. 
                         So how can a person who's maybe not 
                         even a real person -- I don't know 
                         what I'm talking about -- I have to 
                         close my eyes...

               He slides off the stool and lays on the floor. Maddy goes 
               over to her cot and pulls off a blanket which she drapes 
               over him.

               EXT. YARD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ada in the henhouse, collecting eggs, is confident now among 
               the birds. She emerges to find Ruby walking out of the 
               backdoor with the shotgun and a determined look.

                                     RUBY
                         It's a man.

                                     ADA
                         What is?

                                     RUBY
                         Raiding our corn. Got him in the 
                         trap. That's him yelping.

                                     ADA
                         You're not going to shoot him!

                                     RUBY
                         I don't want him to shoot me.
                              (of the gun)
                         Can you fire this thing?

                                     ADA
                              (making it clear she 
                              can't)
                         Yes.

               They head towards the corn crib, bundled up against the cold.

               A MAN IS KNEELING AT THE CORN CRIB, perfectly caught in the 
               art of stealing, his head forced away from view. Ruby hands 
               Ada the gun and approaches, warily.

                                     RUBY
                         Listen up -- you got a barrel trained 
                         on your rear-end.

                                     STOBROD
                         Get me out of this dang thing. My 
                         fist's about to drop off.

                                     RUBY
                         You got a weapon?

                                     STOBROD
                         No ma'am. I'm begging you. I'm already 
                         on my knees, otherwise I'd get down 
                         on them.

                                     RUBY
                              (suddenly recognises 
                              the voice)
                         Unbelievable! Stobrod Thewes.

                                     STOBROD
                         Ruby? God damn!

                                     ADA
                         What?

                                     RUBY
                              (to Ada, disgusted)
                         That's my daddy...

               She walks up to him and KICKS HIM HARD AS SHE CAN ON HIS 
               BACKSIDE.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               A strip of fabric, homemade bandage, being wrapped around 
               Stobrod's badly gashed hand. Ada is tending to him. Ruby is 
               cooking at the range, not remotely warm towards her prodigal 
               father, who looks rather comfortable. Stobrod looks at her.

                                     STOBROD
                         Just so's you know -- I can eat while 
                         she's doing this -- in case you're 
                         holding off.

                                     RUBY
                         Just so's you know -- you're not 
                         eating inside. Number One -- they 
                         hang people round here for taking in 
                         deserters. Number two -- even if 
                         they gave out prizes -- you'd still 
                         eat outside.

                                     STOBROD
                         You're scarred.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm what?

                                     STOBROD
                         Your heart. Scarred. I did wrong to 
                         you.

                                     RUBY
                         You'd be scarred. You'd be really 
                         scarred if I hadn't wrapped them 
                         trap teeth in sacking. Which was her 
                         idea.

                                     STOBROD
                         I hurt you.

                                     RUBY
                         Good God!

                                     STOBROD
                         I wrote fifty tunes with you in mind. 
                         Ruby this, Ruby that, Ruby with the 
                         eyes that sparkle.

                                     RUBY
                         Hey! Let's agree: you beat me, you 
                         abandoned me, you ignored me, you 
                         beat me some more -- all of that is 
                         better than Ruby with the eyes that 
                         sparkle!

                                     STOBROD
                         I'm changed. People change. War 
                         changes people something terrible.
                              (to Ada)
                         Ruby's told you -- I've no doubt -- 
                         I wasn't always the best...

                                     RUBY
                         You were an asshole.

                                     STOBROD
                         I can't disagree with that. I was.

                                     RUBY
                         Get him out of here!

                                     STOBROD
                         Music's changed me. I'm full of music, 
                         darling. I wish I'd brung my fiddle 
                         Hey Ruby! Got a new fiddle -- it's 
                         got a little snake's rattle in the 
                         body -- took it off a dead federal 
                         in Virginia. That's a beautiful 
                         fiddle. It's full of tunes, Ruby. 
                         Don't know if it's from that little 
                         rattle locked up in it, or from 
                         something untied my heart.

               Ruby walks over with a crock, wrapped in a cloth.

                                     RUBY
                         You're all set.

                                     STOBROD
                              (sincerely)
                         Bless you both.

               He goes to the door.

                                     RUBY
                         Ain't you got a proper coat?

                                     STOBROD
                         Darling, I'm fine. And you just say 
                         the word, I won't come back neither. 
                         I don't want to put either you or 
                         your mistress here in any bother.

                                     ADA
                         I'm not Ruby's employer.

                                     STOBROD
                         Oh, okay, who is?

                                     RUBY
                         Nobody.
                              (Stobrod digests this)
                         I'll make up food for you, you come 
                         Sundays before it's light, I'll leave 
                         it behind the Old Frazier Mill.

                                     STOBROD
                         Do you know who really needs a coat, 
                         darling, is my partner, fat boy name 
                         of Pangle. We're hiding up in the 
                         caves and he feels the cold like a 
                         thin man, but ain't no coat'll fit 
                         him.
                              (leaving)
                         I love you, Ruby. In case the sky 
                         falls on our head. You're a good 
                         girl.

               And he's gone. Ruby scowls. FIDDLE MUSIC BEGINS.

                                     RUBY
                         He is so full of manure, that man, 
                         we could lay him on the dirt and 
                         grow another one just like him.

                                     ADA
                         So that's Stobrod Thewes.

                                     RUBY
                         It is and that's the last you'll see 
                         of him.

               EXT. MADDY'S CARAVAN. DUSK

               THE FIDDLE CONTINUES, A BANJO JOINS IN.

               Maddy is loading up Inman for his journey. She hands him a 
               bulging goatskin satchel.

                                     MADDY
                         That's medicine and goatmeat. You're 
                         sick of both.

                                     INMAN
                         I have a deal to thank you for.

               She hands him an ancient flintlock pistol.

                                     MADDY
                         And that's just for show, or -- if 
                         you can get close enough -- a wild 
                         turkey.

               She turns, abruptly, mingles in with her goats. Inman nods, 
               knows that she doesn't want a fuss, although he wants to 
               make one, and turns himself, heads away from the caravan.

               EXT. WOODS. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. A TURKEY calls. And again.

               JUNIOR is hunting. He creeps through this clearing, eyes 
               peeled for the turkey, gun at the ready. His dog growls, and 
               he puts a hand over its mouth. He listens. Another call.

               Junior moves, without sound, in its direction, stops for 
               several seconds under a tree, listening. He looks up. INMAN 
               IS PERCHED IN THE TREE. THE PISTOL FLASHES IN HIS HAND.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman drags Junior's corpse in to the 
               yard. The dogs whine and slobber over the body. Inman goes 
               straight into the Smoke House.

               INT. SMOKE HOUSE AT JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman reaches behind the stove and 
               retrieves his bag. He checks for the LeMats, for the Bartram, 
               opens it, locating the tintype of Ada, which he considers, 
               as the dogs howl outside, joined with another wailing.

               EXT. JUNIOR'S CABIN. DAY

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Inman emerges with his bag, LeMats at 
               the ready. The women are all keening over the corpse, as it 
               a saint had passed away. Dogs, women all howling. A chicken 
               bobs in, investigates the glob of blood on Junior's skull.

               Inman walks away, doesn't look at the women, who don't look 
               at him.

               INT. RUBY'S ROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAWN

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Ruby wakes up. Looks out of the window.

               Ada, also woken, comes into Ruby's room. STOBROD IS OUTSIDE 
               WITH PANGLE, VIOLIN AND BANJO. Ruby opens the window, 
               scowling. Stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food, 
               points at Pangle in his new coat. Pangle waves.

                                     RUBY
                         Get on back where you came from!

               Stobrod and Pangle smile and hurry away.

               EXT. PATH IN HILL COUNTRY. DAY

               WINTER SETTING IN. Inman, increasingly a stick figure in the 
               landscape, wasted and fragile, trudges along through fallen 
               leaves. He still limps from the leg irons. No shelter 
               anywhere. He unwraps a paper containing some scraps of goat 
               meat and corn bread. He walks and eats, fishes out a lozenge, 
               tries to swallow it, washes it down with a drink from his 
               flask. Opens the crock of salve and rubs the treacly grease 
               into his neck and ankle. The path splits. He doesn't know 
               which way to go, A CROW repeatedly caws off to the left and, 
               taking it as a sign, Inman goes in that direction.

                         My love for Heathcliff resembles the 
                         eternal rocks beneath

               INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. NIGHT

               Ada in the bed, reading to Ruby from Wuthering Heights.

                                     ADA
                         -- a source of little visible delight, 
                         But necessary.

                                     RUBY
                         She ain't gonna marry Linton, is 
                         she? She said -- whatever our souls 
                         are made of his and mine are the 
                         same. You can't say that and then 
                         marry Linton.

                                     ADA
                         We'll find out.

                                     RUBY
                         Okay.

                                     ADA
                         Tomorrow.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm not waiting until tomorrow.

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, I'm falling asleep.

               She lies back in her bed. Ruby takes the book, lies across 
               the bottom of the bed, as Ada goes to sleep.

                                     RUBY
                         Little visible delight, but necessary. 
                         I like that...

               EXT. SMALL WOOD. NIGHT

               DRIVING RAIN. Inman shelters under a huge tree, whose split 
               trunk provides a mean shelter. He inserts himself into the 
               cleft of it, a black thing in a black tree, like a troll. He 
               stands, shivers, sodden, desolate.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               A LITTLE CABIN. Its lights coming through square windows 
               like a chinese lantern. Inman considers it, the risk versus 
               the shelter.

               The sleet still pelts down on him and he decides to approach.

               Closer he can hear a sound coming from the house. IT'S A 
               BABY'S INCESSANT CRY. HE SEES A YOUNG WOMAN WALKING ROUND 
               AND ROUND IN THE ROOM, CLUTCHING THE BABY WRAPPED UP IN A 
               QUILT.

               Inman knocks hard on the door. The light from the lamp goes 
               out, although the fire still gives the room a clear glow.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm one man alone. I'm a Confederate 
                         soldier on furlough. I have no bad 
                         intention. I need shelter and food.

               THE TINY SOUND OF THE DOOR BEING BOLTED.

                                     INMAN
                         Can I at least sleep in the corn 
                         crib -- just for some shelter? I'll 
                         be on my way come morning.

               No answer. Inman accepts this as a rebuttal, and trudges 
               back towards the road.

                                     SARA (V.O.)
                         I've got a rifle.

               Inman turns. A gap in the door appears, the figure barely 
               seen.

                                     INMAN
                         Fair enough.

               The baby's crying behind her.

                                     SARA
                         There's some beans and corn pone, 
                         all I got. You better come in.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Inman enters the cabin. It's a single room. A big fire. The 
               baby on the bed, a rudimentary crib unoccupied next to it. 
               The woman is already at the little stove. She turns to him. 
               She's painfully beautiful. But sad and fragile. Inman, despite 
               himself, is mesmerized.

                                     INMAN
                         Thank you.

                                     SARA
                         I'm alone here, as you can see, with 
                         my baby. I need to believe you mean 
                         no harm.

               Inman takes out his gun. She starts, terrified.

                                     INMAN
                         No, I mean to give it to you.

               He turns it handle forwards and offers it to her.

                                     SARA
                         I don't want it. I had my way they'd 
                         take metal altogether out of this 
                         world. Every blade, every gun.

                                     INMAN
                         Is your baby sick?

                                     SARA
                         He cries. I don't know. He cries a 
                         lot. My man is dead. He took his 
                         wound at Fredericksburg. Never saw 
                         his boy.

               She never once looks at him. Her eyes on the floor or the 
               food or the baby.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     SARA
                         It's pretty much what you'll get if 
                         you knock on any door of this war. 
                         Man dead, woman left.

               She hands him a plate of steaming beans. An onion perched on 
               top.

                                     SARA
                         It's mean food but it's hot.

               She goes over to the bed and picks up her baby and starts 
               the same business of walking him, singing the while, an odd 
               lament. Inman eats, looks at her, at the child and the fire.

               He picks up the onion, bites into it. Sara looks across.

                                     INMAN
                              (ashamed of his hunger)
                         There's no hunting on the road, just 
                         cress and --

               He takes another bite. Sara picks up the baby.

                                     SARA
                         I need to feed this man, if you could 
                         look away.

               Inman, embarrassed, turns his back to her. He sits finishing 
               the food while she puts the baby to her breast, slipping the 
               shoulder from her dress. While the baby feeds.

                                     SARA
                         Used to have a cow, few goats. Raiders 
                         took them. Made me kill our own dog 
                         on the porch. That poor creature 
                         watched over me. Nothing left now 
                         save a hog and couple of chickens to 
                         live off till spring. I'll have to 
                         kill that hog and make sense of the 
                         flesh and divisions which is something 
                         I never did.

                                     INMAN
                         I could do that for you in the 
                         morning.

                                     SARA
                         I'm not asking.

                                     INMAN
                         It's what I'd gladly do for you for 
                         what you're gladly doing for me. I'm 
                         Inman by the way. That's my name.

                                     SARA
                         I'm Sara. My baby's Ethan.

                                     INMAN
                         Glad to know you both.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Sara walks ahead of Inman. She carries a pile of clothing, a 
               pair of boots. It's still wretched outside, she hugs the 
               house, the porch barely offering shelter. INMAN FOLLOWS, 
               with a bowl of steaming water and a small towel over his 
               arm. She hands him the clothes.

                                     SARA
                         You look about his size. He was 
                         another man straight up and down.

               There's a palpable attraction between them, so that every 
               exchange seems to contain a promise, a sexual charge.

                                     SARA
                         I don't even have a blanket.

                                     INMAN
                         I got a blanket.

                                     SARA
                         I'll leave you the lamp.

               By the dim light, Inman peels off his clothes, sets to work 
               with the bar of soap and the cloth to scrub himself clean. 
               He can be seen from the window and finds himself turning 
               away to pull off his pants.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Sara sits at the cot, still singing to the baby, then gets 
               up, goes to the window, sees Inman dressing, walks to the 
               door, lets it open a little, but not so as she can be seen.

                                     SARA
                         They fit?

                                     INMAN (O.S.)
                         Pretty much. These boots are good 
                         boots.

                                     SARA
                         I'll say good night.

                                     INMAN (O.S.)
                         Good night.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Inman settles down into the corncrib. He's cold and everything 
               is damp and lumpy and uncomfortable. He pulls his thin blanket 
               around him. The wind is howling. He levers himself up, looks 
               at the house with its warm invitation, can almost feel Sara 
               in there. He reluctantly settles down again.

               HE HEARS A NOISE, STEPS APPROACHING. HE REACHES FOR THE LEMATS 
               UNDER THE BLANKETS.

                                     SARA
                         Will you come inside?

               She stands in a shift, a blanket over her shoulders. Her 
               body under the cotton very clear to him. She turns and goes 
               back inside.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. NIGHT

               Inman comes in. Sara is sitting on her bed. Long silence.

                                     SARA
                         Could you do something for me? Do 
                         you think you could lie here, next 
                         to me, and not need to go further?

                                     INMAN
                         I don't know. I'll try.

               He sits on the bed as she slips under the covers, and then 
               removes the boots, his shirt, gets under the covers. There's 
               an electric space between them. Then Sara begins to cry, 
               pulls his arm to open up so that she can be folded into him.

               SHE SOBS, SHUDDERING IN THE BED.

                                     INMAN
                         I'll go. I'll go, shall I?

                                     SARA
                         I don't want you to.

               They lie, staring up at the ceiling, her tears falling. A 
               FIDDLE PLAYS HEAVY WITH YEARNING...

               INT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. CHRISTMAS DAY. NIGHT

               THE MUSIC CONTINUES. Stobrod is playing the fiddle, his bowing 
               hand still lightly taped and a fingerless mitten covering 
               it. They're in the abandoned Mill, a derelict space, which 
               has been cheered up with some rudimentary Christmas 
               decorations. Ada, Ruby and Sally Swanger, her hair now almost 
               completely white. Some token presents. Pangle is picking at 
               a banjo, his grin infectious, and a third player, GEORGIA, 
               with a harmonica. As they play:

                                     PANGLE
                              (of Sally)
                         She don't speak.

                                     STOBROD
                         She can't speak. I told you.

                                     PANGLE
                              (smiles at Sally)
                         Is she feeble then?

                                     STOBROD
                         No.
                              (to Sally)
                         Don't mind him.
                              (to Ruby)
                         Hey Ruby: what about this?

               He starts the tune of Wayfaring Stranger. Ruby groans.

                                     STOBROD
                         Don't make that face -- you listen: 
                         c'mon Georgia...

               And he starts up again, but this time GEORGIA BEGINS TO SING.

               He's like a pale angel and sings with a soft, true voice.

               Ruby finds herself taken by this boy's voice and by Stobrod's 
               extraordinary invention as he takes the tune off on a wild 
               journey. Ruby sits next to Ada, fiddles with her bracelets, 
               slips one from Ada's wrist and slides it over her own.

               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

               They're all outside now, shaking hands.

                         stop two.

                         the New Year. It's gonna be a better

               Ada at the window as, outside, SNOW FLAKES BEGIN TO FALL.

               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

               Stobrod opens the door of the Mill. The SNOW FLAKES dissuade 
               him from venturing further. He goes back inside.

                                     STOBROD (O.S.)
                         No sense setting off in snow.

               THE DOOR SHUTS, FIDDLE MUSIC LEAKS THROUGH THE DOOR, FOLLOWED 
               BY BANJO AND HARMONICA.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY

               Sara, dressed, agitated -- the baby already complaining -- 
               is urgently shaking Inman. Hissing at him:

                                     SARA
                         Get out of here, quick!

               Inman surfaces from deep sleep.

                                     SARA
                         Federals are coming. They find you 
                         here it'll go bad on all of us.

               Inman is up, grabbing clothes, boots, his gun.

                                     INMAN
                         I can try and fight them.

                                     SARA
                         No, my baby. Please no! Just get.

               She pulls up the window in back of the cabin. Inman throws 
               things out into the freezing morning. He has his pants on, 
               but is otherwise naked. He swings over the window and down 
               onto the frosty ground.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. EARLY

               Inman picks up his stuff and, at a crouch, runs for cover to 
               the wood which borders the property. He can hear horses and 
               a commotion at the front of Sara's cabin, but doesn't look 
               round until he's sheltered by the trees.

               FEDERAL SOLDIERS, a raiding party, have dismounted and are 
               already wrangling with Sara. Inman watches, pulling on his 
               shirt, shivering, then his boots.

               Sara is standing in front of the hogpen, as if to protect 
               the animal, but one of the soldiers, PISTOL, barges her to 
               one side, toppling her, and opens the gate, starts herding 
               the hog out into the yard. A second soldier, NYM, emerges 
               from the cabin, carrying Ethan. Sara starts up, struggles 
               with him, is again knocked down.

               INMAN HAS TO WATCH AS THEY DRAG HER OVER TO A FENCE POST AND 
               ROPE HER TO IT THEN SLIP THE BLANKET OFF THE BABY AND LAY IT 
               ON THE GROUND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE YARD.

               Then Sara starts to scream.

               Inman is dressed. Boots on. He looks back at the yard. The 
               men sitting, smoking, prepared to wait, their breath coming 
               out in gusts in the freezing air. Flakes of snow fall.

                                     PISTOL
                         We got all day.

                                     SARA
                         My baby's sick! Cover him up! He's 
                         shaking! Have some pity.

               A third Federal, BARDOLPH, chases after the chickens, gathers 
               them up.

                                     SARA
                         I got nothing. I swear.

               Nym gets close to her, putting his rifle to her chest.

                                     NYM
                         That ain't necessarily so.

                                     SARA
                         Yes! Take me inside! Let's all go 
                         inside! Take my baby inside and then 
                         we'll do whatever you want.

               Nym unties her. Pistol has a rope around the hog and now 
               leads it towards the horses.

                                     SARA
                              (screaming)
                         There's nothing! You take that hog 
                         I'm as good as dead. Cover up my 
                         boy!

               She's wailing, an unbearable ululation. NYM SLAPS HER, TWICE, 
               HARD.

               INT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY

               The door is kicked open. Nym pushes Sara inside, kicks the 
               door shut, REVEALING INMAN STANDING BEHIND IT.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. DAY

               Bardolph, a chicken in his arms, goes over to the baby.

                                     BARDOLPH
                         This is ready to get a fit going. 
                         It's shuddering. It's gone blue.

                                     PISTOL
                              (to Nym)
                         How long does he want? Hey! Leave 
                         some for the rest of us.

               Pistol heads towards the cabin. As he approaches the door, 
               Bardolph rearranges the blankets to, cover the baby. Pistol 
               opens the door. Nym is on top of Sara. Pistol laughs, enters, 
               and is clubbed down by Inman, who steps out onto the porch, 
               while SARA SHRUGS OFF THE BODY OF NYM, HIS THROAT CUT.

               Bardolph looks up to see Inman walking towards him. Bardolph 
               has left his weapon by the fence.

                                     INMAN
                         Move away from the baby.

               Bardolph obeys, terrified. Sara runs out, collects Ethan, 
               gives a little moan of anguish, runs back inside the cabin.

                                     BARDOLPH
                         Don't shoot.

                                     INMAN
                         Take off your boots.
                              (Bardolph does so)
                         Take off your pants, and your shirt.

                                     BARDOLPH
                         Don't shoot me, please. We're 
                         starving. We haven't eaten.

                                     INMAN
                         You'd better get running before you 
                         catch your death of cold.

                                     BARDOLPH
                              (nods, terrified)
                         Thanks, thank you. I will.

               AND THEN A SHOT RINGS OUT AND HE CRASHES TO THE GROUND, DEAD.

               Behind Inman, Sara stands with a rifle.

               EXT. SARA'S CABIN. LATE DAY

               THERE'S A HUGE FIRE GOING, WITH A CAULDRON HUNG OVER IT. THE 
               HOG HANGS UPSIDE DOWN FROM A TREE, BLOOD DRIPPING INTO A 
               BOWL.

               There's a sense of ritual and order: the chapters of 
               transforming the hog into food.

               Sara is inside the cabin, the door open onto the yard. She 
               holds the baby by the fireplace, swaddled up tight.

               She tries to put him to her breast, but he won't feed. She 
               puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside.

               Now Inman is butchering the hog, chopping down either side 
               of the spine to make two sides of meat. Now Sara is holding 
               up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. Now she's 
               rendering the fat into lard. Now Inman's salting the two 
               hams. Now Sara's washing the intestine. She sings all the 
               while -- I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and 
               my bride bed full of blood -- they don't really converse. 
               Inman continues to work.

               Sara goes back inside to Ethan's crib. Inman glances back, 
               but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable. THE BABY IS 
               DEAD. She looks at it. She takes it up in her arms. Kisses 
               its forehead.

               Makes a strange stifling noise. Inman doesn't look at her.

               She comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate, 
               serves it up to Inman, gently touching him as she does so. 
               Then serves out food for herself. Inman starts to eat.

                                     SARA
                         Good?

               Inman nods. She collects up the knapsacks, including Inman's, 
               and goes back inside the house with them. Inman squats, 
               eating, glancing back towards the cabin. There's the sudden 
               shocking report of a revolver.

               Inman, knowing what it is, goes slowly towards the house and 
               its two dead bodies. His own face is a rictus, the eyes thin 
               slits. If he gave into his grief it would never cease.

               From the house, the silhouette of Inman working outside in 
               the day's dying light, snow falling around him. He's digging 
               a grave.

               Inside the house, TWO BUNDLES, the small body wrapped in a 
               blanket, the other wrapped in the bed's patchwork quilt.

               EXT. CABBAGE PATCH, BLACK COVE FARM. DUSK

               Still snowing. Ruby trudges past Ada who is digging out a 
               couple of heads of the buried cabbages.

                                     ADA
                         Do you think he's dead?

                                     RUBY
                         Who?

                              (shrugs)
                         This snow. Isn't it supposed to fall 
                         with bad news?

                                     RUBY
                         Bad news is girls get working. I'm 
                         going to round up the animals.

                              snow)
                         This'll settle.

               She walks past. Ada stares into the distance where

               EXT. WILD COUNTRY. LAST LIGHT

               -- the snow falls down on Inman. He's hardly visible in its 
               gusting waves. Just a thin black question mark, hunched over 
               the elements, moving slowly forwards...

               EXT. OLD MILL, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               THE SNOW HAS STOPPED. It's left a carpet on the ground.

               Stobrod, Pangle and Georgia emerge from the Old Mill. THEY 
               MAKE HEAVY FOOTPRINTS as they set off up the hill towards 
               the mountain.

               EXT. PATH IN THE MOUNTAINS. DAY

               Inman comes sliding down a crumbling slate hill and onto the 
               path. He cornea to a place where the path suddenly drops 
               away to reveal a view of the geography. And there, finally, 
               in the distance, Inman can see the blue ridge. Somewhere in 
               there is home, is Ada. He goes on.

               EXT. SLOPES OF COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Pangle walks too close to Stobrod and steps on the back of 
               his boot which promptly detaches itself from Stobrod's foot.

               Stobrod turns -- and with a raised finger -- pushes Pangle.

               PANGLE FALLS IN THE SNOW, ARMS SPREADEAGLED, AND SMILES.

               EXT. PIGEON RIVER BEHIND THE OLD MILL. DAY

               SOME HORSES CLUSTER around the Stobrod party's footprints.

               Bosie swings acrobatically over his horse, to hang over the 
               tracks, then up again into his saddle, looks at Teague. The 
               Home Guard plod slowly forward in the direction of the tracks.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

               A CLEARING, fringed by poplars. Stobrod is making a fire.

               Pangle appears with an armful of firewood, his big grin a 
               fixture. Then Georgia appears. He's carrying A SMALL BUCK, 
               frozen and covered with snow.

                         It's frozen. How long it been there 
                         for?

                                     STOBROD
                         You hungry?

               Teague examines the snow's imprinted silhouette of Pangle.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               STOBROD SINGS AND COOKS. PANGLE ACCOMPANIES HIM ON BANJO, 
               Georgia joins in the chorus. Stobrod pulls one of the hickory 
               stick skewers out of the fire, blows on the, meat, smells, 
               smells again, looks at Georgia, takes a bite. Chews.

                         Edible.

               Pangle takes another stick, burns his fingers.

                                     PANGLE
                         Ow!

                         It's good. I think it's good.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND. COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               The three men are asleep. The fire still burning. They're 
               lying like petals of a flower around it. Suddenly Georgia 
               sits bolt upright, grimaces, gets up stumbles away from the 
               fire, toward a stand of trees, from which come the vivid 
               sounds of violent nausea.

               EXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               GEORGIA IS KNEELING IN THE SNOW, his head in the snow, when

               Teague rides up to the fire, the other riders with him -- 
               Mo, Jo, Bosie, Grayling. Stobrod wakes, sits up, Pangle

                         these parts. Hiding out in a big 
                         cave.

                                     STOBROD
                         Not come to my ears.

                                     TEAGUE
                         You don't know where this cave is?

                                     STOBROD
                         No, sir.

                                     PANGLE
                         You do, Stobes! He means --

                                     STOBROD
                         Right, right! he means, there is a 
                         cave, right, it's up over the other 
                         side, big cave, we played some music 
                         up there, never occurred to me they 
                         were deserters. Near Bearpen Branch.

                                     PANGLE
                         Ain't nowhere near Bearpen Branch! 
                         It's this side! He's always getting 
                         lost. That cave -- we live there! -- 
                         it's over on Big Stomp. Tell you how 
                         I always find it. There's a big old 
                         locust tree fell down across the 
                         path, that points straight at it, 
                         like a finger, always a dozen 
                         squirrels round that tree. You gets 
                         to the tree, sit on it, and there's 
                         your entrance, straight in front of 
                         you, tree points at it. Come right 
                         to your hand, them squirrels --
                              (makes a chirping 
                              sound)
                         -- Chrrrpppp! Chrrrrppp!

                                     TEAGUE
                         Sounds good. Okay, let's eat, let's 
                         hear some music.

               EXT. TREES NEAR KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Georgia watches as the music starts, Stobrod playing and 
               singing, Pangle joining in at the chorus. Their improvising 
               is wild, profound, Stobrod chording the fiddle, Pangle 
               following him, then, finishing with another verse and ending 
               with the title declaimed by Stobrod.

                                     STOBROD
                         I call this tune: Ruby's Lament.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Something like compassion has flickered over Teague's face. 
               Mo and Jo nod to the music's secret rhythms. Only Bosie seems 
               detached, contemplating his long fingernail. The music 
               finishes. The Home Guard applaud.

                                     PANGLE
                         What'd you make of that?

                                     BOSIE
                         Heartbreaking.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Stand over by that tree.

                                     STOBROD
                         Me?

                                     TEAGUE
                         Over by that tree. Over there. Take 
                         your boyfriend.

               Stobrod gets up, carrying his fiddle, heads over to a big 
               old poplar. Nods at Pangle.

                                     STOBROD
                         Come on.

               Pangle gets up, banjo in his hand. Puts his arm around Stobrod 
               as if they were about to be photographed. The Home Guard 
               gather around them. From the trees Georgia watches, helpless. 
               Pangle grins at Teague.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Don't smile.

                                     PANGLE
                         What?

                                     TEAGUE
                         Quit smiling.

                                     STOBROD
                         He always smiles. He don't mean 
                         nothing by it. I told him this world's 
                         got nothing worth a smile.

                                     TEAGUE
                         Put your hat over your face.

                                     PANGLE
                         What do you mean?

                                     TEAGUE
                         Cover your face with your hat.

               PANGLE TALES OFF HIS HAT, HOLDS IT OVER HIS FACE. THE MOMENT 
               HE OBLIGIES, TEAGUE'S CARBINE SPRINGS UP IN HIS HAND AND 
               BLOWS THE HAT AWAY SEVERAL OTHER SHOTS FOLLOW. STOBROD FALLS 
               UNDER PANGLE, THE BULLETS FLYING.

               EXT. TREES NEAR THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Georgia lies prostrate in the snow, shuddering under the 
               report of each bullet.

               EXT. BOTTOM FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby working in the snow, in the field, clipping a sheep's 
               feet, the animal on its back between Ruby's knees. She looks 
               up to see GEORGIA RUNNING ACROSS THE FIELD TOWARDS HER, 
               calling out her name. From the kitchen window, Ada looks on 
               as he reaches Ruby, the story pouring from him. Ada emerges 
               from the house, walks towards the bad news.

               INT. STOREROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               Ruby sorting out a kit of shovels, blankets. Ada comes in 
               doesn't know how to help her friend, who shows no emotion.

                                     ADA
                         I told Georgia he can stop here, 
                         sleep in the barn. He's got nothing 
                         inside him. He'd walk out of here 
                         and die in the snow.

                                     RUBY
                         He can milk the cows. I was worrying 
                         about that. It'll be dark in a couple 
                         of hours. I's ten hours climb from 
                         here. He's drawn a map.

                                     ADA
                         Okay.

                                     RUBY
                              (boiling)
                         You know these fools stayed the night 
                         in the Mill? That's Stobrod -- he 
                         can't do one good thing without adding 
                         the bad. Left tracks in the snow all 
                         the way up for them Home Guards to 
                         follow. That's a sign says shoot me!

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, I'm so sorry.

               Ada moves towards her, puts her arms around her. Ruby is 
               rigid. Ada stops embracing her.

                                     RUBY
                         We should get going.

               She's tying up the kit. She doesn't know how to grieve.

                                     RUBY
                         Every piece of this is a man's 
                         bullshit. They call this a war a 
                         cloud over the land, but they made 
                         the weather. Then they stand in the 
                         rain and say: shit! It's raining!
                              (tears welling)
                         If I cry one tear for my Daddy I 
                         stole it off a crocodile.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. EVENING

               THE SNOW IS FALLING HEAVILY. RUBY AND ADA TRUDGE UP THE

               MOUNTAIN, dressed in Monroe's clothes, hats pulled down, 
               leading the horse, which is loaded up with tools and supplies. 
               A choice of paths. They start up one, then Ruby decides 
               against it, consults the map, and they reverse, pulling the 
               horse back and then yanking it up the other path.

               EXT. PI STRUCTURE, COLD MOUNTAIN. NIGHT

               Ruby and Ada have made a fire. They sleep under a stone 
               structure, which forms a natural pi shape, the fire in the 
               entrance, the snow caught in its light.

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

               Ada and Ruby arrive at the scene of murder.

               Pangle is keeled over at the old Poplar, snow covering him. 
               Only his girth and a glimpse of coat identify him.

               Ada brushes some of the snow from his face, revealing the 
               death wound, then lays a hand in blessing on his head.

                                     ADA
                         I don't understand.

                                     RUBY
                         Maybe Teague's took him. They did 
                         that with the Swanger boys -- didn't, 
                         they? -- dragged them into town, 
                         then strung them up as warning... 
                         it's snowed since, so I can't read 
                         the story on the ground.

               Ada fishes out Pangle's banjo from the snow. It's broken and 
               the strings hang slack.

                                     RUBY
                         Let's dig.

               LATER -- and RUBY FINISHES OFF THE GRAVE, hammering in a 
               stone to mark the place. Ada walks away towards the creek, 
               to wash her hands. She bends and rinses her face.

               As she looks up SHE SEES STOBROD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
               CREEK; half-in, half out of the water, slumped against a 
               tree, blood everywhere, staining the crust of snow which 
               covers him.

                                     ADA
                         Ruby! Ruby!

               Ruby arrives at Ada, looks to where she's looking, walks 
               straight into the creek, all her love contained in the urgency 
               with which she hurtles to her father, oblivious to the 
               freezing water. She puts a head to his chest, seeks out a 
               pulse at his wrist. Calls back to Ada.

                                     RUBY
                         He's still breathing!
                              (to Stobrod)
                         God damn! Daddy; Daddy -- it's Ruby. 
                         Don't you die on me again.
                              (to Ada)
                         He's still breathing!

               EXT. THE KILLING GROUND, COLD MOUNTAIN. AFTERNOON

               A mean fire burns by the creek. RUBY TURNS A KNIFE IN THE 
               FLAMES. Stobrod's back is exposed. Just by the shoulder blade 
               is an ugly grey and purple bulge the size of a crabapple. 
               Ruby turns to Ada, who is helping.

                                     RUBY
                         Pack a pan full of snow. I need good 
                         clean water, boiled up.

               She cuts the skin and prises out a slug which she drops in 
               the snow and rolls around to clean. Stobrod doesn't move. He 
               could be dead. Ada loads the pan with snow.

                                     ADA
                         Let's get him home. We have herbs 
                         there and it's warm.

                                     RUBY
                         He'll die first. He's got hardly no 
                         blood left in him.

                                     ADA
                         He'll die lying here.

                                     RUBY
                         There's a place further on up. Used 
                         to be. Old Cherokee place. There's 
                         good water right by it.

               Ada puts the snow-packed pan on the fire.

               EXT. BY THE OUTLIER'S CAVE, COLD MOUNTAIN. AFTERNOON

               Squirrels frolic. Teague sits on the trunk of a fallen tree.

               He feeds the squirrels, looking straight ahead where the 
               mouth of a cave winks back at him.

               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. AFTERNOON

               THE TWO WOMEN EMERGE FROM A STEEP TUNNEL OF TREES IN A 
               CHESTNUT GROVE. There's a stream and, up on the bank, A 
               CLUSTER OF BLACK CONICAL HUTS, made up of chestnut logs, 
               abandoned and slightly sinister looking. They approach one 
               of the huts, its door long lost. The snow has drifted in. A 
               second hut has a door which they pry open. It's dark and 
               cold, but apparently still weatherproof. They get Stobrod 
               off the horse and carry him inside, then come out again to 
               unload the horse of its remaining load.

                                     ADA
                         This horse is weary. He's ready to 
                         give up the ghost.

               Ruby picks up the blankets and provisions and goes back inside 
               to her father. Ada takes the horse to another hut and, despite 
               his great reluctance, pushes him inside.

                                     ADA
                         Good boy.

                              nostrils, calming 
                              him)
                         That's warmer, isn't it.

               Ada wouldn't even recognize this practical, hardy woman she's 
               become. Stringy and of few words. She sets off towards the 
               tree tunnel, passing Stobrod's hut.

                                     ADA

               Inman approaches the Killing Ground. He studies the ground, 
               finds Pangle's grave. Blood has left its black writing in 
               the snow and he finds first where Stobrod has been, where 
               the bullet had been removed, then the journey away, still 
               tiny, telltale spatters of blood, and the hoof prints and 
               boot prints of two walkers and one loaded horse. He puts his 
               hand into the ashes of Ruby's fire, can't feel any warmth. 
               It's getting dark. He takes a drink from the stream, shudders 
               at the cold.

               INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               The fire burns, a pall of smoke. Stobrod lies on the ground, 
               swathed in blankets. Coughs. Ruby sits next to him, wipes 
               the hair from his forehead. Ada opens her eyes, looks, closes 
               them, listens to the fire, a strange squeaking as it burns.

                                     ADA
                         That wood -- that sound when it burns 
                         that mean more snow?

                                     RUBY
                         Yes, it do, country girl.

               EXT. TRACK, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAWN

               First light. The sun creeps up, a red streak of dawn. Inman 
               walking, his head bent to the tracks. He walks quickly, even 
               as the terrain gets more steep. As he bends to the snow -- 
               where a spot of blood has fallen into a hoof print -- A FLAKE 
               OF SNOW LANDS ON HIS HAND. Then a second. He looks up. The 
               snow falls.

               He starts to move more quickly, racing the snow as it seeks 
               to erase the tracks. The snow thickens.

               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               In the Chestnut Grovel A DOZEN WILD TURKEYS pick their way 
               across the snow. A shotgun lines up its sight at one of them.

               The trigger is squeezed. An explosion of feathers.

               EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. MORNING

               Inman hears the shot. Then a second, the sound ricocheting 
               around him. He can't quite identify its source but he runs 
               again, heading for the Chestnut trees he can see above him.

               EXT. TREE TUNNEL NEAR CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               Ada collects the two turkeys, the first creatures she's ever 
               shot. Doesn't quite know how to hold them. She straightens 
               up and sees, at the other end of the tree tunnel, backlit by 
               the morning sun, THE SILHOUETTE OF A MAN. She drops the 
               turkeys tires to reload the shotgun.

               Inman comes down the tunnel, approaching the hunter he sees 
               through the snow at the other end of it.

                                     ADA
                         Turn round and go back where you 
                         came from.

               Inman is bewildered by this woman's voice in a man's outfit, 
               keeps walking, peering through the snow. Ada fires a warning 
               shot. Inman, still some distance, suddenly understands.

                                     INMAN
                         Ada? Ada Monroe?

                                     ADA
                         I do not know you.

               After all this time, all this way, Inman could give up the 
               ghost.

                                     INMAN
                         Then I believe I made a mistake.

               He turns, walks heavily away from her. Then he turns again, 
               completely lost, without compass.

                                     INMAN
                         If I knew where to go I'd go there.

                                     ADA
                              (finally recognising 
                              him)
                         Inman?

               He nods. They don't know how to speak to each other, just 
               stand awkwardly, some distance apart, the emotion stones in 
               their throats. Eventually --

                                     ADA
                         You'd better come with me.

               And with that, she starts to sob, and sob.

               VERY HIGH ANGLE: Inman walks towards Ada. They embrace.

               INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               Ada enters, Inman behind her. Ruby looks up from Stobrod.

                                     ADA
                         Ruby, this is Inman.

               Ruby digests this. Considers this ghost of a man.

                                     RUBY
                         Congratulations, I should send you 
                         out with a shotgun more often. He 
                         looks as he needs sleep.

                                     INMAN
                         I may need to.

                                     RUBY
                         Be my guest. You shot or something?

                                     INMAN
                         Not lately.

                                     RUBY
                         Hungry?
                              (Inman nods, Ruby to 
                              Ada)
                         He woke up.

                                     ADA
                         Stobrod?

                                     RUBY
                         Said -- your mommy's name was Grace 
                         then closed his eyes again.

               EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY

               Ada comes out of Stobrod's hut, a glimpse of Inman sleeping 
               on the floor, heads for another hut which Ruby is sweeping 
               out. The snow has stopped. Ada stands in the door, watches 
               Ruby. Ruby's resistance to Inman is palpable.

                                     ADA
                         He's asleep. They both are.

                                     RUBY
                         I'm not surprised. Your man looks 
                         played out.

                                     ADA
                         I saw him. I realize now.

                                     RUBY
                         Saw him when?

                                     ADA
                         In Sally Swanger's well. A tunnel of 
                         trees. The man like a black smudge 
                         in the snow, the sun behind him.

                                     RUBY
                         Well there you are.

                                     ADA
                         Funny thing is it wasn't the same. 
                         The image. It wasn't snowing. And in 
                         the well, he was, as if he were 
                         falling.

                                     RUBY
                         You probably don't remember it right.

                                     ADA
                         I remember it exactly. There were 
                         crows, these black crows flying 
                         towards me. I thought I was seeing 
                         him fall. Instead I was seeing him 
                         come back to me. All this while I've 
                         been packing ice around my heart. 
                         How will I make it melt?

                                     RUBY
                         Better get a fire going.
                              (goes to the fireplace)
                         I've got big plans for that farm. 
                         Got a vision in my mind of how that 
                         Cove needs to be.

                                     ADA
                         I know you have.

                         There's not a thing we can't do 
                         ourselves.

               INT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               THE FIRE BURNS. Ada lies awake. Ruby sleeping. Ada gets up, 
               steps out into the snow, her blanket around her.

               EXT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               Inman is outside his cabin. Only the light escaping from the 
               cabin, fire lights them, almost silhouettes.

                                     INMAN
                         I'm sorry. I was trying to be quiet.

                                     ADA
                         I couldn't sleep.

                         -- I got no appetite left to be in a 
                         room with wounded men.

                                     ADA
                         I can't see your face.

                                     INMAN
                         It's not a face you recognised.

                         Did you get my letters?

                         I got three letters. Carried them in 
                         that book you gave me. The Bertram.

                         I must have sent 100. Did you write 
                         to me?

                         Whenever I could. If you never got 
                         them I can summarize.

                         I pray you're well. I pray I'm in 
                         your thoughts. You are all that keeps 
                         me from sliding into some dark place.

                         But how did I keep you? We barely 
                         knew each other. A few moments.

                         A thousand moments. They're like a 
                         bag of tiny diamonds glittering in a 
                         black heart. Don't matter if they're 
                         real or things I made up. The shape 
                         of your neck. The way you felt under 
                         my hands when I pulled you to me.

                         That kiss -- which I've kissed again 
                         every day of my walking.

                         Maybe you can't see my face, but if 
                         you could see my inside, my whatever 
                         you want to name it, my spirit, that's 
                         the fear I have deeper than any gash 
                         on my neck. I think I'm ruined. They 
                         kept trying to put me in the ground, 
                         but I wasn't ready, no ma'am, no 
                         more ready than that scoundrel in 
                         there's not ready to die on us. But 
                         if I had goodness, I lost it. If I 
                         had anything tender in me I shot it 
                         dead.

               Ruby stomps out of the hut.

                                     RUBY
                         Number one -- shut this door, it's 
                         freezing.

                         all night I'm going to sleep in with 
                         him.

               And with that she enters Stobrod's hut, slamming the door.

                         Now I can't see anything.

               A long pause.

                                     INMAN
                         I'll say goodnight.

                                     ADA
                         I don't think Ruby's vacating my hut 
                         so that you can sleep in a different 
                         one.

               INT. ADA AND RUBY HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. NIGHT

               Ada puts logs onto the fire. After a few moments a knock.

                                     ADA
                         Come in.

               Inman enters. They don't know the rules for this.

                                     ADA
                         Whatever comes to pass between you 
                         and me, I want Ruby to stay in Black 
                         Cove.

                                     INMAN
                         Right.

                                     ADA
                         As long as she wants. And if she 
                         never leaves I'll be glad.

                                     INMAN
                         More a question could she put up 
                         with me.

                                     ADA
                         And you understand she's my friend, 
                         she's not a hired hand and she doesn't 
                         empty a night jar unless it's her 
                         own.

                                     INMAN
                         Sure.

                                     ADA
                         This war's made some things pointless. 
                         It's hard to imagine a wedding. I 
                         think even my father would recognize 
                         that.

                                     INMAN
                         Ada, I want to marry you. If you'll 
                         have me.

                                     ADA
                         Isn't there's some religion where 
                         you just have to say I marry you, 
                         three times, and then you're man and 
                         wife.

                                     INMAN
                         I marry you. I marry you. I marry 
                         you.

               Ada laughs, unsettling Inman.

                                     INMAN
                         Why's that funny?

                                     ADA
                         No, I think it's I divorce you three 
                         times and then you're not married 
                         anymore.

                                     INMAN
                         I can wait for you.

                                     ADA
                         You waited enough. I certainly did. 
                         I marry you. I marry you. I marry 
                         you.

               And they kiss, tentative, then more urgent.

                                     ADA
                         I'm sorry about the way I look. In 
                         these clothes.
                              (Inman shakes his 
                              head)
                         And there are so many buttons.
                              (starts to undress)
                         Will you turn your back?

                                     INMAN
                         Not for all the gold dollars in the 
                         Federal Bank.

               She stands holding her clothes in front of her to cover 
               herself. He takes them from her, drops them to the floor.

               EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               A crisp, cold beautiful morning. They're packing up, all 
               their clothes in layers. Inman prepares the horse. Ruby and 
               Ada carrying bundles out of the huts. Inman approaches Ruby.

                                     INMAN
                         You go ahead. I'll follow with the 
                         horse at a pace your daddy can 
                         tolerate.

                                     ADA
                         We can all go together.

                                     INMAN
                         It's safer this way. No one has 
                         quarrel with you.

                                     RUBY
                         He's right.

                                     INMAN
                              (to Ruby)
                         I gather I need permission if I reckon 
                         on living at Black Cove.

               Ruby gives a curt nod, goes over to Stobrod's hut. Inman 
               gets close to Ada.

                                     INMAN
                         We'll get to you by nightfall.

                                     ADA
                         You be safe.

               She puts her hand to his mouth which creases into a smile.

                                     INMAN
                         Your Mr. Bartram speaks about some 
                         category of fly born on the hide of 
                         a cow. It flies up into a tree and 
                         waits and waits until it smells cow. 
                         It can wait a year, two years, I 
                         don't know, maybe longer. Then a cow 
                         comes along and it wakes up, flies 
                         down, lays its eggs on the cow. 
                         There's purpose for you.

                                     ADA
                         And am I the fly in this story, or 
                         the cow?

               INT. STOBROD'S HUT, CHEROKEE VILLAGE. DAY

               Ruby is wrapping a fragile Stobrod for the journey.

                                     STOBROD
                         You come up the mountain for me, 
                         darling, I'd be dead otherwise, dead 
                         and gone.

                                     RUBY
                         You'd have found some other fool to 
                         rescue you.

                                     STOBROD
                         He's sweet on you, that Georgia boy.

               He coughs for a long time.

                                     RUBY
                         If you say a thing and then cough 
                         it's a lie. Daddy, stay on that horse, 
                         and don't lose him or sell him. We'll 
                         need him on the farm.

               EXT. CHEROKEE VILLAGE. MORNING

               And then the two women are off, little men in their outfits, 
               tramping off in the snow. Inman watches.

               EXT. TRACK NEAR THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ruby and Ada walk.

                                     RUBY
                         I hope that Georgia boy's been seeing 
                         to the animals.

                         I was not. I was thinking on swollen 
                         udders -- and before you say same 
                         difference...

                         I'm saying nothing.

               Ruby elbows her.

                                     RUBY
                         Miss lovey-dovey!

               Ada elbows her back.

               EXT. THREE WAY CROSSING, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Inman has roped Stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a 
               steep slope. Behind him, their hooves muffled by the snow, A 
               GROUP OF RIDERS JOIN THE TRAIL, IN SLOW BUT STEADY PURSUIT.

               Inman walks on, apparently oblivious to who's behind him. He 
               and Stobrod are some distance from broken ground, a fringe 
               of trees.

                                     INMAN
                              (quietly to Stobrod)
                         Don't look round.

                                     STOBROD
                         Got it.

                                     INMAN
                         How many men does he have?

                                     STOBROD
                         There were five. You can't reason 
                         with that man.

                                     INMAN
                              (takes off his gloves)
                         I got a conversation stopper.
                              (they're getting closer)
                         Closer we get to that broken ground 
                         the better.

               Inman opens his coat. Stobrod looks at the Lemats. They're 
               at the edge of the trees.

                                     INMAN
                         You hold on tight, do you hear? When 
                         I say three, look round, nice and 
                         slow.

                                     STOBROD
                         Okay.

                                     INMAN
                         One, two, three.

               Stobrod looks round. Inman doesn't. Teague has some new bodies 
               in his entourage but they're all dead. A SPARE HORSE HAS 
               THREE CORPSES HUNG OVER IT, ANOTHER HORSE DRAGS A MAKESHIFT 
               LITTER WITH A COUPLE MORE, SOUVENIRS OF THEIR CAVE VISIT. 
               Teague waves.

                                     TEAGUE
                         God damn! You're a hard fucker to 
                         put down.
                              (they approach)
                         Good directions to that cave from 
                         the fat boy -- saw the squirrels, 
                         sat on the tree made some friends, 
                         brought some back with me.

               His riders begin, quite casually, to fan out.

               IN ONE MOVEMENT, INMAN SLAPS THE FLANK OF THE HORSE. WHICH 
               CAREERS DOWN THE TRACK, THEN TURNS AND FIRES, TWICE, BEFORE 
               PITCHING HIMSELF INTO A ROLL TOWARDS THE TREES. HIS FIRST 
               SHOT KNOCKS JO FROM HIS HORSE, THE SECOND MO, WHO FALLS INTO 
               THE SNOW, BLEEDING FROM THE GROIN AND SCREAMING. The riderless 
               horse gets tangled up with the others.

               Inman is in the trees, shots around him. He doesn't move 
               away from, but towards the riders inside the line of trees. 
               Grayling charges him, riding into the trees. INMAN SHOOTS 
               HIM, THEN RUSHES FROM THE TREES, FIRING, MISSING BOSIE, WHO 
               RIDES AWAY, EVIDENTLY NOT RELISHING THE FIGHT, AND THROWS 
               HIMSELF AT TEAGUE, WHOSE HORSE IS BUCKING WILDLY. Teague's 
               carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. Inman yanks 
               the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the 
               shotgun barrel of the Lemats with the other, the big pistol 
               almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. TEAGUE'S CHEST 
               OPENS OUT AS HE'S THROWN OFF THE HORSE. Mo is still screaming.

               Inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to 
               Teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow 
               under him.

               Inman studies him, picks up the Spencer carbine, turns to 
               look where Bosie has gone, steps up onto Teague's horse, 
               reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate Teague, 
               LEANS OVER AND SHOOTS HIM DEAD. He turns the horse in the 
               direction Bosie had headed. He can't see horse or rider, but 
               in the stand of Hickory Trees ahead, THE GUSTS OF STEAMING 
               BREATH betray them both. He rides slowly towards the stand 
               of trees.

               EXT. COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ada and Ruby walking. They hear the shots. Ada turns and 
               starts to run through the snow, her hat flying from her head.

               EXT. STAND OF HICKORY TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Inman's horse is parallel to Bosie, who is deep inside the 
               trees but also riding, slowly. It's like a dance.

                                     INMAN
                         Come out of there.

                                     BOSIE
                         No, sir. Here's fine.

                                     INMAN
                         I just have to shoot the horse from 
                         under you.

                                     BOSIE
                         Shoot her. She's not mine. You riding 
                         Mr Teague's mare?

                                     INMAN
                         I am.

                                     BOSIE
                         He dead?

                                     INMAN
                         I hope so.
                              (wearily, as he brings 
                              his horse inside the 
                              trees)
                         Look, how old are you? Give me your 
                         gun and ride home, I'm done fighting. 
                         I'm sick of it.

                                     BOSIE
                         I give you my gun you'll shoot me 
                         dead.

                                     INMAN
                         I will not shoot you, but nor am I 
                         walking down that mountain looking 
                         over my shoulder for you.

                                     BOSIE
                         That's what they call a conundrum. I 
                         tell you what I've got on my side.

                                     INMAN
                         What have you got on your side?

                                     BOSIE
                         The confidence of youth.

               And in that second HE PRODUCES HIS GUN AND FIRES. INMAN HAS 
               ALREADY FIRED THE LEMATS AND THE BOY, SHOT IN THE HEAD, FALLS. 
               CAUGHT BY ONE STIRRUP THE HORSE BOLTING. INMAN WATCHES, STOCK 
               STILL, THEN MAKES A COUGH, AS IF CLEARING HIS THROAT, AND A 
               THIN MIST OF BLOOD SPRAYS FROM HIS MOUTH.

               EXT. RIDGE, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ada and Ruby running. THEY REACH STOBROD, HIS HORSE STOPPED, 
               DRINKING FROM THE CREEK. Stobrod, barely conscious, hanging 
               halfway down its flank, held on by the ropes.

               Ada hurries on, taking the shotgun from Ruby, who tends to 
               her father.

               EXT. A GROVE OF TREES, COLD MOUNTAIN. DAY

               Ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses. She hardly 
               stops to look at the bodies, just rushes on.

               THE GROUND SIMPLIFIES AND SHE'S AT THE BOTTOM OF A GROVE. A 
               STEEP INCLINE, THE SUN LOW AND IN FRONT OF HER. SHE SEES A 
               BRILLIANT FRAME OF BLACK TREES, AND THEN A SUDDEN FLURRY OF 
               ANGRY CROWS FLYING TOWARDS HER. AT THE TOP OF THE HILL IS A 
               SMALL HIEROGLYPH OF A MAN.

               FINALLY, THE IMAGE FROM THE SWANGER WELL EXACTLY AS SHE FIRST 
               SAW IT.

               THE FIGURE RAISES A HAND, BRIEFLY, THEN PITCHES FORWARD INTO 
               THE SNOW.

               She runs, her heart broken, towards the body of Inman. He's 
               dead, the red flag of his life ebbed, away in the snow. Ada 
               falls to her knees and pulls him over, the snow crusted on 
               his face, which she wipes away with great tenderness, then 
               sits, his head in her lap, as Ruby slowly comes up the hill 
               towards them.

               A VIOLIN PLAYS, quite raucous.

               INT. KITCHEN, BLACK COVE FARM, EASTER. DAY

               A GIRL, about five or six, with Ada's curls, sits at the 
               table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled 
               bottle she offers it. She tries again. Ada comes in suddenly, 
               takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out.

                                     ADA
                         You bring that lamb outside.

               The girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field.

               EXT. FIELD, BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               THE SOUND OF THE FIDDLE CONTINUING, JOINED BY A BANJO, It's 
               a glorious spring morning, Black Cove Farm at its most 
               luxuriant, the path edged with brilliant flowers. There are 
               more animals in evidence. The girl emerges from the house 
               and sees Ada in the field, surrounded by sheep. She hurries 
               over.

               ADA IS EXPERTLY SKINNING A STILLBORN LAMB. The little girl 
               is horrified.

                                     GRACE
                         What are you doing!

                                     ADA
                         He came out dead, love.

               She has the skin off the lamb, which lies like a little pink 
               cat on the ground. She approaches Grace, takes the live lamb 
               from her arms, the girl resistant, frightened.

                                     GRACE
                         Don't kill him!

                                     ADA
                         I'm not going to kill him. But we 
                         have to try something or else he's 
                         going to die.

               She takes the skin and wraps it round Grace's lamb. Then 
               puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lamb's 
               mother.

               It goes to the sheep and, after a few false starts, starts 
               to feed, accepted as a surrogate.

                                     ADA
                         Isn't that a small mercy.

               And A VOICE joins in with the fiddle and banjo.

               EXT. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY

               STOBROD is playing, on his repaired fiddle. His hair is now 
               completely grey. GEORGIA is playing the banjo and singing, 
               although. A SMALL CHILD with Georgia's reddish coloring keeps 
               invading his picking hand trying to join in. RUBY HAS ANOTHER 
               GEORGIA CHILD IN HER ARMS, but is also trying to serve food.

               She passes Georgia and touches the top of his head. SALLY 
               SWANGER is pouring water from a jug, Ada emerges from the 
               kitchen, with a big pie, racing to the table.

                                     ADA
                              (laughing)
                         Hot hot hot hot hot!!!

               From behind her, Grace appears, carrying a jug of milk, puts 
               it on the groaning board of the table. Grace has a full plate 
               in front of her, picks up a fork to spear some meat.

                                     ADA
                         Grace Inman, nobody said eat.
                              (then to Stobrod)
                         Mr. Thewes...

               The music stops. And there's quiet except for the sound of 
               animals: lowing, barking, braying, bleating.

                                     ADA
                         For good friends, good food, good 
                         family: for all our blessings -- Oh 
                         Lord we thank thee. Amen.

                                     ALL
                         Amen !

               And they eat.

                                         THE END
CORIOLANUS

          INT. DARKENED ROOM - DAY

          The blade of a knife.

          Pulled from its sheath, intricate tribal etchings on the
          blade catching the light.

          The blade being pulled across a sharpening stone. Swoosh-
          swoosh-swoosh. Rhythmic. A well-practiced hand. A muscular,
          tattooed arm.

          The blade held up. Razor sharp. The glow of a TV in the
          darkened room is the only illumination.
          We see images on the TV:

          GLOBAL AND URBAN STRIFE slums barricades poverty
          starvation demonstrations repression refugee
          camps barbed wire prisons riot police tear gas
          violence...

          Then the images settle to now, BREAKING NEWS:
          FOOD RIOTS IN ROME. Images of a protest march. A crowd
          filling the streets. Soldiers moving into position. We see
          placards: "DOGS MUST EAT," "MEAT WAS MADE FOR MOUTHS."
          The man sharpening the knife watches the images. His eyes are
          cold. Almost disinterested.

          Then he stops.
          Frozen in mid-stroke.
          Something on the TV suddenly rivets him.
          His eyes no longer cold.

          The TV shows one of the soldiers, a high-ranking officer.
          Imperious. Giving orders. We will come to know this is a man
          as Caius Martius -- Coriolanus.

          TULLUS AUFIDIUS, the man sharpening the knife, gazes at the
          image on the screen.

          He leans forward. Emerging from the darkness. We see his
          face.

          He is a handsome and imposing figure, magnetic in his
          personality. Charismatic, yes, but also neurotic and edgy.
          Uncomfortable in his own skin. Some demons there.
          He watches the face of Caius Martius on the TV screen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          Then he puts the point of his knife against the screen.
          Against Caius Martius' heart.
          Holds it there Presses the point against the screen
          Muscles knotting in his forearm As if he could thrust the
          knife through the screen and into the heart of Caius
          Martius...
          His nemesis His dark angel.
          Sharp cut to--

          EXT. ROME - STREET - DAY

          We move with an intense woman down the street. She is
          nervous. Checks she is not being followed.
          She is TAMORA, an extreme figure on the political landscape.
          To the Roman elite she is a dangerous anarchist -- to her
          supporters she is an ardent patriot and democrat.
          As she moves, we take in Rome.
          It might be Mexico City. Or Chechnia. Or El Salvador. Or
          Detroit. Or Baghdad. Or London.
          This Rome is a modern place. It is our world right now:
          immediately recognizable to us. Elements of classical
          architecture loom over decay. Monolithic modernism and brave
          public monuments are lost in a sea of brazen advertising
          billboards, neon shopping plazas and drab super-highways.
          Splendor and squalor sit side-by-side.
          It is a volatile, dangerous world.
          William Shakespeare's Rome.
          She comes to a graffiti-covered apartment building. Looks
          around. Enters.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          A secret political meeting in a police state.
          Tension. Cigarette smoke hangs in the air. Men and women
          gathered, hushed and urgent tones. A cell meeting of the
          political opposition, the resistance.
          A TV shows the food marches elsewhere in the city. The
          gathering storm.
          CASSIUS is a leading proletariat organizer:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         CASSIUS
          Before we proceed any further, hear me
          speak -- You are all resolved rather to
          die than to famish?
          The others agree. They are not wild-eyed radicals. They are
          normal people, from all walks of life. You and me.

                         CASSIUS
          First, you know Caius Martius is chief
          enemy to the people.
          A voice from the back of the room:

                         TAMORA
          Let us kill him.
          The others turn. Tamora, just entering, pulls off her coat,
          joins the others:

                         TAMORA
          And we'll have corn at our own price. Is
          it a verdict?
          Some are unsure. She is too extreme for some.

                         CASSIUS

                         (PRESSING SLIGHTLY)
          We are accounted poor citizens, the
          patricians good The leanness that
          afflicts us, the object of our misery,
          our sufferance, is a gain to them. Let us
          revenge this with our sticks ere we
          become rakes! I speak this in hunger
          for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
          A woman, a YOUNG MOTHER, protests:

                         YOUNG MOTHER
          Will you proceed especially against Caius
          Martius?

                         CASSIUS
          Against him first.
          A COLLEGE PROFESSOR, speaks up:

                         COLLEGE PROFESSOR
          Consider you what services he has done
          for his country?

                         TAMORA

                         (SNAPS)

          pays himself with being proud.

                         COLLEGE PROFESSOR
          Nay, but speak not maliciously.
          She has over-played her hand. Pretends to back down:

                         TAMORA
          I say unto you, what he hath done
          famously, he did it to that end...
          (a snarky smile)
          He did it to please his mother.
          Some laugh at her gossip.
          Then the TV image switches to a BREAKING NEWS update:
          From the Roman Senate. An august press room. A Senator is
          moving to a podium to make a statement.
          He is Senator MENENIUS is a seasoned and wily politician.
          Silver hair, perfectly tailored suit. He is known as a folksy
          "man of the people." It is a role he plays to perfection.

                         CASSIUS
          Soft, who comes here?

                         COLLEGE PROFESSOR
          Worthy Senator Menenius, one that hath
          always loved the people.

                         TAMORA
          He's one honest enough; would all the
          rest were so.

                         MENENIUS

          The others shush her.

          When you curse them as enemies--
          Cassius mutes the TV. We see Senator Menenius continuing with
          his speech; his attempt to calm the dangerous situation.

                         CASSIUS
          Care for us? They never cared for us yet!

                         TAMORA
          If the wars eat us not up, they will: and
          that's all the love they bear us.
          The others are growing increasingly restive -- shifting --

                         TENSION BUILDING--

                         CASSIUS
          Why stay we prating here?

                         TAMORA
          No more talking on it!
          To the Capitol! Come! Come!

                         CUT TO--

          EXT. STREETS - DAY

          Tamora, Cassius and the others are now in the midst of the
          protest march. The crowd has become a mob, with a life and
          will of its own. The crowd surges forward--
          They round a corner and suddenly stop--
          For a formidable sight awaits them-

          RIOT POLICE.
          Rows of black uniforms. Full riot gear with plexiglass
          shields and dangerous truncheons.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          A few soldiers on horses as well.
          The crowd starts and shifts nervously, unsure how to proceed.
          Should they launch themselves against this monolithic
          military force?
          A long, tense beat.
          Then...
          One of the horsemen trots forward...
          He rides a beautiful white horse...
          It is CAIUS MARTIUS. (Soon to be given the honorary title
          Coriolanus.) He is intense and patrician. Uncompromising. A
          man of steel. A soldier. He wears a crisp, military uniform.
          From his position on the horse, Martius looks over the
          rioters...
          His gaze is ice...
          A long beat...
          Then he dismounts...
          He slowly walks to the unruly mob...
          With no hesitation, unarmed...
          He stops before them...
          And speaks with absolute disdain.

                         MARTIUS
          What's the matter, you dissentious
          rogues,
          That, rubbing the poor itch of your
          opinion,
          Make yourselves scabs?

                         CASSIUS

                         (SARCASTIC)
          We have ever your good word.

                         MARTIUS

                         (SNAPS)
          He that will give good words to thee will

                         FLATTER
          Beneath abhorring.
          The crowd is hushed. Taking in his every word.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.
          We note a TV news crew has moved into position and is filming
          eagerly. Some in the crowd film with cell phone cameras.
          Streaming video. We intercut some of these perspectives.

                         MARTIUS
          What would you have, you curs?
          He that trusts to you,
          Where he should find you lions, finds you

                         HARES;
          Where foxes, geese.
          He walks along the front of the crowd. Some are frightened by
          the great Martius. Some are even awed. Others glare at him
          with loathing.

                         MARTIUS
          Who deserves greatness
          Deserves your hate...
          Hang ye! Trust ye?
          With every minute you do change your
          mind,
          And call him noble that was now your
          hate,
          Him vile that was your garland.
          He continues along the crowd, his cold eyes taking in face

                         AFTER FACE:

                         MARTIUS
          What's the matter,
          That in these several places of the city
          You cry against the noble Senate, who,
          Under the gods, keep you in awe, which

                         ELSE
          Would feed on one another?
          He stops and glares at the mob with seething anger.
          He climbs back onto his horse. Stares down at them.

                         AN ULTIMATUM:

                         MARTIUS
          Go GET YOU HOME, YOU FRAGMENTS!
          A tense beat.
          The riot police shift nervously.
          The crowd is unsure.
          The TV news crew films everything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.
          Cassius looks around. He sees the police ready with tear gas.
          He sees old men, women and children in his crowd. He doesn't
          want this to explode.
          He exchanges a few whispers works with Tamora. Word is passed
          and the crowd begins to disperse. Some run off in a panic.
          Others walk away.
          The danger has passed.
          Senator Menenius, who has been watching from nearby, gestures
          for Martius to join him. He is an old family friend of
          Martius' as well as his mentor and chief political advisor.
          Menenius is relieved bloodshed has been avoided.

                         MENENIUS
          These are almost thoroughly persuaded;
          For though abundantly they lack
          discretion,
          Yet are they passing cowardly.

                         MARTIUS
          They are dissolved. Hang 'em.
          Senator Menenius watches the crowd. Disturbed.

                         MENENIUS
          I would they were abed.

                         MARTIUS
          I would they were in Tiber.
          They move off.

          INT. DARKENED ROOM - DAY

          We see the TV image of Martius railing at the people from

                         BEFORE:

                         MARTIUS

                         (ON TV)
          Go GET YOU HOME, YOU FRAGMENTS!
          Tullus Aufidius is leaning in. Watching so closely.
          From his POV: the pixilated close-up of Martius' face on the
          screen.
          He runs his knife blade back and forth. Turns it in the
          light; the reflection of Martius' face distorting as he
          rotates the blade.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.
          Then Aufidius leans back again.
          Back into the shadows. Disappearing.

          EXT. MILITARY COMMAND CENTER - DAY

          Rome's military headquarters. A high security building like
          the Pentagon.

          INT. ROMAN WAR ROOM - DAY

          Martius is seated with several MILITARY OFFICERS and AIDES.
          Also with him is TITUS. He younger than Martius, an old
          friend and comrade-in-arms. Like Martius he has seen a lot of
          battle.
          COMINIUS, an older general, enters. He is an experienced
          commander of men also used to dealing with the necessary
          politics of civilian oversight. West Point bearing.
          All salute. Cominius returns the salute.

                         COMINIUS
          The news is the Volsces are in arms.
          An aide presses a remote. Grainy video images play on a
          monitor: Volscian soldiers, jeeps, tanks.
          One section shows a quick image of the rebel leader, a
          striking man called Tullus Aufidius, riding past in a jeep.

                         COMINIUS
          They have a leader,
          Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to it.

                         MARTIUS
          I sin in envying his nobility,
          And were I any thing but what I am,
          I would wish me only he.

                         SENATOR
          You have fought together?

                         MARTIUS
          He is a lion
          That I am proud to hunt.
          Martius takes the remote control. Stops the video. Rewinds to
          the unclear image of Aufidius.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         MARTIUS
          Titus Lartius, thou
          Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus'
          face.

                         TITUS
          Lead you on.
          Martius rewinds and plays the image of Aufidius again,
          rewinds and plays it again, almost obsessively.
          We push in on the video image of Aufidius...
          Aufidius appears to be staring right back at Martius...
          And this takes us to...

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-WAR ROOM - NIGHT

          The same face.
          Aufidius, who is the leader of the rebel Volscian forces,
          stands deep in thought.
          The Volsces are an insurgent force challenging the monolithic
          might of Rome: rebels that suggest to us Latin American
          revolutionaries or Hamas fighters or Chechnian separatists.
          They are a dangerous guerilla force.
          We are in the Volsce war room in an old apartment building. A
          basement. No windows. Secure.
          OFFICERS and some civilian POLITICIANS. The room is filled
          with military maps, weapons, surveillance photos.

                         VOLSCE POLITICIAN
          So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
          That they of Rome are entered in our

                         COUNSELS
          And know how we proceed.

                         AUFIDIUS

                         (SNAPS)
          Is it not yours?
          Tis not four days gone since I heard
          thence.

                         VOLSCE OFFICER
          We never yet made doubt but Rome was

                         READY
          To answer us.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         VOLSCE POLITICIAN
          And it is rumored Martius, your old
          enemy, leads in their preparation.
          He tosses a glossy magazine on the desk, a picture of Martius
          on the cover.
          Aufidius' eyes spark at the image of Martius.
          He picks up the magazine and carefully tears off the cover
          picture of Martius, looking at the picture deeply.
          He continues with a strange and grim fire:

                         AUFIDIUS
          If we and Caius Martius chance to meet,
          'Tis sworn between us we shall ever

                         STRIKE
          Till one can do no more.
          By the elements,
          If ever again I meet him beard to beard,
          He's mine or I am his.

          EXT. MARTIUS VILLA - DAY

          A beautiful butterfly. Catching the light perfectly, almost
          iridescent.
          It floats before a palatial mansion in the suburbs of the
          great city. Manicured lawns. Formal gardens. Classical
          architectural lines.
          This fine home of aristocratic privilege seems a world away
          from the urban blight of Rome.
          In the immaculate front gardens YOUNG MARTIUS, Martius' son,
          is playing. The boy is about ten. There is something grim and
          lonely about him, without charm.
          Young Martius chases after the butterfly, trying to catch it.
          He fails. The butterfly flits away. Young Martius leaps after
          it. Again he misses.
          Finally the frustrated boy manages to catch the butterfly. In
          his rage he tears it to pieces, brutally shredding it.
          We realize he is being observed...

          INT. MARTIUS VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          . VIRGILIA, Martius' wife, stands at the window. Disturbed
          by the sight of her son ripping apart the butterfly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          She sees Young Martius stop and look at the tiny bit of blood
          on his fingers. Young Martius is unmoved. He glances up.
          Locks eyes with his mother.
          She turns away.
          Virgilia was well-chosen for her role as wife to one of
          Rome's most aristocratic men. She is beautiful and graceful
          but -- like Diana thrown into lion's den of the Windsor
          family -- woefully out of her depth. We feel an inner
          fragility to her.
          The room is spacious and elegantly appointed. A lovely Roman
          statue in one corner. This is a place of wealth, order and
          control.
          A fine flat-screen TV flickers with images of war. We see
           helicopters zooming over desert landscape Imbedded war
          correspondents Tanks Combat Romans . Volscians.
          VOLUMNIA, Martius' mother, stands and watches the TV. She is
          an imposing woman, handsome and tall, impeccably dressed.
          Adamantine in her strength.
          Virgilia moves from the window. Sits on a sofa. She watches
          the TV news footage of the war, upset by the images.
          A frozen silence.

                         THEN:

                         VOLUMNIA
          I pray you, daughter, sing, or express
          yourself in a more comfortable sort. If
          my son were my husband, I should more
          freely rejoice in that absence wherein he
          won honor than in the embracements of his
          bed where he would show most love.
          She moves across the room to fetch a cigarette. She moves,
          always, with stately grace.
          She walks past a series of photographs. They tell the story
          of Martius' life: the happy baby; the stern dead father; the
          rigid young military cadet; the formal wedding; the
          restrained and unsmiling adult.
          In the photos we sense a transformation: innocent boy to
          experienced, severe looking soldier. Volumnia is present in
          most of the pictures.

                         AS:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         VOLUMNIA
          When yet he was but tender-bodied and the
          only son of my womb, I, considering how
          honor would become such a person, was
          pleased to let him seek danger where he
          was like to find fame.
          She lights her cigarette.

                         VOLUMNIA
          To a cruel war I sent him, from whence he
          returned, his brows bound with oak.

                         VIRGILIA
          But had he died in the business, madam,
          how then?

                         VOLUMNIA
          Then his good report should have been my
          son.
          (she rivets Virgilia)
          Had I a dozen sons I had rather have
          eleven die nobly for their country than
          one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
          A MAID enters. She speaks to Volumnia (the true mistress of
          the house) not to Virgilia.

                         MAID
          Madam, Senator Menenius is come to visit
          you.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Tell Menenius we are fit to bid him
          welcome.
          The Maid goes.

                         VIRGILIA
          Beseech you, give me leave to retire
          myself.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Indeed, you shall not!
          She turns off the TV and goes to a bar to mix drinks. She
          mixes the drinks aggressively, strangely inspired by the
          discussion of war:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Methinks I hear hither your husband's

                         DRUM;
          Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call

                         THUS:

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)
          "Come on, you cowards! You were got in
          fear,
          Though you were born in Rome." His bloody

                         BROW
          Then wiping, forth he goes.

                         VIRGILIA
          His bloody brow? 0 Jupiter, no blood...

                         VOLUMNIA
          Away, you fool! It more becomes a man
          Than gold his trophy.

                         VIRGILIA
          Heavens bless my lord from fell
          Auf idius ...

                         VOLUMNIA
          He'll beat Aufidius' head below his knee
          And tread upon his neck.
          Senator Menenius enters, he is comfortable in this house and
          an old ally of Volumnia's.

                         MENENIUS
          My ladies both, good day to you.
          Volumnia hands him one of the drinks she has been mixing: a
          perfect martini. She knows how he takes his drink. She is not
          above flirting with him when it suits her ends.

                         MENENIUS
          How do you both?

                         (TO VIRGILIA)
          And how does your little son?

                         VIRGILIA
          I thank you, sir; well, good.

                         VOLUMNIA
          He had rather play with swords and hear a
          drum than look upon his schoolmaster.

                         MENENIUS
          On my word, the father's son!
          He and Volumnia laugh.
          Menenius has sensed Virgilia's tension. Tries to cheer her:

                         MENENIUS
          Come, I must have you play the idle
          housewife with me this afternoon.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         VIRGILIA
          No, good sir, I will not out of doors.

                         MENENIUS
          Not out of doors!

                         VOLUMNIA
          She shall, she shall.

                         VIRGILIA
          Indeed, no, by your patience. I'll not
          over the threshold till my lord return
          from the wars.

                         MENENIUS
          Fie, you confine yourself most
          unreasonably.

                         VIRGILIA
          I cannot go hither.

                         MENENIUS

                         (PLAYFULLY)
          You would be another Penelope; yet they
          say all the yarn she spun in Ulysses'
          absence did but fill Ithaca full of
          moths.

                         VIRGILIA
          No, good sir, pardon me; indeed, I will
          not forth.

                         MENENIUS
          Go with me and I'll tell you excellent
          news of your husband.

                         VIRGILIA
          0, good sir, there can be none yet.

                         MENENIUS
          There came news from him last night.
          Volumnia pounces, moving in:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Indeed?

                         MENENIUS
          Your lord and Titus Lartius are set down
          before the Volscian city of Corioles.
          They nothing doubt prevailing and to make
          it brief wars This is true, on mine
          honor; and so, I pray, go out with us.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         VIRGILIA

                         (AGAIN DECLINING)
          Give me excuse, good sir. I will obey you
          in everything hereafter.

                         VOLUMNIA

                         (SNAPS)
          Let her alone. As she is now, she will
          but disease our better mirth.
          She takes Menenius arm and pulls him out, eager for more news
          of her son.
          Virgilia sits for a beat.
          Then she presses a button on the remote control. The TV goes
          on again. More news reports of the war.
          We see images of the Volscian town of Corioles. A "BREAKING
          NEWS" scroll runs across the bottom of the screen The
          Battle for Corioles
          Virgilia watches the war footage, her eyes haunted.
          Hard cut to--

          EXT. CORIOLES - DAY

          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! A series of explosions jolt us.
          Corioles is a small urban center. Smoke billows up from areas
          of the city. The steady crack and rattle of gunfire. The
          occasional thud of explosions.
          We see urban street-to-street fighting. The images are
          startling in their familiarity: this could be Basra or
          Belfast.
          The battle is photographed in a gritty exposure. Color is
          drained out -- blood is a darker red like oil. Soldiers are
          dark forms moving through shadows and smoke.
          Martius and Titus, leading a platoon of around twenty Roman
          SOLDIERS, run into view and take cover. Bullets zip and snap
          around them.
          The Roman soldiers wear modern battle fatigues and body
          armor, tricked out with all the latest tech gear. The
          Volscians, being a poor guerilla force, wear thrown together
          uniforms that look almost tribal.
          Martius calls over the incessant din of battle to Titus and

                         THE SOLDIERS:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         MARTIUS
          They fear us not, but issue forth their
          city.
          Sniper bullets slam into a wall near him. He coughs away the
          smoke and debris. This only makes him more angry:

                         MARTIUS
          They do disdain us much beyond our
          thoughts,
          Which makes me sweat with wrath!
          He that retires, I'll take him for a
          Volsce,
          And he shall feel mine edge!
          Martius leaps up and races on. The others follow in military
          order.
          The Roman soldiers move along the street -- it is chaotic --
          explosions, smoke and sniper fire -- they duck into doorways
          and behind abandoned cars -- returning fire as best they can--
          Martius leads -- firing stead bursts from his machine gun--
          It is slow and bloody going--
          Finally the Romans turn a corner and are stopped by a
          roadblock: a burning bus that fills the entire street--
          The Volsces use this roadblock to ambush the Roman soldiers--
          We see glimpses of Volscian soldiers darting for position --
          firing from rooftops and from inside shops--

                         BLISTERING CROSSFIRE--

          INT. BLASTED HOTEL ROOM - DAY

          Aufidius runs into a blasted hotel room. Some of his soldiers
          with him.
          He goes to the window. Scans the street below. Sees Martius
          and the others trapped at the bus. He gestures to an aide for

                         A RADIO--

          EXT. CORIOLES-STREET - DAY

          In the face of the crossfire, the Roman soldiers start

                         FALLING BACK--
          Martius refuses to yield -- pushing and shoving his men
          toward the burning bus -- screaming in fury over the noise:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         MARTIUS
          You souls of geese,
          That bear the shapes of men! PLUTO AND

          HELL!
          All hurt behind! Backs red, and faces

                         PALE
          With flight and agued fear! Mend and
          charge home,
          Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave

                         THE FOE

          AND MAKE MY WARS ON YOU!
          An EXPLOSION -- dirt and brick shards slash across Martius'
          face -- blood--
          This only pushes his fury to white rage--

                         MARTIUS
          Look to it. Come on!

          FOLLOW ME!
          He leaves his soldiers behind--
          Moves alone to the burning bus and fights his way through the

                         FLAMES--
          Martius is in his own world now. He doesn't even realize he
          is alone. He has become a sort of killing machine. A shark
          moving through the ocean. Ruthless and efficient.
          We become the warrior.
          From Martius' POV:
          We move through disorienting curtains of smoke...
          Continue down the street...
          Firing a heavy machine gun...
          Volscian soldiers contort and die, torn to pieces by the
          bullets...
          The heavy machine gun is empty, we drop it and use a sidearm,
          firing strategic shots...
          Volscian soldiers dart up -- fire -- and die...
          We keep moving steadily forward...
          Shadowy shapes moving nearby, we fire. Killing civilians. The
          fortunes of war...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          Strange surreal images. We smash into a house. An OLD MAN
          crouches, terrified, in a corner. He reaches forward. He is
          offering us water. An act of kindness amid the carnage...
          We move on...
          Panicked civilians, scattering in terror...
          Volscian soldiers rush us, attacking, we slam them aside...
          We duck down, roll under a car, emerge and fire...
          More Volscians die...
          We continue forward...
          Then the pistol is empty, we drop it and pull a machete-like
          knife...
          Still moving relentlessly forward...
          Slashing and killing...
          Hand-to-hand now...
          Carnage.

          EXT. CORIOLES-ALLEY - DAY

          Aufidius and his aides are racing down an alley, trying to
          get to Martius--
          Roman fire stops them--
          They return fire as they divert down another alley, trying
          for a better strategic position, running flat out--

          EXT. CORIOLES - LATER

          Titus and the soldiers are still pinned down at the burning
          bus. Two soldiers race back to Titus to report, they dive for
          cover.

                         TITUS
          What is become of Martius?

                         SOLDIER 1
          Slain, sir, doubtless.

                         SOLDIER 2
          He is himself alone,
          To answer all the city.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         TITUS
          Thou art lost, Martius...
          Titus has no time to mourn. He looks over the hopeless
          situation. Scanning the rooftops, windows and shops.
          Then he stops He sees something Past the burning bus
          Through the smoke and flames...
          He glimpses a ghostly figure...

                         TITUS
          Who's yonder,
          That does appear as he were flayed?
          0 gods! He has the stamp of Martius.
          It is indeed Martius.
          A shocking sight.
          Drenched head-to-toe in blood.
          His face splattered with gore.
          His eyes wild.
          Lost in something like rapture.

                         MARTIUS
          Come I too late?! Come I too late?!

                         TITUS
          Ay, if you come not in the blood of
          others,
          But mantled in your own.
          Martius laughs wildly and embraces Titus, who comes away
          splattered with blood:

                         MARTIUS
          0, let me clip ye
          In arms as sound as when I wooed, in

                         HEART
          As merry as when our nuptial day was
          done!
          SUDDENLY -- a deafening explosion -- and RPG EXPLODING from
          nearby. Then gunfire. Bullets shatter windows. The Volscians
          are attacking again.
          The Romans instantly begin diving for cover and taking up

                         DEFENSIVE POSITIONS--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.
          Martius scans the location. Sees the attack is coming from an
          old Hilton hotel. Now pockmarked with bullets and artillery
          shells. Most of the windows shattered.
          This is the Volscian stronghold. The last stand. He sees
          flashes of Volscian soldiers moving on the roof and
          balconies, and snipers firing from windows.
          There is an open plaza, littered with bodies and debris, in
          front of the hotel.
          Martius stops scanning with his binoculars--
          Sees Aufidius moving in the hotel, directing the battle--

                         MARTIUS
          There is the man of my soul's hate--

                         AUFIDIUS--
          Piercing our Romans.

                         TITUS
          Worthy sir, thou bleeds.
          Thy exercise hath been too violent
          For a second course of fight.

                         MARTIUS
          Sir, praise me not.
          My work hath yet not warmed me.
          The blood I drop is more medicinal
          Than dangerous to me. To Aufidius thus
          I will appear and fight.
          He turns to some soldiers, imploring them to join him. His
          bloody visage and intensity are strangely inspiring, his

                         FEROCITY INFECTIOUS:

                         MARTIUS

                         (TO SOLDIERS)
          If any such be here-
          As it were sin to doubt - that love this

                         PAINTING
          Wherein you see me smeared; if any fear
          Lesser his person than an ill report;
          If any think brave death outweighs bad
          life,
          And that his country's dearer than

                         HIMSELF;
          Let him alone, or so many so minded,
          Wave thus, to express his disposition,

          AND FOLLOW MARTIUS!
          The soldiers are pumped up -- like Marines straining for

                         COMBAT--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         MARTIUS

          0, ME ALONE! MAKE YOU A SWORD OF ME!

                         THEY BOLT--
          Zigzagging across the plaza toward the hotel--
          Titus and the others provide covering fire--

          EXT. CORIOLES-PLAZA - DAY

          Martius zigzags with his men across the dangerously exposed

                         PLAZA--
          They return fire at the hotel as best they can, but the
          barrage from the Volscians is murderous--
          Roman soldiers contort and fall, blood spraying--
          Bullets snap and ricochet everywhere around them--
          But still they keep up a steady pace, reloading and firing as

                         THEY GO--
          Then Martius is hit--

                         BLOOD SPRAYS--
          But still he keeps on--
          The front of the hotel is closer now--
          Martius and his soldiers race to the hotel and crash into the

                         LOBBY--

          INT. CORIOLES-HOTEL-LOBBY - DAY

          Martius and his soldiers battle the Volscian defenders in the

                         HOTEL LOBBY--
          It is the weird and incongruous nature of modern urban
          warfare: soldiers fighting to the death among hotel couches
          and tatty corporate artwork--
          It is brutal--
          Martius and his soldiers cut a bloody swath across the hotel

                         LOBBY--
          Another HUGE EXPLOSION rocks the hotel -- like a seismic
          blast -- an ugly 1970's chandelier falls--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.
          Martius and his men move into a stairwell--

          INT. CORIOLES-HOTEL-STAIRWELL - DAY

          Martius and his men race up the stairway-
          Volscians are firing down at them--
          Bullets ricochet crazily in the confined stairway, refracting
          from concrete walls and twisting metal railing, sending up
          sparks and clouds of dust--
          Then Martius slows to a stop.
          Looks up.
          Aufidius is on the stairway above. Glaring down at him.
          A long beat as they lock eyes. Both panting for breath in the
          heat of the combat.

                         MARTIUS
          I'll fight with none but thee, for I do
          hate thee.

                         AUFIDIUS
          We hate alike.
          Then Martius does something astounding.
          He holds out his arms to his sides and drops his weapons.
          They clatter down.
          Aufidius does the same.
          The Roman and Volscian soldiers watch.
          None daring to interfere.
          Martius and Aufidius continue to glare at each other --
          dropping weapons -- disarming -- Martius climbing up the
          stairs, Aufidius coming down -- moving closer and closer--
          At an instant-
          They slam together-
          Fighting without weapons--
          Grappling brutally. Tearing at each other. Twining together.
          Fingers grasping. Teeth snapping. Hands pulling.
          It is a bloody, terrible, graceless struggle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          They crash and slam awkwardly in the claustrophobic
          stairwell. Smashing into the walls. Falling from level to

                         LEVEL--

                         THEN--
          Another EXPLOSION rocks the hotel--
          Part of the roof COLLAPSES--
          Concrete SLAMS down--
          A cloud of smoke, dust and debris obscures everything-
          Martius is tossed violently to the ground in the action--
          Aufidius is pulled away by several of his men. They drag him
          to safety. Roman soldiers fire after them. The sound is
          deafening in the confined garage.
          But Aufidius and his comrades disappear into a cloud of dust.
          Gone.
          Martius glares after him. Wipes blood from his eyes.

          INT. CORIOLES-HOTEL-LOBBY - NIGHT

          The hotel lobby has been turned into a hastily assembled
          emergency triage station.
          The moaning and screaming of the injured are constant. Roman
          medics attend to the wounded: administering IVs; arranging
          evacuations; performing battlefield surgery.
          Martius sits, dried blood covering his face, looking over his
          injured and dying soldiers as a medic stitches up a wound in
          his arm. Titus is with him.
          General Cominius enters with several attending officers,
          going to congratulate Martius.

                         COMINIUS
          If I should tell thee over this thy day's
          work,
          Thou would not believe thy deeds.
          Martius is barely listening. His attention is on a YOUNG
          SOLDIER across the room. The Young Soldier is injured, pale
          and thirsty. Dying.

                         COMINIUS
          But I'll report it
          Where Senators shall mingle tears with

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         COMINIUS (CONT'D)

                         SMILES;
          Where great patricians shall attend and
          shrug,
          In the end admire and say: "We thank the

                         GODS
          Our Rome hath such a soldier."

                         MARTIUS

                         (SHIFTING PAINFULLY)
          Pray now, no more. My mother,
          When she does praise me, grieves me.
          I have done as you have done - that's
          what I can;
          Induced as you have been - that's for my
          country.
          Martius continues to look at the poor dying soldier.

                         TITUS
          Rome must know
          The value of her own. It were a

                         CONCEALMENT
          Worse than a theft,
          To hide your doings.

                         MARTIUS
          I have some wounds upon me, and they

                         SMART
          To hear themselves remembered.
          The surgeon finishes stitching Martius' arm. Starts to clean
          another wound.

                         COMINIUS
          Should they not,
          Well might they fester against

                         INGRATITUDE
          Too modest are you.
          Impatient, Martius rises, painfully and slowly. He takes his
          canteen and crosses to the Young Soldier. Gives his canteen
          to the boy. The Young Soldier drinks. His deep, sad eyes gaze
          up at Martius.
          Martius watches as...
          The Young Soldier dies. The light goes from his eyes. His
          head hangs awkwardly. His boyish face is leaden.
          Martius suddenly finds himself exhausted. Morally and
          physically spent.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         MARTIUS

                         (TO COMINIUS)
          I will go wash;
          And when my face is fair, you shall

                         PERCEIVE
          Whether I blush or no Howbeit,
          thank you.
          Martius stares at the dead soldier.

          EXT. CORIOLES-STREET - NIGHT

          Aufidius and some of his Volscian soldiers, bloody and
          filthy, are on foot.
          They are moving through the outskirts of Corioles, leaving
          the city. Exhausted after the long and failed battle.
          Fires burn from blasted shops and homes. The Romans have
          clearly laid waste to this part of the city.
          There is a minivan stopped ahead of them. Bullets holes
          everywhere. Bodies inside.
          They walk to it. Aufidius looks in. A dead family. Father,
          mother, kids in the back. Bloody toys on the floor of the
          minivan.
          Roman atrocities.
          Aufidius gazes at the bodies. His face hardens.
          He whispers to himself:

                         AUFIDIUS
          Five times, Martius,
          I have fought with thee; so often hast
          thou beat me,
          And would do so, I think, should we

                         ENCOUNTER
          As often as we eat.
          He becomes aware some of his men are looking at him,
          disturbed at his fervor.

                         AUFIDIUS

                         FOR WHERE
          I thought to crush him in an equal force,
          True sword to sword, I'll stab him some
          way,
          Or wrath -- or craft -- may get him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         SOLDIER
          He's the devil.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Bolder, though not so subtle.
          A beat. Aufidius continues with prayer-like intensity:

                         AUFIDIUS
          My valor, poisoned with him,
          Shall fly out of itself ...
          Nor sleep, nor sanctuary, being naked,
          Sick, the prayers of priests,
          Nor times of sacrifice,
          Shall lift up their rotten privilege
          And custom,
          Against my hate to Martius.
          In the shattered glass of the minivan window, Aufidius
          suddenly sees himself.
          He studies his own face, nurturing his dark thoughts.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Where I find him, were it
          At home, upon my brother's guard, even
          there,
          Will I wash my fierce hand in his heart.

          INT. POLITICO BAR - DAY

          Back in Rome, we are at a comfortable restaurant/bar near the
          Senate where politicians gather to eat, drink, gossip and
          conspire. The business of state is conducted over steak and
          martinis.
          Comfortable red leather booths. Wooden panelling.
          Two Tribunes -- Senators chosen to speak for the people --
          are having lunch.
          BRUTUS is a large man in a rumpled grey suit; a sweating bear
          with a taste for bare-knuckle politics. SICINIUS is smaller
          and vulpine; crafty and cold.
          Both are ambitious politicos used to manipulating the people
          and the press for their personal ends. With them sits
          Cassius, the political agitator we met before.
          The TV over the bar shows images of Martius' victory:
          parading Roman troops; Volscian prisoners; flags; adoring
          crowds; triumphant slogans; "Mission Accomplished."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         SICINIUS
          Was ever man so proud as is this Martius?

                         CASSIUS
          He has no equal.

                         SICINIUS
          When we were chosen Tribunes for the

                         PEOPLE-

                         BRUTUS
          Marked you his lip and eyes?

                         SICINIUS
          Nay, but his taunts.
          They see Senator Menenius approaching. Sicinius nods to
          Cassius, who quickly goes.
          Menenius stops by on his way out. He is jolly, knowing the
          victory will assure his protege's political future:

                         MENENIUS
          The augurer tells me we shall have news
          tonight.

                         BRUTUS
          Good or bad?

                         MENENIUS
          Not according to the prayer of the
          people, for they love not Martius.

                         SICINIUS
          Nature teaches beasts to know their
          friends.

                         MENENIUS
          You blame Martius for being proud?

                         BRUTUS
          We do it not alone, sir.
          Subtly, the polite chit-chat is turning more serious and
          pointed; Menenius growing sharper. The gloves are coming off.

                         MENENIUS
          I know you can do very little alone
          You talk of pride: 0 that you could turn
           your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
           and make but an interior survey of your
          good selves! 0 that you could!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

                         BRUTUS
          What then, sir?

                         MENENIUS
          Why, then you should discover a brace of
          unmeriting, proud, violent, testy
          magistrates, alias fools, as any in Rome.
          The saturnine Sicinius' response seems almost a threat:

                         SICINIUS
          Menenius, you are known well enough too.

                         MENENIUS
          I am known to be a humorous patrician,
          and one that loves a cup of hot wine with
          not a drop of allaying water in it; one
          that converses more with the buttock of
          the night than with the forehead of the
          morning. What I think I utter, and spend
          my malice in my breath.

                         BRUTUS
          Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

                         MENENIUS
          You know neither me, yourselves nor
          anything You are ambitious.
          A tense beat. They are formidable adversaries.

                         MENENIUS
          Good-e'en to your worships. More of your
          conversation would infect my brain, being
          the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians
          I will be bold to take my leave of you.
          He goes. The Tribunes watch him cut through the lunch crowd
          and exit.

          EXT. SENATE - DAY

          The Roman Senate is constructed with classical symmetry and
          clean, square lines. Probably the most striking and beautiful
          building in Rome.

          INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY

          Volumnia, Virgilia and Menenius are hurrying down a corridor,
          excited. All are well-dressed, for an important public event.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Honorable Menenius, my boy Martius
          approaches! For the love of Juno, let's
          go.

                         MENENIUS
          Is he not wounded? He was wont to come
          home wounded.

                         VIRGILIA
          0, no, no, no...

                         VOLUMNIA

                         (VICTORIOUSLY)
          0, he is wounded! I thank the gods for
          it.

                         MENENIUS
          So do I too -- if it be not too much.
          Brings a victory in his pocket, the
          wounds become him. Has he disciplined
          Aufidius soundly?

                         VOLUMNIA
          Titus Lartius says they fought together,
          but Aufidius got off.

                         VIRGILIA
          In truth, there's wondrous things spoke
          of him. Gods grant them true.

                         VOLUMNIA
          (an exhalation of scorn)
          True?!

                         MENENIUS
          I'll be sworn they are true. Where is he
          wounded?
          Volumnia and Menenius now gleefully add up her son's wounds
          like accountants -- or campaign managers.

                         VOLUMNIA
          In the shoulder and in the left arm.
          There will be large scars to show the
          people, when he shall stand for his place
          He received in the repulse of Tarquin
          seven hurts in the body.

                         MENENIUS
          One in the neck, and two in the thigh -
          there's nine that I know.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         31

                         VOLUMNIA
          He had, before this last expedition,
          twenty-five wounds upon him.

                         MENENIUS
          Now it's twenty-seven. Every gash was an
          enemy's grave.
          We focus on Volumnia's face as she thinks about her son.

                         VOLUMNIA

                         BEFORE HIM
          He carries noise, and behind him he
          leaves tears.
          Death, that dark spirit, in his nervy arm

                         DOTH LIE;
          Which, being advanced, declines, and then
          men die.
          They hurry to the stop of a grand staircase, where there are
          people waiting...

          INT. SENATE-STAIRS - DAY

          They join Cominius and other dignitaries at the top of a
          majestic stairway.
          An honor guard of Roman soldiers in dress uniforms are
          waiting. Roman flags flutter. All very ceremonial.
          Martius enters below. The honor guard snaps to attention.
          Martius -- hereafter called Coriolanus -- slowly begins to
          cross to the steps. We see that walking is very difficult
          for him. His wounds are severe and every movement is agony.
          He has paid a steep price for his victory.
          Photographers flash photos and a TV crew film the ceremony.
          Coriolanus finally reaches the steps leading up. He takes a
          breath and slowly begins to climb the stairs, each step a
          challenge.
          Volumnia looks down on him. Unmoved by his pain.
          Virgilia is distraught.
          As Coriolanus slowly hauls himself up the last few steps,
          General Cominius speaks into a cluster of microphones and
          addresses the press:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         COMINIUS
          Be it known,
          As to us, to all the world, that Caius

                         MARTIUS
          Wears this war's garland And from
          this time,
          For what he did before Corioles, call
          him,
          With all the applause and clamor of the
          host,
          "Caius Martius Coriolanus!"

                         (TO MARTIUS)
          Bear the addition nobly ever!
          The soldiers salute in a grim sort of chant:

                         SOLDIERS
          Caius Martius Coriolanus!
          Coriolanus has reached the podium. An awkward beat. Cominius
          gestures for him to speak into the microphones.
          He tersely does so:

                         CORIOLANUS
          No more of this; it does offend my heart.
          Pray now, no more.
          An awkward silence. Cominius elegantly tries to covers the

                         MOMENT:

                         COMINIUS
          Look, sir, your mother.

                         CORIOLANUS

          0,
          You have, I know, petitioned all the gods
          For my prosperity.
          He kneels to her -- slowly, with great difficulty -- she lets
          him.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Nay, my good soldier, up.
          (he slowly rises)
          My gentle Martius, worthy Caius, and
          By deed-achieving honor newly named -
          What is it? - Coriolanus must I call
          thee?
          She laughs coquettishly, thoroughly upstaging her son.
          Then, almost an afterthought:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         VOLUMNIA
          But, 0, thy wife...
          Coriolanus greets Virgilia with the clumsy and stiff
          formality that marks their marriage.

                         CORIOLANUS
          My gracious silence, hail.
          An awkwardly tender kiss. He notes her tears. Reacts coldly.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Would thou have laughed had I come
          coffined home,
          That weeps to see me triumph? Ay, my
          dear,
          Such eyes the widows in Corioles wear,
          And mothers that lack sons.

                         MENENIUS
          Now, the gods crown thee!

                         CORIOLANUS
          (greets him warmly)
          And live you yet?

                         VOLUMNIA

                         (LAUGHS)
          I know not where to turn. 0, welcome
          home!
          And welcome, general. And you're welcome
          all!

                         MENENIUS
          A hundred thousand welcomes!
          Coriolanus is surrounded by well-wishers and political
          admirers. Volumnia and Menenius usher him along.
          We see the image from TV: The noble warrior returned home.
          Devoted family. Flags waving. The future golden.

          INT. VILLA-BATHROOM - EVENING

          And then the hard reality.
          Coriolanus' body is a battleground of scars. Some are livid
          and red, fresh and still oozing blood. Others are pale and
          blue, discolored and dead.
          His body is something monstrous. Stitched up. Patched
          together. Slashed around. Frankenstein's monster.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.
          He is leaning against a sink, stripped naked. His muscular if
          shattered body exposed.
          Volumnia sits and dresses her son's wounds. As she always has
          done. As she always will.
          It is a disturbing, intimate image.

                         CORIOLANUS
          The good Senators must be visited;
          From whom I have received not only
          greetings,
          But with them change of honors.
          He shifts painfully as she continues to treat one of his
          wounds.

                         VOLUMNIA
          I have lived
          To see inherited my very wishes
          And the buildings of my fancy. Only
          There's one thing wanting, which I doubt

                         NOT BUT
          Our Rome will cast upon thee.
          He catches her eye in the mirror, very firm:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Know, good mother,
          I had rather be their servant in my way,
          Than sway with them in theirs.
          They stop when--
          Virgilia enters.
          She stops in the doorway. It is embarrassing for her, as if
          she has interrupted two lovers. A long moment.
          She looks to her husband.
          To Volumnia.
          They stare back.
          There is no way she can compete with their intimacy.
          Surrendering, she silently goes.

          INT. VILLA -- HALLWAY - EVENING

          Virgilia wanders a long hallway, past a fine collection of
          antique Roman weaponry. She seems lost.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          She stops and opens a door, glances into her son's bedroom:
          Young Martius is asleep.
          Her eyes move across his room. The military toys. The little
          cadet uniform carefully hung. The polished boots waiting.
          All stern and joyless. Not like a child's room at all.
          Virgilia closes the door and continues down the long hallway,
          disappearing into darkness.

          INT. SENATE-OFFICE - DAY

          Darkened office. Brutus and Sicinius sit, heads together,
          focused.

                         SICINIUS
          He cannot temperately transport his
          honors, but will
          Lose those he hath won.

                         BRUTUS
          I heard him swear,
          Were he to stand for Consul, never would

                         HE
          Appear in the marketplace nor
          Showing, as the manner is, his wounds
          To the people, beg "their stinking
          breaths."

                         SICINIUS
          It was his word.

          INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY

          Brutus and Sicinius continue as they hurry to the Senate

                         CHAMBER:

                         BRUTUS
          So it must fall out with him,
          Or our authorities at an end.

                         SICINIUS
          We must suggest to the people in what

                         HATRED
          He still hath held them.

                         BRUTUS

                         (SHUSHING HIM)
          Peace...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          They enter the Senate Chamber...

          INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

          Brutus and Sicinius make their way to their seats as we hear:

          MENENIUS (V.0.)
          It remains,
          As the main point of this our after-
          meeting,
          To gratify his noble service that
          Hath thus stood for his country...
          The interior of the grand Senate is an airy, sweeping chamber
          that suggests the Israeli Knesset or U.N. General Assembly.
          Again, classical symmetry is the rule with tiers of seats
          facing a central dais. An imposing piece of outdated modern
          art suggesting the might of Rome looms over the chamber like
          a bird of prey.
          Network TV cameras purr quietly from a corner.
          Menenius, Cominius, Coriolanus and several other politicos
          are seating at a central table on the dais, facing the rows
          of SENATORS.
          Menenius is standing at a podium, speaking into a microphone:

                         MENENIUS
          Therefore, please you,
          Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
          The present Consul, and last general
          In our well-found successes, to report
          A little of that worthy work performed
          By Caius Martius Coriolanus.

                         SENATOR
          Speak, good Cominius.
          General Cominius rises and moves to the podium.
          But then Coriolanus abruptly stands--

                         MENENIUS
          Nay, keep your place.

                         SENATOR
          Sit, Coriolanus. Never shame to hear
          What you have nobly done.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Your honors' pardon.
          I had rather have my wounds to heal again
          Than hear say how I got them.

                         MENENIUS
          Pray now, sit down.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I had rather have one scratch my head in

                         THE SUN
          When the alarum were struck than idly sit
          To hear my nothings monstered.
          Coriolanus moves across the dais and exits into a hallway.
          The door shuts after him.
          Menenius sighs. Nods to Cominius.
          Cominius moves to the podium and begins to read his speech
          from a Teleprompter. This all has the rehearsed quality of a
          campaign nomination speech.

                         COMINIUS
          The deeds of Coriolanus
          Should not be uttered feebly. It is held
          That valor is the chiefest virtue, and
          Most dignifies the haver. Alone he

                         ENTERED
          The mortal gate of the city,
          And struck Corioles like a planet,
          From face to foot
          He was a thing of blood...
          Brutus and Sicinius exchange a glance, bored by the political
          boilerplate.

          INT. SENATE-SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY

          Meanwhile, Coriolanus stands in the service corridor beyond
          the chamber. Green industrial walls. Ugly fluorescent lights
          above.
          He leans against a wall, alone with his thoughts.
          Cominius' voice can be heard droning inside.
          Then Coriolanus glances up. A CUSTODIAN is pushing a garbage
          can down the long corridor. He stops when he sees Coriolanus.
          Coriolanus' cool, uncompromising stare makes the Custodian
          uneasy. He turns around and goes back.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.
          Coriolanus waits. His face strangely vacant.
          He flexes his wounded arm. It hurts.
          He hears Cominius finish. A good round of applause. He hears
          his name being cheered: "Coriolanus!"
          Coriolanus closes his eyes, steels himself, and then re-
          enters the chamber...

          INT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY

          Menenius greets him and escorts him to the podium for his
          "acceptance speech."

                         MENENIUS
          The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
          To make thee Consul!
          Menenius steps back.
          A beat.
          Coriolanus stares at the Senators. At the TV cameras.
          He leans awkwardly into the podium microphone:

                         CORIOLANUS
          I do owe them still
          My life and services.
          A beat.
          For an acceptance speech, rather terse. Menenius jumps in to
          salvage the moment:

                         MENENIUS
          It then remains
          That you do speak to the people.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I do beseech you,
          Let me overleap that custom, for I cannot

                         ENTREAT THEM
          For my wounds' sake to give their
          suffrage.
          Please you that I may pass this doing.
          From the Senate floor, Sicinius jumps on this:

                         SICINIUS
          Sir, the people
          Must have their voices!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          The Senators, led by Brutus, clamor their agreement.
          Tradition must be obeyed.

                         MENENIUS
          (calming, to Coriolanus)
          Pray you, go fit you to the custom.

                         CORIOLANUS
          It is a part
          That I shall blush in acting, and might

                         WELL
          Be taken from the people.
          Menenius quickly turns off Coriolanus' microphone.

                         BRUTUS

                         (TO SICINIUS)
          Mark you that?

                         CORIOLANUS
          To brag unto them "Thus I did, and thus!"
          Show them the unaching scars which I
          should hide,
          As if I had received them for the hire
          Of their breath only!
          Menenius sees Coriolanus is getting angry, this could be
          disastrous.
          He elegantly gestures for Cominius to escort Coriolanus out
          immediately -- as he addresses the Senators and TV cameras:

                         MENENIUS
          To our noble Consul
          Wish we all joy and honor!
          He applauds. The applause is taken up by the Senators. Some
          cheering as well for the hero of Rome The two Tribunes,
          however, are already whispering maliciously to other
          Senators.
          Menenius seems pleased with the general response. So far, so
          good.

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Volumnia is pleased as well.
          She sits, watching the events unfold on TV.
          The sound of the cheering fades as we go to...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          INT. MENENIUS' LIMO - DAY

          The limousine winds through the pedestrian traffic toward the
          Roman marketplace.
          Coriolanus sits with Menenius. Coriolanus is both angry and
          embarrassed. He is wearing a sharp business suit.

                         MENENIUS
          Have you not known
          The worthiest men have done it?

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (AGREES)
          Custom calls me to it.
          What custom wills, in all things should
          we do...
          What must I say?
          "Look, sir, my wounds.
          I got them in my country's service."

                         MENENIUS
          O me, the gods!
          You must not speak like that. You must

                         DESIRE THEM
          To think upon you--

                         CORIOLANUS
          "Think upon me"? Hang 'em!
          I would they would forget me.

                         MENENIUS
          You'll mar all!
          The limo stops. They are at the marketplace. The moment has
          come.
          Menenius takes a breath. Urges calm:

                         MENENIUS
          Pray you, speak to them, I pray you,
          In wholesome manner.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (SOURLY)
          Bid them wash their faces
          And keep their teeth clean.
          He leaves the car.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

          EXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY

          The commercial heart of Rome. A large town square, since
          antiquity used as a marketplace.
          But now it is filled with tatty stalls selling cheap purses
          and knock-off watches. Paltry fruit stands alongside shabby
          souvenir stalls.
          Advertising billboards surround and pollute the square --
          SONY. COKE. NIKE. MCDONALDS -- obscuring any classical
          architecture that might have survived.
          Tamora and Cassius, the political activists, are in the
          crowd. They watch closely.
          Coriolanus slowly walks to the center of the marketplace. He
          stands, feeling ridiculous and not at all humble.
          He looks around.
          Waiting for something to happen.
          The CUSTOMERS and SHOPKEEPERS just look back at him. Some are
          curious. Some are amused. Some hostile and most indifferent.
          But no one approaches.
          Then Coriolanus understands. He must g to them: beg for
          votes.
          He prepares himself and then slowly moves through the various
          stalls, weaving in and out. Trying to maintain his dignity.
          He sees the Citizens from before and goes to them. We glimpse
          Brutus and Sicinius amongst the crowd.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (TO CASSIUS)
          You know the cause, sir, of my standing
          here.

                         CASSIUS
          We do, sir. Tell us what hath brought you
          to it.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Mine own desert.

                         TAMORA
          Your own desert?

                         CORIOLANUS
          Ay, but not mine own desire.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         TAMORA
          How not your own desire?

                         CORIOLANUS
          No, it was never my desire yet to trouble
          the poor with begging.

                         CASSIUS
          You must think, if we give you anything,
          we hope to gain by you.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Well then, I pray, your price of the
          Consulship?

                         WAR VET
          The price is to ask it kindly.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Kindly, sir, I pray, let me have it. I
          have wounds to show you, which shall be
          yours in private Your good voice,
          sir. What say you?

                         WAR VET

                         (IMPRESSED)
          You shall have it, worthy sir.

                         CORIOLANUS
          A match, sir. There's in all two worthy
          voices begged. I have your alms. Adieu.
          Business done, so he thinks, Coriolanus crisply moves on.
          Cassius is not convinced.

                         CASSIUS
          But this is something odd.
          Coriolanus continues on. He sees a large JAMAICAN WOMAN with
          her CHILDREN, carrying plastic grocery bags, talking to a
          SHOPKEEPER. He goes to them:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Pray you now, if it may stand with the
          tune of your voices that I may be Consul.

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          You have deserved nobly of your country,
          and you have not deserved nobly.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Your enigma?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          You have been a scourge to her enemies;
          you have been a rod to her friends
          You have not indeed loved the common
          people.

                         CORIOLANUS
          You should account me the more virtuous
          that I have not been common in my love
          Therefore, beseech you, I may be
          Consul.

                         SHOPKEEPER
          We hope to find you our friend, and
          therefore give you our voices heartily.

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          You have received many wounds for your
          country.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I will not seal your knowledge with
          showing them. I will make much of your
          voices, and so trouble you no farther.

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
          Coriolanus is warming to the task, it's easier than he
          thought. He moves to a central, open area and declares

                         PUBLICLY:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Your voices! For your voices I have

                         FOUGHT;
          Watched for your voices; for your voices

                         BEAR
          Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice

                         SIX
          I have seen and heard of!
          A crowd is gathering. We note Brutus and Sicinius in the
          crowd. Menenius, too, has moved in.

                         CORIOLANUS
          For your voices
          Have done many things, some less, some
          more.
          Your voices! Indeed, I would be Consul.

                         WAR VET
          He has done nobly, and cannot go without
          any honest man's voice!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

          RACE TRACK TOUT
          Therefore let him be Consul!

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          The gods give him joy, and make him good
          friend to the people!
          The Citizens applaud and give their support:

                         CITIZENS
          Amen, amen. God save thee, noble Consul!

                         CORIOLANUS
          Worthy voices!
          Menenius, with Brutus and Sicinius, goes to him:

                         MENENIUS
          You have stood your limitation, and the

                         TRIBUNES
          Endue you with the people's voice.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Is this done?

                         SICINIUS
          The custom of request you have
          discharged.
          The people do admit you, and are summoned
          To meet anon upon your approbation.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Where? At the Senate?

                         SICINIUS
          There, Coriolanus.

                         MENENIUS
          I'll keep you company.

                         (TO BRUTUS)
          Will you along?

                         BRUTUS

                         (DECLINES)
          We stay here for the people.
          Coriolanus and Menenius go, relieved the trial is over.
          Brutus and Sicinius, however, have work to do. This has not
          gone as they wanted. They are urgent:

                         SICINIUS
          How now, my masters! Have you chose this
          man?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         CASSIUS

                         (RUEFULLY)
          He has our voices, sir.

                         BRUTUS
          We pray the gods he may deserve your
          loves.

                         TAMORA
          Amen, sir. To my poor unworthy notice,
          He mocked us when he begged our voices.

                         CASSIUS

                         CERTAINLY
          He flouted us downright.

                         JAMAICAN WOMAN
          No, it is his kind of speech; he did not
          mock us.

                         TAMORA

                         (SHARPLY)
          He should have showed us
          His marks of merit, wounds received for's
          country.

                         SICINIUS
          Why, so he did, I am sure.

                         TAMORA
          No, no! No one saw them!

                         CASSIUS
          (inciting the crowd)
          Was not this mockery?
          Brutus presses hard:

                         BRUTUS
          When he had no power,
          But was a petty servant to the state,
          He was your enemy, ever spake against
          Your liberties.

                         SICINIUS
          Did you perceive
          He did solicit you in free contempt
          When he did need your loves, and do you

                         THINK
          That his contempt shall not be bruising

                         TO YOU
          When he hath power to crush?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          Cassius and Tamora carefully lead the crowd in expressing
          growing alarm and resistance to Coriolanus:

                         CASSIUS
          He's not confirmed; we may deny him yet!

                         TAMORA
          And will deny him!
          I'll have five hundred voices of that
          sound.

                         CASSIUS
          I twice five hundred and their friends!
          The crowd roars approval. A frightening, animal sound.

                         SICINIUS
          Let them assemble,
          And on a safer judgment all revoke
          Your ignorant election.

                         BRUTUS
          Enforce his pride,
          And his old hate unto you!

                         SICINIUS
          And presently, when you have drawn your
          number,
          Repair to the Capitol.

                         CASSIUS
          We will so!

                         TAMORA
          We will so! All
          Repent in their election!
          Cassius and Tamora lead the crowd. It is a terrifying
          spectacle of sudden mob rage, only a razor-thin edge to
          violence.
          Brutus and Sicinius watch, satisfied, like Robespierre and
          Saint Just looking over the bloody guillotine.

          INT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY

          Coriolanus, dressed again in his familiar uniform, emerges
          from an antechamber with his comrade Titus.
          Menenius, General Cominius and several pro-Coriolanus
          Senators follow them. They stride down the corridor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (TO TITUS)
           Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new
          army?

                         TITUS
          He has, my lord.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Saw you Aufidius?

                         TITUS
          He is retired to Antium.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Spoke he of me?

                         TITUS
          He did, my lord.

                         CORIOLANUS
          How? What?

                         TITUS
          How often he had met you, sword to sword;
          That of all things upon the earth he

                         HATED
          Your person most.

                         CORIOLANUS
          At Antium lives he?

                         TITUS
          At Antium.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
          To oppose his hatred fully.
          They hear the growing rumble of a crowd. Curious.
          They continue on and turn a corner to...

          INT. SENATE-CENTRAL LOBBY - DAY

          The central lobby of the Senate is an open, airy space.
          Through the glass doors at the front of the lobby an unruly
          crowd can be seen gathering. Police. Barricades.
          Sicinius and Brutus are waiting to intercept them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (TO TITUS)
          Behold, these are the Tribunes of the
          people,
          The tongues of the common mouth.

                         SICINIUS
          Pass no further.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Ha! What is that?

                         BRUTUS
          It will be dangerous to go on. No
          further.

                         CORIOLANUS
          What makes this change?

                         MENENIUS
          The matter?

                         COMINIUS
          Hath he not passed the nobles and the
          commons?

                         BRUTUS
          Cominius, no.
          Coriolanus steps closer to Brutus. The mob sees him through
          the glass doors. The tension immediately increases.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Have I had children's voices?

                         TITUS
          Tribunes, give way.

                         BRUTUS
          The people are incensed against him.

                         CORIOLANUS
          (glancing to the growing

                         CROWD)
          Are these your herd?

                         MENENIUS
          Be calm, be calm.

                         BRUTUS
          The people cry you mocked them, and of
          late called them
          Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to
          nobleness.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         CORIOLANUS
          But this was known before.

                         SICINIUS
          You show too much of that
          For which the people stir. If you will

                         PASS
          To where you are bound, you must inquire
          your way.
          The crowd outside is growing restless, sensing and responding
          to the building tension. The police try to hold them back,
          keeping them away from the doors. The crowd presses in.
          We see Cassius and Tamora at the forefront, urging the crowd
          on.

                         MENENIUS
          Let's be calm--

                         COMINIUS
          The people are abused, set on--

                         MENENIUS
          Not now, not now--

                         TITUS
          Not in this heat, sir--
          Coriolanus strides angrily toward the doors and exits--
          The others follow--

          EXT. SENATE-COURTYARD - DAY

          Coriolanus launches himself into the crowd with blistering

                         ANGER:

                         CORIOLANUS
          My nobler friends, I crave their pardons.
          For the mutable, rank-scented crowd,
          Let them regard me as I do not flatter,
          And therein behold themselves. I say
          again,
          In soothing them, we nourish against our

                         SENATE
          The cockle of rebellion, insolence,
          sedition,
          Which we ourselves have ploughed for,
          sowed, and scattered,
          By mingling them with us!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         MENENIUS
          Well, no more!

                         TITUS
          No more words, we beseech you--
          The mob has surrounded them all by now.
          The police are getting nervous, eyes darting uneasily from
          the unruly crowd to the volatile men.
          This all has the potential of sparking to violence.
          We note a TV news crew moving into position, covering the
          action. Others film with cell phone cameras. We intercut some
          of this footage.

                         BRUTUS
          (to Coriolanus, provoking)
          You speak of the people
          As if you were a god to punish, not
          A man of their infirmity.

                         SICINIUS
          It were well we let the people know it.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
          By Jove, it would be my mind!

                         SICINIUS
          It is a mind
          That shall remain a poison where it is,
          Not poison any further.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (EXPLODES)
          "Shall remain"!
          Hear you this Triton of the minnows? Mark

                         YOU
          His absolute "shall"?

                         BRUTUS
          Why, should the people give
          One that speaks thus their voice?

                         CORIOLANUS
          I'll give my reasons,
          More worthier than their voices!
          Menenius tries to pull him away, Coriolanus shakes free and
          continues the attack:

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         51

                         CORIOLANUS
          By Jove himself,
          It makes the consuls base; and my soul

                         ACHES
          To know, when two authorities are up,
          Neither supreme, how soon confusion,
          May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
          The one by the other.
          The crowd roars angrily -- Coriolanus spins on them:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Thus we debase the nature of our seats,
          and make the rabble
          Call our cares fears; which will in time
          Break ope the locks of the Senate, and

                         BRING IN
          The crows to peck the eagles!

                         MENENIUS
          Come, enough!

                         BRUTUS
          Enough, with over-measure.

                         SICINIUS
          (calls to the mob)
          He has spoken like a traitor, and shall

                         ANSWER
          As traitors do!
          At the word "traitor" Coriolanus loses all reason, he is

                         FIRE:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee!

                         BRUTUS
          Manifest treason!

                         SICINIUS
          This is a Consul? No!

                         CORIOLANUS
          Hence, old goat!
          Coriolanus grabs Sicinius roughly and flings him aside--
          At this -- the crowd ROARS in outrage -- the TV crews hustle

                         FOR POSITION--
          Menenius pulls Coriolanus off:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         MENENIUS
          On both sides more respect!

                         SICINIUS
          (calling to the crowd)
          Here's he that would take from you all
          your power!
          The crowd reacts angrily -- surging forward against the
          restraint of the police.
          We see grim RIOT POLICE marching into position. The crowd is
          not intimidated, they are spoiling for a fight.
          The Tribunes provoke the crowd even more, escalating and
          building the fever:

                         BRUTUS
          You are at point to lose your liberties!
          Martius would have all from you, Martius,
          Whom late you have named for Consul.

                         SICINIUS
          What is the city but the people?!

                         TAMORA
          True! The people are the city!

                         SICINIUS
          We do here pronounce, upon the part of
          the people,
          Martius is worthy of present DEATH!
          A huge roar from the mob. Panic and violence building. Fast

                         AND OVERLAPPING:

                         BRUTUS
          Guards, seize him!

                         CORIOLANUS
          No, I'll die here!

                         BRUTUS
          Lay hands upon him!

                         SICINIUS
          (to the crowd)

          HELP, YE CITIZENS!
          At his cue--
          The civil violence threatened from the opening moments of
          this story finally EXPLODES--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          With Cassius and Tamora in the forefront, the crowd attacks

                         THE POLICE--
          Riot Police march in, slamming ahead with riot shields and

                         TRUNCHEONS--
          The mob fights back with anything at hand -- some are armed
          with clubs and knives, others snatch up garbage cans and
          newspaper vending machines, throwing them, smashing windows,
          battling the police, kicking and punching and screaming--
          It is civil disobedience. But it is also drunken, thug
          violence. Terrifying in its intensity--
          Menenius gets Titus and Cominius to hustle Coriolanus away--

                         MENENIUS
          Go, get you to your house! Be gone, away!
          All will be naught else--

                         COMINIUS
          Come, sir, along with us--
          They hurry Coriolanus away--
          The Riot Police, outnumbered, start firing TEAR GAS into the

                         CROWD--

                         SCREAMS--
          TV news crew filming--
          Chaotic, flurried violence--
          Shaky TV images, cell phone video--
          Choking, acrid gas--
          It is a terrifying descent into public madness as all order
          breaks down.
          Rome is bloody.

          INT. SENATE-OFFICE - DUSK

          Menenius and the Tribunes are gathered in a darkened office
          for some high-stakes politicking.
          Tamora, her face bloody from the riot, is with them. So too
          some supporters on either side.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         MENENIUS

                         (URGENTLY)
          As I do know the Consul's worthiness,
          So can I name his faults--

                         SICINIUS
          Consul! What Consul?

                         MENENIUS
          The Consul Coriolanus.

                         BRUTUS
          He Consul?!

                         SICINIUS
          It is decreed
          He dies tonight.

                         TAMORA
          He's a disease that must be cut away.

                         MENENIUS
          0, he's a limb that has but a disease:
          Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
          What has he done to Rome that's worth his
          death? Eh?
          Killing our enemies?!
          He sees that his words are having some effect, he presses the

                         POINT:

                         MENENIUS
          The blood he hath lost --
          He dropped it for his country.
          Some in the room murmur agreement.

                         BRUTUS
          We'll hear no more--

                         MENENIUS
          Consider this: he has been bred in the

                         WARS
          Since he could draw a sword, and is ill

                         SCHOOLED
          In graceful language Give me leave,
          I'll go to him, and undertake to bring

                         HIM
          Where he shall answer by a lawful form,
          In peace, to his utmost peril.

                         PRO-CORIOLANUS SENATOR
          Noble tribunes,
          It is the humane way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         ANOTHER SENATOR
          The other course
          Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
          Unknown to the beginning.
          Sicinius is about to retort when Brutus stops him.
          Brutus assents, assuming the voice of reason:

                         BRUTUS
          Be you then as the people's officer.
          Menenius and Coriolanus' supporters are relieved.

                         BRUTUS
          If you bring not Martius, we'll proceed
          In our first way.

                         MENENIUS
          I'll bring him to you.
          He goes quickly.
          Brutus turns to Sicinius and Tamora and begins to quietly
          explain his plan.

          INT. MARTIUS VILLA-CORRIDOR - DAY

          Coriolanus strides angrily down a long corridor, in and out
          of shafts of light, seething to Titus:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Let them pull all about mine ears,

                         PRESENT ME
          Death on the wheel or at wild horses'
          heels,
          Yet will I still be thus to them--!

                         TITUS

                         MARTIUS--

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (CONTINUING UNABATED)
          I muse my mother
          Does not approve me further!
          He slams through a door to the living room...

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          And stomps to confront his mother, who is currently
          conspiring with Menenius and a few Senators.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         CORIOLANUS
          (to Volumnia, angrily)
          I talk of you!
          Why did you wish me milder? Would you

                         HAVE ME
          False to my nature? Rather say I play
          The man I am!
          She is equally tough with him, not giving an inch, snapping

                         RIGHT BACK:

                         VOLUMNIA
          0, sir, sir, sir,
          I would have had you put your power well
          on,
          Before you had worn it out.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Let go!

                         VOLUMNIA
          You might have been enough the man you
          are,
          With striving less to be so!

                         CORIOLANUS
          Let them hang!

                         VOLUMNIA
          Av, and burn too!
          Her outraged fury matches his. Overpowers his.

                         MENENIUS

                         (TO CORIOLANUS)
          Come, come, you have been too rough,
          something too rough.
          You must return and mend it.
          Coriolanus turns away.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Pray, be counseled.
          I have a heart as little apt as yours,
          But yet a brain that leads my use of

                         ANGER
          To better vantage.

                         MENENIUS
          Well said, noble woman!

                         CORIOLANUS
          What must I do?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         MENENIUS
          Return to the Tribunes.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Well, what then? What then?

                         MENENIUS
          Repent what you have spoke.

                         CORIOLANUS
          For them? I cannot do it to the gods.
          Must I then do it to them?

                         VOLUMNIA
          You are too absolute,
          Though therein you can never be too
          noble.

                         CORIOLANUS
          (upset, walking away)
          Why force you this?
          She pursues him:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Because that now it lies you on to speak
          To the people, not by your own
          instruction,
          Nor by the matter which your heart
          prompts you,
          But with such words that are but

                         REHEARSED IN
          Your tongue, though but bastards and

                         SYLLABLES
          Of no allowance to your bosom's truth...
          She moves closer to him. Her voice lower. A sort of
          seduction.

                         VOLUMNIA
          I would dissemble with my nature where
          My fortunes and my friends at stake

                         REQUIRED
          I should do so in honor...
          She is very close now. Whispering. She touches him gently,
          like a lover.

                         VOLUMNIA
          I am in this your wife, your son,
          These senators, the nobles
          And you.
          A long beat. All are silent, watching her spin her web.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         VOLUMNIA
          I prithee now, my son,
          Go and say to them
          Thou art their soldier, and being bred in

                         BROILS
          Has not the soft way
          In asking their good loves; but thou wilt

                         FRAME
          Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs.

                         MENENIUS
          This but done, even as she speaks,
          Why their hearts were yours.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Prithee now,
          Go, and be ruled...
          (laughing to him)
          Although I know thou hadst rather
          Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
          Than flatter him in a bower.
          Coriolanus smiles. A genuinely sweet moment between them.
          Cominius enters with several other political supporters.

                         COMINIUS
          Sir, it is fit
          You make strong party, or defend yourself
          By calmness or by absence. All's in
          anger.

                         MENENIUS
          Only fair speech.

                         COMINIUS
          I think it will serve, if he
          Can thereto frame his spirit.

                         VOLUMNIA
          He must -- and will.

                         (TO CORIOLANUS)
          Prithee now, say you will, and go about
          it.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         MUST I
          With base tongue give my noble heart
          A lie that it must bear? . Well, I will
          do it.
          But he is still agitated. Volumnia shares a concerned glance
          with Menenius.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (BITTERLY)
          Away, my disposition, and possess me
          Some harlot's spirit. A beggar's tongue
          Make motion through my lips, and my armed
          knees,
          Who bowed but in my stirrup, bend like

                         HIS
          That hath charity received!
          The thought of begging is too much, he rejects it, breaking

                         AWAY:

                         CORIOLANUS
          I will not do it!
          Lest I cease to honor mine own truth
          And by my body's action teach my mind
          A most inherent baseness.
          Volumnia snarls at him, exasperated, building to a thunder
          that dwarfs his:

                         VOLUMNIA
          At thy choice, then!
          To beg of thee, it is my more dishonor
          Than thou of them. Come all to ruin! Let
          Thy mother rather feel thy pride than

                         FEAR
          Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at

                         DEATH
          With as biq heart as thou! Do as you
          like!
          The words echo.
          It is as if he has been slapped. His resolve vanishes.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Pray, be content...
          Mother, I am going, chide me no more.
          He awaits her approval.
          She will not yet grant it.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Look, I am going...
          Commend me to my wife. I'll return
          Consul,
          Or never trust to what my tongue can do
          In the way of flattery further.
          She graciously bows to him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Do your will.
          Then she kisses him.
          And she goes.
          Like a queen. Volumnia triumphant. Always.
          Then a shocking hard cut to:

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

          A crowded TV studio. The audience stands are filling up.
          Television cameras. Lights. Heavy security.
          On the stage: the set for a chat show. Translight of a city
          skyline behind the set. Two standing microphones.
          At the side of the set, Sicinius and Brutus are conspiring
          with the two citizen activists, Cassius and Tamora:

                         BRUTUS

                         (TO SICINIUS)
          In this point charge him home: that he

                         AFFECTS
          Tyrannical power. If he evade us there,
          Enforce him with his envy to the people.

                         SICINIUS

                         (TO TAMORA)
          Have you a catalogue
          Of all the voices that we have procured
          Set down by the poll?

                         TAMORA
          I have; it's ready.

                         SICINIUS
          When the people hear me say "It shall be

                         SO
          In the right and strength of the
          Commons," be it either
          For death, for fine, or banishment, then
          let them,
          If I say "Fine," cry "Fine!" - if
          "Death," cry "Death!"

                         TAMORA
          We shall inform them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         61
          Cassius and Tamora hurry off to instruct and manipulate the
          crowd as best they can. They mix with the audience in the
          stands.

                         MEANWHILE--
          A gloomy but resolved Coriolanus walks with Cominius and
          Menenius between the tiers of audience, on the way to the
          set.

                         COMINIUS

                         ARM YOURSELF
          To answer mildly, for they are prepared
          With accusations, as I hear, more strong
          Than are upon you yet.

                         CORIOLANUS
          The word is "mildly." Pray you, let us
          go.
          Let them accuse me by invention, I
          Will answer in mine honor.

                         MENENIUS
          Ay, but mildly.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
          Coriolanus steels himself as they emerge from between the
          stands and head toward the set.
          TV news crews are waiting. Blinding lights snap on.
          The crowd, on seeing Coriolanus, lets out a ROAR. Deafening
          and savage.
          We see Cassius and Tamora moving through the crowd,
          instigating, convincing, imploring.
          Coriolanus ignores it all. Imperious to the end.
          Brutus and Sicinius wait on the set.

                         BRUTUS
          (whispers to Sicinius)
          Put him to choler straight.
          Coriolanus and his supporters move to the stage. Coriolanus
          glares at the Tribunes. The TV crews take up position.
          Menenius gestures for Coriolanus to step to the microphone,
          whispering to him:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         MENENIUS
          Calmly, I do beseech you.
          Coriolanus steps to the microphone.
          Brutus gestures for the crowd to quiet down.
          We see bits of this scene through the monitors on the TV
          cameras.
          When the crowd is silent, Coriolanus begins to make a

                         REHEARSED SPEECH:

                         CORIOLANUS
          The honored gods--
          But his voice echoes badly with reverb. Menenius adjusts the
          microphone. Coriolanus begins again, quickly and by rote:

                         CORIOLANUS
          The honored gods
          Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of

                         JUSTICE
          Supplied with worthy men. Plant love
          among us.
          Throng our large temples with the shows
          of peace,
          And not our streets with war.

                         COMINIUS
          Amen, amen.

                         MENENIUS
          A noble wish.
          His boilerplate speech over, Coriolanus turns to Sicinius who
          is at the other standing microphone:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Shall I be charged no further than this
          present?
          Must all determine here?

                         SICINIUS
          I do demand,
          If you submit you to the people's voices.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I am content.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Volumnia watches the proceedings closely on TV. She is
          pleased with her son's performance so far.

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

          Menenius, ever the People's Friend, steps to the microphone:

                         MENENIUS
          Lo, citizens, he says he is content.
          The warlike service he has done,

                         CONSIDER; THINK
          Upon the wounds his body bears, which

                         SHOW
          Like graves in the holy churchyard.

                         CORIOLANUS
          (uncomfortable with this)
          Scratches with briers,
          Scars to move laughter only.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Aufidius sits with several of his officers, leaning forward,
          watching the drama unfold on TV.

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY


                         MENENIUS
          Consider further,
          That when he speaks not like a citizen,
          You find him like a soldier. Do not take
          His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
          But, as I say, such as become a soldier.
          Coriolanus cuts in, his impatience getting the better of him:

                         CORIOLANUS
          What is the matter
          That being passed for Consul with full
          voice,
          I am so dishonored that the very hour
          You take it off again?

                         SICINIUS
          We charge you that you have contrived to

                         TAKE
          From Rome all seasoned office, and to

                         WIND
          Yourself into a power tyrannical

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         SICINIUS (CONT'D)
          (the coup de grace)
          For which you are a traitor to the
          people.
          Coriolanus responds, a cobra striking:

                         CORIOLANUS
          How? Traitor?!

                         MENENIUS

                         (ALARMED)
          Nay, temperately! Your promise.

                         CORIOLANUS
          The fires in the lowest hell fold in the
          people!
          Call me their traitor, thou injurious
          Tribune!

                         SICINIUS

                         (CALLING)
          Mark you this, people?!
          The crowd responds, egged on by Cassius and Tamora. A murmur
          of voices, a chant growing, "Traitor traitor
          traitor..."
          Brutus cleverly plays the reasonable voice, knowing his words
          will further rile Coriolanus:

                         BRUTUS
          But since he hath
          Served well for Rome--

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (SNAPS)
          What do you prate of service?

                         BRUTUS
          I talk of that, that know it.

                         CORIOLANUS
          You?!
          I'll know no further.
          Let them pronounce death, exile,
          Flaying, pent to linger
          But with a grain a day - I would not buy
          Their mercy at the price of one fair
          word!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Volumnia watches, alarmed now. She knows this rage will prove
          to be disastrous for her son.

          INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

          Sicinius seizes the moment to destroy Coriolanus, barking
          into the microphone:

                         SICINIUS
          In the name of the people
          And in the power of us the Tribunes, we,
          Even from this instant, banish him our
          city!
          In the people's name,
          I say IT SHALL BE SO!
          Well-rehearsed by Cassius and Tamora, many in the crowd
          respond with a fierce cry:

                         CROWD
          It shall be so! It shall be so! Let him
          away!

                         TAMORA
          He's banished! IT SHALL BE SO!

                         CROWD
          It shall be so! It shall be so! It shall
          be so...!
          Cassius and Tamora keep the crowd at a fever pitch--
          They keep chanting and railing--
          A building seismic rumble--

                         COMINIUS

                         (STEPPING FORWARD)
          Hear me, my masters, and my common
          friends--!

                         SICINIUS
          He's sentenced. No more hearing.

                         COMINIUS
          Let me speak!
          The crowd's fury is building--
          It is all about to erupt--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         BRUTUS
          There's no more to be said, but he is

                         BANISHED
          As enemy to the people and his country.

          IT SHALL BE SO!

                         CROWD
          It shall be so! It shall be so! It shall
          be so...!

                         AND THEN--

                         CORIOLANUS EXPLODES--
          His rage is volcanic--
          He SLAMS the standing microphone away--
          His dragon's ROAR silences the entire studio--

                         CORIOLANUS

          YOU COMMON CRY OF CURS!
          A collective intake of breath--
          The crowd is stunned--

                         CORIOLANUS
          Whose breath I hate
          As reek of the rotten fens, whose loves I

                         PRIZE
          As the dead carcasses of unburied men
          That do corrupt my air...
          (each word an attack)

          I BANISH YOU!
          The crowd is silent. No one dares to even breathe.
          AT THE VILLA: Volumnia watches, frozen, breathless.
          IN THE APARTMENT: Aufidius stands, riveted.

          BACK IN THE STUDIO:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Here remain with your uncertainty.
          Let every feeble rumor shake your hearts!
          Your enemies, with nodding of their
          plumes,
          Fan you into despair! Have the power

                         STILL
          To banish your defenders, till at length
          Your ignorance - which finds not till it
          feels,

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         CORIOLANUS (CANT'D)
          Making but reservation of yourselves;
          Still your own foes - deliver you
          As most abated captives to some nation
          That won you without blows!
          A beat.
          The TV cameras hum. The crowd is silent.
          Menenius and the others watch in amazement.
          Coriolanus slowly takes one last, long look at the people of
          Rome.

                         THEN:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Despising,
          For you, the city, thus I turn my back.
          He turns and slowly walks toward one of the tunnels leading
          from the studio.
          The crowd follows every step with their eyes.
          He stops.
          Turns back.
          Steel.

                         CORIOLANUS
          There is a world elsewhere.
          And he goes down the tunnel.
          Disappearing from view.
          A silent beat.
          Then, a chilling cry of absolutely Jacobin bloodlust from the

                         STANDS:

                         TAMORA
          The people's enemy is gone!
          The crowd SCREAMS their approval.
          The SAVAGE CRY echoes around the studio.
          The echoing roar takes us to...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

          EXT. WASTELAND CHECKPOINT - DAWN

          The outskirts of Rome are an urban wasteland. Abandoned
          factories. Rusting cars. Overgrown vacant lots. Collapsing
          advertising billboards.
          There is a lonely gas station in the distance, its neon sign
          glowing a lurid green in the gray dawn light.
          We are at a Roman checkpoint on the highway into the city. A
          guardhouse and barrier. Some barbed wire barricades. Bored
          soldiers.
          Several cars pull up to the checkpoint. Two Roman security
          SUVs. Menenius' familiar limousine. And Volumnia's enormous
          Bentley.
          Security Guards climb out of their vehicle, light cigarettes
          and chat with the soldiers manning the checkpoint. Menenius,
          Titus and Cominius climb from Menenius' limousine.

          INT. VOLUMNIA'S BENTLEY - DAWN

          Meanwhile, inside the Bentley, Coriolanus is comforting his
          wife and mother:

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (TO VIRGILIA)
          Come, leave your tears. A brief farewell.

                         THE BEAST
          With many heads butts me away.

                         VIRGILIA

                         0 HEAVENS 0 HEAVENS
          Volumnia has tears in her eyes as well. Coriolanus is
          surprisingly unsentimental and tough with her:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Nay, mother,
          Where is your ancient courage?

                         VOLUMNIA
          Now the red pestilence strike all trades
          in Rome,
          And occupations perish!

                         CORIOLANUS
          Nay, mother, I shall be loved when I am
          lacked.
          She nods to him, she has regained her composure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Only then do they climb from the car.

          EXT. WASTELAND CHECKPOINT - DAWN

          Coriolanus takes his leave:

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (EMBRACING TITUS)
          Bid me farewell.

                         TITUS
          Farewell, Martius.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (EMBRACING COMINIUS)
          Cominius, droop not, adieu.
          I'll do well yet.
          He goes to Menenius, who is genuinely distraught. For all his
          political machinations, he truly cares for Coriolanus.
          Coriolanus is moved to see Menenius so emotional.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Thou old and true Menenius,
          Thy tears are salter than a younger
          man's,
          And venomous to thine eyes.

                         MENENIUS

                         (DEEPLY)
          If I could shake off but seven years
          I'd go with thee every foot.
          They embrace.
          Then Coriolanus knows it is time to go. He picks up a
          traveling bag and slings it over his shoulder.
          Looks back at his friends and family.
          A beat.
          A certain darkness creeps into his expression. An ominous
          resolve.

                         CORIOLANUS
          You shall hear from me still.
          He turns and looks to the distance.
          Miles and miles of wasteland and desolation.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.
          His future.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I go alone,
          Like to a lonely dragon.
          He strides off.
          The soldiers manning the checkpoint raise the barrier.
          Coriolanus walks under it. And begins walking down the long
          highway away from Rome.
          The only sound is the cold, lonely moan of the wind.
          We fade to...

          EXT./INT. EXILE SEQUENCE - DAY/NIGHT

          Coriolanus' exile.
          We see his long odyssey. It is a grueling physical journey --
          and also something of a spiritual challenge. He is solitary
          and without comfort: vulnerable to the elements and also to
          the demons of his own psyche.
          We see him as...
          He walks along the barren highway. Trash piled along the
          road. A car zooms past. Whoosh. He is lost in dust...
          Blazing heat, like a furnace, as he trudges over desert
          terrain. Burning oil wells blacken the sky in the distance...
          Isolated, within himself, as he walks past the detritus of
          war a burned out tank a mountain of rusted artillery
          shells skeletons bleached in the sun...
          His clothes are dusty and dirty now. A sandstorm. He wraps a
          scarf around his head, like a burnoose. Only his eyes visible
          now...
          A gypsy boy in tattered clothing riding a white horse passes
          him. The boy looks at him intently as he passes...
          We get a sense of him moving into different terrain, up into
          a mountain range, climbing...
          Then descending. Pouring rain. Lightning sparking. He is
          almost a Romantic figure now. Byronic. Wrapped in a cloak
          against the wildness of nature; the chiaroscuro flashes of
          light illuminating his haunted eyes...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          We end at...

          EXT. OUTSIDE ANTIUM - NIGHT

          Coriolanus stands. Like a statue. All his life in his blazing
          eyes. He is staring at a small town in the distance.
          We see a sign: ANTIUM.
          His destination since he began. The home of his nemesis, the
          hated Aufidius.
          He begins to walk to the town.

          INT. POLITICO BAR - DAY

          Meanwhile, back in Rome, Brutus and Sicinius are having lunch
          at their usual hangout.
          They see Volumnia entering the restaurant, pulling Virgilia
          after her. An ambush. She heads toward the Tribunes.
          Volumnia's eyes have the grim intensity of a predator. She
          looks strangely wild.

                         BRUTUS
          Here comes his mother.

                         SICINIUS
          (prepares to go)
          Let's not meet her. They say she's mad.
          Volumnia stalks up to them:

                         VOLUMNIA
          0, you're well met. The hoarded plague of

                         THE GODS
          Requite your love!
          The Tribunes try to leave, she won't let them:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Will you be gone?

                         VIRGILIA
          You shall stay too. I would I had the

                         POWER
          To say so to my husband.

                         SICINIUS
          Are you mad?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Ay, fool, is that a shame? Note but this,

                         FOOL:
          Hadst thou craft
          To banish him that struck more blows for

                         ROME
          Than thou hast spoken words?

                         SICINIUS
          (trying to escape)
          0 blessed heavens...
          Volumnia is creating a scene. Heads are turning.
          She continues her attack on Sicinius, but is distracted and

                         JUMBLED:

                         VOLUMNIA
          More noble blows than ever thou wise
          words,
          And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what -

                         YET GO--
          Nay -- but thou shalt stay too -- I would

                         MY SON
          Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
          His good sword in his hand.

                         SICINIUS
          What then?

                         VIRGILIA
          What then?
          He'd make an end of thy posterity.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Bastards and all.
          Menenius has entered the bar, seeing the trouble he goes to
          them, tries to calm Volumnia:

                         MENENIUS
          Come, come, peace...

                         BRUTUS
          Pray, let us go.
          He tries to leave the bar. Volumnia stops him for final
          attack, something like a curse in its power:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Now, pray, sir, get you gone.
          You have done a brave deed. Ere you go,

                         HEAR THIS:

                         (GRABS VIRGILIA)

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)
          This lady's husband here, this, do you
          see?!--
          Whom you have banished, does exceed you
          all.

                         BRUTUS
          Well, well, we'll leave you.

                         SICINIUS
          Why stay we to be baited
          With one that wants her wits?

                         VOLUMNIA
          I would the gods had nothing else to do
          But to confirm my curses!
          Menenius gently restrains Volumnia and the Tribunes finally
          escape the bar.
          Volumnia takes a breath, controls herself.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Could I meet 'em
          But once a day, it would unclog my heart
          Of what lies heavy to it.

                         MENENIUS
          You have told them home;
          And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll
          sup with me?
          She turns to him. A cold and killing fire in her eyes.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Anger's my meat. I sup upon myself,
          And so shall starve with feeding.
          She takes Virgilia's hand and drags her out.
          Menenius watches. Saddened.
          Once proud Volumnia, reduced to this.

          EXT. ANTIUM - NIGHT

          Antium is an old Volscian city gone to seed. It is Latin in
          flavor, something like Havana.
          There is life to the place, a certain humid vitality. Someone
          is singing in a bar. Old men are playing dominos on a patio.
          Flickering TV and radio babel from terraced apartment
          buildings.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          Coriolanus, his face still shrouded in the burnoose, like a
          Hamas soldier, moves through the streets.
          He takes in the life of the town as he walks. Studying the
          faces of the Volscians around him.
          Coriolanus sees a heavily-guarded apartment building at the
          end of the street. Jeeps and SOLDIERS.
          Coriolanus approaches with stealth, moving in and out of
          shadows along the street, ducking into doorways and alleys,
          taking advantage of the darkness.
          He stops. Steps into the shadows. For he sees...
          Aufidius.
          Walking with a few of his officers.
          Aufidius is beloved in Antium. He has an easy manner with the
          people. He stops and chats. Laughs with them. He dances for a
          moment with a little girl.
          Coriolanus watches from the shadows, his expression complex.
          There is real envy . Aufidius has such a comfortable way
          with the common people, he's natural, unaffected.
          Aufidius jokes with the little girl's parents for a moment
          and then moves on.
          Coriolanus watches Aufidius and his men go into an apartment
          building.
          He scans the building with the eye of a Special Forces
          soldier. He sees that the soldiers guarding the building are
          bored, it is perfunctory work.
          Two YOUNG WOMEN, perhaps hookers, move past the front of the
          building, flirting with the soldiers. The soldiers call and
          whistle to them, delighted.
          Coriolanus uses this distraction to slip into the shadows
          behind the soldiers and sneak into the building...

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-CORRIDOR - NIGHT

          Coriolanus moves again with stealth, heading toward what is
          clearly the center of the action: a noisy room on the second
          floor.
          The doorway is guarded by two serious GUARDS. These are not
          the bored soldiers out front, these are grim and intense
          warriors.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.
          Coriolanus considers his course.
          Decides. Takes a breath. Focuses.
          He is like ice now.

                         HE MOVES--
          A steady stride--
          He walks right up to the Guards--
          Before they can even respond--
          He punches one HARD in the throat -- the Guard recoils,
          gasping for air--
          Simultaneously, Coriolanus SLAMS his other hand violently
          over the entire face of the second Guard -- grabbing his face
          firmly and SHOVING him back into the door--
          So hard that the door slams aside--
          And Coriolanus shoves the Guard into--

          INT. AUFIDIUS' CHAMBER - NIGHT

          Aufidius is having dinner with some of his men, their wives
          and some children--
           The soldiers bolt up, upsetting the table, smashing dishes --
          pulling guns -- alarmed--
          As Coriolanus powers in, still holding the second Guard by

                         THE FACE--
          He flings the Guard aside--
          Aufidius and his men, all pointing weapons at Coriolanus, are
          stunned.
          A long beat.
          Coriolanus' face is still masked by the burnoose. Only his
          cold eyes are visible.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Whence comes thou? What wouldst thou? Thy
          name?
          Coriolanus does not respond.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          Aufidius is growing uneasy. His men are tense, ready to open
          fire at any second.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Speak, man! What's thy name?

                         CORIOLANUS
          A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
          And harsh in sound to thine.
          The other Guard from outside, and several other soldiers,
          rush in. Weapons drawn, surrounding Coriolanus.
          He doesn't move a muscle.
          Aufidius, intrigued by the stranger's courage, waves his men
          off.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Say, what's thy name?
          Thou has a grim appearance .What's thy
          name?

                         CORIOLANUS
          Know'st thou me yet?

                         AUFIDIUS
          I know thee not Thy name?
          Finally, Coriolanus removes his burnoose. His face is
          exposed. The Volscians are stunned.

                         CORIOLANUS
          My name is Caius Martius, who hath done
          To thee particularly and to all the

                         VOLSCES
          Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness

                         MAY
          My surname Coriolanus.
          The Volscians look to Aufidius, very nervous, unsure how to
          proceed. Aufidius just stares back at Coriolanus, staggered.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Only that name remains.
          Aufidius doesn't understand. Coriolanus explains:

                         CORIOLANUS
          The cruelty and envy of the people,
          Who have all forsook me, hath devoured
          the rest,
          And suffered me by the voice of slaves to

                         BE

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         CORIOLANUS (CANT'D)
          Whooped out of Rome. Now this extremity
          Hath brought me to thy hearth, not out of

                         HOPE -
          Mistake me not - to save my life; for if
          I had feared death, of all the men in the

                         WORLD
          I would have avoided thee, but in mere
          spite,
          To be full quit of those my banishers,
          Stand I before thee here.
          Coriolanus dares to take a step toward Aufidius--
          The Volscians react. Guns are raised, fingers tight on
          triggers, an instant from opening fire--
          Coriolanus carefully holds out his arms. He's unarmed.
          Aufidius nods to his men. They hold their fire.
          Coriolanus slowly crosses the room toward Aufidius. Step by
          step. Their eyes are locked. Nothing else in the world
          exists.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I will fight
          Against my cankered country with the

                         SPLEEN
          Of all the under fiends. But if thou
          Dares not this, then I present
          My throat to thee and to thy ancient
          malice...
          Coriolanus stops right in front of Aufidius and slowly,
          carefully, undoes his collar. Exposing his naked throat.
          Bending back his head.
          Ready for execution.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Which not to cut would show thee but
          a fool,
          Since I have ever followed thee with
          hate,
          And cannot live but to thy shame unless
          It be to do thee service.
          A long beat.
          Aufidius stares at Coriolanus.
          The Volscians watch, eyes wide, too tense to do anything now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.
          Aufidius just continues to stare at Coriolanus.
          Eyes locked.
          Coriolanus blinks some sweat from his eyes. This tiny, human
          response sparks something in Aufidius.

                         AUFIDIUS
          O Martius Martius
          Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded
          from my heart
          A root of ancient envy.
          He offers his hand.
          Coriolanus takes it. Aufidius continues to hold him by the
          hand, rather intensely, speaking low:

                         AUFIDIUS
          Let me twine
          Mine arms about that body.
          He embraces Coriolanus.
          Aufidius' men finally relax. Weapons are lowered. Relieved
          glances exchanged.
          Some of the Volscians, though, are clearly suspicious of
          Coriolanus. They watch Aufidius and Coriolanus, concerned.
          Aufidius still can't quite believe his ancient enemy is now
          his newest ally.

                         AUFIDIUS

                         KNOW THOU
          I loved the maid I married; never man
          Sighed truer breath. But that I see thee
          here,
          Thou noble thing, more dances my rapt

                         HEART
          Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
          Bestride my threshold.
          Coriolanus glances to him, perhaps a little disturbed or
          embarrassed by the intensity of Aufidius' words.
          Aufidius steps away from him, gestures for Coriolanus to sit.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Why, thou Mars, I tell thee,
          We have a power on foot, and I had

                         PURPOSE
          Once more to hew thy target from thy
          brawn,

          79.

                         AUFIDIUS (CONT'D)
          Or lose mine arm for it. Thou hast beat

                         ME OUT
          Twelve several times, and I have nightly

                         SINCE
          Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and
          me.
          Aufidius continues quietly, almost whispering:

                         AUFIDIUS
          Worthy Martius,
          Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
          Thou art thence banished, we would muster

                         ALL
          From twelve to seventy, and, pouring war
          Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
          Like a bold flood, overbear it.

          INT. SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

          Coriolanus sits, naked. He has finally washed off the layers
          of dirt from his journey.
          An old woman is using an electric razor to shave his head.
          Aufidius is standing in the doorway to the room. Watching.
          His eyes move over Coriolanus' body, adding up the scars and
          wounds.
          A pause.
          Then Aufidius goes to the old woman. Takes the razor from
          her. She goes.
          Aufidius continues to shave Coriolanus' head himself.
          It is a deeply personal act, even intimate Yet Aufidius
          employs the same methodical rhythms as when he was sharpening
          his knife at the opening of the story.

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING-WAR ROOM - NIGHT

          The Volscian military command center. Maps, recon photos and
          radio equipment. Stacks of grenade launchers and arms.
          Aufidius' CAPTAINS and AIDES wait alongside some bedraggled
          Volsce POLITICIANS in ill-fitting suits.
          Aufidius ushers Coriolanus in:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         AUFIDIUS
          0, come, go in,
          And take our friendly senators by the
          hands.
          Coriolanus shakes hands with the politicians:

                         CORIOLANUS
          You bless me, gods.
          Then Aufidius takes him to a huge military map laid out on a
          pool table. Rome and her territories. Strategic markers
          denote Roman forces and Volscian forces.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou

                         WILT HAVE
          The leading of thine own revenges, take
          The one half of my commission.
          The Volscian soldiers and politicos are shocked. Aufidius is
          giving Coriolanus command of half his forces!

                         AUFIDIUS
          And set down---
          As best thou art experienced, since thou

                         KNOWS
          Thy country's strength and weakness---
          thine own ways,
          Whether to knock against the gates of
          Rome,
          Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
          To fright them ere destroy.
          Aufidius looks at Coriolanus hard. There it is. The gauntlet
          is thrown down. Coriolanus will have to completely betray
          Rome: expose her military weaknesses, tell her secrets.
          For all his neurotic intensity, Aufidius is a shrewd man.
          Coriolanus nods and turns to the battle map, moving various
          markers around to show Rome's defensive positions.
          Aufidius watches him with Machiavellian calm.

          INT. POLITICO BAR - DAY

          Several weeks later, back in Rome, politics go on as usual.
          Menenius is passing the Tribunes' table. They josh with him:

                         BRUTUS
          Is this Menenius?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         81

                         SICINIUS
          'Tis he,'tis he! 0, he is grown most kind
          of late. Hail sir!

                         MENENIUS
          Hail to you both.

                         SICINIUS

                         YOUR CORIOLANUS
          Is not much missed, but with his friends.

                         MENENIUS
          All's well, and might have been much

                         BETTER IF
          He could have temporized.

                         SICINIUS
          Where is he, hear you?

                         MENENIUS
          Nay, I hear nothing. His mother and his

                         WIFE
          Hear nothing from him.

                         BRUTUS
          Caius Martius was
          A worthy officer in the war, but
          insolent,
          Overcome with pride, ambitious past all
          thinking,

                         SELF-LOVING--

                         MENENIUS
          I think not so.

                         SICINIUS
          And Rome sits safe and still without him.
          They are distracted when people begin talking loudly,
          alarmed, at the bar. They hush each other and watch the TV
          over the bar. Something has happened.
          On the TV: a SPECIAL REPORT. Breaking News. A scroll across
          the bottom of the screen reads "The Volscians On The March?"

                         TV ANCHORMAN

                         (ON TV)
          Reports the Volsces with two several

                         POWERS
          Are entered in the Roman territories,
          And with the deepest malice of the war
          Destroy what lies before them...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.
          The whole bar is growing quiet now. All watching the TV,
          which shows grainy indistinct images -- like cell phone
          pictures -- of troops and tanks.

                         MENENIUS
          'Tis Aufidius,
          Who, hearing of our Martius' banishment,
          Thrusts forth his horns again into the
          world.

                         SICINIUS

                         (NERVOUS)
          Come, what talk you of Martius?

                         BRUTUS
          It cannot be the Volsces dare break with
          us.

                         TV ANCHORMAN

                         (ON TV)
          The nobles in great earnestness are going
          All to the Senate House. Some news is

                         COMING
          That turns their countenances...
          (he listens to his ear
          piece for a second)
          Yes, the first report is seconded, and
          more,
          More fearful, is delivered.
          The TV picture switches to a flustered TV REPORTER outside
          the Senate. A lot of nervous activity behind him.

                         TV REPORTER

                         (ON TV)
          It is spoke freely out of many mouths -
          How probable I do not know - that Martius
          Has ioined with Aufidius--
          There is an audible gasp in the bar -- quickly silenced and
          hushed so all can hear the TV:

                         (ON TV)
          --He leads a power against Rome,
          And vows revenge as spacious as between
          The youngest and oldest thing.
          Something close to terror on the faces of the politicos.
          Menenius, without a word, goes.
          He does not want to believe this is possible.

          INT. VILLA -- BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Virgilia lies on her bed.
          On the TV an imbedded WAR CORRESPONDENT is giving an update,
          intercut with shaky and unclear images of the Volscian army
          on the move:

                         (ON TV)
          A fearful army, led by Caius Martius
          Associated with Aufidius, rages
          Upon our territories, and have already
          Overborne their way, consumed with fire,

                         AND TOOK
          What lay before them.

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Volumnia sits, almost frozen, smoking, watching the TV. Her
          emotions are deep and dark.
          Her son, to her the model of all Roman virtues, has betrayed
          his country.

          TV WAR CORRESPONDENT

                         (ON TV)
          Martius has joined with the Volscians -
          He is their god. He leads them like
          Boys pursuing summer butterflies
          Or butchers killing flies.
          Close up on Volumnia's face.
          She gives away practically nothing.
          She takes a slow drag on her cigarette.

          EXT. VOLSCIAN CAMP - DAY

          Urban industrial wasteland. Old factories and abandoned
          warehouses. Broken asphalt. Smashed windows.
          The Volscians have set up camp here. On the decaying fringes
          of the city. We see military hardware. Guns. Missile
          launchers. Armored vehicles.
          Soldiers are cleaning weapons, cooking meals, sleeping,
          playing video games.
          Then...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          An incongruous sight...
          An old barber chair floats past. Moving across the blue sky.
          Carried overhead by a group of Volscian soldiers.
          But there is something different about these Volscian
          soldiers. They have altered their uniforms into something
          pagan and primitive. All have shaved heads. Many have face
          tattoos or wear striking war paint.
          It is like something from LORD OF THE FLIES.
          They set the barber chair down outside an abandoned factory.
          This shattered and abandoned factory is Coriolanus' domain.
          It is decorated with human skulls.
          The CAMP BARBER, a fat man in a greasy butcher's apron,
          begins to strop his razor.
          Hard core young soldiers line up to have their heads shaved.
          They are Coriolanus' ACOLYTES.
          There is no sign of Coriolanus himself.
          Aufidius and his LIEUTENANT stand on the fringes, disturbed
          by the strange cult of personality that has grown up around
          Coriolanus.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Do they still fly to Coriolanus?

                         LIEUTENANT
          I do not know what witchcraft's in him,

                         BUT
          Your soldiers use him as the grace before
          meat,
          Their talk at table, and their thanks at
          end.
          And you are darkened in this action, sir.

                         AUFIDIUS
          He bears himself more proud,
          Even to my person, than I thought he

                         WOULD
          When first I did embrace him.
          They turn and walk to the building where Aufidius is

                         QUARTERED:

                         LIEUTENANT
          Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry
          Rome?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         AUFIDIUS

                         (GRIM)
          I think he'll be to Rome
          As is the osprey to the fish, who takes

                         IT
          By sovereignty of nature.
          Aufidius nods to the guards outside his quarters and enters
          with his Lieutenant...

          INT. VOLSCIAN CAMP-AUFIDIUS' QUARTERS - DAY

          A shattered building. Old graffiti on the walls. Weapons.
          Maps. Aufidius' gear.
          Aufidius sits on his cot, deep in thought.
          He pulls a folded bit of paper from his pocket. Carefully and
          lovingly unfolds it. He has been carrying this paper for
          months.
          We realize it is the glossy magazine cover with the picture
          of Coriolanus that Aufidius tore out earlier.
          He gazes at the picture, his fingers smoothing the paper,
          tracing the contours of Coriolanus' face...

                         AUFIDIUS
          Whether t'was pride,
          Whether defect of judgement,
          Or whether nature,
          Not to be other than one thing,
          Made him feared,
          So hated, and so banished.
          A beat as he studies the picture.
          His lieutenant watches him closely, disturbed by Aufidius'
          obsession with Coriolanus.

                         AUFIDIUS
          So our virtues
          Lie in the interpretation of the time.
          He brings the picture closer, whispering now:

                         AUFIDIUS
          One fire drives out one fire; one nail,

                         ONE NAIL;
          Rights by rights founder, strengths by
          strengths do fail
          And when, Caius, Rome is thine,

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         AUFIDIUS (CONT'D)
          Thou art poorest of all -- then shortly
          art thou mine.

          INT. ROMAN WAR ROOM - DAY

          Rome is at war now, so the room is busy and tense. Maps and
          video footage chart the enemy's progress. Soldiers confer
          urgently outside the door.
          Menenius stands with the two Tribunes, Brutus and Sicinius.
          With them are several SENATORS and GENERALS.
          Menenius snaps angrily:

                         MENENIUS
          No, I'll not go!

                         SICINIUS

                         (IMPLORING)

                         GOOD MENENIUS--

                         MENENIUS
          Go, you that banished him!
          A mile before his tent fall down, and

                         KNEE
          The way into his mercy.
          They stop when Titus enters with General Cominius.
          Titus is dusty, has just come from somewhere. He is pale.
          Truly shaken.
          Menenius and the others crowd around him, waiting for his
          report.
          Titus sits, takes a moment to pull himself together, and then
          reports with the grim severity of a death sentence:

                         TITUS
          He would not seem to know me.
          A beat.

                         TITUS
          I urged our old acquaintance, and the

                         DROPS
          That we have bled together. "Coriolanus"
          He would not answer to, forbade all
          names...
          A long beat. They wait for him to go on.
          Titus searches for the words to continue.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         TITUS
          He was a kind of nothing.
          (a difficult beat)
          Titleless...
          Till he had forged himself a name in the

                         FIRE
          Of burning Rome.
          He has no more to say, his head drops.
          Menenius begins to leave the room. The Tribunes stop him,
          leading him to a secluded corner:

                         SICINIUS
          If you refuse your aid

                         IN THIS--

                         BRUTUS

                         IF YOU
          Would be your country's pleader, your
          good tongue,
          More than the instant army we can make,
          Might stop our countryman.

                         MENENIUS
          No, I'll not meddle.

                         SICINIUS
          Pray you, go to him.

                         MENENIUS
          What should I do?
          Brutus stops him, with real emotion:

                         BRUTUS
          Only make trial what your love can do
          For Rome towards Martius.

                         MENENIUS
          Well, and say that Martius
          Return me, as Titus is returned,
          Unheard - what then?

                         SICINIUS
          Yet your good will
          Must have that thanks from Rome.
          Menenius thinks about it.

                         BRUTUS
          You know the very road into his kindness,
          And cannot lose your way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          Menenius, despite all still a patriot at heart, decides.

                         MENENIUS
          I'll undertake it
          I think he'll hear me.
          The Tribunes are relieved. Cominius nods and escorts Menenius
          out.
          Brutus and Sicinius return to Titus.

                         TITUS
          He'll never hear him.

                         SICINIUS
          No?

                         TITUS
          I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
          Red as it would burn Rome.

          EXT. CHECKPOINT-HIGHWAY - DAY

          The Roman checkpoint on the desolate highway. A formidable
          military presence here now: soldiers, heavy weapons, tanks.
          Volscian troops and a jeep can be seen down the highway.
          We see Menenius' limousine pull up.
          He and General Cominius climb out. Menenius is out of place
          in his trim business suit: a politician among soldiers.
          Menenius steels himself then passes through the Roman
          checkpoint.
          He walks down the highway toward the distant Volscian troops.

          EXT. VOLSCIAN CAMP - DAY

          Menenius is blindfolded, roughly pulled by two Volscian
          soldiers.
          We hear some of the soldiers hooting at him. We stay close on
          Menenius' blindfolded face, sharing his feeling of
          disorientation and suspense.
          The Volscians drag him into the abandoned factory--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

          INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY

          Finally his guards stop him and pull off his blindfold--

                         REVEALING-
          Coriolanus. Transformed.
          And terrifying.
          He is no longer Roman. He is not Volscian. He is, as Titus
          said, "a kind of nothing."
          He sits in the barber chair. His head is completely shaved.
          His face is marked with martial face painting. These striking
          totemic markings also cover his scarred body.
          He is primitive. Inhuman. Like a dragon.
          The Angel of Death.
          His young warrior Acolytes -- similarly shaved and painted --
          are gathered around him; his personal bodyguard and cult.
          A long beat as Menenius stares at his friend, stunned at the
          pagan metamorphosis.
          Coriolanus just gazes back at him.
          Menenius finally pulls himself together and approaches, with

                         FULSOME BRAVADO:

                         MENENIUS
          The glorious gods sit in hourly synod
          about thy particular prosperity, and love
          thee no worse than thy old friend
          Menenius does! 0 Martius, Martius!
          He steps forward to hug Coriolanus. Two of the Acolytes stop
          him. He can approach no further.
          Menenius accepts this. No matter. He is completely confident
          he will be able to manipulate his protege. He always has in
          the past.

                         MENENIUS
          Thou art preparing fire for us. Look
          thee, here's water to quench it. I was
          hardly moved to come to thee, but being
          assured none but myself could move
          thee, I have been blown out of your gates
          with sighs, and conjure thee to pardon
          Rome.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          A long beat.
          Menenius waits for an answer. Grows uneasy.
          Then...

                         CORIOLANUS
          Away.

                         MENENIUS
          How? . Away?

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (ICE)
          Wife mother child I know not.

                         MY AFFAIRS
          Are servanted to others.
          Menenius can't believe this cold response--

                         MENENIUS

                         SIR--

                         CORIOLANUS
          Therefore be gone.
          His frigid eyes slice into Menenius:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Another word, Menenius,
          I will not hear thee speak.
          Menenius stares at him, shaken to the core.
          The Guards pull Menenius away.
          Coriolanus doesn't even glance at him.

          EXT. CHECKPOINT-HIGHWAY - DAY

          Back at the Roman checkpoint, Menenius strides toward his
          limousine. He has been deeply shaken by his interaction with
          the transformed Coriolanus.
          General Cominius follows urgently, Menenius doesn't stop:

                         MENENIUS
          This Martius is grown from man to dragon.
          He has wings; he's more than a creeping
          thing.
          He stops at his limo.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          A beat.
          He turns back to Cominius. We see the pain in Menenius' eyes.

                         MENENIUS
          There is no more mercy in him than there
          is milk in a male tiger.
          He climbs into his limo. Shuts the door.
          The limousine drives off, sending up a cloud of dust that
          swirls around Cominius.

          INT. MENENIUS' LIMO - DAY

          Menenius sits in the back of his limo as it speeds back to
          Rome.
          The rejection by Coriolanus has wounded him. Also he is
          plagued by guilt. He helped create this monster. He pushed
          Coriolanus into politics. And now Coriolanus has lost his
          soul, even his humanity, and Rome is to be put to the sword.
          All his fault.
          This preys on him.

          EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

          Menenius' limousine pulls over by an isolated set of railroad
          tracks. Weeds springing up. Battered advertising posters. An
          old chain link fence.
          Menenius climbs out of the car and walks along the tracks.
          Thinking.
          He stops.
          He sits on the railroad tracks.
          Pulls out a little pocket knife and, in the Roman fashion,
          efficiently slits his wrists.
          He stares out over the hideous landscape.
          Blood begins to pool around his stylish shoes.
          From afar we see him, sitting on the railroad tracks, alone
          and forlorn in this surreal urban wasteland, like a Samuel
          Beckett character.
          He slumps over.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          Menenius is dead.

          INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - SUNSET

          The red glow of dusk is shining through the cracked and dusty
          windows.
          Coriolanus, still in the barber chair, broods silently.
          Aufidius sits nearby, watching him.
          The visit from Menenius is troubling Coriolanus.

                         CORIOLANUS
          My partner in this action,
          You must report to the Volscian lords how

                         PLAINLY
          I have borne this business.
          Aufidius is curiously formal in his response, the
          estrangement he feels toward Coriolanus growing:

                         AUFIDIUS
          Only their ends
          You have respected; stopped your ears

                         AGAINST
          The general suit of Rome; never admitted
          A private whisper, no, not with such

                         FRIENDS
          That thought them sure of you.

                         CORIOLANUS
          This last old man,
          Whom with a cracked heart I have sent to
          Rome,
          Loved me above the measure of a father.
          Shouts and whistles from outside the factory draw their
          attention.

          EXT. VOLSCIAN CAMP - SUNSET

          Volumnia, Virgilia and Young Martius stride past the soldiers
          and mountains of military hardware. Volumnia leads, pulling
          the others by the hand.
          Some of the soldiers whistle. Some spit. Others laugh and
          make lascivious noises. Many just watch with grim dislike.
          Volumnia appears to be completely impervious to the whistles
          and cruel taunts. Her head is high, back straight, eagle eye
          forward. She was never more a Roman patrician.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          She is magnificent.

          INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - SUNSET

          Coriolanus stands as Volumnia, Virgilia and Young Martius are
          led into the factory.
          He tries to register nothing, assuming a sort of glacial
          calm.
          Volumnia and the others stop -- taking in Coriolanus' savage
          new demeanor and appearance -- taking in the Acolytes and
          pagan totems.
          Volumnia just stands, peering sternly at her son. As if
          daring him not to crumble before her. He doesn't.
          Aufidius watches everything closely.
          It is Virgilia, finally, who bravely approaches:

                         VIRGILIA
          My lord and husband--
          He stop her, almost a warning, with:

                         CORIOLANUS
          These eyes are not the same I wore in
          Rome.

                         VIRGILIA
          The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
          Makes you think so.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Best of my flesh,
          Forgive my tyranny, but do not say
          For that "Forgive our Romans."
          She shows great courage. Stepping forward and kissing him
          deeply. A long kiss.

                         CORIOLANUS
          0, a kiss Long as my exile, sweet as
          my revenge.
          It is a perverse response. In his monomaniacal imagination,
          his wife's kiss is obsessively equated with his revenge on
          Rome.
          He finally moves to Volumnia, simply can't resist her orbital
          pull.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         CORIOLANUS
          You gods I prate,
           And the most noble mother of the world
           Leave unsaluted. Sink, my knee, in the
          earth.
           He kneels before her. It is done with a sense of duty and
          protocol, not affection.

                         VOLUMNIA
          0, stand up blest.
          He rises.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Then with no softer cushion than the

                         FLINT
          I kneel before thee.
           She quickly and dramatically kneels before him. It is a coup
          de theatre and a masterpiece of manipulation.

                         CORIOLANUS
          What is this?
          Your knees to me? To your corrected son?

                         VOLUMNIA
          Thou art my warrior;
          I hope to frame thee.
          She indicates Young Martius:

                         VOLUMNIA
          This is a poor epitome of yours,
          Which by the interpretation of full time
          May show like all yourself.

                         CORIOLANUS
          (to his son)
          The god of soldiers,
          Inform thy thoughts with nobleness, that
          thou may prove
          To shame invulnerable.
          Volumnia pulls Young Martius down:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Your knee, sir.
          She pulls Virgilia down:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Even he, your wife, and myself,
          Are suitors to you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.
          All three kneel before Coriolanus. A pitiable sight. But he
          has no pity.
          He turns, sits in the barber chair.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I beseech you, peace!
          Or, if you'd ask, remember this:
          Do not bid me dismiss my soldiers, or

                         CAPITULATE
          Again with Rome's mechanics. Tell me not
          Wherein I seem unnatural. Desire not
          To ally my rages and revenges with
          Your colder reasons.
          Volumnia stands, assuming again a position of strength.

                         VOLUMNIA
          0, no more, no more!
          You have said you will not grant us
          anything,
          For we have nothing else to ask but that
          Which you deny already; yet we will ask,
          That, if you fail in our request, the

                         BLAME
          May hang upon your hardness. Therefore
          hear us.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for

                         WE'LL
          Hear naught from Rome in private.
          (coldly, to her)
          Your request?

                         VOLUMNIA
          Should we be silent and not speak, our

                         RAIMENT
          And state of bodies would reveal what

                         LIFE
          We have led since thy exile. Think with

                         THYSELF
          How more unfortunate than all living

                         WOMEN
          Are we come hither, since that thy sight,

                         WHICH SHOULD
          Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
          with comforts,
          Constrains them weep and shake with fear
          and sorrow,
          Making the mother, wife, and child to see
          The son, the husband and the father

                         TEARING
          His country's bowels out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.
          Coriolanus' face is a study in aloof neutrality. Yet he is
          listening intensely and Volumnia's words are affecting.
          She fights back emotion. It is impossible to tell if this
          real or feigned.

                         VOLUMNIA
          For myself, son,
          I propose not to wait on fortune till
          These wars determine. If I cannot

                         PERSUADE THEE
          Rather to show a noble grace, thou shalt

                         NO SOONER
          March to assault thy country than to
          Tread on thy mother's womb
          That brought thee to this world.

                         VIRGILIA

                         (STANDS)
          Ay, and mine,
          That brought you forth this boy, to keep

                         YOUR NAME
          Living to time.
          Young Martius stands as well and approaches his father,
          challenging and warlike:

                         YOUNG MARTIUS
          You shall not tread on me.
          I'll run away till I am bigger, but then
          I'll fight!
          Coriolanus stares at him -- the intensity of the boy's
          aggression is disturbing. And familiar.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I have sat too long.
          He rises and turns as if to go--

                         VOLUMNIA
          Nay, go not from us thus!
          Her command stops him. She appeals, quickly getting to the
          point of her argument:

                         VOLUMNIA
          If it were so that our request did tend
          To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
          The Volsces whom you serve, you might

                         CONDEMN US
          As poisonous of your honor. No, our suit
          Is that you reconcile them -- so the

                         VOLSCES

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)
          May say "This mercy we have showed," the
          Romans,
          "This we received," and each in either

                         SIDE
          Give the all-hail to thee and cry, "Be

                         BLEST
          For making up this peace!"
          Coriolanus does not respond.
          She softens...

                         VOLUMNIA
          Speak to me, son...
          Still he does not respond.
          His emotions are roiling.
          Still she is soft and vulnerable...

                         VOLUMNIA
          Why dost not speak?
          But softness is not a note she plays naturally. She knows it.
          Her natural aggressiveness comes out, anger and outrage
          gradually boiling to the surface:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Thinks thou it honorable for a noble man
          Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak
          you.
          He cares not for your weeping. Speak
          thou, boy.
          Perhaps thy childishness will move him

                         MORE
          Than can our reasons. There's no man in

                         THE WORLD
          More bound to his mother, yet here he
          lets me prate
          Like one in the stocks!
          She is assaulting him now, on the attack:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Thou hast never in thy life
          Showed thy dear mother any courtesy,
          When she, poor hen,
          Has clucked thee to the wars and safely

                         HOME
          Loaded with honor. Say my request's
          unjust,
          And spurn me back; and the gods will

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)
          plague thee,
          That thou restrains from me the duty

                         WHICH
          To a mother's part belongs!
          Coriolanus can take no more, turns and begins to walk away--
          Volumnia reacts like lightning -- grabbing Virgilia and Young
          Martius and dragging them to the dirt with her--

                         VOLUMNIA
          Down! Let us shame him with our knees!
          She claws at the dirt -- like Hecuba -- keening -- a shocking
          explosion of raw emotion -- almost an incantation:

                         VOLUMNIA
          Down! An end! This is the last. So we
          will home to Rome,
          And die among our neighbors. Nay, behold!
          This boy, that cannot tell what he would

                         HAVE
          But kneels and holds up hands for
          fellowship,
          Does reason our petition with more

                         STRENGTH
          Than thou hast to deny it.
          She remains kneeling, panting for air.
          Coriolanus looks at her. His noble mother. Clawing in the
          dirt like an animal. Filthy. Despairing. Her face wet with
          tears.
          She looks back up at him. She senses she has failed.
          It's over.

                         VOLUMNIA
          Come, let us go.
          She rises slowly, her age showing. Her spirit broken. Or
          seeming so.
          She stares at Coriolanus as she rips off the Roman Eagle
          medal she wears and flings it to the ground.
          The blood red sky of sunset behind her reflects her passion
          as she summons up all her strength for a lacerating and icy

                         FAREWELL:

                         VOLUMNIA
          This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
          His wife is in Corioles and his child

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         VOLUMNIA (CONT'D)
          Like him by chance Yet give us our
          dispatch.
          I am hushed until our city be afire,
          And then I'll speak a little.
          She turns and begins to go.
          But...
          We see finally Coriolanus crack.
          Like a great building crumbling.
          Like fissures cutting across marble.
          Emotion floods into him.
          He lunges forward and grabs her hand. Volumnia stops.
          Time stands still.
          He doesn't speak.

                         THEN:

                         CORIOLANUS
          O mother mother...
          What have you done?
          He falls to his knees, clutching her hand.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Behold, the heavens do ope,
          The gods look down -- and this unnatural

                         SCENE
          They laugh at.
          He buries his head in her, like a lost child:

                         CORIOLANUS
           O my mother, mother! 0!
           You have won a happy victory for Rome;
           But for your son - believe it, 0 believe
          it! -
          Most dangerously you have with him

                         PREVAILED
          (he looks up at her

                         DEEPLY)
          If not most mortal to him.
          She looks down at him. His meaning, his foreshadowing, is
          clear: she has saved Rome, but he knows he is doomed. Rome
          will live. He will die. This is the price for her victory
          today.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.
          She is willing to pay that price. So is he.
          A moment between them.
          He accepts his destiny.

                         CORIOLANUS
          But let it come.
          He stands, regains his composure. He slowly walks to
          Aufidius.
          He leans close, speaking intimately:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
          I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good
          Aufidius,
          Were you in my stead, would you have

                         HEARD
          A mother less? Or granted less?
          Aufidius?

                         AUFIDIUS

                         (CAREFULLY)
          I was moved withal.

                         CORIOLANUS
          I dare be sworn you were.
          And, sir, it is no little thing to make
          Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good
          sir,
          What peace you'll make, advise me.
          We study Aufidius' face. He gives away nothing.
          Coriolanus turns back to Volumnia. Looks at her.
          She is victorious.
          The crimson sky looms over her ominously.
          And we go to...

          INT. FORMAL MINISTRY HALL - DAY

          A solemn peace treaty signing ceremony.
          Coriolanus represents the Volscians. Cominius represents the
          Romans. They sit side-by-side at desks signing the treaty.
          Volumnia and Virgilia, gorgeously dressed, are present. So
          too Brutus and Sicinius. The press films everything.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         101
          It has the stiff formality of a White House ceremony.
          Cominius concludes signing:

                         COMINIUS
          A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
          No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
          We have all
          Great cause to give great thanks.
          He looks to Volumnia.

                         COMINIUS
          Behold our patroness, the life of Rome.
          She is erect and exalted. "The Life of Rome" personified.
          She ignores her son.
          Coriolanus will not look at her.

          EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY

           A rundown Truck Stop in an industrial wasteland.
          Garish, buzzing neon. Filthy 18-wheelers refueling. Music
          droning from a radio.
          Aufidius, his Lieutenant and seven of his men are waiting
          outside the dusty diner.
          The men with Aufidius are thugs and killers, the most brutal
          Volsces he could find. We note a couple of Coriolanus'
          Acolytes among them. They have turned with great venom on
          their hero.
          They are like a mafia hit squad, waiting for Coriolanus to
          return with the peace treaty.
          Aufidius is deep in thought.
          His Lieutenant breaks the silence:

                         LIEUTENANT
          How is it with our general?

                         AUFIDIUS
          As with a man by his own charity slain.

                         LIEUTENANT
          Our soldiers will remain uncertain whilst
          'Twixt you there's difference; but the

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         LIEUTENANT (CANT'D)
          fall of either
          Makes the survivor heir of all.

                         AUFIDIUS
          I know it,
          And my pretext to strike at him admits
          A good construction.
          A beat. He continues more to himself than them, almost
          convincing himself.

                         AUFIDIUS
          I raised him, and I pawned
          Mine honor for his truth; who being so
          heightened,
          He watered his new plants with dews of
          flattery,
          Seducing so my friends.

                         (BITTERLY)
          At the last
          I seemed his follower, not partner, and
          He waged me with his countenance as if
          I had been mercenary.

                         LIEUTENANT
          So he did, my lord.
          The army marveled at it; and in the last,
          When he had carried Rome and that we

                         LOOKED
          For no less spoil than glory--
          Aufidius works himself into an intense, neurotic rage:

                         AUFIDIUS
          There was it!
          For which my sinews shall be stretched
          upon him.
          At a few drops of women's rheum, which

                         ARE
          As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and

                         LABOR
          Of our great action -- Therefore shall he
          die,
          And I'll renew me in his fall.

                         LIEUTENANT
          Therefore, at your vantage,
          Ere he express himself or move the people
          With what he would say, let him feel your
          sword,
          Which we will second.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         AUFIDIUS

                         (SEES SOMETHING)
          Say no more.
          In the distance they can see a Roman military truck
          approaching. Clouds of dust billow up.
          They exchange a look. This is what they have been waiting
          for. They stand, stretch and prepare.
          The truck stops across the highway from them and Coriolanus
          gets out. He holds a copy of the peace treaty in a leather
          portfolio. He is unarmed.
          He stops.
          He sees Aufidius and the thugs. Waiting for him. Like a death
          squad.
          Coriolanus looks at them.
          He knows exactly what's going to happen.
          He is ready.
          He nods and the truck drives off.
          Coriolanus slowly crosses the highway to the truck stop, like
          a gunslinger walking down Main Street.
          There is something new to Coriolanus here. A sort of
          acceptance. He knows his time is past.
          Aufidius and the thugs go to meet him. The thugs spread out a
          bit, strategically, getting ready to strike. Coriolanus'
          experienced eyes miss none of this.
          They meet in the parking lot.

                         CORIOLANUS

                         (TO AUFIDIUS)
          I am returned your soldier,
          No more infected with my country's love
          Than when I parted hence, but still

                         SUBSISTING
          Under your great command.
          He hands the treaty portfolio to Aufidius:

                         CORIOLANUS
          We have made peace
          With no less honor to the Volscians
          Than shame to the Romans.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         AUFIDIUS
          (handing the treaty to

                         LIEUTENANT)
          Read it not,
          But tell the traitor, in the highest

                         DEGREE
          He hath abused your powers.
          Coriolanus is ready for Aufidius' ploy. He is amused at the
          obvious attempt to anger him:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Traitor? How now?

                         AUFIDIUS
          Ay, traitor, Martius.

                         CORIOLANUS
          "Martius"?

                         AUFIDIUS
          Ay, Martius, Caius Martius! Dost thou

                         THINK
          I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy

                         STOLEN NAME
          "Coriolanus"?
          He spins to the others, making the case against Coriolanus
          with cutting bitterness:

                         AUFIDIUS

                         PERFIDIOUSLY
          He has betrayed your business and given
          up,
          For certain drops of salt, your city Rome-
          I say "your city" - to his wife and

                         MOTHER;
          Breaking his oath and resolution, like
          A twist of rotten silk; never admitting
          Counsel of the war, but at his nurse's

                         TEARS
          He whined and roared away YOUR VICTORY!
          Coriolanus tries to contain his anger:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Hear'st thou, Mars?

                         AUFIDIUS
          Name not the god, thou boy of tears.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         CORIOLANUS
          Measureless liar, thou has made my heart
          Too great for what contains it. "Boy"? 0
          slave.
          Coriolanus' eyes miss nothing a Volscian thug shifting
          a bead of sweat on another one secretly reaching into
          his coat for a weapon.
          Some of the Volscian thugs are clearly nervous.
          Coriolanus is ready. He prepares himself mentally to die. He
          is acutely controlled:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Cut me to pieces, Volsces.
          Men and lads, stain all your edges on me.
          It is a dare. A challenge.

                         CORIOLANUS
          "Boy"? False hound.
          If you have writ your annals true, 'tis

                         THERE
          That, like an eagle in a dovecote, I
          Fluttered your Volscians in Corioles.
          His gaze burns into Aufidius:

                         CORIOLANUS
          Alone I did it "Boy."

                         AUFIDIUS
          Let him die for it.
          At this command, his men move--
          Aufidius steps back as--
          The Volscian thugs attack--
          With knives, machetes and tire irons--
          Coriolanus fights bravely -- disarming two, grabbing their
          weapons, killing them, fighting back--
          Slashing and cutting his way through the killers-
          Closer and closer to Aufidius, who just watches--
          Blood spattering and spraying-
          But the thugs overpower Coriolanus, there are just too many--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.
          They stab him -- slicing with knives -- battering with chains
          and clubs -- finally emptying pistols him into him--
          It is graceless and brutal carnage.
          Slaughter.
          But still he comes on. Body riddled with bullets and cut to
          bits. He refuses to fall. Like something immortal. An obscene
          demon of blood.
          Finally the thugs move away.
          Coriolanus still stands. Teetering. His face is a swollen
          mask of blood and gore. Blood flows from his body, pooling
          around his feet, spreading across the parking lot.
          Aufidius steps forward.
          What is left of Coriolanus glares at him through blood.
          Aufidius slowly pulls his knife. The same knife he was
          sharpening so carefully at the opening of the story. It has
          finally found its purpose.
          Coriolanus looks at him.
          Then slowly Coriolanus tries to raise one bleeding arm
          this requires superhuman effort his slashed fingers
          clutch his shirt he rips it open exposing his breast.
          Ready.
          He locks eyes with Aufidius.
          Aufidius steps to him. Takes his neck. Pulls him onto the
          knife. Driving it into him. Cradling his head like a lover.
          They stand like this.
          Then Coriolanus falls.
          A pause.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Take him up.
          No one moves.

                         AUFIDIUS
          Assist.
          Abrupt cut to--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

          EXT. TRUCK - DAY

          Coriolanus' body is awkwardly tossed into the back of an open
          truck. Like a sack of potatoes.

          EXT. TRUCK - SUNSET

          A crowd of Volscians are gathered around the back of the
          truck. They have come to see Coriolanus' body.
          We watch their faces. Normal people. A range of grim emotion.
          One raises a cell phone. Takes a photo.
          More phone cameras come out. Streaming video. Recording the
          moment.

          INT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY

          On the TV:
          The footage from the cell phone video.
          Coriolanus' body in the back of the trunk.

          Volumnia stands.

          Looking at her son.

          His body sprawled ungainly in death.

          No ritual or ceremony. No honor.

          Her face.

          Snap to black.

          The End.
The Deer Hunter

 

EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAY

The plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley
under five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon
across the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering through
the windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of
guyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents and
chimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the
clanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted
by the falling snow.

In the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- which
inhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly
down the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sad
looking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by
the skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrow
sidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwiched
between the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the
hillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which run
to three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of
toppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are
all connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility
lines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional
aid from a leaning pole.

MUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as
we watch a car come charging up through the slush on
Columbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on the
slippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears,
huddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears AS
CAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTY
STREET.

MAIN TITLE COMES UP:

			  THE DEER HUNTER

INT. STEEL MILL - DAY

A white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and
comes ripping down a track. Another ingot follows it, and
another and another and another. The ingots are huge,
trembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifying
rumble.

CREDITS ROLL

UNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots with
tongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERS
wear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped in
heat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures
in some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it is
hard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who
are young, who seem to work with particular grace. These are
NICK, SAL and MERLE.

CREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noise
is deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on
with murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pause
MERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL.
SAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICK
make the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips,
gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLE
and NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he starts
laughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track
again and they all grab their tongs.

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - ALTAR - DAY

A very old PRIEST is making preparations for a wedding
ceremony. SAL'S MOTHER hovers around him as he unlocks a
cabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which
will be used in the service. The PRIEST moves with agonizing
slowness and SAL's MOTHER is in the midst of a bad case of
nerves.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	It's all ready? Everything's ready?

			PRIEST 
	Yes.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	Are you sure everything's ready?
	Are you positive?

			PRIEST 
	Everything. Yes.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	It would snow... Everything's going
	to slip. Everything's going to
	slide... All the cars are going to
	crash!

SAL'S MOTHER puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into
tears.

			SAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
	I can't believe this... My own
	little boy... with a stranger!

The PRIEST smiles. He takes SAL'S MOTHER in his arms and
comforts her.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

Another car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides
back. As the car disappears, the door to one of the houses
bursts open and a group of giggling BRIDESMAIDS begin
scampering across the street. They have all been working on
their dresses, which are not completely finished, and they
all carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material. As
they make their way to the other side of the street they all
wave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support. One
of the BRIDESMAIDS loses her dress entirely and with everyone
laughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip. When the
garment is repossessed a door comes open and the BRIDESMAIDS
disappear inside.

CAMERA HOLDS ON COLUMBINE STREET. The snow slants across the
little stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little
houses. Another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides
back. Suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group
of OLDER WOMEN emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a
miniature bride and groom standing on the top. The WOMEN are
all in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats.
They begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow,
with the great white cake held firmly between them.

INT. STEEL MILL - ENTRY AREA - DAY

The time clocks are lined against both walls. As a whistle
screams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin
checking out. NICK, SAL and MERLE are right up in the front
ranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather
together along the wall.

			NICK
	Where's Vince?

			SAL
	There's Albert! 
		(calls)
	Hey, Albert!!!

ALBERT -- six and a half feet tall and built like an ox --
changes course and plows across the river of homeward-bound
STEELWORKERS.

			ALBERT
	How you feelin', Sal?

			SAL
	I feel okay.

			ALBERT
	Feeling hot?

			NICK
		(arm around SAL)
	Humper's ready. Old humper's
	hotter'n damn hell!

			MERLE 
	There's Vince!

			OTHERS
		(calling)
	Vince!... Over here! Vince!

			MERLE 
	Get him, Albert. Get Vince!

			ALBERT 
	I'll get him.

ALBERT wades back into the stream of STEELWORKERS, grabs
VINCE and they all push out together.

EXT. STEEL MILL - PARKING LOT - DAY

The snow is still falling. It covers the ground. It covers
the acres of parked cars. It swirls and tosses and blows. As
the five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all
stop dead in their tracks.

			VINCE 
	Snow... Holy shit, snow!

SAL gives a look at the others. Something is going on. VINCE
is so excited he begins hopping around.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	 ... Do you know what this means?
	Do you guys realize exactly what
	this means?

They all know. They all know damn well. MERLE and NICK
exchange looks. ALBERT chortles.

			SAL 
	What are you guys...? Are you guys
	going hunting?

The others nod, shrug, shuffle their feet. They are all a
little embarrassed.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Not tonight?... You're not driving
	up tonight?

			NICK 
	As soon as you're hitched, Sal.
	First we get you hitched.

			SAL 
		(envious)
	You guys are crazy. You know that?
	I mean you guys are really nuts.

			VINCE 
	He's getting married... and we're
	nuts!

			NICK
		(puts his arm around SAL)
	It's all right. Hey, it's all
	right. We'll be right here, right
	with you.

A look at the others...

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Won't we? Right? Am I right?

			MERLE 
	Right.

			ALBERT 
	Damn right!

			VINCE 
	What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you
	think we'd miss this?

Now SAL is embarrassed. He makes a gesture with his hand.

			NICK 
		(with a laugh)
	C'mon. C'mon you guys!

They all start into the swirling snow. NICK with an arm
around SAL.

			VINCE 
	And we want you to know, Sal, that
	any help you might need--

			ALBERT 
	Yeah, Sal--

			MERLE 
	Willing fingers--

			ALBERT 
	Extra feet!

INT. V.F.W. POST - DAY

The place is large and drafty and rundown. A huge American
flag hangs from the middle of the ceiling. Under it WOMEN are
laying white table cloths on trestle tables. Off to one side
a half dozen OLD MEN wearing VFW hats are Scotch-taping paper
ribbons to the brick wall. Two OLD MEN are on stepladders,
two more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under
the direction of a pair of World War I VETS standing side by
side. Their hands tremble. Their four eyes loom huge behind
corrective lenses.

			VET 1 
	Up I would say... What would you
	say?

			VET 2 
	Up.

			VET 1 
		(signals)
	Up ribbon!

One end of the ribbon is moved up. The two VETS study it.

			VET 2 
	Down I would say... What would you
	say?

			VET 1 
	Down.

			VET 2 
		(signals)
	Down ribbon!

Suddenly there is a commotion. The WOMEN who are setting up
the tables all rush to the door as the OLDER WOMEN come in
with the wedding cake. The OLDER WOMEN look half-frozen and
as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus
of Uhh's and Ahh's. Suddenly one of the OLDER WOMEN
collapses. Friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and
give her wine. The WOMAN takes the glass, tosses it off in
one swallow and grins. EVERYONE laughs.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - BOTTOM OF HILL - DAY

A big, battered old shark-finned black Cadillac approaches,
coming fast.

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

NICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE and ALBERT are all laughing. NICK is
at the wheel.

			VINCE
	Hit it, Nick!

			OTHERS
	Go Nick! Hit it, baby!!!

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

The car bangs over potholes and slams into the grade. We
watch as it reaches the half-way point, then the three
quarter mark...

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

NICK bends forward over the wheel, peering out through the
slapping wipers.

			GUYS IN THE CAR
		(chanting)
	Do it, Nick! Do it! Go Nick, Go! Do
	it! Do it, Nick! Go!

The car fishtails, loses speed... to a creep.

			NICK 
	Back! All hands to the rear!

ALBERT and MERLE, who are sitting in front, immediately throw
themselves into the back seat on top of SAL and VINCE.

			GUYS IN BACK SEAT 
	Easy... 'At's it, easy! Easy,
	Nick... Easy!

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY

The Cadillac inches up the last ten feet, gains level ground
and skids to a stop. From inside comes a MUTED CHEER.

INT. BRIDE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

ANGELA is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil. She is
plump, pretty, with a solemn, round face and big brown eyes.
ANGELA leans forward into a mirror.

			ANGELA
		(sincerely)
	I do.

A pause. ANGELA scowls and tries it again.

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
		(heartfelt)
	I do.

ANGELA tries it a few more times. It sounds worse and worse.

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
	I do, I do, I do!!!

ANGELA stares at herself. Now she looks desperate and
unrelievedly forlorn. Bursting into tears she throws herself
on the bed. Someone has slipped a photograph under the
pillow. The photograph is face down and as ANGELA pulls it
out she sees that something is written on the back:

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
		(reading, slow)
	"This is it -- more or less...
	Love, Mom."

ANGELA frowns, turns the photograph over. It is a picture of
Michaelangelo's "David". ANGELA stares at the figure for a
long, long moment...

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
	Oh, wow.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY

The place is packed with boisterous STEELWORKERS drinking
boilermakers. Deerheads are mounted in a long row over the
bar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls. The murals
depict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once
comical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret
from the hunters, some power beyond their own.

JOHN bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer. At
the same moment SAL comes in with NICK, MERLE, ALBERT and
VINCE. JOHN, who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his
tray, wraps his arms around SAL and begins jumping him around
the floor, grinning ear to ear. The STEELWORKERS turn, desert
their places and swarm around SAL, joking and shouting
congratulations.

INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

LINDA is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly
lovely face. Wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone
in the kitchen, staring at the ceiling. Thumping noises are
coming from the room above. The thumping gets louder.
There is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were
being thrown around. A MAN'S VOICE begins cursing and there
is more thumping and crashing. Suddenly there is a thud...
and then silence.

LINDA bites her lip. She crosses to the stove, ladles stew
into a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it
all on a tray.

INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - FATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

The room is a wreck of broken furniture. Chairs are turned
over, lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the
wall. In the middle of the room, face down on the floor, is
LINDA'S FATHER. His coat is torn, one shoe is missing and he
holds a half-empty bottle in his hand. Behind him, through
the open window, snow is blowing in.

LINDA comes in with the tray. She stands for a moment
expressionless, looking down at her father. Then she sets the
tray on the bureau and kneels beside him.

			LINDA 
	Daddy?

			FATHER
		(mumbles)
	Go... fucking hell!

LINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and
rolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes
up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles
from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it
seaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins
cursing again.

			FATHER (CONT'D)
	Fucking shit... all around, like a
	sea! Like an ocean!

LINDA gets up and closes the window. She comes back, gets
down on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the
bed. Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by
the shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet. The
effort is almost too much for her. Tears begin to burn in her
eyes, but when he slips back she tries again. The father
groans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him
on the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in
the face and pushes her violently across the room.

LINDA crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into
the wall. As she gets to her feet her father advances on her.

			FATHER (CONT'D)
	Fucking bitch... All bitches!

He swings, catches her in the face again, hard.

			LINDA
	Daddy...! Daddy, it's me!

			FATHER
	Hate 'em. Fucking bitches!

LINDA'S FATHER swings at her again, loses his balance and
falls on the floor. LINDA stands looking at him, holding her
jaw. She is crying. Tears are streaming down her face. 

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY

Seven MUSICIANS, carrying their instruments, file silently
through the falling snow.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND JOHN'S BAR - DAY

The WOMEN are all gathered, some fifteen or twenty, ranging
from grandmothers to young wives. About half of them wield
rolling pins or heavy pans. As the last reinforcements arrive
-- TWO HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS -- a roar of laughter
comes from inside.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY

NICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are dancing. The
MUSIC is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut
with a knife. Suddenly, from the back, comes a CHORUS OF
SCREECHES AND FEMALE RECRIMINATIONS. The door to the alley
bursts open and the HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS appear. The
STEELWORKERS take one look, gulp their drinks, grab their
heads in their hands and rush for the front door.

EXT. JOHN'S BAR - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

The STEELWORKERS stream into the snow with the WOMEN close
behind. Several blows are delivered and the howls of
complaint are met with angry commands to hurry and get
dressed for Sal's wedding.

CAMERA CLOSES ON SAL, who emerges with NICK and MERLE. The
snow hits him a sobering blow and he comes to a stop.

			SAL 
	Boy, this is it. This is really
	it... I mean... here I go.

SAL'S MOTHER hurries out of the alley. She is crying.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	My beautiful boy! My angel... who
	is leaving his own mother.

She throws herself in SAL's arms, sobbing.

			SAL 
	Momma...

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	So cold is your heart to leave your
	own mother?

			SAL 
	Momma, I'll be right upstairs.

SAL throws a look to NICK and MERLE. They gesture with
sympathy and study the snow flakes.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	So cruel is your heart? Is your
	heart so uncaring?

			SAL
		(a litany now)
	One flight, Momma. It's one flight.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

The trailer is a dented two-tone pink and cream job which
looks as if it had been purchased third-hand off a
construction site. It stands on cinder blocks in a small lot
which has been cut out of the side of the hill. A wrecked
school bus decorates it to the right. On the left is a bare
branched tree. NICK's black Cadillac is parked in front and a
light shows from inside the trailer.

CAMERA PICKS UP MERLE who is strolling toward the trailer
whistling through his teeth. He is wearing his tuxedo and
carries a knapsack and a deer rifle. He mounts the cinder
block steps and pounds on the trailer door. NICK opens the
door and waves him in.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

The place is cramped, littered with camping paraphernalia. A
deer head is mounted above the sink and NICK, who is half
into his tuxedo, is applying waterproofing to a pair of heavy
boots. MERLE smiles, throws his kit on the stove and sits.

			MERLE
		(indicates the
		waterproofing)
	You should have put that on last
	night.

			NICK 
	I know.

			MERLE 
	That way it sets.

			NICK 
	Yeah.

Pause.

			MERLE 
	I just wait. You know?

			NICK 
	Huh?

			MERLE 
	I just wait. For this... It's what
	I wait for... I wait all year.

			NICK 
	So do I.

			MERLE 
		(sharp)
	You do?

			NICK 
		(nods)
	Yeah.

NICK grins, takes down his rifle and begins wiping the oil
off it.

			MERLE 
	You think about it?

			NICK
	Yeah.

			MERLE
	So do I.
		(watches Nick for a
		minute)
	I want to be ready... You have to
	be ready... It has to be there, in
	your mind.

			NICK
	The shot?

			MERLE
	Fucking A.

			NICK
	I don't think about the shot that
	much.

			MERLE
		(firmly)
	You have to think about the shot.
	It's the shot. The shot's it.

			NICK
		(uncertain)
	Yeah... I guess.

			MERLE 
		(studies him)
	What do you think about?

			NICK 
	I don't know... I guess I think
	about the deer... Being out, maybe.
	I don't know. I think about it all.
	Hell, I like the trees, you know? I
	like the ways the trees are, all
	the different ways the trees are
	too.

			MERLE
		(with a glance to the
		window)
	I'll tell you something, Nick. I
	wouldn't hunt with anyone but you.
	I won't hunt with a yo-yo.

			NICK 
		(laughs)
	Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?

			MERLE 
	Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you
	think's a yo-yo! They're all yo
	yo's. I mean they're all great
	guys, for Christ's sake, but... The
	point is, Nick, without you I'd
	hunt alone. Seriously. I would.
	That's what I'd do.

			NICK
		(laughs)
	You're a fucking nut. You know
	that, Merle? You're a fucking
	maniac!

			MERLE 
	Yeah.
		(he grins)
	When it comes to hunting, that's
	true.

Cursing and banging from outside. NICK opens the door. JOHN
and ALBERT, both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are
pounding on the trunk of the Cadillac, trying to get it open.
NICK and MERLE go out. 

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

			NICK 
	Albert! For Christ's sake... John!
	Wait a minute, you guys!

			ALBERT
	It won't open.

			NICK 
	You gotta hit it here. Here,
	Albert, not there.

			ALBERT 
	Where should I hit it? Just show me
	where I should hit it.

			NICK
	Here. Hit it here.

ALBERT hits the trunk in the indicated spot and the lid snaps
open.

			ALBERT 
	Hey, that's neat.

NICK nods.

			ALBERT (CONT'D)
	That's new, isn't it?

			NICK 
	Couple of weeks... Listen --

			ALBERT 
	I love this car. Some cars sit, you
	know? This car, a car like this...
	grows. I mean you never know, with
	a car like this, where this car has
	been.

VINCE comes up, also in tuxedo, and dragging a totally
disorganized clutter of hunting gear behind him.

			VINCE 
	Hey, guys...

			JOHN
	Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup
	de Ville.

ALBERT looks around at his friends. He surveys the back end
of the Cadillac with simian pride. Then he expands his chest,
thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent,
mile-carrying Tarzan call. As the echo of it comes back the
church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of
excited BRIDESMAIDS come, hurrying up.

			BRIDESMAID 1
	Albert, what are you doing!

			BRIDESMAID 2
	Hurry up, you guys!

			BRIDESMAID 3
	Who's got their carnations?

			BRIDESMAID 4
	Here. They're right here.

			BRIDESMAID 1 
	Look at you! You're all a mess!

			BRIDESMAID 3
	Put on their carnations!

			BRIDESMAID 1 
	Who's got a pin?

As the BRIDESMAIDS begin straightening ties and putting on
carnations, NICK hears someone call his name. He turns to
find LINDA standing beside the trailer where she can't be
seen. She looks pale and very frightened and she holds a
small suitcase in her hand.

			NICK
		(crosses)
	Linda...

			LINDA 
	Hi.
		(forces a smile)
	Nick, your shoes are soaking.

			NICK 
	Linda, what's the matter?

			LINDA
		(tries to toss it off)
	Oh... You know...

She fights against it but the tears begin to come. NICK looks
around, pulls her inside the trailer.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

NICK clears a place on the couch. LINDA sits, holding her
suitcase in her lap.

			LINDA
		(with great effort)
	I was just wondering... Nick...
	You're going hunting... If I could
	use this place to stay, because...

			NICK 
	Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.

			LINDA 
	I'd want to pay you... and I was
	thinking --

			NICK 
		(kneels in front of her)
	Linda... Hey, Linda...

			LINDA
	I would want to pay you, Nick...
	and I was thinking --

			NICK
	Linda, Linda...!

			LINDA
		(very small, looking into
		his eyes)
	What?

			NICK
	Will you marry me?

			LINDA
		(after a long, long
		moment)
	Okay.

			NICK
	Would you?

LINDA nods - a solemn nod.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	You would?

LINDA's lip begins to tremble. Tears stand in her eyes and
she gives a little toss of her head.

			LINDA
	Who else, dummy?

NICK stares at her. He can still hardly believe it.

			NICK
	This is terrific...! This is really
	terrific!

LINDA nods. She is suddenly excited, suddenly radiantly
happy. She takes the suitcase off her lap and throws herself
in NICK's arms.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	I don't know what we've been
	waiting for!

			LINDA
		(eyes closed, loving him)
	I don't know! I don't know either!

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - NIGHT

SAL and ANGELA stand facing each other as the PRIEST reads
the Holy Sacrament of Marriage.

			PRIEST 
	"Blessed be the Kingdom... now and
	forever unto Ages and Ages...

As the PRIEST continues with the Holy Sacrament CAMERA PICKS
UP FACES IN THE CONGREGATION. We see SAL'S FAMILY. We see
ANGELA'S FAMILY. We see the VETS from the V.F.W. Post. We see
the STEELWORKERS from the bar and the WIVES and MOTHERS who
chased them home to change. They are hard faces -- working
class faces -- but we sense a fortitude among the
congregation, a community of both heart and spirit.

CAMERA PICKS UP NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN standing
in a row opposite the BRIDESMAIDS. The guys all look slightly
disheveled. Their tuxedos are all too small and their shoes
are soaking wet from walking in the snow.

NICK catches LINDA's eye and they hold each other across the
intervening space like two children who are amazed.

The PRIEST hands white tapers to the bride and groom. CAMERA
CLOSES SLOWLY ON THE PRIEST. The man is impressive -- gentle
yet full of power. The PRIEST lights the tapers -- first
ANGELA's, then SAL's -- and looks out across the assembled
congregation.

			PRIEST 
	"For everyone that does evil hates
	the light, and does not come to the
	light, lest his deeds will be
	reproved."

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF THE HILL - NIGHT

Save for a lone figure trudging home, the street is deserted,
left to the gently falling snow. In the background the
massive silhouette of the steel mill is plainly visible, lit
with fire.

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - NIGHT

NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN join with the BRIDESMAIDS
to assist the PRIEST in the crowning of SAL and ANGELA.

The PRIEST crowns SAL first.

			PRIEST 
	"The servant of God, Sal, is
	crowned for the servant of God
	Angela, in the Name of the Father
	and of the Son and of the Holy
	Ghost. Amen."

Now ANGELA is crowned.

			PRIEST (CONT'D)
	"The servant of God, Angela, is
	crowned for the servant of God,
	Sal, in the Name of the Father and
	of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
	Amen."

Guiding the couple by their joined hands the PRIEST leads SAL
and ANGELA around the analoy. The movement is very precise,
very formal, a circling to represent eternity.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

The Band is going full blast and the whirling COUPLES, young
and old, are laughing.
We see SAL and ANGELA, NICK and LINDA, VINCE, ALBERT and
JOHN. The only one of the group not dancing is MERLE. MERLE
is drinking, standing alone on the side of the floor chugging
beer in tense, rapid-fire gulps. We sense immediately that he
feels out of place, at a loss to join spontaneously in the
spirit of the party. MERLE finishes the beer, crumples the
can and starts on another. As he picks up the second can he
notices that a SAD-LOOKING GIRL is sitting against the wall
behind him, waiting for someone to ask her to dance. The SAD
LOOKING GIRL gives MERLE a smile. MERLE pretends not to see
and moves behind a post.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLES - NIGHT

The wedding cake that was carried in earlier has now been
attacked from all sides, but the miniature bride and groom
are still standing in the middle. Unnoticed by each other
SAL'S MOTHER and ANGELA'S MOTHER eye the little figures. Both
women are in rather teary condition and begin moving toward
the cake. Suddenly, as the CROWD shifts, they encounter each
other face to face. Smiles are exchanged -- strained smiles,
which get stretched and stretched and stretched. Then, in
unison, they desert the smiling and remove their respective
offspring from the cake. SAL'S MOTHER looks down at her sugar
coated groom and ANGELA'S MOTHER looks down at her sugar
coated bride. Then they eye each other, burst into tears and
throw themselves in each other's arms, moaning and sobbing.

INT. V.F.W. POST - COAT ROOM - NIGHT

Another COUPLE tries to enter the rack. It is pretty full.
They finally find an empty place and squeeze in.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

NICK comes off the floor with LINDA and throws an arm around
MERLE.

			NICK 
	Sit with Linda, man, will ya?...
	Give her a beer.
		(to Linda with great
		solicitude)
	Would you like a beer?

			LINDA
		(puzzled)
	Sure.

			NICK 
	What kind of beer would you like?

			LINDA 
		(laughing)
	I don't know.

			NICK
		(to Merle)
	Give her Miller's. Miller's High
	Life.

NICK takes off. LINDA sits down at a table and MERLE goes to
the cooler to get a Miller's. He gropes around in the tub,
finds one and pops the tab. Suddenly he notices that NICK has
crossed to the SAD-LOOKING GIRL by the wall. He has stopped
in front of her and is asking her something. The SAD-LOOKING
GIRL gives a blush, gets out of her chair and NICK takes her
in his arms and begins to dance. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL looks
transformed. She begins chattering and laughing.

MERLE crosses back to LINDA and gives her the beer. As he
pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and
nearly loses his balance. He is very drunk.

			MERLE 
	Sorry.

			LINDA
		(laughs)
	It's okay, Merle.

NICK swings by with the SAD-LOOKING GIRL and waves.

			MERLE 
		(catching Linda's
		expression)
	I guess you like Nick.

			LINDA 
		(nods)
	Yes.

MERLE doesn't say anything for a moment. He seems to be
trying to contain a floodtide of emotion.

			MERLE
	Fuckin' Nick... 
		(clears his throat)
	Fuckin' Nick... gives. 
		(he nods, bangs his fist
		on the table)
	Gives. Fuckin' Nick gives.

INT. V.F.W. POST - COATROOM - NIGHT

The rack is still jammed with COUPLES but the laughing and
giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing
and low moans.
What light there is comes from the colored glass ball
revolving above the dance floor, where the MUSIC is now
playing sweet and low.

The front door comes open and a U.S. Army SERGEANT steps into
the darkened hallway. The man wears his dress green uniform.
On his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are
brightly polished.

			SERGEANT
	Pow!

The SERGEANT gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance
floor.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLE AREA - NIGHT

The SERGEANT passes between groups of celebrating GUESTS,
plucks a beer from one of the coolers and sits down alone at
the end of one of the white trestle tables.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

ALBERT gives his Tarzan cry, suddenly picks his GIRL off her
feet and marches around holding her above his head.

			GIRL 
	Albert, what are you doing...
	Albert!

INT. V.F.W. POST DANCE FLOOR - ANOTHER LOCATION - NIGHT

VINCE and JOHN are standing together. VINCE is going bananas
because his girl, MARSHA, is dancing too close to FRED.

			VINCE 
	Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a
	minute, watch. There! D'j'u see
	that? D'j'u see the way he... You
	know what that guy is doing? That
	guy is squeezing her ass!

			JOHN 
	Oh, well...

			VINCE 
	Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?!
	The guy is actually... He did it
	again! That's what he's doing...
	He... He's reaching in, John, to
	her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna
	kill him right now.

VINCE marches up and taps FRED on the shoulder. FRED releases
MARSHA. MARSHA waits, one hand on her hip, while the two of
them exchange words. VINCE turns MARSHA, points to her ass.
FRED turns MARSHA, pints to the small of her back. VINCE is
hopping up and down now. So is FRED. MARSHA, who is getting
bored, points to the door. VINCE and FRED bang out. As soon
as they have gone MARSHA is taken by someone else who puts
his hand right back where FRED had it.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLES - NIGHT

NICK, SAL and MERLE are standing together, looking at the
SERGEANT.

			MERLE 
	Nick, he just came back.

			NICK 
	From Nam?

			MERLE 
	Fucking A. See that ribbon in the
	left. That's Quan Son. That fucking
	guy was at Quan Son!

MERLE gestures with his head. NICK and SAL cross with him to
the SERGEANT.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	We, ah... We're going too.

The SERGEANT looks at them and delivers a big, blank smile.

			SERGEANT 
	Pow!

			MERLE 
	What?

The SERGEANT keeps smiling.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(to Nick)
	What'd he say?

			NICK 
	Pow.

			MERLE 
	Pow?

			NICK 
	Pow.

			MERLE 
	Oh.

MERLE nods.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(clears his throat)
	Uh... well, maybe you could tell us
	how it is over there?

			SERGEANT 
	Pow!

			MERLE 
	Pow?

			SERGEANT 
	Pow!

MERLE looks at NICK. NICK looks at SAL. They all begin
scratching their heads, trying not to laugh.

			MERLE
	Well, thanks a lot.

They turn away and then, when they are out of earshot, they
all break up, howling.

			SAL
	Who the hell is he?

			MERLE
	Who the hell knows!

			NICK
	Is he from here?

			MERLE
	Hell no!

			NICK 
	Well, where's he from?

			MERLE AND SAL
		(in unison)
	Who the hell knows!

			MERLE
		(soberly)
	Maybe he's lost.

			SAL AND NICK
	Lost???

			MERLE
		(throws up his hands)
	Well, I don't know!

INT. V.F.W. POST - NIGHT

The GUESTS have formed in a long double line which extends
from the dance floor right out into the street. Everyone is
pretty drunk and they are all armed with streamers and bags
of rice. As SAL and ANGELA appear from out of a back room
there is a great rowdy CHEER. The MUSICIANS strike up a
MARCH. Followed by the MUSICIANS, showered with streamers,
rice, advice and encouragement, SAL and ANGELA walk the
gauntlet toward the street, where a glossy, bright red
Pontiac with headers and straight pipes is being revved in a
series of ear-splitting crescendos.

EXT. V.F.W. POST - STREET - NIGHT

JOHN, ALBERT, MERLE and VINCENT are standing by the door.
Their tuxedos are stained and torn. Their carnations are
squashed and their clip-on bow ties are either missing
entirely or dangling from the open collars of their shirts.
VINCE looks the worst, with a black eye and half his pant leg
torn away, and they are all guzzling beer.

			VINCE 
	Bullshit! That's bullshit!

			MERLE 
	You wanna bet?

			VINCE 
	I'll betcha! That's bullshit and
	I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!

			MERLE 
	How much? How much do you wanna
	bet?

			OTHERS
	Bet him! Bet him, Vince!

			VINCE 
	I'll betcha! I'll betcha... I'll
	betcha twenty dollars!

EXT. V.F.W. POST - PARKED PONTIAC - NIGHT

SAL and ANGELA emerge to more CHEERS and a shower of
streamers and rice. ANGELA is helped into the Pontiac on the
right. NICK throws an arm around SAL and walks him around to
the driver's seat.

			NICK 
	Don't worry what it says in the
	book.

			SAL 
	Right.

			NICK 
	Just forget that. Forget what it
	says in the book.

			SAL 
	I'm gonna start slow... At the top.
	Then I'm gonna work down.

			NICK 
	Great. That's great.

			SAL 
	That's my plan.

NICK gives SAL a hug. SAL gets in the car.

			NICK
	See you Monday.

			SAL
	See you Monday.

INT. PONTIAC - NIGHT

SAL looks over at ANGELA.

			SAL
	All set, hon?

ANGELA nods. SAL puts the car into gear and starts slowly
off. Fists pound on the car. Rice and streamers shower down.
Suddenly, through the front windshield, MERLE appears, stark
naked, running in front of the car with colored paper
streamers floating out from his upraised right hand. For a
split second SAL cannot believe what he is seeing. He throws
a look at ANGELA. ANGELA covers her mouth in amazement and
then quickly shifts the hand to cover her eyes.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

MERLE weaves down the street in front of the growling red
Pontiac. MERLE is not just running. He is leaping and
bounding, as if released from gravity and entered into a
realm of pure ethereal space.

NICK, ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN pound down the street behind the
Pontiac, ALBERT carrying MERLE's clothes.

			GUYS
	Look at that! Fuckin' guy! Fuckin'
	Merle!... Unbelievable!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The road forks, one road going high to a parking area, the
other descending to the valley below. MERLE swerves up the
incline toward the parking area, while the Pontiac goes
straight and disappears down the hill.

ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN stagger to a stop, panting helplessly.
NICK grabs MERLE's clothes from ALBERT and takes off up the
hill.

EXT. HILLSIDE PARKING AREA - NIGHT

MERLE stands motionless, looking out across the valley as
NICK approaches. The night is brilliantly clear and the fires
from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow.

NICK comes to a stop a few feet away.

			NICK 
	Merle?

MERLE turns. His face has a strange, distant look, and he
gives NICK an almost feral grin.

			MERLE 
	You think we'll ever come back?

			NICK
		(startled)
	From Nam?

			MERLE 
	Yeah.

NICK moves up beside him. He doesn't know what to say.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	I love this fuckin' place... That
	sounds crazy. I know that sounds
	crazy, but I love this fuckin'
	place... If anything happens, Nick,
	don't leave me there. I mean it.
	Don't leave me... You gotta
	promise, Nick. You gotta promise me
	that.

			NICK
		(half laughing)
	Merle --

			MERLE 
	Promise! You gotta promise!

			NICK 
	You got it.

MERLE lets out his breath. It is as if some great weight had
been pressing on him.

			MERLE
		(with a laugh)
	Let's go huntin'. I mean let's do
	it!

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THRUWAY - NIGHT

NICK'S battered old shark-finned Cadillac comes screaming
past.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN, all of them still in
tuxedos, are jammed in the car between knapsacks, sleeping
bags, six packs of beer and deer rifles.

			GUYS
		(singing)
	Let me be free! Let me be free!
	If... you... will let me be free...
	You'll... always be happy... with
	me-e-e-e!!!

			ALBERT
		(making a trumpet sound)
	Wa-wa-wa!... Waaaaa!!!

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

Tale Cadillac comes blasting by...

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

NICK is hunched over the wheel, his eyes gone completely
glassy. MERLE and VINCE are on the nod, while ALBERT and
JOHN, both half asleep, are having a lead-voiced
conversation.

			ALBERT
	She fucked you?

			JOHN
	She fucked me.

			ALBERT
	She fucked me too.

			JOHN
	She fucked you?

			ALBERT
	She fucked me too.

There is a long pause. They both struggle to keep their eyes
open.

			JOHN
	She fucked us both.

			ALBERT 
	Yeah.

			JOHN 
	Fucking women, man...

			ALBERT
		(shakes his head)
	I know...

INT. CADILLAC NIGHT

NICK'S head is sunk below the upper rim of the steering
wheel. One eye is entirely shut and the open one seems close
to death. Suddenly his head snaps up. He slams his foot down
on the brake and the Cadillac fishtails, rubber screaming, to
a jolting stop.

EVERYONE in the car comes awake ten bleary eyes staring out
through the windshield.

There are deer in the road, fifteen or twenty of them
standing in the headlights.

EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

VINCE, ALBERT, NICK and JOHN pile out with their rifles.
VINCE immediately slips and falls down.

			VINCE 
	Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!

			JOHN 
	Who's got the ammo?

			ALBERT 
	Ammo! Get the ammo!

			VINCE 
	I'll get it! Where is it?

			JOHN 
	It's in the trunk!... It's in the
	trunk! I'm telling you, it's in the
	trunk!

VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush around to the trunk. ALBERT
begins pounding on it.

			VINCE 
	There, Albert! Hit it there!

Pushing and shoving each other, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush
around to the side of the car. As they pass along the
embankment at the side of the road there is a soft sound,
like a sigh, and all three of them simultaneously vanish.

NICK, who has been watching, stares at the place where his
three friends disappeared. He takes a few steps forward,
realizes what has happened and doubles up in the middle of
the road, helpless with laughter.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(getting out of the car)
	Man, let's go hunting!... Where are
	they?

NICK makes a gesture, a downward pointing of his finger.
VINCE crosses to the side of the road.

EXT. RAVINE - NIGHT

The slope is a good 45 plus. At the bottom, barely visible,
three tiny figures flop in the snow.

EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

VINCE looks down at the three hunters with an expression of
absolute disgust. He looks at NICK -- flat on his back,
pounding his feet, howling -- and then he looks at the deer.
The deer are still watching. If anything they have edged
closer and their massed expression of polite curiosity throws
VINCE into a blind rage.

			VINCE 
	Get out of here, damn you! Go
	home!... Scat!... Shoo!

VINCE, whose rifle is fully loaded, slams a shell into the
chamber and lets off a barrage of shots above the deer.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Bastards! Assholes! Get lost!

EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAWN

The sky is cold -- first light -- with low, wind-driven
clouds. CAMERA TILTS DOWN and we see NICK's Cadillac coming
up a narrow road flanked by precipitous, heavily forested
ridges on both sides.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN

The Cadillac seems minuscule, overwhelmed by the massive,
black slopes looming up from the road.

INT. CADILLAC - DAWN

Everyone is eating cold hot dogs, ripping them out of a half
dozen plastic packages, dipping them in a jar of mustard and
stuffing them down. Hot dog juice has dripped over
everything, potato chips are littered everywhere and both
beer and milk are being passed around.

			ALBERT
	Fuel up. Need fuel.

			JOHN
	Those are mine!

			ALBERT
	You want 'em?

			JOHN
	Damn right!

			ALBERT
	Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.

			MERLE
	Here's a Hershey.

ALBERT tears off the wrapper, dips it in the mustard and
glomps it down.

			JOHN
	That's mustard!

			ALBERT
		(mouth jammed full)
	What?

			JOHN
	You just put mustard on your
	Hershey bar.

			ALBERT
		(nods)
	Good... Pass the beer.

			VINCE
		(pointing to a location
		beside the road)
	Here, here! This is it!

			MERLE
		(milk slopping over him)
	Watch it, shithead!

			VINCE
		(pounds Nick on the
		shoulder)
	Here! This is it!

			ALBERT 
	It is not!

			VINCE 
	It is too! Now you passed it!

			MERLE
	It's ahead, by the tree.

			NICK
	It's ahead, Vince.

			VINCE 
	That isn't it! There's no way
	that's it... Unless they changed
	it. They might have changed it.

NICK pulls to a stop on the shoulder.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	They changed it. That's what they
	did. This is it but they changed
	it.

EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN

The sky is just turning grey. A cold wind is blowing, moaning
in the trees and swirling a fine haze of snow across the open
roadway. The guys all pile out in their wrecked tuxedos.

			VINCE
	This is it. Definitely. This is it,
	but they changed it.

			ALBERT 
	You're full of shit.

			VINCE 
	Who's full of shit?

			ALBERT 
	You're full of shit!

			VINCE 
	I'm telling you, they changed it!

			ALBERT 
	They did not!

			VINCE 
	They did too!

			ALBERT 
	Jesus, it's freezing!

NICK, MERLE and JOHN have the trunk open and are taking stuff
out. MERLE strips down where he stands and begins putting on
his hunting clothes. ALBERT and VINCE grab their things and
follow the example of NICK and JOHN, who are changing on the
corner of the seats.

			NICK 
	Whee-uu!

			ALBERT 
	Jesus!

			JOHN 
	Holy shit!

			VINCE 
	Merle, hey Merle, you got any
	socks?

MERLE, who is crouched down studying the hillside, looks
over.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(rummaging around in the
		mess of things he has
		brought)
	Never mind, Merle. Never mind, I
	got 'em... Where the hell are my
	pants? Anyone see my pants?... Who
	the hell took my pants!

VINCE begins plunging around.

			OTHERS 
	Fuckhead! Watch it!

			VINCE 
	Somebody took my pants... I know I
	brought pants.

VINCE tears into another pile of equipment, comes up with
nothing and steps out of the car.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	All right. All right, you guys.
	Whoever took my pants, I want 'em
	back!

EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN - LATER

Shots are ringing out in the hills. NICK, ALBERT and JOHN
stand by the roadside while VINCE and MERLE glare at each
other. VINCE is still in his tuxedo pants, is still wearing
his dress shoes and is draped in a gigantic red goose down
vest that could only have come from ALBERT. MERLE's knapsack
lies on the ground in front of him and we can see that it
contains a pair of Vibram-soled mountain boots.

			MERLE 
	Sure I got boots. I got boots right
	here.

			VINCE 
	Then lemme have 'em.

			MERLE 
	No.

			VINCE 
		(both hands in the air)
	No!!!?

			MERLE 
	No.

			VINCE 
	What do you mean, no???

			MERLE
	That's it. No. No way.

			VINCE 
	Some fuckin' friend... You're some
	fuckin' friend, Merle!

			MERLE 
	You gotta learn, Vince! You come
	out here... You got no jacket, you
	got no pants, you got no knife and
	you got no boots. You think
	everyone's gonna take care of you!
	That's what you always think, but
	this time you're wrong. This time
	you're on your own!

			ALBERT
	Merle, give him the boots.

			MERLE
	No. No boots. No nothin'.

			VINCE 
	You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle.
	You know that? You're one fucking
	bastard!

			MERLE 
		(snapping it out, jabbing
		his finger at the ground)
	This is this, Vince. This isn't
	something else. This is this!

			VINCE 
	You know what I think? There's
	times I think you're a goddamn
	faggot!... I fixed you up a million
	times, Merle!
		(to the others)
	I fixed him up a million times! I
	don't know how many times I fixed
	him up... and nothin' ever
	happens... Zilch! Zero!... The
	trouble with you, Merle, no one
	knows what you're talking about!
	"This is this"? What does that
	mean, "this is this"? I mean is
	that some faggot bullshit, or is
	that some faggot bullshit!!! And if
	it isn't, what the hell is it???

			JOHN
	Vince. Hey, you guys --

			VINCE
		(hopping now)
	Take last night...! Last night he
	coulda had twenty fuckin' deer!
	More! He coulda had more! And look
	what he does! I mean look what he
	fuckin' does!!!

			JOHN 
	Vince!!!

JOHN throws up his hands in a comical way.

			JOHN (CONT'D)
	I'll get the boots.

			ALBERT
		(in agreement)
	Get the boots.

			JOHN
		(crossing to Merle's
		knapsack)
	I mean let's get going before --

MERLE -- who has remained completely calm throughout VINCE's
tirade -- pumps a shell in the chamber of his rifle. JOHN
freezes in his tracks and stares at him, his face gone white.

			MERLE
	I said no.

JOHN looks at ALBERT, who is right behind him, and they both
back away. VINCE, who is standing directly opposite MERLE,
begins to tremble. His mouth comes open, closes and comes
open again. Urine begins trickling out from the bottom of his
pants leg, staining the snow. Suddenly, NICK steps forward.
He looks at MERLE, crosses to the knapsack, takes out the
boots, walks over to VINCE and throws them on the road.

			NICK
		(gently, to Merle)
	Let's hunt.

INT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

The place is about nine-by-twelve. The floor is rotted out,
boards are missing from the walls and the entire structure is
canted to the right. Hanging from the roof peak is a hissing
Coleman lantern which sways in the wind.

VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are sacked out, sound asleep. Beer
cans -- some old, some new -- litter the floor. Wet clothes,
most of them bloody, hang from tie-boards and nails. Strung
up on the end wall are two deer carcasses, one of them with a
knife jammed in it where steaks have been cut out.
Snow is blowing in -- dry, crystal bright. It swirls over
everything and settles on the sleeping figures on the floor.

CAMERA DISCOVERS MERLE AND NICK. They are both in sleeping
bags, lying on rusted bedsprings at either side of the broken
door. The wind gusts and moans. The cabin shudders and then
there is a sudden lull.

			MERLE 
	Hey, Nick?

			NICK 
	Huh?

			MERLE
	Tomorrow I go with Vince.

			NICK
	Hunt with Vince?

			MERLE
	Yeah... I mean so he knows... He
	doesn't even know.

EXT. THRUWAY PITTSBURGH OFF-RAMP - TWILIGHT

Traffic is heavy, an unending flow of cars, a river of
headlights suspended on a curved concrete trestle which seems
to float in thin air. Behind is the mill, belching steam and
ablaze with fire.

NICK's Cadillac appears, horn blaring, weaving through the
traffic. The car sits low. Trussed to the hood, to the roof,
to the trunk, are the carcasses of five deer. Rope-ends
flutter and bang in the wind. The car shudders and thuds.
Inside, grinning maniacally, NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and
JOHN are all shouting and guzzling beer.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TWILIGHT

The Caddy appears, swerving onto Columbine with tires
screaming and NICK still leaning on the horn. The guys are
all hanging out the windows, shouting to FRIENDS, whistling
at GIRLS and banging a triumphant tatoo on the doors.

			ALBERT
	Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!

			JOHN
	Hey Geraldine, let's eat!

			VINCE
	Nothin' to it, asshole! Piece o'
	fuckin' cake!

As the car ascends the grade the mill appears behind it,
seeming to loom upward under the pink-streaked twilight sky.

CAMERA HOLDS AS THE CAR COMES TOWARD IT. The headlights blaze
white, like huge hungry stars, and the eyes of the dead deer
on the fenders glitter gold and green and red.

ALBERT leans out the window and gives his Tarzan call... IT
SEEMS TO ECHO, AS IF COMING FROM FAR AWAY,

							FREEZE FRAME...

EXT. CLOSE-UP OF JUNGLE LEAF - DAY

The leaf is being eaten by an exotic-looking insect. After
each bite, the insect lifts its head, produces an exceedingly
thoughtful expression, and chews.

WE HEAR THE BUZZ AND CREAK OF OTHER INSECTS, THEN A DULL,
FLUTTERING DRONE. THE DRONE GROWS LOUDER...

EXT. HELICOPTER SQUADRON - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY

There are twenty of them, coming fast and low, just over the
tops of the trees. Sunlight gleams on their paint and
murderous-looking rockets are packed to their bellies in fat
clusters, like eggs.

Suddenly, in unison, they fire the rockets.

EXT. RANGE OF LOW HILLS - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY

As the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot
upward, lost to sight. There is an eerie silence and then the
hillside explodes, vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two
miles wide.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

A platoon of AMERICANS have been ambushed on the road. The
bodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, guts
spilled in the dirt. No one moves and there is absolute
silence except for the low buzz of flies.

A V.C. LIEUTENANT steps into sight. He gives a brusque
command and V.C. SOLDIERS step out of the jungle. The
LIEUTENANT bayonets a few of the fallen U.S. SOLDIERS --
idly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he
rubs his finger in the Americans' blood. The V.C. SOLDIERS
laugh, spear a few AMERICANS themselves and repeat the joke.

There is a slight sound. The V.C. LIEUTENANT spins and gives
a low command. Fifty feet away there are three grass huts.
He signals his SOLDIERS to spread out and then he starts
toward them.

INT. GRASS HUT - DAY

South Vietnamese VILLAGERS -- women, children, and a few old
men -- sit huddled in the semi-darkness. The WOMEN hold their
hands over their BABIES' mouths. Flies buzz and there is a
look of stark terror in their faces.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

One of the fallen AMERICANS moves. CAMERA CLOSES ON THE
SOLDIER. His face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a
gash in his temple. The face is unshaven, frighteningly
gaunt, but we recognize that it is MERLE.

A WOMAN'S SCREAM comes from the direction of the huts. A shot
rings out. MERLE pulls himself to his hands and knees and
stands there, on all fours, like a dog.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY

The V.C. roust the VILLAGERS from their huts, smashing them
in the back with rifle butts. One of the SOLDIERS emerges
from a hut carrying two small BABIES upside-down by their
feet. One of the WOMEN cries out. The SOLDIER gives her a
kick, swings one of her BABIES in the air and lets it go. The
BABY turns over and over against the blue sky. As the BABY
comes down ANOTHER SOLDIER catches it through the neck on the
end of his bayonet.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

MERLE strips a B.A.R. from one of his dead companions, slams
a fresh clip in it, jams two extras in his pants and starts
for the grass huts. His movements are slow, almost dreamlike,
and his face is expressionless, like someone risen from the
dead.

EXT. GRASS HUTS DAY

The VILLAGERS -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in
a line. As the SOLDIERS look on the V.C. LIEUTENANT walks up
and down trying to extract information. The SPEARED BABY lies
in the dust between the two groups. The SECOND BABY tries to
play with it. The SOLDIER who threw the dead baby in the air
squats nearby and yawns.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

MERLE approaches between the huts. He takes a quick look
around the corner, finds the V.C. all bunched in a neat
package and draws back.

CAMERA CLOSES ON MERLE'S EYES. They are cold, dreaming
things, glittering blankly.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY

MERLE spins out with the B.A.R. on full automatic. The V.C.
SOLDIERS go down screaming, arms and necks thrown back, in a
thin mist of spraying blood.

ABOVE THE CHATTER OF MERLE'S B.A.R. WE HEAR A GROWING ROAR.

EXT. APPROACHING AMERICAN HELICOPTERS - DAY

There are five of them, coming in low under the tops of
nearby trees.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - THE VILLAGERS - DAY

The VILLAGERS stand motionless, staring at the helicopters
and frozen with terror. They turn. They start to run. And
then they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm.

EXT. GRASS HUTS AFTER NAPALM ATTACK - DAY

MERLE stands alone with his B.A.R. surrounded by clouds of
billowing black smoke. There is no sound but the rush of
heated air and the faint crackle of flames. MERLE'S clothes
are burning. Flames are licking up his trouser legs and a
blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet.

In front of MERLE the SOLDIERS and the VILLAGERS lie in two
charred heaps. The BABIES lie between them. Both are
motionless now, like two roasted stones.

An AMERICAN LIEUTENANT steps out from behind one of the
burning huts. MERLE and the LIEUTENANT spin on each other and
then the LIEUTENANT lowers his carbine.

			LIEUTENANT
	What the hell are you doing here?

			MERLE 
		(numb)
	Saving lives.

MORE AMERICANS appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the
trees in a long line. Among them are NICK and SAL.

			LIEUTENANT
	Move it out, girls! Move it out!

The LIEUTENANT heads down the line. NICK stares at MERLE.

			NICK
	Merle?... Jesus, Merle!

MERLE turns and looks at NICK. There is no recognition. He
seems to be looking right through him.

SAL comes up behind NICK.

			SAL
	Hey...! Hey, Merle!

A shot rings out. The LIEUTENANT goes down and suddenly the
whole line of AMERICANS is caught in a murderous cross-fire.
Grenades rain out of the trees. MERLE, NICK and SAL dive for
cover.

Out of the smoke V.C. SOLDIERS begin to appear, more and more
of them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

We are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug
and fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by
stones. The ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pits
are filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo
gratings. In each of the pits are about a half-dozen men --
SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their hands grip the gratings
and their eyes are hollow. Other than an occasional groan
there is only the sound of the falling rain.

A V.C. SOLDIER trudges out of the jungle. As he reaches the
pits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up and
down on the bamboo gratings. The hands disappear. As soon as
one comes back, the SOLDIER stomps on it, shrieking with
laughter. Then, almost as an afterthought, the SOLDIER pulls
down his pants and squats above the center grating.

CAMERA TILTS SLOWLY UPWARD. We see the clearing in its
totality. It is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and
contains only two structures. One is a large bamboo "tiger
cage" with a few leaves tied to its top. The other is a small
hut with a thatched roof. The walls of the hut are open and
we can see V.C. GUARDS moving about inside.

A cry comes from the hut. There is the THUD of a rifle butt
on flesh and the cry abruptly stops.

INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY

In the middle of the hut is an American kitchen table with a
rose-patterned plastic top. At opposite ends of the table are
two chairs. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONER sits in one of the
chairs. In the other chair, facing him, is MERLE.
The SOUTH VIETNAMESE has a welt on his head and one of the
half-dozen V.C. GUARDS in the hut is screaming at him. In the
middle of the table, between the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and MERLE,
is a single-action .45 caliber revolver with an American
eagle carved on its ivory grip.

MERLE sits quietly, waiting, but his eyes are working, taking
in every detail of the scene. The V.C. GUARD gives the SOUTH
VIETNAMESE a final cuff, takes up the revolver with a
dramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber.
Immediately the OTHER GUARDS begin placing bets. The GUARDS
are a ragged bunch -- wet, half-drunk on captured Budweiser,
and it takes some time to straighten things out.

MERLE looks off to his right:

INT. THATCHED HUT - REVERSE ANGLE - DAY

We see more SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN prisoners standing
against the wall. Most of them have been badly beaten and all
have their elbows tied behind their backs. In among them,
standing beside one another, are NICK and SAL. NICK looks
grey, like a skinny ghost. SAL is out of control, sobbing
quietly.

INT. THATCHED HUT - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAY

The betting is now completed. The V.C. in charge waves the
.45 around and calls for silence. Then, closing the cylinder
containing the single bullet, he points the revolver at the
ceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until the
revolver goes off with a ROAR. Bits of thatch flutter down
from the ceiling. The V.C. GUARDS shout enthusiastically and
grin.

MERLE sits motionless. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE across the table
from him begins shaking uncontrollably.

The V.C. in charge now reloads the revolver with one
cartridge, snaps the cylinder shut, puts the gun on the table
between MERLE and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and gives it a good
spin.

The revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing at
MERLE. MERLE stares at it for a long beat. Then he picks it
up, spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and
pulls the trigger. The hammer falls on an empty chamber with
a loud CLICK.

MERLE places the revolver back on the table and pushes it
toward the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE begins to
tremble again. Fumbling horribly he finally manages to get
the gun in his hand. He spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer
and puts the gun to his temple. The gun weaves around.
The SOUTH VIETNAMESE closes his eyes and pulls the trigger.
There is a loud CLICK.

MERLE takes the revolver again. He spins it, cocks it -- all
in one smooth motion -- puts it to his temple and pulls the
trigger. There is another CLICK.

MERLE pushes the gun back across the table. This time the
SOUTH VIETNAMESE takes it up with sudden confidence. He spins
the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls on
the trigger.

THERE IS A ROAR. THE PISTOL IS FLYING IN THE AIR AND THEN THE
MAN'S HEAD, HALF-EXPLODED, CRASHES OVER ONTO THE KITCHEN
TABLE.

MERLE doesn't even blink. The GUARDS begin hooting and
laughing, wiping pieces of brain from their clothes, and
MERLE watches them, watches every gesture, every movement...
like a cat.

EXT. THATCHED HUT - LATER DAY

A pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain. The
bodies are both SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their heads
are all variously blown to pieces and SEVERAL HUGE RATS are
already feeding on them.

INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY

NICK is at the table now, opposite a SOUTH VIETNAMESE. He
holds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder. His face is
twitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are
holding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it for
a long time.

NICK raises the pistol to his temple, CLICKS OUT. The GUARDS
murmur. NICK pushes the pistol across the table.

INT. THATCHED HUT - PRISONER END - DAY

There are no Americans left to play except SAL. The sobbing
has stopped but SAL is shaking and trembling and his eyes
wander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose.
MERLE, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk to
SAL. As he does so we hear the CLICKS coming from across the
room and the excited MURMURS of the GUARDS as their betting
choice survives another round.

			MERLE 
	You can do it, Sal.

			SAL 
	No. No, no.

			MERLE 
	Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have
	to do it.

			SAL
	I want to go home, Merle.

			MERLE 
	You have to think about this, Sal.
	Listen to me, Sal! You have to
	think about this.

			SAL 
		(tears again)
	This is horrible!

			MERLE 
	Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do
	it they'll put you in the pit. If
	they put you in the pit, Sal,
	you're gonna die... Sal, do you
	understand?

			SAL 
		(nods)
	Merle, I wanna go home!

There is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'S
eyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDS
open a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him and
the GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor.

			MERLE 
	Listen to me, Sal. Do it! You have
	to do it!

The GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and drags
him of f to the table.

INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY

SAL is thrown in the chair. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE is placed
opposite him. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE is a kid, even younger
than SAL, and he is trembling with terror.

			SAL 
	Hey, listen, you can do it. 
		(Sal nods, smiles)
	Believe me, you can do it. We can
	both do it. Then we go home, see?
	Then we go home!

SAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle
comes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH
VIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his
eyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and then
SAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTH
VIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around,
cocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and the
SOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE IS
TAKING HIS FAITH STRAIGHT OUT OF SAL'S EYES AND NOW SAL GIVES
HIM ANOTHER ENCOURAGING NOD.

The SOUTH VIETNAMESE BOY squeezes the trigger. THERE IS AN
EXPLOSION AND HIS HEAD DISINTEGRATES WITH A ROAR.

SAL sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed
in an expression of terrible puzzlement. Then his face begins
to move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to
discover a frown. SAL looks around. He looks back again at
the place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry.

INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - FOLLOWING DAY

A half-dozen SOUTH VIETNAMESE sit huddled together in the
muck on the uphill side. A seventh lies sprawled on his back,
DEAD. The rain pours through the few leaves placed on the
roof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the
floor.

On the downhill side are SAL, NICK and MERLE. SAL is in a
fetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back
and forth. His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an
expression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at
the table blow himself away. Beside SAL is NICK. NICK sits
slumped against the bamboo. One knee is raised and he is
picking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn
at the knee.

MERLE IS STANDING, GRIPPING THE BAMBOO WALLS OF THE CAGE AND
LOOKING OUT AT THE "PITS".

EXT. THE PITS - MERLE'S POV - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

The pits are about twenty feet away. Running mud and water
gurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on the
downhill side. There are fewer hands than the day before, far
fewer. The nearest pit only has one pair and as MERLE watches
he sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip.

SUDDENLY ONE OF THE HANDS SLIPS AWAY. THE HAND COMES BACK FOR
A MOMENT, THEN BOTH HANDS DISAPPEAR.

INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE turns away from the "pits". He looks down at SAL, then
he looks at NICK. His expression is one of exasperation, as
if he had been having a long argument.

			MERLE 
	I'm telling you, Nick, no one's
	going to come.

			NICK 
	What are you, God?

			MERLE
	Listen, asshole, it's up to us!

			NICK 
	They bombed last night, right?
	Didn't they bomb? If they bombed
	last night, they could bomb
	tonight. They could be up there
	right now!

			MERLE 
	What are you, hoping?

			NICK 
	What else?

			MERLE 
	I thought you might be praying.

			NICK 
	I'm doing that too.

			MERLE 
	I suppose you wish you were
	somewhere else?

			NICK 
	What do you think?

			MERLE 
	Nick, you're wasting your time...
	Listen to me! You're wasting your
	time! This is no fucking time for
	hoping or praying or wishing or any
	other shit! This is it. Here we
	are... And we gotta get out!

			NICK 
	You're right... Okay, you're right.

			MERLE 
		(grabs him)
	Get off your ass, Nick. Get off
	your fucking ass and stand up!!!

			NICK
		(stands)
	Okay, okay!
		(he straightens his
		shoulders)
	Okay. Okay, you're right... What
	about Sal?

			MERLE 
	Forget Sal.

			NICK 
	What do you mean?

			MERLE 
	I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take
	it, Nick.

			NICK 
	Forget Sal?

			MERLE 
	Forget Sal... Listen to me --
	forget Sal! I've been working on
	Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a
	dream and he won't come out.
	LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go
	for you. You hear me? For you!

			NICK 
	Merle...

			MERLE 
	LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR
	HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD
	TOO!

A shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE
whip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn.

Through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the V.C. GUARDS
coming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all
drinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the
pearl-handled revolver.

NICK looks at MERLE. The sight has totally unnerved him.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(calm)
	We gotta play with more bullets.

			NICK 
	We what?

			MERLE 
	We gotta play with more bullets,
	Nick. It's the only way.

			NICK 
	More bullets in the gun?

			MERLE 
		(even)
	More bullets in the gun... The
	trouble is that still leaves one of
	us with his hands tied up, so that
	means we gotta play each other.

			NICK 
		(numb)
	With more bullets?... Against each
	other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you
	fucking nuts!!!

			MERLE 
	Nick... NICK!!! It's the only
	chance we've got!

NICK stares at MERLE. Rain is pouring off them in rivulets
and the VOICES of the approaching GUARDS are getting louder.

			NICK 
	How many bullets?

			MERLE
		(watching him)
	Three bullets -- minimum.

			NICK 
		(panic)
	No way. No fucking way!

			MERLE 
		(evenly, holding him with
		his eyes)
	I'll pick the moment, Nick. The
	game goes on until I move. When I
	start shooting, go for the nearest
	guard and get his gun.

			NICK 
	No. No way!

			MERLE
	When you get the AK, open up. You
	got me? Open up.

			NICK
		(screaming)
	YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW
	YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY
	CRAZY!!!

The GUARDS begin screaming orders from outside the cage and
ONE OF THEM lets off a blast of automatic rifle fire which
shreds the bamboo roof just above the PRISONERS' heads. NICK
and MERLE grab SAL and drag him to the door.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

As the PRISONERS emerge from the "tiger cage" the GUARDS
smash them with their rifle butts, screaming orders. In the
melee SAL is separated from NICK and MERLE, both of whom are
knocked to the ground by furious blows. When they get to
their feet they see that SAL is wandering off alone in the
direction of the "pits". One of the GUARDS spots SAL and
clubs him down.

SAL gets up and begins wandering off again. The GUARD clubs
him down again, turns to the GUARD IN CHARGE and begins
complaining. The GUARD IN CHARGE dispatches a SECOND GUARD to
help the FIRST and the TWO GUARDS open the bamboo grating on
one of the "pits".

MERLE turns to NICK, who is standing beside him.

			MERLE 
	It's up to you, Nick. Now it's up
	to you.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - THE "PITS" - DAY

SAL has absolutely no comprehension of what is about to
happen to him. His eyes are dreamy, far away, as if he had
mentally transported himself to some distant place. There are
great gashes in his head from the blows he has received and
as he stands waiting in the pouring rain he looks exactly
like a very small child who has experienced some terrible
confusion.

Suddenly the GUARD standing beside SAL wrenches him around.

We see the pit now, CLOSE UP. There are four bloated CORPSES
floating in the muck.

We SAL'S FACE, CLOSE UP. He gives a CRY and tries to turn
away.

We see the GUARDS pick SAL up, SCREAMING. We see the SPLASH
as SAL hits the water and then we see him surface between the
bloated CORPSES, STILL SCREAMING, paddling desperately and
trying to find something solid to hod him up.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - WAITING PRISONERS - DAY

NICK stands motionless, stunned, listening to SAL'S SCREAMS.
MERLE has his attention focused on the GUARD IN CHARGE and
when he glances in their direction MERLE slugs NICK in the
stomach and begins beating him furiously to the ground. NICK
struggles to his feet. MERLE attacks him again and now, as
the GUARD IN CHARGE comes over to see what's going on, MERLE
begins hopping up and down, pointing at NICK, pointing at the
revolver in the GUARD'S hand and screaming.

			MERLE
	Him and me!!! Him and me!!!

The GUARDS look at each other, interested.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Him and me, goddamn it! Him and me!

INT. THATCHED HUT - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE and NICK sit facing one another across the rose
patterned kitchen table. The GUARDS are all grinning and even
the SOUTH VIETNAMESE are watching with grim fascination. NICK
has the revolver. He is trembling visibly. Already MERLE has
managed to draw the GUARDS in closer and as NICK spins the
cylinder and cocks the hammer MERLE jumps up and begins
pounding on the table.

			MERLE 
	This is it, motherfuckers! Now he's
	going to do it! Watch! You watch!

NICK almost loses what little control is left and his hand
begins shaking violently.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Look at him! See! This is it and he
	knows it!

Side bets begin changing hands.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Last chance to lose your money
	there, guys. Goodbye money! Hurry,
	hurry. Here he goes!

NICK puts the revolver against his temple and pulls the
trigger. There is a dull CLICK.

NICK puts the revolver back on the table. His hand is shaking
so badly it falls with a clunk. MERLE grabs it, spins it,
sticks it to his temple and CLICKS OUT, talking all the time:

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	This is stupid! You understand
	stupid? On and on! At this rate
	we'll still be here tomorrow!
		(throws the revolver on
		the table)
	Wait a minute. I know! Hey, I got
	it. More! Put in more! You
	understand more? More! More
	bullets!
		(he mimes with his
		fingers)
	Three bullets! You understand
	three? That way BLAM! BOOM!

MERLE hops up and down, laughing maniacally.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	KA-POWIE!!! BA-ROOM!!!... 'Cause I
	want that bastard! Him I want boom!
	Him or me!!!

The GUARD IN CHARGE looks at his COMPANIONS. They all begin
shouting for him to go ahead. The GUARD IN CHARGE purses his
lips, as if imitating a general coming to a decision, and
then nods his assent. The GUARDS all howl. MERLE joins right
in.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	He's terrific! Great fucking guy!

The GUARD IN CHARGE takes the revolver, opens the cylinder
and begins sticking in two more cartridges.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	KA-POW!!! BA-ROOMIE!!!

MERLE hops up and down again, then screams at NICK, jabbing
his finger at him, as if in fury.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Both of us may have to pull on
	this, so get your shit in fuckin'
	shape!!!
		(to the GUARDS)
	Him or me!!! Now we got it, him or
	me!!!
		(he rubs his hands and
		sits back down)
	Place your bets, motherfuckers! Now
	we're going! Now we got a game!

The GUARD IN CHARGE places the revolver on the table, spins
it.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Watch! Now watch! He's going to get
	it. And then KA-POW! BA-ROOMIE!!!

The muzzle stops pointing at MERLE. MERLE scowls, looks over
at the GUARD IN CHARGE. The GUARD IN CHARGE has lifted the
barrel of his AK 47 and is watching him with caution. The
OTHER GUARDS, who are totally caught up in the game, are
yelling and shouting.

			MERLE 
	You guys think I'm in trouble,
	right?

MERLE picks up the revolver, spins the cylinder, cocks it...

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	No way! Never!!!
		(he begins to chant)
	MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!
	MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!
	MERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA!
	MERLE LIVES LONG!
	Lemme hear it. Come on,
	motherfuckers, lemme hear it!

MERLE starts it again. The GUARDS who are bett ing on him
JOIN IN:

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(with GUARDS)
	MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!
	MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!
	MERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA!
	MERLE LIVES LONG!

MERLE takes a glance at the GUARD IN CHARGE again. The GUARD
IN CHARGE is still eyeing him with caution.

MERLE places the revolver to his temple... and CLICKS into an
empty chamber.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	See! Nothing to it.

He pushes the gun across to NICK. Then he stabs his finger at
him, screaming again, as if in a fit of rage.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	You got an empty chamber and it's
	in your mind! Just put that empty
	chamber in the gun!

NICK looks down at the revolver and picks it up. He stares at
MERLE for a moment. Then he spins the cylinder, cocks the
hammer, Puts it to his head... and CLICKS into an empty
chamber.

The GUARDS let out expressions of disbelief. Those betting on
NICK begin taunting those betting on MERLE.

MERLE sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated,
his brow furrowed in a mighty frown.

NICK pushes the revolver across the table. His face is
twitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if
throwing back a challenge.

MERLE stares at the revolver -- stares at it with an
expression of utter gloom. Then he reaches out, takes the
revolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no
longer possessed the strength to pick it up.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(gloom)
	Who's for Merle?
		(he thumps his fist on the
		table)
	Is anyone for Merle???

MERLE roams a glowering eve over the watching GUARDS, as if
suddenly discovering himself among traitors. Slowly, he
pushes himself to his feet. The gun is still on the table,
still in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his body
sag over it.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Who here is for Merle...?

There is absolute silence now except for the drumming of the
rain. It is as if the war had disappeared, vanished. The
GUARDS stand motionless, hardly breathing, so captivated by
MERLE'S performance that they suddenly resemble little
children.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Who... here... is for Merle...?

MERLE begins his chant again. His voice is low, very
dramatic, and the GUARD IN CHARGE joins right in.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(with GUARDS)
	MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!
	MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!
	MERLE IS MAGIC -- HA!

MERLE snaps the revolver level in his hand and BLASTS the
GUARD IN CHARGE, hitting him full in the face. At the same
time NICK throws himself into the GUARD who is standing
behind him, spins and slams the GUARD'S AK 47 into his chin.
TWO MORE SHOTS BLAST OUT FROM MERLE'S .45 and we see TWO
GUARDS crash over the kitchen table. NICK now opens up with
AK 47, and as MERLE backs off beside him, also with an AK 47,
they GUN the remaining GUARDS to the floor.

It is over in an instant. The BODIES lie in a bloody, tangled
mess under a pathetic paper lantern. The rain drones on --
uninterrupted, undiminished, eternal...

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

Barely visible against the dripping foliage -- like a shadow 
is a startled V.C. SOLDIER. The man takes a half-step
forward, unslings his rifle and OPENS FIRE.

INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY

The SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONERS are hit where they stand. NICK
spins, BADLY WOUNDED. MERLE throws himself on the floor and
lets go with the AK 47.

EXT. BAMBOO GROVE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE appears carrying NICK on his back. NICK is unconscious
and the effort that MERLE has expended to get him this far
can be measured in MERLE'S eves, which burn like dead coals.
As MERLE approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the
side of a steep hill, we suddenly see SAL, stumbling along
behind and attached to MERLE by a short rope.

MERLE comes to a stop, unshoulders NICK and lays him on the
ground. As MERLE stands looking at NICK, gasping for breath,
SAL hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo
with an expression of pure terror.

			SAL 
	Where are we going, Merle? Are we
	going home?

There is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible.
MERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across his
mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK.

For a moment there is nothing -- silence. The rain drones on
and we can hear NICK'S breath, which comes in short, shallow
rasps.

The sound comes again and suddenly a PLATOON OF V.C. SOLDIERS
appear, coming down through the trees. Their passage is
almost completely silent and they go by on both sides, moving
down the hill.

CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON MERLE'S FACE. His gums are bleeding
and his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in
his skull. His teeth are bared, his eyes are hollow and he
looks within a hair's breadth of being completely mad.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - NIGHT

A huge battle is taking place nearby. The earth trembles and
shakes and gigantic explosions intermittently light the sky.

MERLE staggers down a ravine with NICK, loses his footing and
slides to the bottom where he lies in the mud, motionless,
too tired to move.

SAL comes down behind. He is hunched over, like a gnome. The
rope which MERLE has tied around his neck drags in the mud
and his eyes are huge with terror.

			SAL 
	Merle?

			MERLE
		(a whisper)
	Right here.

SAL crouches down in the mud.

			SAL 
	Where are we going, Merle? Are we
	going home?

			MERLE 
		(barely moving his lips)
	Right here.

Another explosion lights the sky, this one much closer. In
the flash we see that a red American car is stranded in the
middle of the road. There is another explosion and another
flash. The car is dusty, spattered with mud, but otherwise it
appears miraculously unharmed.

NICK'S breath rattles in his throat. MERLE, who lies beside
NICK, holding him, has closed his eyes. SAL, who is the only
one who has seen the car, stares at it hard, and for a long
time, trying it out with one eye and then the other.

			SAL 
	Merle?

No answer.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Merle?

Still no answer. SAL goes over to MERLE and shakes him.
Getting no response he crosses fearfully toward the
automobile. When he gets to within a foot of it, he reaches
out and touches it.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Merle. Merle, a car!

As the flashes continue to light up the sky, SAL peers at the
tires and begins kicking them.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Hey! Hey, gee!

SAL crosses to the window and looks in. There is no damage
whatsoever, the keys are dangling from the ignition. SAL
pulls open the door and climbs in. He pumps the accelerator,
hits the starter...

THERE IS A FLASH OF FIRE, THEN A HUGE EXPLOSION AND THE CAR
GOES UP IN A FIREBALL OF FLAME.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - BURNING CAR - NIGHT

MERLE has dragged SAL from the car and thrown him in the
ditch below NICK. SAL is horribly burned and MERLE kneels
over him -- out of breath, tears streaming from his cavernous
eyes -- howling with helpless rage.

			MERLE
	Damn it!!! God damn it!!!

MERLE looks down at SAL. SAL'S face in a mass of raw flesh
but his eyes look up at MERLE with lunatic, unwavering trust.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Sal!
		(more gently)
	Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you
	know anything?

			SAL
	Where are we going, Merle? Are we
	going home?

			MERLE
		(nods)
	Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - FOLLOWING DAY

REFUGEES are streaming down the road in a desperate,
frightened human torrent. There is every imaginable means of
conveyance -- from bullock carts to motorbikes -- but the
vast majority, carrying their meager belongings, are fleeing
on foot. The burned-out car is still in the middle of the
road and the great human tide streams around it, as if it
were an island. In the distance comes the sound of machine
gun fire and mortars are coming in nearby. MEDVAC helicopters
clatter overhead with wounded strapped to baskets on the
skids. Now and then an ARMY CONVOY comes through, blasting
the REFUGEES into the ditch.

MERLE sits alone on the embankment by the side of the road.
NICK and SAL are gone and the area is littered with fresh
bandage packages and throw-away medical supplies. Suddenly a
jeep pulls up with a two-star GENERAL in it.

			GENERAL
	Where's your unit, soldier?

MERLE stares at the GENERAL -- blankly, without
comprehension. Finally, after a long moment, he gives a
slight shrug.

			GENERAL 
		(to his DRIVER)
	C'mon. We'll take him along.

The GENERAL and the DRIVER get out and start up the
embankment toward MERLE.

			GENERAL (CONT'D)
	Little R and R and you'll be
	standing tall again, son... Damn,
	this is steep!

			DRIVER 
	Uh-oh. Sir.

The GENERAL looks up at MERLE. MERLE is holding the pearl
handled revolver and he cocks the hammer with an audible
click.

			GENERAL 
	Uh-oh.

The GENERAL and the DRIVER turn tail, scramble back down the
embankment and pile in the jeep.

			GENERAL (CONT'D)
		(as they take off)
	Y'know, there's more fucking
	maniacs coming out of this
	conflict...

MERLE watches them go without expression. On the road below
the REFUGEES stream past -- by the hundreds, by the
thousands, by the tens of thousands. For a long moment MERLE
watches, then he jams the gun in his pants and stands.

EXT. EVACUATION ROUTE - DAY

MERLE is walking with the fleeing REFUGEES. CAMERA PANS,
HOLDING ON MERLE as he grows smaller and smaller -- to a
speck in the vast human torrent.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - SAIGON - DAY

The room is tiny, a cubicle furnished with a chair. NICK is
alone, standing at the window looking out. He wears ill
fitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for-the
pallor of his skin. Around his neck is a piece of plastic on
which is stapled a colored paper marker. Departing aircraft
thunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby
hydraulic mechanism.

EXT. LOADING RAMP (NICK'S POV) - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY

Black BODY BAGS are laid out in countless rows on the hot
concrete TWO PFC's are stacking them on pallets and MORE
PFC's, driving hydraulic LIFTERS, are loading the pallets
into the cavernous hold of a huge JET TRANSPORT.

INT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY

NICK turns away from the window and sits down in the chair.
Suddenly the door bursts open and a harassed DOCTOR comes in.

			DOCTOR
	Is your name Solomon?

NICK shakes his head.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	Are you sure?

NICK nods.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	Lemme see this.

The DOCTOR looks at the paper marker on NICK's neck.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	Is this yours?

NICK nods.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	This isn't yours. This can't be
	yours! I'm going to take this one
	off and cut it up...
		(he extracts a pair of
		scissors and does so)
	Shred it... so no one gets a hold
	of it. What I'm going to do now,
	I'm going to give you this one.
		(he staples a new marker
		around NICK's neck)
	There. How's that? Does that feel
	better?

NICK nods. The DOCTOR directs a finger at him.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	That one's yours.

The DOCTOR slams back out the door. Another jet thunders
overhead. The hydraulic LIFTERS on the loading ramp shriek
and whine...

NICK reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers
down at it from the corner of his eye. It seems to remind him
of something and he takes out his wallet. In his wallet is a
PHOTOGRAPH of LINDA. NICK peers at the photograph intently,
then closes his wallet and puts it away.

INT. U.S. ARMY TELEPHONE CENTER - SAIGON - DAY

Banks of telephones line the wall. Stretching out from the
telephones are long, ragged lines of SERVICEMEN waiting to
call home. The room is huge, full of echoes. Re-enlistment
posters are plastered everywhere and CANNED LATIN MUSIC is
playing.

NICK stands in one of the lines with only one person in front
of him. He looks anxious. He takes out his wallet again,
peers intently at LINDA'S PHOTOGRAPH, then puts it back.
NICK takes a half-step forward -- staring at the telephone --
and then he stops, frozen with fear.

			GUM CHEWER BEHIND 
	Go on, babe. Take it. 'S all yours!

			NICK
		(mumbles)
	You go ahead.

CAMERA HOLDS ON NICK as he turns out of the line and heads
for the exit under a long row of CLOCKS.

EXT. BUSY STREET - SAIGON - DAY

NICK comes along the sidewalk in a CROWD OF PEDESTRIANS. He
is drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting
along for hours. As he comes to a stop, staring at a SOUTH
VIETNAMESE who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket
for a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the
gutter. Suddenly, across the street, something catches his
eye.

			NICK 
		(calling)
	Sal...! Sal!!!

NICK throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even
looking.

Vehicles swerve and screech to a stop. NICK dodges between
them, gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand
on the back of a passing SOLDIER. The SOLDIER turns. It is
not SAL at all and the resemblance is not even close.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Sorry... Thought you were someone
	else.

The SOLDIER continues on his way. The CROWD streams on, a sea
of bobbing, brilliant color. NICK gropes in his pocket and
produces another pint bottle. He unscrews the cap and downs a
long swallow.

INT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT

The place is very dark. LOUD MUSIC is playing. Partially-clad
BAR GIRLS are dancing with the CUSTOMERS, while above, on a
kind of trapeze, NAKED GIRLS are performing obscene
contortions.

NICK sits at one of the tables. By now he is very drunk and a
BAR GIRL is giving him her undivided attention.

			NICK 
	I love Linda, see. I love Linda
	more than I can even say.

			BAR GIRL 
	Everybody love Linda.

			NICK 
	That's right. That's exactly what I
	mean!

			BAR GIRL 
	I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda
	so much!

			NICK 
	Only,good people love Linda, see.
	What Linda has, Linda --

			BAR GIRL 
		(in his ear)
	How you like to have nice fuck with
	Linda? You like that? Special,
	crazy fuck just like with Linda?

			NICK 
		(stares at her)
	You mean...?

			BAR GIRL 
	I show you. Come. You come. 
		(pulls him to his feet)
	Linda have special, crazy fuck.
	That right?

NICK nods. He looks as if he might be about to cry.

			BAR GIRL (CONT'D)
	I give you special, crazy fuck,
	just like Linda. Come. You come.
	Linda cry, make crazy moan?

NICK nods.

			BAR GIRL (CONT'D)
	I give you cry, crazy moan. Come.
	You come.

INT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT

The BAR GIRL comes around the corner with NICK, guiding him
to a flight of narrow stairs. She has one hand around his
waist and the other down the front of his pants.

			BAR GIRL
	You like to call me Linda now?

			NICK 
	Linda, yeah.

			BAR GIRL 
	You call me Linda, just like home.

Suddenly NICK draws to a stop, staring at a small window at
the end of the corridor. He tears himself loose from the BAR
GIRL and pushes up against the glass.

EXT. NARROW STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

Seated on the sidewalk against the wall of the opposite
building is an OLD MAN surrounded by a collection of white
ceramic elephants. A truck roars by in front of him.
Motorcycles sputter past and PEDESTRIANS hurry in both
directions. The OLD MAN sits motionless, like the guardian of
some timeless, silent kingdom.

INT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT

NICK spins away from the window.

			NICK 
	Hey... Hey, elephants! Look at
	those elephants!

The BAR GIRL stares at him.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Linda loves elephants! Linda... she
	loves 'em!

NICK turns and charges back down the corridor with the BAR
GIRL hot on his tail.

			BAR GIRL 
	Wait! First I give you special
	fuck!

			NICK 
	Elephants! Make way... I gotta get
	elephants!

EXT. NARROW STREET - NIGHT

NICK paces up and down in front of the OLD MAN and his
ceramic elephants.

			NICK 
	Great... These are great. I wanna
	tell you these are great elephants!
	I'm going home, see... Stateside in
	a few days and my wife Linda, she
	loves elephants. She... she has a
	thing for elephants because
	elephants... Elephants go on. You
	know what I mean? They go right on.
	I don't know if they cry. Maybe at
	night. I mean... What I mean is my
	two best buddies are dead, see,
	MIA, who knows, and they would have
	liked some elephants also
	because... How much are these
	elephants? I mean let's talk
	elephant.
		(notices a GROUP OF STREET
		URCHINS)
	Hey you guys...! Over here! Come
	over here and carry elephants!

The STREET URCHINS come running. They are ragged,
malnourished, ranging in age from about six to nine. They are
covered with sores. One of them ~as lost an eye and another
has lost a hand.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Everyone take an elephant!
		(to the YOUNGEST URCHIN)
	You know how to carry an elephant?
		(the URCHIN nods)
	That's what I thought. Right off I
	figured you as that kind of guy.
	Hey, wait a minute, I gotta get
	change. Take an elephant! Everyone
	take an elephant and then form up.
	Right here. Over here, like this,
	in a nice long elephant line...
	Good. That's good. Man, look at all
	these elephants! One, two, three,
	four, five, six, seven, eight,
	nine, ten... eleven elephants!
		(surveys them)
	Hey, but you gotta stand tall to
	carry elephants.
		(he illustrates)
	Better. That's better. I mean...
	God damn, I mean that's elephants
	now! Wait. Now you wait while I get
	change.

NICK dives into a nearby bar.

INT. NEARBY BAR - NIGHT

The place is as dark as the one before. MUSIC BLASTS from a
jukebox and two vaseline-covered GIRLS are dancing. As NICK
crosses to the bar to get change there is a WHISTLING SCREAM
and then the FRONT WALL OF THE BUILDING DISINTEGRATES IN A
ROAR OF NOISE.

NICK pulls himself out of the debris. There is absolute
silence in the WRECKED BAR but rockets are coming in all over
the city and the EXPLOSIONS rumble and roar.

EXT. NARROW STREET AFTER ROCKET EXPLOSION - NIGHT

A nearby building is burning fiercely. The street is deserted
except for the sprawled CORPSES of the STREET URCHINS which
lie this way and that, like broken dolls.

NICK walks out past the CORPSES. The street is littered with
fragments of broken ceramic -- gleaming, pure white, like
chunks of snow.

EXT. DESERTED STREET - SAIGON - NIGHT

The sky is alight with fires. Now and then HUGE EXPLOSIONS
rock the night and SIRENS wail.

A lone figure appears, walking down the middle of the street.
As the figure approaches we see that it is NICK.

			NICK
		(toneless, over and over)
	Hey, hey, the wind does blow. 
	Hey, hey, the snow does snow. 
	Hey, hey, the rain does rain...

NICK swallows, as if to force back some overwhelming emotion.
Then, squatting down under a lamp post, he begins again.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Hey, hey, the wind does blow.
	Hey, hey, the snow does snow...

NICK takes out his wallet, opens it hurriedly to the
PHOTOGRAPH OF LINDA and peers at it with a kind of ferocious
determination, as if this link were the last, as if by
staring at it hard he could make it hold.

			NICK (CONT'D)
		(his voice thin, cracking)
	Hey, hey, the wind does blow.
	Hey, hey, the snow does snow --

There is the sharp report of a pistol SHOT and then, as NICK
spins, staring at a shuttered building, there is the
unmistakable sound of APPLAUSE.

NICK stares at the building for a long moment, then he
crosses toward it.

EXT. YARD BEHIND BUILDING - SAIGON - NIGHT

A tiny light glows inside a paper lantern. Lying on the
around are three CORPSES, all of them Asian, all of them
expensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown
off. As NICK stands looking at them a door comes open on the
back of the building,and TWO BURLY MEN bring out another
corpse. The body is that of a young American. Like the Asians
he is expensively dressed and he is dead from a bullet in the
right temple.

			MAN (V.O.)
	If you are brave and lucky I can
	make you rich.

NICK turns. A MAN is standing in the shadows of a small grape
arbor, eyeing him with a look of cold amusement. The MAN'S
accent is French. Beside him, on a small white table, is a
bottle of champagne and several glasses.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	You have played?

NICK stares at the MAN, nods.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	Once you have played it is not so
	hard. Cigarette?

NICK shakes his head.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	You seem... disturbed.

			NICK
	I... No. You do this for money?

			MAN 
	Mais certainment... A great deal of
	money. Naturally I do not do it
	myself. I myself do not possess the
	nerve.
		(smiles)
	But I am always... how do you
	say... looking out for those who
	do... It is a thing quite rare.
	Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't
	say no. When a man says no to
	champagne, he says no to life and
	that no man must ever do.
		(gives NICK a glass)
	Where did you play?

			NICK 
	Up north.

			MAN 
	Ah yes. Of course... So few
	survive.
		(smiles)
	La creme de la creme... How did you
	obtain release?

			NICK 
	Playing.

			MAN
		(raises his eyebrows)
	Playing?

			NICK
	We... Three bullets.

			MAN 
	And then you...

The MAN makes a clicking sound, three times, as if firing a
pistol. NICK nods.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	How extremely clever. That is
	really most extraordinaire... Allow
	me please to introduce myself. I am
	Armand... And you are?

			NICK 
	Nick.

			ARMAND 
	Nick. C'est extraordinaire! Do you
	know that I have a cousin who is
	called Nicholas and a nephew
	Nickolai. So you are, comme on dit,
	en famille. In the family.

There is another SHOT from inside and another round of
APPLAUSE.

			NICK 
	I have to go.

			ARMAND 
	But you must come in.

			NICK 
	No, I --

			ARMAND 
	But I insist.

			NICK 
	I have to go.

			ARMAND 
	You are frightened, no?

NICK nods.

			ARMAND (CONT'D)
	Of what is there to be afraid? The
	war? The war is no problem. It is a
	joke, a silly thing. I make one
	call and get you out.

ARMAND refills NICK's glass. NICK looks at it. The glass is
as thin as paper and the sparkling bubbles dance and hiss.
NICK lifts the glass and empties in one swallow.

			NICK 
	See, I'm going home.

			ARMAND 
	Ah yes. Of course.
		(smiles)
	To the girl who waits.

			NICK 
		(gives him a look and
		sits)
	Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?

			ARMAND 
	But of course! Please make yourself
	comfortable. Perhaps you would
	enjoy some fresh caviar, or une
	petite glace, or --?

			NICK 
		(weary, shaking his head)
	No. None of that.

			ARMAND 
	Unfortunately I must now go in, but
	I leave you my card. Naturellement
	I pay my players cash American.
	Just so you know.

ARMAND disappears in the darkness. Then his VOICE comes
again.

			ARMAND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
	However, should you prefer German
	marks, or perhaps Swiss francs,
	this of course can be arranged.
	Everything can be arranged.

ARMAND moves around the side of the building and the sound of
his FOOTSTEPS fades away. The TWO BURLY MEN come lurching
with another CORPSE. Laughter comes from inside the building
and there is a glimpse of AN ELEGANTLY DRESSED WOMAN seated
at a cafe table. The BURLY MEN return to the door and shut it
tight. In the distance the sky goes up in a huge flash of
fire and then the sound of the EXPLOSION rolls across the
city like a great dead wind.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - WINTER - DUSK

The trailer is all decked out with bunting and stuck, like a
plum cake, with tiny American flags. Stretching from the
trailer to the side of a house across the street is a huge,
hand-lettered banner which says "WELCOME HOME NICK!" and it
whips and it snaps in the cold winter wind.

NICK's battered old shark-finned Cadillac is in the yard.
Alongside it are a bunch of newer cars and PEOPLE are coming
from all directions, spilling in and out of the trailer and
congregating in excited, foot-stomping, half-frozen groups.

EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS - COLUMBINE AREA - DUSK

We see the OLD PRIEST on his way from the church. We see the
OLDER WOMEN, wrapped in shawls and carrying cakes and
cookies, trudging up the hill. We see ALBERT, JOHN and a
bunch of STEELWORKERS, all of them half-bombed, dragging two
cases of beer on a child's sled. We see LINDA peering out the
trailer window, pale and anxious-looking. We see VINCE, who
is unofficial lookout, jumping up and down at the approach of
every car and screaming, "This is it! This is Nick!" and
then, when it isn't, saying, "Not yet! Just hold your water,
I'll tell you when!"

And we see an empty street into which SIX VETS from the VFW
Post come tottering. The VETS are all in their old uniforms.
While three of them attempt to make MUSIC on a BASS DRUM, a
FIFE and an old Army BUGLE, the other three attempt to sing.

			VETS 
	Three cheers for the red, white and
	blue...!

			VET #1 
	This is hard.

			VET # 2 
	Christ Almighty, it's fifty years!

			VETS 
	Three cheers for the red, white and
	blue...

INT. TAXICAB - DUSK

NICK sits hunched forward in the back seat surrounded by
unwrapped cartons containing electric appliances he has
bought for LINDA. NICK looks nervous, VERY NERVOUS.

Suddenly, as the cab comes over the crest of a hill, the
trailer looms into sight, straight ahead, with VINCE hopping
up and down in the snow and the OLD VETS all marking time
under the flapping banner.

			CAB DRIVER 
	Whadda welcome! Will you lookit...
	Whadda welcome!

NICK stares at the approaching trailer.

			NICK 
	That's not it.

			CAB DRIVER 
	What're you, crazy? That's not
	it??? You said a trailer. You said--

			NICK 
	That's not it. Keep going. Go
	straight.

			CAB DRIVER 
	Hey, now listen. Now you said --

			NICK 
	I'm telling you that's not it! Now
	keep going!

NICK throws himself down on the floor.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Just keep going! Just keep going
	straight!

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK

LINDA is outside, standing with VINCE and ALBERT.

			VINCE 
	This is him. I'm telling you, this
	is Nick!

The TAXICAB comes thudding by. LINDA, VINCE and ALBERT all
watch as it disappears over a rise.

			ALBERT
		(to VINCE)
	I thought that was it.

			VINCE 
	So he's in the next one, Albert. I
	mean take it easy. I mean you're
	driving everybody nuts!

			VETS (V.O.)
		(singing raggedly)
	Three cheers for the red, white and
	blue...!

			VINCE
		(to LINDA)
	You okay?

LINDA gives a thin smile.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	It's gonna be the next one. Okay?

LINDA nods.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	It's gotta be the next one. I mean
	it's gotta be! Right, Albert?

			ALBERT
	Fuckin' A. It's gotta!

			VINCE
	It's gotta!

EXT. MOTEL - DUSK

A huge neon sign stands against the grey sky, buzzing
angrily, as if it were full of bees.

The TAXI DRIVER comes out of one of the units, gets back in
his cab and pulls away.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK

NICK stands in the doorway where the driver has left him. His
duffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled
along the wall by his feet. His head is thrown back and he is
draining a bottle of whiskey, gulping it down in great raw
swallows. .

NICK lowers the bottle, catches his breath and goes at it
again. This time, as he lowers the bottle, the stark panic is
gone, but there is still fear -- blind, nameless fear, like
that of an animal run to the ground.

NICK crosses to the window, grips the frame with both hands
and looks out.

EXT. THE STEEL MILL FROM THE MOTEL (NICK'S POV) - DUSK

The five great stacks trail ribbons of black smoke across the
pale winter sky, Steam billows upward in huge, silver-edged
clouds and there is the flash and gleam of fire.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK

NICK turns back to the room. He stares at it blankly --
stares at the bed, stares at the bureau, stares at the chair,
then he picks up the bottle, closes his eyes and begins
gulping down whiskey -- gulping it hard, fast, as hard and
fast as he can.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NEW ANGLE - DAWN

The banner stretching to the house across the street has been
whipped to shreds by the wind. In the yard, parked beside
NICK's black Cadillac, is another car of about the same
vintage. There is a case of beer on its roof, the windows are
entirely frosted over and the engine is running. After a
moment TWO STEELWORKERS come down the street and knock on the
trailer door. TWO OLDER WOMEN emerge, putting on their coats,
and then LINDA comes to the door and tells the STEELWORKERS
she has no news. The STEELWORKERS and the OLDER WOMEN start
off, but now one of the WOMEN points to the frosted up car.
The STEELWORKERS go back, pound on the roof of the frosted up
car, pull open a few doors and go on their way. First thing
out is a GIRL. Next thing out is a SECOND GIRL. Their dresses
are rumpled and half-undone. Neither one has a coat and the
SECOND GIRL is missing a shoe. The GIRLS both plunge back
inside the car, where howling and cursing can now be heard.
The GIRLS both retrieve their coats. The SECOND GIRL gets her
missing shoe, plus a bra and a pair of panties.
She returns the panties to the FIRST GIRL, puts on her shoe
and they both take off at a fast trot. As the two GIRLS leave
there is a cascade of empty beer cans and ALBERT, VINCE and
JOHN all stagger out -- bleary-eyed, hung-over, half
undressed and freezing. LINDA comes out of the trailer with
coffee, but just as she emerges the whistle at the mill goes
off. ALBERT and VINCE begin yelling at each other, yelling at
JOHN and yelling at LINDA. Then they throw themselves back in
the car and start off. The case of beer on the roof crashes
to the street. They stop, pile out, pick up the cans, heave
them in the back seat and take off again.

JOHN says something to LINDA and goes on his way.

LINDA stands in the yard, alone, with the three cups of
coffee.

EXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN

NICK stands half-way down a rickety wooden stairway,
watching.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAWN

LINDA turns and goes back inside the trailer.

EXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN

NICK swallows and starts down the stairway toward the
trailer. He hesitates, pulls the bottle from his pocket,
drains the last of it and tucks it under the stairs.
Straightening up, he claws at his hair, trying to comb it
with his fingers. Then he starts down again.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAWN

Cakes, cookies, six-packs of beer and bottles of wine cover
almost every inch of available space. LINDA sits on the
little settee, wedged between two cases of Coca-Cola and
hunched over a white sweater which she is attempting, with
painful slowness, to knit. LINDA is trying not to cry. She is
trying her God-damnedest.

There is a knock at the door. LINDA freezes. Then, trying to
be totally matter-of-fact, she puts down the sweater, crosses
to the door and opens it.

			NICK
	Guess who.

LINDA stares at him. NICK gives a little laugh and steps in.

			LINDA
		(throws herself in his
		arms)
	Nick! Oh, Nick, you're back!

She hugs him for a moment, as hard as she can, then they pull
apart.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought
	you were hurt, some accident. Maybe
	you fell or maybe some car...
		(back in his arms)
	I thought someone stole you away!

			NICK 
	No.

			LINDA 
	Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!

They pull apart.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	How are you?

			NICK 
	Fine. I'm fine. How are you?

			LINDA 
	Fine. I just go along, you know.
	Down at the market. Back here. I
	mean it just seems there's a
	million things to do!... Are you
	sure you're all right? I mean, what
	about the wound?

			NICK 
		(anger)
	That was nothing. That wasn't
	anything.

			LINDA 
	But --

			NICK 
	It was just the complications. I
	mean, you take a little thing over
	there and then you get
	complications. I mean all the guys
	had it.

			LINDA 
	I made you a sweater. 
		(she gets it)
	Here... You have to take that off.

NICK removes his coat. LINDA pulls the sweater over him

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	I couldn't remember your exact
	size.

The sweater is huge, a great rumpled thing reaching almost to
NICK's knees.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
		(smoothly)
	Oh, that's fine. Perfect... It is a
	little too big... 
		(she pulls the sweater
		back off)
	... but I can easily fix that.
	Easily. One thing about wool
	sweaters, they are such a cinch to
	fix.

She crosses to a garbage pail out of NICK's line of sight and
stuffs the sweater in it.

			NICK 
	How's the trailer?

			LINDA 
	Great. Fine... Once or twice it did
	fall off the blocks. I don't know
	what that's from.

			NICK 
	Frost.

			LINDA 
	Is that what it is? I couldn't
	figure out.

			NICK 
	Did you get hurt? You didn't get
	hurt?

			LINDA 
	Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump.
	Would you like a Coke? You don't
	drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What
	about champagne? Let's have
	champagne! I don't think we have
	champagne. Let's have this. See?
	Sparkling. I'll get you an opener.
	Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's
	just have beer. Do you want some
	cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we
	should have coffee.

She begins to sob. CAMERA CLOSES ON HER FACE:

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Nick? I'm so glad you're alive! I'm
	so happy! I... I just don't know
	what to do!

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

NICK and LINDA are some distance away. NICK is shaking hands
with an ENTHUSIASTIC MAN while LINDA stands to one side,
watching his face, and so full of love that she seems about
to burst. ANOTHER MAN comes over. LINDA takes the MAN's arm
and presents him to NICK.

WE CANNOT HEAR WHAT IS BEING SAID. THE ONLY SOUND COMES FROM
THE MILL WHICH LOOMS UP BEHIND THEM OUT THE FROZEN VALLEY
BELOW.

INT. PIZZA PARLOR - TABLE BY WINDOW - DAY

NICK and LINDA sit opposite one another. Across the street a
coal train is rumbling slowly by and NICK is watching it. The
cars are black, interchangable, and they roll on and on.
Suddenly the last car appears. The car passes and there is
silence.

LINDA gives NICK a smile.

			NICK 
	It was all for nothing. Do you know
	that? It was all for nothing.

LINDA stares at him. She doesn't know what to say, how to
respond. NICK forces a grin, gestures with his hand and
shrugs. He picks up the check, stands.

			LINDA 
	Nick?... I just want to say how
	sorry I am about Sal and about
	Merle. How... I know you loved them
	and I know it's not the same. I
	mean now.

			NICK
	Naw, it's... I mean...

			LINDA 
	Maybe... I don't know, if you want
	to talk --

			NICK 
	Naw, it's... This guy wants his
	money.

INT. SUPERMARKET - BACK ROOM - DAY

The place is full of crates and boxes. ONE CREW is unloading
a tractor-trailer. ANOTHER CREW is stacking and unpacking.
NICK stands with LINDA and a red-faced, cigar-chewing MANAGER
who is pumping NICK's hand, slapping him on the back and
shouting orders all at the same time.

			MANAGER 
	You did a good job, kid. Pettrucio,
	here! You did a good job. Gimme a
	count on these pears! I think we
	got 'em now, know what I mean? The
	pears, the pears! Ask me, we got
	'em right by the balls, know what I
	mean? Have a cigar. The pears,
	Pettrucio, the pears!!!

He goes off.

			NICK
		(to Linda)
	Does this... I mean, how does this
	job work out?

			LINDA 
	Oh, it's great. Fine.

NICK nods. A STOCK BOY comes by and whistles.

			STOCK BOY 
	Hi you, hot lips.

			NICK 
	What do they... bother you!?

			LINDA
		(takes his arm, laughs)
	No-o-o!

			NICK 
	I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you,
	I'll kill 'em!

			LINDA 
		(gently)
	Nick. It's okay... It's okay.
		(gives him a squeeze,
		kisses him)
	I have to go now.

NICK nods.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Pick me up at eight.

NICK nods again. LINDA hurries off. The MANAGER comes in from
behind, clapping NICK on the shoulder and going for his ear

			MANAGER 
	That's one sweet little piece of
	ass. I'm telling you, that's one
	sweet little piece of ass. Who's
	got these pears, God damn it! Who's
	got the count on these goddamn
	pears!

EXT. STEEL MILL PARKING LOT - DAY

NICK stands by the entrance to the mill. It is cold and he
looks as if he had been waiting for some time. Suddenly
STEELWORKERS begin streaming out the doors, heading for their
cars. NICK cranes his neck and then he catches sight of
ALBERT and VINCE.

			NICK 
	Hey, Albert!

ALBERT turns. He grabs VINCE and pulls him through the
departing STEELWORKERS.

			VINCE 
	What the --!

			ALBERT 
	It's Nick!

			VINCE 
	Nick...?
		(sees him)
	Jesus, Nick!

VINCE grabs NICK's hand, shakes it. Then ALBERT does the
same.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Where the hell were you? We were
	all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am
	I right?

			ALBERT 
	Yeah.

			NICK 
	I got delayed. I --

			ALBERT
		(hugs him)
	Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you
	been doin', I mean...

			VINCE 
	Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants,
	Albert! I mean, what do you think?

			ALBERT 
	I know, but...

			VINCE 
	What do you think? You think he's
	been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's
	been saving your ass, Albert.
	Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!

			ALBERT 
	Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you
	must be tired.

			NICK 
	I'm fine. Hey, I'm fine.

THEY start for the cars.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	How're you guys... I mean, how've
	you guys been?

			VINCE 
	Same old thing. Hey, same like
	always. Nothing's changed. Albert
	is getting fat.

			ALBERT 
	Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got
	married! Vince got married!

			NICK 
	Married?

			ALBERT 
	Tell him, Vince.

			VINCE 
	Yeah. I did. Yeah...What the hell.

VINCE makes a gesture, shrugs.

			NICK 
		(after a beat)
	Well, who'd you get married to?

			VINCE 
	Aw, it's a long story!

			ALBERT 
	Tell him, Vince!

			VINCE 
	Well... you remember Cynthia?

			NICK 
	Cynthia! Sure.

			VINCE
		(nods)
	That's who.

			NICK 
		(fast recovery)
	Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I
	mean... Great! That's really great!

			ALBERT 
	Show him the gun. Hey, show him the
	gun, Vince.

VINCE looks around. Cars are streaming out of the lot, horns
blaring. VINCE pulls back his coat and shows a .38 Smith and
Weston in a holster on his hip.

			NICK 
	What the hell's that for?

			VINCE 
	What's it for??

			ALBERT 
	He's serious. Vince is fuckin'
	serious!

			NICK 
	You mean...?

			VINCE
	Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is
	for the guy that gets caught!

			ALBERT
	Vince thinks... you know...

			NICK 
		(nods)
	Hey... hey, let's drink!

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT

NICK comes through the CROWD OF STEELWORKERS shaking hands.
The STEELWORKERS treat him with immense respect. There are no
cracks; there are no jokes. They squeeze his shoulder, pat
his back, reaching out for him, touching him.

			STEELWORKERS 
	Nice going! Good going, Nick! You
	did good, boy; you did fine! Let
	him through! Damn good, boy! Let
	him through! He's all right! Did
	his part and he did it good! Let
	him through! Let's make a little
	room!

JOHN pushes out of the crowd.

			JOHN
	Nick! Hey, Nick!
		(gives him a big hug)
	Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay?
	You're okay, huh?

			NICK
	Fine. Hey, I'm fine.

			JOHN
	Sit down. Here. Right here.
		(calls)
	Albert! Vince!

JOHN pushes them all into a booth. A tray arrives loaded with
beer and shots of whiskey.

			JOHN (CONT'D)
	Here. Here we go.
		(he raises a beer)
	Here's to you, Nick!

			ALBERT
	Fuckin' A!

			VINCE
		(stands)
	Here's to Nick, you guys. He did
	his part. He did... what hadda be
	done... and so he did it... and
	here he is!!!

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT - LATER

NICK sits at the bar flanked by VINCE and ALBERT. Both VINCE
and ALBERT are completely glassed out. Behind, in the booths,
three or four STEELWORKERS are sleeping. JOHN moves around
behind the counter wiping things off.

			JOHN
	Rough, huh?

			NICK
	Rough.
		(he nods)
	We didn't have to do it, John.

			JOHN
	No?

			NICK
	No. How's Angela? How's she taking
	it?

			JOHN
	Not so good.

			NICK
	No?

			JOHN
	Worse since she talked to him.

			ALBERT
		(with a dull beery blink)
	Fucking A.

			NICK
	Worse since she talked to who?

			JOHN
	Sal.

			NICK
	Talked to Sal?
		(stares at him)
	Sal's alive?

			JOHN
	Kind of. You didn't know?

			NICK
		(pushes off the counter)
	Sal's alive???

JOHN, ALBERT and VINCE exchange glances, nod.

			ALBERT
	He's real bad, Nick.

			NICK
		(stares at them)
	Well, where the hell is he!!! I
	mean what are we all sitting here
	for!!!
		(tears begin streaming
		down his face)
	WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???

			ALBERT 
	Nick...

			VINCE 
	Hey, Nick...

			JOHN 
	Nick, we don't know where Sal is...
	Nick, Angela won't tell us.

			NICK 
	Why?... What do you mean?... Why???

			JOHN 
	Nick, she won't say why.

			NICK 
	But Sal's mother! What about Sal's
	mother!

			JOHN 
	She's out of her tree, Nick. She is
	straight out of her tree.

			NICK 
		(stares at them)
	Oh, Jesus.

He walks in a circle and then stops, staring at them.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Oh, Jesus!!!

NICK turns and goes out.

INT. SAL'S HOUSE - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT

The room is very dark. ANGELA sits at a lace-covered table by
the window where a street lamp illuminates her in an eerie
glow. ANGELA holds a portable radio in tier hand, a very tiny
one, and she fiddles with the dial, going from one station to
another.

There is a sound from the hallway, then SAL'S MOTHER comes in
with NICK.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	I know I know you. So familiar.
	Such a familiar face. Oh, I know
	now! The toaster man! I'll go and
	get it for you.

SAL'S MOTHER goes out. ANGELA lights up a cigarette.

			ANGELA 
	You're back.

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			ANGELA 
	I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very
	glad.

			NICK 
	Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.

			ANGELA 
	Sure. Why not.

			NICK 
	Where? Where is he?

			ANGELA 
	Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital
	and they're fixing him up.

			NICK 
	You talk to him?

			ANGELA 
	Oh, sure... Twice a day.

			NICK 
	What hospital is he in? Where?

			ANGELA 
	Nick... Sal is very weak. He
	suffered a severe wound... and
	right now he doesn't want a whole
	lot of people to get involved in a
	whole thing.

			NICK 
	Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a
	long way.

			ANGELA 
	He doesn't want people bugging him,
	Nick!

ANGELA begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands
up.

She stares at NICK for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and
writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. NICK
comes up behind her. ANGELA finishes, puts down the pen and
stands with her back against the wall. NICK tears off the
piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket.

			NICK 
	Angela...?

ANGELA laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding
NICK's eyes.

			ANGELA 
	Did you ever think life would turn
	out like this?

			NICK 
	No.

			ANGELA 
	You know what Sal's got now?...
	Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and...
	that's it.

The door to the kitchen bangs open and SAL'S MOTHER comes in
with an electric toaster and a screwdriver.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	Here. This is it. What you do, you
	stick this in here.

Pushes the toaster in NICK's arms.

			SAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
	Then you jab it, see. Jab it good.
	Something's in it. Hear? Listen.
	Something's in it. What? What's
	there?

EXT. RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT

NICK sits on the steps with the toaster that Sal's mother
gave him in his lap. It is snowing and from inside the church
we hear the CHOIR SINGING. The sound is massive, deep and
dark, like a great river rolling through the night.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK. He is staring at something, tears
glistening in his eyes.

EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - REVERSE ANGLE (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

We see a lone telephone booth at the curb. The door is half
open and snow is blowing in.

EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - ORIGINAL ANGLE - NIGHT

NICK closes his eyes, leans his head forward and takes it in
his hands.

INT. MOTEL NICK'S UNIT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

LINDA steps out of the shower and begins to dry herself.

			LINDA 
	It just seems sort of strange
	coming to a motel... Like a
	honeymoon. Or some kind of parlez
	vous ... Not parlez-vous!
		(she giggles)
	What am I saying? That's those
	cocktails! Parlez-vous!... What I
	mean is rendezvous. Some kind of
	rendezvous.

LINDA pulls on a short and very sexy nightie, then looks at
herself in the mirror. She is very excited, very nervous. She
strikes a pose, pulling up the bottom of the nightie and
poking a finger in her mouth.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Do you know what I mean?... Nick?

NICK doesn't answer. LINDA pulls the door full open, takes
one last look at herself and goes out.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

As LINDA comes out of the bathroom her face falls and she
stops dead in her tracks.

NICK is lying on the bed -- sprawled on his back, one shoe
off and sound asleep.

			LINDA 
	Nick?

NICK doesn't stir, doesn't budge. LINDA crosses and looks at
him -- hungrily, top to bottom -- then she gives his toe a
wistful shake.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Nick...? Nick, it's me!

But NICK is out, gone. LINDA lets out a little moan and sits
down on the chair beside the bed. Then, almost immediately,
she stands and begins taking off his clothes. She takes off
his shoes, then both socks. As she goes to undo his belt, his
shirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a
fresh scar. LINDA stares at the scar for a moment, then she
slowly exposes the whole of NICK's chest.

NICK'S CHEST IS COVERED WITH A SERIES OF TERRIFYING FRESH
SCARS. THE SCARS ARE RAISED; THEY ARE INTER-CONNECTED AND
STUDDED WITH ANGRY SUTURE MARKS, LIKE A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF
SOME UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUND.

CAMERA HOLDS ON LINDA'S FACE.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STEEL MILL - CASTING ROOM - DAY

NICK stands at the handle of a long metal rod. At the other
end of the rod ALBERT and VINCE are attaching metallic
strips. When ALBERT and VINCE have secured the strips they
signal to NICK and all three of them lower their goggles.

CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. NICK is standing below a furnace
which is seven stories high, towering above him into a maze
of cat-walks and monstrous steel-hipped cranes.

ALBERT and VINCE give a signal and the CRANE OPERATOR raises
the door at the bottom of the furnace. NICK is now alone,
standing like Don Quixote with his lance. As NICK advances
toward the base of the furnace with his rod the surface of
his asbestos suit begins to smoke and bits of lint which have
stuck to it burst into flame. Within reach of the furnace
now, NICK pauses. Then, lifting the metal rod, he jams it
through the open doorway at the base of the furnace. There is
a white flash as the metallic strips explode and then a
geyser of molten steel erupts in a huge jet through the
doorway, passing NICK at the level of his shoulders and
showering him in a great cascade of white sparks.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT

NICK sits at the bar, silent, hunched over a beer, lost in
thought. All around him STEELWORKERS are shouting, yelling,
cracking jokes. After a moment VINCE pushes in, claps him on
the back.

			VINCE 
	How's it feel, huh? How's it feel
	to be back?

			NICK
		(forced enthusiasm)
	Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!

			VINCE 
	I mean, I guess you still think
	about Nam. Right? I mean --

			NICK 
	Naw.
		(shakes his head)
	Uh-huh.

			VINCE 
	Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one
	of those slants?

			NICK 
	No.

			VINCE 
	No!

			NICK 
	Never one.

			VINCE 
	Oh, Jesus!
		(looks around)
	You're kiddin'!

			NICK 
	One, Vince... you have to
	understand, doing it with one...
	would be... like nothing. They're
	small, see, so if you're smart you
	get about six or eight. I mean, if
	you want to have any fun.

			VINCE 
	Six or eight.
		(nods) 
	And they go wild?

			NICK 
		(lowers his voice)
	They have these little sticks,
	Vince. They call them "chomp
	chomps", and when you get these
	girls going, you have to stick 'em
	in their mouths.

VINCE stares at NICK. His respiration is up, his mouth is
bone dry and his eyes are as big as saucers. For a moment his
belief is total, then a frown crosses his face.

			VINCE 
	You're full of shit!

			NICK 
		(nods)
	Yeah.

			VINCE
		(pounding him on the head)
	And I believed you! I oughta punch
	you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey,
	let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey,
	Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do
	you say? Nick? What do you say?

			NICK 
	Sure.

			ALBERT 
	Hey! Fuckin' A! Hey!

He spots JOHN passing with a tray of beer.

			ALBERT (CONT'D)
	Hey, John!

ALBERT scoops JOHN into his arms where he holds him from
behind.

			JOHN
	Yes, Albert?

			ALBERT
		(into his ear)
	John,we're going huntin'.

			JOHN 
	Who's going?

			ALBERT
	We're all going.

			JOHN
	Nick's going?

			ALBERT
	Nick, Vince, Albert and John.

			JOHN 
	No women?

			OTHERS 
	No! No women! Jesus! What are you,
	crazy?

			JOHN 
	Take these beers.

They all take a beer. JOHN raises his glass, solemnly.

			JOHN (CONT'D)
	Here's to huntin'.

			ALBERT 
	Hey! Fuckin' A!

			VINCE
		(hopping up and down)
	Just like always! Just like it
	always was! Right, Nick? Am I
	right?

			NICK 
	In the timeless words of Squire
	Albert...

VINCE cracks up, howling.

			VINCE 
	Squire Albert...

VINCE collapses on the floor.

			NICK
	In the timeless words of Squire
	Albert...

			ALL
		(in a ragged chorus)
	Hey! Fuckin' A!!!

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer. His
hunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he
is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the
window by a street light on the corner. There is a sound
outside, then the lights come on as LINDA enters with
groceries.

			LINDA
	Nick?

			NICK
	Right here.

LINDA crosses to the doorway.

			LINDA
	What are you doing?

			NICK
	Oh. Nothing... Sitting.

			LINDA
	You're going hunting?

			NICK
		(blankly)
	What?

			LINDA
	I see you're going hunting.

NICK looks at the equipment on the floor.

			NICK
	Yeah... All the guys, we're all
	going huntin'. Like we did. You
	know? Like we always used to.

			LINDA 
	That's wonderful. I think you
	should... fresh air.

NICK gets to his feet, suddenly. His face is twisted with
pain and his voice is cracked with emotion.

			NICK 
	You know how sometimes you're going
	along... You're going along... And
	that's all...! One thing is right
	after another, like steps... And
	you step along.

NICK can hardly breathe. It is as if he were choking.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	I don't know where that is... It's
	gone! That's gone!

A car pulls up outside. The HORN begins blowing, then VINCE
and ALBERT begin pounding on the wall of the trailer.

			VINCE (V.O.) 
	Let's go!!!

			ALBERT (V.O.) 
	Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!

			NICK 
	I gotta go.

NICK swings his pack on his back, picks up his rifle and
heads for the door. LINDA follows, still clutching her
groceries, her emotions so pulverized she can't even speak.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	I'll be... I don't know... Couple
	of days.

NICK IS GONE. LINDA STANDS MOTIONLESS, CLUTCHING HER
GROCERIES, STARING AT THE TRAILER DOOR. IT IS DARK OUTSIDE.
SNOW IS BLOWING IN. THE DOOR CLOSES SLOWLY, WITH A FAINT
HISS, AND THEN CLICKS SHUT.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST - DAY

Snow is blowing, swirling past the trunks of stark, ice
covered trees. There is no horizon. Sky and earth are bound
in a moan of wind, in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the
whispering, fitful, spinning flakes.

NICK appears, suddenly, as a gust of wind shifts the slanting
snow. NICK is moving easily, heading slightly uphill,
following the contour of the slope. As he draws closer we see
that he is following a SET OF FRESH TRACKS.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOODS - ROCK LEDGE - DAY

A magnificent SEVEN POINT BUCK stands by a grove of hemlocks,
looking down the slope.

NICK appears below, barely visible in the swirling snow.

The BUCK watches NICK for a moment, then turns unhurriedly
and vanishes into the trees.

EXT. RIDGE NEAR CAMP - DAY

VINCE is out of breath, clawing his way up a steep slope on
all fours. JOHN and ALBERT, who have reached a level area
above VINCE, unsling their rifles. SHOTS are going off in
every direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that
it sounds like a full scale war.

			VINCE 
	What are you, kiddin'? Are you
	kiddin' me, Albert? Twenty times I
	coulda had her! She...! One time
	she begged me, practically begged
	me. Listen, I had her tit, which
	was out, in one hand, and my other
	hand... You know that mole on the
	inside of her right leg? Well, I
	was past that mole, way past that
	mole, and I was --

JOHN nudges ALBERT. FOUR DEER are coming down the slope,
single file. JOHN and ALBERT raise their rifles and FIRE. TWO
OF THE DEER FALL AND THE REMAINING TAKE OFF. VINCE, who is
just getting to his feet, unslings his rifle, trips and falls
down. JOHN and ALBERT drag VINCE to his feet and then rush
over to the TWO DEAD DEER.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(coming after them)
	Nice shootin', you guys. Not bad.
	Not half bad.

Leans his rifle on the horns of one of the fallen DEER.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	'Course how could you miss, right?
	Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean,
	if I'd'a been where you guys were --

			JOHN 
	Psst. Vince!

JOHN signals with his head. VINCE turns. ANOTHER DEER has
come out of the woods. The DEER is rattled by the gunfire and
peers at VINCE uncertainly. VINCE spins and grabs his gun,
which immediately goes off. He slams another shell in the
chamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is
hooked on the antlers of the DEAD DEER and another shot
ricochets off a nearby rock. JOHN and ALBERT dive for cover.
As they look up, they see the DEER trot down the slope and
then VINCE, firing wildly, running after it.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY

The wind is much stronger, moaning in the trees. NICK
appears, moving fast, at a near trot. Suddenly he stops,
listening. At the same moment there is a snort. NICK wheels.
The BUCK is behind him, bounding away.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY

The BUCK appears, trotting out of the swirling snow. Reaching
a deadfall the BUCK pauses, looking back, and then turns
sharp left and disappears.

NICK comes out of the snow. He is winded but still going
hard.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DEADFALL - DAY

NICK reaches the deadfall, hesitates, then rapidly springs
over. As he touches down on the other side there is a
growling sound.

NICK grabs for the deadfall. The wind shifts and we see that
he has stepped onto a boulder which is loosely planted at the
top of a steep scree slope. As NICK watches, the boulder
begins to roll, then to bound, dislodging other rocks and
boulders, all of them bouncing and leaping and cracking...
and then falling -- soundless -- over a sheer ledge to
unknown depths below.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY

ALBERT and JOHN have dragged their TWO DEAD DEER to a log
beside the shack. They sit side by side, drenched in sweat,
guzzling beer out of both hands.

			JOHN
	Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!

			ALBERT 
	Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a
	hot shit... except cold.

JOHN lowers his beer. ALBERT gives him a blank expression,
then cracks up. SHOTS explode nearby. At first the shots are
scattered but they quickly open into a FULL BARRAGE. ALBERT
and JOHN stand up.

EXT. HIGHWAY EMBANKMENT - DAY

The DEER that VINCE was chasing earlier comes hobbling out of
the woods pursued by a GROUP OF HALF-DRUNK HUNTERS. VINCE
comes barreling through the HUNTERS, shouting and screaming.
VINCE's clothes are in tatters, the sole is gone from one
shoe and the barrel of his rifle is jammed up with mud and
perceptibly bent.

			VINCE 
	I got this one!!! This one's
	mine!!!

VINCE loses his footing and rolls down the embankment, head
over heels.

EXT. DITCH - DAY

VINCE comes up ten feet from the bewildered DEER. He raises
his rifle, fires, and the BARREL SPLITS OPEN. SHOTS begin
coming in, thudding in the mud and ricocheting off rocks. The
DEER wheels out on the highway. VINCE heaves his rifle at the
DEER, draws his pistol...

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Cars are parked on both sides of the road. HUNTERS are
sitting in the cars, drinking, eating sandwiches and warming
themselves at small fires. MORE HUNTERS are up on the
embankment.

			VINCE 
	I got this one!!! This one's
	mine!!!

The panicked DEER bolts down the highway between the parked
cars. The HUNTERS ON THE EMBANKMENT open fire. The HUNTERS IN
THE CARS dive for cover.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Hold your fire! I got this one!!!

VINCE FIRES, FIRES AGAIN. SHOTS are ringing everywhere.
HUNTERS are shouting, running, yelling. A car window goes
out, a headlight goes out. The DEER is hit, falls and gets
up. VINCE takes aim. A FLEEING HUNTER bowls him over. The
DEER bolts for the woods, bullets smashing all around it.
VINCE scrambles to his feet and plunges after it.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	I got it! I got this one!

EXT. WOODS - DAY

The DEER staggers through the trees, blood pouring from its
wounds. VINCE comes stumbling after it. HE FIRES, FIRES
AGAIN.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY

ALBERT and JOHN stand with their beers, looking into the
woods. A shot zings by, close, and they dive behind a log.

The DEER comes out of the woods, barely able to keep moving.
VINCE appears, reeling. He takes aim at the DEER and there is
a DULL CLICK. VINCE jams his pistol back in his holster.

			VINCE 
	Gun! Gimme gun!!!

ALBERT indicates his rifle. VINCE stumbles over to it, rams a
cartridge in the chamber.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(looks around, bewildered)
	Where's it gone?

			JOHN 
	Inside, Vince.

VINCE staggers to the cabin door. The DEER is lying on the
floor, motionless, DEAD.

			VINCE 
	I got it! Hey, you guys, I got
	it!!!

EXT. MOUNTAINS - FROZEN LAKE - DAY

The wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way
and then the other. NICK appears in the distance, a black
speck in the endless expanse of shifting white.

As NICK draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. His
clothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow
gasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. As NICK
APPROACHES CAMERA HE FALTERS AND LIMPS TO A STOP. There are
no tracks. There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in
the driving snow.

The wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in
again from another way. Suddenly it stops entirely. In the
silence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock.

NICK turns. The BUCK is standing on the shoreline, not thirty
feet away, looking down at him.

NICK pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights
down the barrel.

WE SEE THE BUCK THROUGH NICK'S SIGHTS. IT IS A CLEAR SHOT.
NICK'S FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER. HE HAS ONLY TO SQUEEZE IT.

NICK LOWERS HIS RIFLE. THE BUCK SNORTS, TOSSES HIS HORNS AND
DISAPPEARS IN THE SLANTING SNOW.

NICK STANDS MOTIONLESS, STARING AFTER IT, SO WONDER-STRUCK HE
HAS FORGOTTEN TO BREATHE.

			NICK
		(grins)
	Damn... God damn...

EXT. MOUNTAINS - OVERLOOK - DAY

NICK sits on his haunches with his back against a sheer rock
face. As he devours a Hostess Twinkie he looks out over a
snow-shrouded landscape of such spectacular beauty that it
might be something from a dream.

			NICK 
		(shouts)
	Hey! Hey... okay!

INT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

The Coleman lantern hangs from the rafter, rocking in the
wind. NICK is propped against the wall, dozing. JOHN is out
cold. ALBERT and VINCE are both drunk and arguing bitterly.

			ALBERT 
	You're full of shit, Vince! You're
	so full of shit you're going to
	float away!

			VINCE 
	Who? Who is?

			ALBERT 
	You, Vince! You! You are! You're a
	crock! You're a walking, talking
	crock!... I mean, what do you know?

			VINCE 
	I know! I fuckin' know!

			ALBERT 
	You don't!

			VINCE 
	I do!!!

			ALBERT 
	I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince!
	With twenty guys you know!

			VINCE 
	She does not!

			ALBERT 
	Then what's the gun for! What's
	this for?

			VINCE 
	In case!!! The gun's in case!!!

			ALBERT 
	In case???!!! In case of what? In
	case you stumble on her, suckin'
	cock in the front fucking hall?!

			VINCE 
	She might!!! She might do it,
	Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell
	me that she does!!!

			ALBERT 
	She does, Vince! That's what I'm
	telling you! She does!!!

VINCE is sheet-white, trembling. He grabs up the pistol and
cocks it.

			VINCE
		(shrieking)
	Say that one more time!... Say
	it!!! Go on, say it!!!

NICK is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at
the pistol in disbelief. Suddenly he springs, seizes the gun
with one hand and slams VINCE to the floor. VINCE gets up.
NICK slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and
begins pounding his head against the wall. ALBERT lurches
over, pulls NICK away.

			ALBERT 
	Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!...
	Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince
	goes back a long way.

			NICK
		(grimly)
	Yeah.

VINCE gets to his feet. Blood is streaming down his face.

			VINCE 
	What the hell was that!
		(picks up the pistol)
	What did you think? Did you think
	it was loaded!

			NICK 
	You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!

			VINCE 
	The fuck I did!!!

			NICK 
	The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!

NICK takes the pistol.

			VINCE 
	What do you think? You think I
	don't know!!!

NICK looks at him, then he EMPTIES THE PISTOL INTO THE FLOOR.

For a moment there is absolute silence. The wind moans in the
trees, snow curls through the open door and JOHN, who is
still soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore.

NICK looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands...

			NICK 
	I'm going to throw this fuckin'
	thing away.

NICK goes out.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

For a moment NICK stands in the light from the door,
listening to the wind. He looks down at the pistol again,
then he heaves it into the trees.

The wind gusts. The snow swirls and hisses, slipping through
the woods in great streaming wraiths.

NICK watches it for a moment, then he turns and goes back in.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK

The trailer is lonely looking, DARK and cold. VINCE pulls
into the yard beside NICK's car and skips to a stop. NICK
gets out, says a few words to VINCE and everyone laughs. NICK
goes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and
pounds on the car. VINCE takes off, thudding over the curb
with his load of THREE DEAD DEER.

NICK crosses to the trailer and goes inside.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

TWO DOZEN AMPUTEES in wheelchairs are watching a western.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

In the foreground a NURSE holds a telephone. Beyond the NURSE
we see a wizzened figure in a wheelchair coming slowly down
the polished corridor. As the figure draws closer we realize
it is SAL. SAL is dressed in a white hospital gown, the
bottom of which hangs over the front of the wheelchair and
trails limply on the floor. Both SAL's legs have been
amputated and he has lost one arm. His face is terribly
scarred and what expression he displays is centered in his
eyes.

SAL takes the telephone. THE SOUNDTRACK FROM THE MOVIE IN THE
RECREATION ROOM IS VERY LOUD.

			SAL
	Hello?

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK sits in a little chair by the window, still in his
hunting clothes, huddled anxiously over the receiver.

			NICK
	Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.

			SAL
	Nick. Hey. How's things?

			NICK
	Oh. You know. How's it with you?

			SAL 
	Same. Hey. Same old stuff.

			NICK 
		(he can hardly hear)
	What's that noise?

			SAL 
	What?

			NICK 
	What's that noise?

			SAL 
	John Wayne... Listen, Nick --

			NICK 
	Great. Hey. That's great.

			SAL 
	Listen, Nick --

			NICK 
	John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal.
	Jesus. When are you getting out?

			SAL 
	I'm gonna stay here, Nick.

			NICK 
		(hearing it)
	What?

			SAL
		(with everything he has)
	Place is great. Really. One great
	place... Basketball, bowling. You
	name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of
	guys are making salad bowls. What
	I'll do is make a salad bowl for
	you, unless you'd rather have a
	pencil holder. The pencil holder's
	neat, I mean --

			NICK 
	Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John
	Wayne's making so much noise I can
	hardly --

			SAL 
	I gotta get back, Nick.

SAL looks around in desperation.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	They're passing out popcorn now, so
	I'll be talking to you... maybe
	next year.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK holds the receiver, staring into it. There is the SOUND
OF WHOOPING, GRUNTING, THUNDERING HOOVES...

			NICK 
	Sal?... Sal?

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

SAL is wheeling himself rapidly down the polished corridor.
At the doorway to the recreation room he pauses, looking back
at the DANGLING RECEIVER. Then he turns and disappears into
the flickering darkness, where BUGLES are sounding a cavalry
charge.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK listens to the SOUND OF THE BUGLES for a moment, then
puts the receiver back on the telephone. He stands, walks
around in a little circle - pained, terribly upset. His eye
falls on the clock. It is nearly eight o'clock. He turns,
hurries out the door.

EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping
carts which a CLERK is banging together.

NICK gets out of his car and goes in.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Two or three CHECKERS are closing out the registers up front.

			CHECKER 
	She's in back.

			NICK 
	Thanks.

			CHECKER 
	How was huntin'?

			NICK 
	Oh. Fine.

			CHECKER 
	Get anything?

			NICK 
	No.

			CHECKER 
	Too bad.

NICK goes down a long aisle of bright packages. Coming out at
the back he finds LINDA sitting in a green plastic chair,
crying.

			NICK 
	Linda... Honey, what's wrong?

			LINDA
		(helpless shrug)
	I don't know.

			NICK 
	Hey. Look. There must be something.

LINDA looks at him, tears streaming down her face.

			LINDA 
	I'm just so lonely.

			NICK 
	C'mon. I've got the car.

			LINDA 
		(shakes her head)
	I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll
	be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.

NICK walks back down the aisle between the bright packages.

INT. NICK'S CAR - SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The CLERK is still collecting abandoned shopping carts. The
carts crash and clank as the CLERK rams them together.

NICK sits behind the wheel, watching the clerk. His hands
begin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car.

EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NICK'S CAR - NIGHT

NICK watches the lights go out in the market. LINDA comes out
of the door and crosses towards him.

			NICK
	You okay?

LINDA nods. NICK fumbles for the door.

			LINDA
	Let's make love, Nick.

LINDA takes him in her arms and holds him tight.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Let's make love forever!

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

LINDA is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across
the pillows, like a dancer leaping.

NICK stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking
down at her. After a moment he draws the covers over her,
fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then
goes to the window.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF NICK'S TRAILER (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

The wind is blowing. Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the
frozen ruts and a cat comes by, MEOWING. Suddenly a MAN
appears walking slowly down the street. The MAN is elegantly
dressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest,
polished boots and a Stetson hat. As the MAN draws under the
light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at NICK's trailer.

THE MAN IS MERLE, OR IF NOT MERLE IT IS A FACE SO STRIKINGLY
SIMILAR THAT NICK ALMOST LETS OUT A CRY.

THE MAN UNDER THE STREET LAMP PAUSES, JUST FOR AN INSTANT,
THEN HE TURNS AND MOVES ON DOWN THE STREET.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK backs away from the window. For a moment he stands
motionless, hardly able to believe his eyes. He looks over at
LINDA, he looks down at a chair, then he pushes his face to
the window again.

EXT. STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

The street is empty. The MAN is gone.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK hesitates, then he sheds the blanket and pulls on pants,
shirt, jacket and jams his sockless feet into a pair of
slices.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK comes out into the street. There is no one in sight.

NICK crosses to the intersection of Columbine.

EXT. INTERSECTION OF COLUMBINE - NIGHT

No one. Nothing. A beer can rolling in the wind.

NICK jams himself against a wall, zippers his jacket. He is
irked with himself, a little frightened. Suddenly he hears a
car door close and en engine start up. A black limousine
pulls out of a nearby street and comes past him slowly. A
CHAUFFEUR is at the wheel.
The PASSENGER in back appears to be the MAN he saw, but the
MAN is looking out the window on the other side and his face
is not visible.

As NICK watches, the limousine rapidly gathers speed. The
tail lights grow small, then the car dips over a hill and
disappears.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Sunlight streams through a window. The television is going.
In a far corner SAL sits in his wheelchair, sleeping.

CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON SAL. His head has fallen to one side
and his single arm sticks into the air -- as if he had failed
in his grasp of something, as if he were drowning. On a tray
in front of him is an untouched breakfast of orange juice,
milk and a little box of Wheaties.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY

Someone is descending the stairs. After a moment the feet
appear, clad in expensive cowboy boots. We see expensive,
tailor-made trousers, a belt buckle embossed with a six
shooter... and then, suddenly, MERLE'S FACE.

MERLE slows in his descent, stops, looking at something.

EXT. V.A. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE (MERLE'S POV) - DAY

NICK is getting out of a cab. He pays the driver and starts
toward the building.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY

MERLE watches NICK for a moment, his face utterly without
expression, then MERLE continues down the stairs.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY

NICK is pushing SAL down a walkway.

			NICK 
	Sal, we need you. We need you.

			SAL 
	Hey, Nick. How can you need me?

			NICK 
	We do, Sal. We do... You're the
	heart.

Turns SAL and sits on a bench.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna
	sit in that corner watching soaps
	and you're gonna die!... I'm not
	saying it's gonna be the same. It's
	not gonna be the same, but whatever
	it's gonna be we're all gonna do
	it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are
	gonna do it!

			SAL 
	Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin'
	scared to go home.

			NICK 
		(nods)
	I know. It's like coming from the
	moon. Or Mars.

SAL laughs.

			SAL 
	Did you go hunting.

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			SAL 
	Did you get one?

			NICK 
	No.

			SAL 
	You didn't get a deer?

			NICK 
	I tracked this one, a big buck.
	God, he was such a beauty--! What's
	this suitcase here?

			SAL 
	Where?

			NICK 
	Here. Behind you.

NICK pulls a suitcase off the rack behind SAL's chair.

			SAL 
	I don't know.

NICK sets the suitcase on a low wall and starts to undo the
clasps.

			NICK
	Maybe Angela brought you stuff. I
	know she said --

The suitcase slips over the back of the wall.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Shit!

NICK swings up on the wall and then he freezes. The lid of
the suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are
scattered all down the slope of a steep embankment.

			SAL 
	Mom keeps sending me socks, Nick. I
	mean, if it's socks or something
	just let 'em go.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - EMBANKMENT WITH MONEY - DAY

NICK looks down at the money scattered at his feet. The
bundles are made up of hundreds and they are everywhere.

			SAL (V.O.)
	Maybe you could use socks, Nick.
	Jesus, I mean, come to think of it
	socks are pretty expensive now.

			NICK 
	It's not socks, Sal.

NICK bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking
for identification. There is nothing. As he straightens up he
notices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the
bundles of bills.

The paper is about an inch square. The corners are tattered
and it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket
for a long time.

NICK picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and
unfolds it.

THE CARD READS "EXHIBITIONS". IT CONTAINS A TELEPHONE NUMBER
ON THE LOWER LEFT CORNER AND IS IDENTICAL TO THE CARD ARMAND
GAVE TO NICK WHEN HE CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN BEHIND HIS
ROULETTE GAME IN SAIGON.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - VALLEY OVERLOOK - DAY

NICK leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable
cars of a coal train roll slowly by. SAL sits with the
suitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying.

			SAL 
	Who is it, Nick? Who is it? I don't
	understand.

NICK looks at SAL. His head is spinning and he brings himself
back with effort.

			NICK 
	It's Merle, Sal.

			SAL
	Merle? ... Merle's alive?
		(NICK nods)
	How do you know?

			NICK 
	I saw him last night. I thought I
	was dreaming. I thought I was out
	of my mind.

			SAL 
	Merle gave me this?

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			SAL 
	But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where
	would a guy like Merle get money
	like this?

NICK is standing slightly behind SAL, looking down at the
money. The reality of what MERLE is doing, has nearly
overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he
maintains a casual tone.

			NICK 
	Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's
	getting cold, Sal. I'm going to
	take you in.
		(starts off)
	We'll call Angela. The guys can
	help her bring you home... Did I
	tell you I was going on a trip?

			SAL 
		(panicked)
	Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You
	said you'd be --

			NICK 
	It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a
	week. Just to see Phantom Mary.

			SAL 
	Phantom Mary?

			NICK 
	Didn't I ever tell you about
	Phantom Mary?

			SAL 
		(laughs)
	No. 

			NICK
		(starts off again)
	Well... Phantom Mary's on my
	mother's side. Naturally no one
	there admits it because Phantom
	Mary's pretty weird... You want to
	hear the whole story?

			SAL
		(enthusiastically)
	Yeah!

			NICK 
	Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty
	weird... Lives alone, lives way out
	in the middle of nowhere with a cat
	called Pajamas and a cow called
	Fred. Well, last week I got a call
	from Phantom Mary, which in itself
	was very strange...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - U.S. ARMY AIRFIELD - TEXAS - DAY

The place is a madhouse of activity. As jets scream overhead
TROOPS embarking for Saigon are being counted and recounted.
SERGEANTS are yelling off names. CLERKS are typing forms and
papers. Forklift trucks weave in and out, DRIVERS cursing.

NICK is back in uniform. He stands at a window watching a jet
transport being prepared for loading. A CLERK comes by,
arguing with a SERGEANT. The CLERK sets down his clipboard to
consult the SERGEANT's papers. NICK picks up the clipboard
and moves into the CROWD.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - ANOTHER LOCATION - DAY

NICK spots a lone SECOND LIEUTENANT sitting on his gear. More
OFFICERS are waiting nearby but the SECOND LIEUTENANT seems
not to know them.

NICK moves in close enough to read the SECOND LIEUTENANT's
name tag.

			NICK
		(bawling)
	Biederman! Where's Biederman!

			LIEUTENANT 
	Here.

			NICK 
	You Biederman?

			LIEUTENANT 
	Biederman, yes.

			NICK 
	I got you on this flight,
	Biederman. Is that right?

			BIEDERMAN 
	Correct.

			NICK 
	Follow me, please.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

NICK walks along briskly with the LIEUTENANT at his side.

			NICK 
	Right this way.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

NICK comes to a door, opens it.

			NICK 
	Through here.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - UTILITY CLOSET - DAY

The LIEUTENANT walks into the closet and comes to a stop,
looking puzzled. NICK comes in behind him, closes the door
and picks up a length of pipe.

			NICK
	Take off the uniform.

The LIEUTENANT stares at NICK, dumbfounded.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Take off the uniform, Lieutenant!

The LIEUTENANT nods, begins taking off his uniform.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - UTILITY CLOSET - DAY

NICK has changed into the LIEUTENANT's uniform and tied him
to a chair. The LIEUTENANT is in tears. NICK is going through
his orders.

			LIEUTENANT 
	Please! Please mister, please! This
	is vital I go to Saigon. This is
	very important. Most important.

			NICK
		(exasperated)
	Listen, Biederman, I'm going to
	club you into the floor unless you
	tell me what the fuck is so
	important.

			LIEUTENANT 
	That I must not tell you. Top
	secret. You see there. Topmost
	secret.

			NICK 
	Biederman!

			LIEUTENANT
		(stiffly)
	I will not betray my country. No.
	Ne-ver!

NICK throws down the pipe in disgust, whips a gag around the
LIEUTENANT's mouth and ties it.

			NICK 
	When I get to Saigon I'll tell 'em
	where you are.

Slams the door.

EXT. SAIGON AIRPORT - TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT

Viet Cong SAPPERS have just attacked. A number of jet
fighters are burning, bodies are strewn over the tarmac and
jeeps with SOLDIERS are racing back and forth.
Out beyond, the jet transport taxis into view, lumbering like
a great silver monster out of the night.

INT. JET TRANSPORT - NIGHT

NICK stands in the aisle next to a COLONEL who is peering out
the window.

			COLONEL 
	Jesus Christ, they hit the airport!

NICK nods.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	Those fuckin' niggers. This time
	I'm going to eat balls!... You ever
	try 'em?

			NICK 
	Naw.

			COLONEL 
		(leans close)
	Not bad fresh, but they don't keep
	worth a pig's fart.

NICK nods. EVERYONE starts out.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	Lotta guys don't know that.
		(winks)
	Assholes!

EXT. JET TRANSPORT - DEBARKATION RAMP - NIGHT

A SIREN is screaming in the distance. NICK looks around
nervously. The COLONEL is still right in beside him.

			COLONEL 
	Tell you something else. Don't eat
	'em in the damn Delta. Unless you
	like 'em fishy... Some do. I don't.
	I never did.

The scream of the SIREN grows louder. Suddenly a Jeep careens
around the corner followed by a huge black Cadillac flying
American flags on the fenders. Both vehicles screech to a
stop and an MP jumps out of the jeep with a loud hailer.

			MP 
		(amplified)
	Lieutenant Biederman! Lieutenant
	Biederman report to the ramp!

			COLONEL 
	That's you.
		(grabs NICK's arm and
		waves)
	Right here, Sergeant! He's right
	here!

			MP 
	Right this way, Lieutenant.

NICK is hurried to the limousine where a SECOND MP holds the
door.

			SECOND MP 
	Quick as you can, sir. We're in a
	rush.

NICK gets in the limousine. The SECOND MP slams the door,
jumps in the front and they take off with sirens wailing.

INT. LIMOUSINE - SAIGON - NIGHT

There are jeeps with MP's ahead; there are jeeps with MP's
behind. Seated beside NICK is a gigantic MARINE CORPORAL who
stares rigidly ahead.

EXT. CAVALCADE - SAIGON - NIGHT

Pedestrians and bicyclists flee as the cavalcade comes
screaming down a wide boulevard.

EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - SAIGON - NIGHT

The jeeps peel off to the side. The gate swings open and the
limousine enters the compound.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

A STRING QUARTET is playing. GUESTS in evening clothes are
drinking champagne.

NICK enters with the MARINE CORPORAL and is whisked rapidly
down a hallway.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - KITCHEN - NIGHT

NICK stands in front of a huge range staring down at a table.
On the table there is a basket of eggs, an omelette pan and a
pile of mushrooms. Across from the table six SERVANTS with
napkins on their arms stand waiting with plates.

			MARINE (V.O.) 
	Sir?

NICK turns. The MARINE CORPORAL is holding a chef's hat. NICK
takes off his cap, puts on the chef's hat. Suddenly a door
comes open and the AMERICAN AMBASSADOR and his WIFE come in.

			AMBASSADOR 
	Henri! So good to see you. How are
	you? How are you? Darling, this is
	Henri. Henri, my wife Elizabeth.

			WIFE 
	My pleasure.

			AMBASSADOR
	Henri, we are starved. Six
	omelettes, s'il vous plait.

			WIFE
		(hissing)
	Avec champignons.

			AMBASSADOR
	Avec champignons.
		(back to his WIFE)
	Fines herbes?

The WIFE shakes her head. The AMBASSADOR winks.

			AMBASSADOR (CONT'D)
	Avec champignons.

The AMBASSADOR and his WIFE hurry out. There is dead silence.
NICK pulls the MARINE CORPORAL to one side, points to his
crotch.

			NICK
	Pee-pee.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT

NICK comes down the corridor behind the MARINE CORPORAL. As
he passes a straight-back chair standing against the wall he
picks it up and swings it down on the MARINE CORPORAL'S head.
The blow is ferocious. The chair splinters into pieces and
the MARINE CORPORAL goes down with a dull thud.

NICK stands for a moment, looking at him. Then he kneels,
removes his pistol and jams it in his belt.

EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - WALKWAY TO PEDESTRIAN EXIT - NIGHT

Three MARINE GUARDS are standing at parade rest by an open
iron gate.
As NICK appears in his white chef's hat the GUARDS snap to
attention and he walks into the CROWD OF ASIANS streaming by
outside.

EXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - BUSY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

NICK takes out his wallet, extracts the tattered calling card
that he found with SAL'S money and dials the number. He lets
it ring a long time but there is no answer.

EXT. DESERTED STREET WITH SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

NICK is not sure where he is. Suddenly he stops, recognizing
the yard with the little grape arbor where he met ARMAND.

EXT. YARD BEHIND SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

The yard is grown over. As NICK goes in there comes a low
buzz of flies. He trips over something, draws back. Seeing a
candle on the little table under the grape arbor, he crosses
and lights it.

The yard is full of discarded champagne bottles, red velvet
cushions and rotting CORPSES. NICK leans over one of the
CORPSES. The skin is falling away and the eye sockets writhe
with maggots.

NICK straightens, looks around.

			NICK 
	Merle!!!

The back door to the building is open. NICK draws his pistol
and goes in.

INT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

NICK finds his way blocked by a door. He steps back, hurls
himself against it. The door gives way with a crash and he
staggers into the middle of a small stage hung with red
velvet curtains and furnished with a table and two chairs.

Out beyond the proscenium, huddled together in a litter of
broken cafe tables, a FAMILY OF REFUGEES stare at him in
terror from the other side of a small fire.

			NICK
		(waves pistol)
	It's okay.

The REFUGEES cower back even further.

			NICK (CONT'D)
		(screaming)
	It's okay, God damn it! It's all
	right!

POUNDING and BANGING come from the direction of the front
door. NICK crosses...

INT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

NICK readies his pistol, cautiously unbolts the door and
jerks it open. The COLONEL FROM THE AIRPLANE tumbles in and
falls flat on his back. Standing in the doorway, lit by the
headlights of two cars, is a party of U.S. OFFICERS, ARVN
OFFICERS and WHORES.

			COLONEL
		(no attempt to get up)
	Hey, good buddy, how you doin'?
		(gestures)
	This is Biederman, you guys.
	Biederman, this is Son Loc, Tu Fon,
	Huckerbelly and Potts. What's the
	story here, Biederman? We're
	looking for... Wait a minute.

He fishes a piece of paper out of his breast pocket.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	Here it is. Chez Armand.

			WHORE 
	Chez Armand not here! Chez Armand
	has gone to other spot!

			COLONEL 
		(gets up)
	Honey, c'mere. Come right here.

The COLONEL opens a brown paper bag he is carrying and
presents her with a large red, white and blue dildo.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	This is for bein' so smart.

The WHORE shrieks with pleasure. EVERYONE laughs.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
		(arm around WHORE)
	Let's go! Mount up! C'mon
	Biederman!

The COLONEL throws an arm around NICK and they all start for
the cars.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
		(to NICK)
	Boy, do I love this conflict.
	Huh?... What the hell were you
	doin' in there?

			NICK
	You know a guy named Merle?

			COLONEL 
	Merle? That's who we're looking
	for. Merle.

			NICK 
	Yeah?

			COLONEL 
	Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes
	says he goes one more... He
	retired, you know.

			NICK 
	Yeah?

			COLONEL 
	Now he's back.

Pulls NICK close so he can whisper in his ear.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	He eats 'em... Sure... He eats 'em
	raw!

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - SAIGON OUTSKIRTS NIGHT

An elegant house of French design is ablaze with lights. The
house is encircled by a stone terrace on which tables have
been set up. Over the terrace and strung out for a hundred
yards into the surrounding trees are countless paper lanterns
which bob and sway in the wind. GUESTS are everywhere --
wandering in and out of the house, sitting at the tables and
strolling under the trees. For the most part the GUESTS are
AMERICANS and SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The majority of these are
OFFICERS IN UNIFORM, but there are numerous CIVILIANS mixed
among them and the CIVILIANS are attired in everything from
sports shirts to white linen suits and tuxedos. As to
nationality there are no limits. There are FRENCH, GERMANS,
BELGIANS, SWISS, CHINESE, BRITISH and AUSTRALIANS. WHORES and
MISTRESSES abound. WIVES are not greatly in evidence, except
to dog the heels of heavily armed ARVN GUARDS who wander
about, glass-eyed, drinking champagne.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - PARKING AREA - NIGHT

Jeeps, personnel carriers, trucks and light tanks are parked
side by side with gleaming Mercedes limousines, staff cars
from various government agencies and a blitz of civilian
vehicles running from sedans to motor scooters.

More vehicles arrive by the minute and exotic couples, like
plumed birds, debark in the swirling dust.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - CLEARING IN TREES - NIGHT

A dozen ARVN helicopters have put down between the trees. One
has crashed and lies on its side with a broken rotor.

There is a mounting clatter in the distance and another
helicopter comes out of the sky. As it sets down a dashingly
handsome AIR FORCE OFFICER hops out and extends a hand to his
WIFE. When his WIFE has descended the OFFICER opens a back
compartment in the fusilage and carefully takes out their
BABY. He hands the BABY to his WIFE and they stroll off
toward the house.

INT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT

Gambling tables are set up in all the rooms. The betting is
heavy, champagne flows like water and the atmosphere is one
of reckless abandon, as if money, like love, were good for an
hour.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE STAGE - NIGHT

Low bleachers covered in red velvet are set in a semi-circle
facing a small stage. The stage is lit with a single,
blindingly bright spotlight and is furnished with a table and
two velvet-covered chairs. Two CONTESTANTS, both of them
VIETNAMESE, sit opposite one another. Between them, lying on
the table, is a revolver. Both CONTESTANTS are dressed in
tuxedos. Both wear red numbers on their downstage arm.

Although the bleachers are not yet full, eager BETTORS jam
the first three rows. Here CLERKS with change trays take the
bets, signalling each transaction to a MARKER who chalks the
shifting odds on a large board.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, standing in the aisle, staring in
disbelief at the evolution of the game he once played.

Now a REFEREE enters the stage carrying two strips of scarlet
cloth.

			REFEREE
		(amplified)
	Game number seven. Gentlemen will
	please wrap.

The CONTESTANTS wrap their heads with the scarlet cloth.

			REFEREE (CONT'D)
		(as he loads revolver)
	One cartridge. Game to be played to
	completion. Forfeit automatic after
	delay of one minute.

The REFEREE places the pistol back in the center of the table
and spins a wheel whose -intervals are alternately marked L
and R. The wheel clatters to a stop with the marker on L.

			REFEREE 
	Gentleman on the left will now
	commence play.

The REFEREE steps out of the light. A gong sounds. The
CONTESTANT on the left picks up the pistol, spins the
cylinder, cocks it and

places it to his temple. He hesitates, pulls the trigger...
and clicks out.

NICK is unable to bear it. He turns, starts around toward the
back of the stage. AS NICK MOVES THROUGH THE GUESTS WE HEAR
THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER CLICKING, AMPLIFIED OVER A P.A.
SYSTEM. WE HEAR THE CLICK OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED...

NICK turns. The SECOND CONTESTANT has the pistol to his
temple. He pulls the trigger... THE GUN GOES OFF WITH A
DEAFENING ROAR and he topples on the floor.

The FIRST CONTESTANT STEPS FORWARD AS THE SPOTLIGHT NARROWS
TO CONTAIN HIM ALONE. HE BOWS, CLASPS HIS HANDS ABOVE HIS
HEAD AND DANCES AROUND.

NICK stares at the FIRST CONTESTANT celebrating his victory.
He looks around him. BETTORS are screaming and yelling in
five languages.

NICK starts off again, hurrying.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - BACKSTAGE AREA NIGHT

NICK comes upon a pile of six naked CORPSES with their heads
blown off. Opposite the CORPSES -- sitting, standing, pacing,
squatting in the dirt -- are a GROUP OF WAITING CONTESTANTS.
Some of these are AMERICAN. Most are SOUTH VIETNAMESE,
several of whom have come with WIVES and FAMILIES. A few of
the contestants are well dressed, most are in rags. THREE. OF
THE WAITING CONTESTANTS ARE WEARING TUXEDOS.

Suddenly a WOMAN WITH A BABY lets out a shriek. NICK spins.
TWO BURLY MEN appear, bringing the CORPSE OF THE SECOND
CONTESTANT. As the WOMAN WITH THE BABY begins sobbing and
screaming with grief the BURLY MEN strip the tuxedo off the
SECOND CONTESTANT and then, as each article is summarily
removed, they begin dressing one of the WAITING CONTESTANTS
in it.

			ARMAND (V.O.) 
	If you are brave and lucky I can
	make you rich.

NICK turns and finds ARMAND behind him. ARMAND studies him
for a fraction of a second and then smiles.

			ARMAND (CONT'D)
	C'est tres amusant... You have been
	promoted. And to a Jew... I am
	joking of course. Naturellement.
	Seriously, Nick, may I hope that
	you have come to play?

			NICK 
	I came to see Merle.

			ARMAND 
	Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			ARMAND 
		(studies him)
	You are his friend.

			NICK 
	Where is he???

			ARMAND 
		(faint smile)
	Merle is under his tree... Beside
	the terrace. You can't miss him.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TREES BY TERRACE - NIGHT

GUESTS are still coming in from the cars, strolling down
through the trees in bright coveys and flocks, chattering
like birds.

Laughter comes from the terrace. Glass tinkles and the tiny
lanterns bob and sway.

NICK appears, hurrying down the steps. Suddenly he stops.

MERLE is sitting at a table under a nearby tree. He is alone,
dressed in a tuxedo, watching the arriving GUESTS with an
expression of dreamy detachment, as if they were rain drops,
or snow flakes, or falling stones.

			NICK
		(shouts)
	Merle!

MERLE turns, watching NICK as he crosses toward him. When
NICK reaches the table, he stands.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?

			MERLE 
	Nick!... I thought you went home.

			NICK 
	I did. I... This is stolen. I came
	back.

			MERLE 
	Sit down.

NICK sits. MERLE's self-possession has thrown him. He doesn't
know where to start.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(breaking the silence)
	How's Linda?

			NICK 
	Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the
	hell are you doing?

			MERLE
		(eyes him)
	I like it, Nick.

			NICK
	Merle... Hey, Merle, listen... 
		(stares at him)
	Why?

For a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, like
faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as if
to some landscape far beyond.

			MERLE
	I like it because it's simple.

A BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL steps up and whispers something
in MERLE's ear.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(stands)
	I have to go, Nick. We'll have a
	drink.

MERLE and the VIETNAMESE GIRL move into the CROWD.

			NICK
	Merle...! Merle, wait!

NICK starts after them. He can see them ahead, moving rapidly
through a GROUP OF ARVN OFFICERS and WHORES.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Merle!!!

NICK sees he can never overtake them directly. He cuts around
to the terrace.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT

NICK maneuvers his way down to the end of the terrace.

			NICK 
	Excuse me... Sorry... Sorry...
	Pardon.

NICK reaches the end of the terrace. MERLE and the BEAUTIFUL
VIETNAMESE GIRL have disappeared.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT

NICK sits at one of the tables. The terrace is deserted.

			REFEREE (V.O.)
	Gentleman on the right will now
	commence play.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT

The gaming tables are utterly deserted. AS NICK WANDERS
THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS THE SOUND OF THE GAME CONTINUES OVER
THE P.A. SYSTEM -- THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER SPINNING, THE
SOUND OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED... AND CLICK AFTER CLICK
INTO EMPTY CHAMBERS.

Suddenly NICK can stand it no more. He turns and starts
toward the entrance to the bleachers.

A SHOT EXPLODES OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM. NICK freezes, then he
runs.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE THEATRE - NIGHT

NICK appears at the back of the aisle between the bleachers.
The CROWD is going wild, yelling and screaming. NICK pushes
through a group of BETTORS and then stops. A look of stunned
relief spreads over his features.

On the stage a tall figure stands alone in the spotlight,
head bowed in acknowledgement of the OVATION.

NICK grins. He begins yelling and screaming along with
everyone else.

On the stage the tall figure raises his head, pumps his fists
in the air and begins hooting maniacally.

... WE NOW SEE, AS DOES NICK, THAT THE TALL FIGURE IN THE
SPOTLIGHT IS NOT MERLE AT ALL. IT IS MERLE'S OPPONENT.

INT. V.F.W. POST - BASEMENT - DAY

Pipes crisscross the ceiling and there is the faint hiss of
leaking steam. Seated on a bench and all dressed-up in their
uniforms are FIVE OLD VETS. TWO VETS are on the nod. THE
OTHER THREE -- rheumy-eyed and ancient -- give patient
attention to the SIXTH VET who stands beside the boiler with
a bugle, trying to play TAPS.

			VET 1 
	Up a little there... What would you
	say?

			VET 2 
	Up.

The VET WITH THE BUGLE tries it again, flubs it, starts
over...

INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY

Three tables have been set up in the middle of the floor. The
tables have been laid with white cloth and the OLDER WOMEN
are setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for a
funeral breakfast. They work in silence, fussing over the
placement of each knife and fork.

AS THE WOMEN WORK WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR SINGING AS
THE SERVICE PROGRESSES IN THE CHURCH. AT FIRST THE SOUND IS
BARELY AUDIBLE, EASILY MATCHED BY THE FAINT NOTES OF THE VET
WITH THE BUGLE IN THE BASEMENT BELOW.
BUT NOW THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR GROWS -- A SOUND AS DEEP AS
WATER, AS DARK AS NIGHT; A SOUND LIKE STONE.

Gradually, one by one, the OLDER WOMEN stop fussing with the
table. They stand motionless, listening.

EXT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - DAY

A HEARSE waits at the curb. The day is windless, cold and
grey Snow is drifting down and the gleaming vehicle emits a
ghostly cloud of white exhaust.

THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR IS MUCH LOUDER, ASCENDING IN DARK
TRIUMPH TO A SUDDEN, FINAL NOTE.

In the ringing silence of the MUSIC'S END the doors to the
church swing open. NICK, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN appear with
MERLE's flag-draped COFFIN. Followed by MOURNERS, they bear
the COFFIN slowly down the steps.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Snow drifts down from a leaden sky as the MOURNERS stand
together on a steep hillside of tilted, weather-worn
headstones. The mill looms behind them, breathing roiling
clouds of steam and uttering a dull concordia of clanks and
groans.

EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - DAY

The PRIEST completes his reading of the 23rd PSALM. The
MOURNERS join in the LORD'S PRAYER.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, VINCE, ALBERT, JOHN and SAL. They help
SAL to the side of the grave. It is awkward. The chair gets
stuck and they have to carry it. THEY ALL pick up a handful
of dirt and then, following NICK's lead, they throw it in.

NICK steps back from the grave, nods to the VETS. The VETS
come to attention. The VET WITH THE BUGLE steps forward and
tremblingly, but perfectly, PLAYS TAPS.

INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY

The meal is over. The WOMEN are drinking coffee, the MEN are
smoking and putting down the beer. There is muted laughter
and conversation.

NICK sits at the head of one of the tables, flanked by LINDA
and SAL. He looks stunned. His food is untouched, there are
tears in his eyes and he hardly seems to know where he is.

			LINDA 
	Eat something, Nick. Eat a piece of
	toast.

NICK nods, picks up a piece of toast and then, forgetting all
about it, lays it absently on his plate.

VINCE comes up behind NICK, looking somewhat officious in a
new blue suit.

			VINCE 
	You want to say a few words, Nick?
	I think you should. Like that would
	wind things up.

NICK nods. VINCE raps on a glass.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright,
	everybody, Nick has a few words.

			NICK
		(very shaky)
	I just... would like to say a few
	words... about Merle. I guess Merle
	always wanted something... I don't
	know... better. That fucking guy,
	he saved my Life. He saved Sal's...
	What Merle liked, he liked things
	right... But then there wasn't any
	place for that... that he could
	find.

Tears are streaming down NICK's face and he sits down,
looking miserable.

			VINCE
		(hisses)
	John! Play something!

JOHN goes to the piano, hurried along by VINCE. He sits down,
casts a quick glance to the ceiling and begins playing
"America The Beautiful".

A FEW VOICES being SINGING. OTHERS join in. ALBERT stands up.
Then EVERYONE stands up.

				 THE END
EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL MILL - LIGHT SNOW - DAY

The plant is massive, grime-streaked, squatting in the valley
under five massive stacks, each one trailing a black ribbon
across the winter sky. Fires can be seen flickering through
the windows and long flames weave and dance from the tops of
guyed metal flues. Steam rises in clouds from vents and
chimneys and the sound of it all -- the hissing, the
clanging, the rumbling, the shrieking -- comes faintly, muted
by the falling snow.

In the foreground is a street -- COLUMBINE STREET -- which
inhabits the bottom of a narrow ravine and plunges directly
down the hillside, straight at the mill. Columbine is a sad
looking street, a grim-looking street, a street hanging on by
the skin of its teeth. Dilapidated stores hug the narrow
sidewalks. Battered signs squeak in the wind. Sandwiched
between the stores and scattered on twisting roads along the
hillside are narrow Victorian houses. These houses, which run
to three stories or more in height, all seem on the verge of
toppling over, and undoubtedly would, except that they are
all connected one to another by a mad arrangement of utility
lines which cross and re-cross between them with occasional
aid from a leaning pole.

MUSIC COMES UP -- dissonant, rather frightening music -- as
we watch a car come charging up through the slush on
Columbine Street. As it nears CAMERA the car falters on the
slippery grade and slides out of sight. A figure appears,
huddled against the driving snow. The figure disappears AS
CAMERA HOLDS ON THE STEEL MILL AT THE END OF THE EMPTY
STREET.

MAIN TITLE COMES UP:

			  THE DEER HUNTER

INT. STEEL MILL - DAY

A white-hot ingot shoots out of an ejecting mechanism and
comes ripping down a track. Another ingot follows it, and
another and another and another. The ingots are huge,
trembling with heat, and they come on with a terrifying
rumble.

CREDITS ROLL

UNDER CREDITS we see STEELWORKERS catching the ingots with
tongs and deftly swinging them into troughs. The STEELWORKERS
wear leather aprons and are stripped to the waist. Warped in
heat waves and glistening with sweat they seem like figures
in some hellish ballet. Since they all wear goggles it is
hard to distinguish between them, but there are three, who
are young, who seem to work with particular grace. These are
NICK, SAL and MERLE.

CREDITS END. CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, SAL AND MERLE. The noise
is deafening, the heat is unbelievable and the ingots come on
with murderous speed. Taking advantage of a slight pause
MERLE jabs NICK and they both make cuckold's horns at SAL.
SAL blushes and waves them off with his hand. MERLE and NICK
make the horns again and now SAL puts both hands on his hips,
gives a thin smile and studies the corner of the shed. MERLE
and NICK begin laughing. SAL can't hold out and he starts
laughing too, but now the ingots begin roaring down the track
again and they all grab their tongs.

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - ALTAR - DAY

A very old PRIEST is making preparations for a wedding
ceremony. SAL'S MOTHER hovers around him as he unlocks a
cabinet and takes out white tapers and a golden crown which
will be used in the service. The PRIEST moves with agonizing
slowness and SAL's MOTHER is in the midst of a bad case of
nerves.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	It's all ready? Everything's ready?

			PRIEST 
	Yes.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	Are you sure everything's ready?
	Are you positive?

			PRIEST 
	Everything. Yes.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	It would snow... Everything's going
	to slip. Everything's going to
	slide... All the cars are going to
	crash!

SAL'S MOTHER puts her hand to her mouth and bursts into
tears.

			SAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
	I can't believe this... My own
	little boy... with a stranger!

The PRIEST smiles. He takes SAL'S MOTHER in his arms and
comforts her.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

Another car lunges up the hill, gets about halfway and slides
back. As the car disappears, the door to one of the houses
bursts open and a group of giggling BRIDESMAIDS begin
scampering across the street. They have all been working on
their dresses, which are not completely finished, and they
all carry ribbons and scissors and pieces of material. As
they make their way to the other side of the street they all
wave away the snowflakes and grab each other for support. One
of the BRIDESMAIDS loses her dress entirely and with everyone
laughing she rushes back to retrieve it in her slip. When the
garment is repossessed a door comes open and the BRIDESMAIDS
disappear inside.

CAMERA HOLDS ON COLUMBINE STREET. The snow slants across the
little stores and piles on the gables of the tipsy little
houses. Another car appears, lunges at the hill and slides
back. Suddenly the door to the bakery comes open and a group
of OLDER WOMEN emerge carrying a huge wedding cake with a
miniature bride and groom standing on the top. The WOMEN are
all in their fifties and bundled in boots and dark overcoats.
They begin moving slowly up the street, in the driving snow,
with the great white cake held firmly between them.

INT. STEEL MILL - ENTRY AREA - DAY

The time clocks are lined against both walls. As a whistle
screams to mark the end of the shift thousands of men begin
checking out. NICK, SAL and MERLE are right up in the front
ranks and once they have clocked their cards they gather
together along the wall.

			NICK
	Where's Vince?

			SAL
	There's Albert! 
		(calls)
	Hey, Albert!!!

ALBERT -- six and a half feet tall and built like an ox --
changes course and plows across the river of homeward-bound
STEELWORKERS.

			ALBERT
	How you feelin', Sal?

			SAL
	I feel okay.

			ALBERT
	Feeling hot?

			NICK
		(arm around SAL)
	Humper's ready. Old humper's
	hotter'n damn hell!

			MERLE 
	There's Vince!

			OTHERS
		(calling)
	Vince!... Over here! Vince!

			MERLE 
	Get him, Albert. Get Vince!

			ALBERT 
	I'll get him.

ALBERT wades back into the stream of STEELWORKERS, grabs
VINCE and they all push out together.

EXT. STEEL MILL - PARKING LOT - DAY

The snow is still falling. It covers the ground. It covers
the acres of parked cars. It swirls and tosses and blows. As
the five friends come bursting out of a side exit they all
stop dead in their tracks.

			VINCE 
	Snow... Holy shit, snow!

SAL gives a look at the others. Something is going on. VINCE
is so excited he begins hopping around.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	 ... Do you know what this means?
	Do you guys realize exactly what
	this means?

They all know. They all know damn well. MERLE and NICK
exchange looks. ALBERT chortles.

			SAL 
	What are you guys...? Are you guys
	going hunting?

The others nod, shrug, shuffle their feet. They are all a
little embarrassed.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Not tonight?... You're not driving
	up tonight?

			NICK 
	As soon as you're hitched, Sal.
	First we get you hitched.

			SAL 
		(envious)
	You guys are crazy. You know that?
	I mean you guys are really nuts.

			VINCE 
	He's getting married... and we're
	nuts!

			NICK
		(puts his arm around SAL)
	It's all right. Hey, it's all
	right. We'll be right here, right
	with you.

A look at the others...

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Won't we? Right? Am I right?

			MERLE 
	Right.

			ALBERT 
	Damn right!

			VINCE 
	What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you
	think we'd miss this?

Now SAL is embarrassed. He makes a gesture with his hand.

			NICK 
		(with a laugh)
	C'mon. C'mon you guys!

They all start into the swirling snow. NICK with an arm
around SAL.

			VINCE 
	And we want you to know, Sal, that
	any help you might need--

			ALBERT 
	Yeah, Sal--

			MERLE 
	Willing fingers--

			ALBERT 
	Extra feet!

INT. V.F.W. POST - DAY

The place is large and drafty and rundown. A huge American
flag hangs from the middle of the ceiling. Under it WOMEN are
laying white table cloths on trestle tables. Off to one side
a half dozen OLD MEN wearing VFW hats are Scotch-taping paper
ribbons to the brick wall. Two OLD MEN are on stepladders,
two more are bracing the ladders and the operation is under
the direction of a pair of World War I VETS standing side by
side. Their hands tremble. Their four eyes loom huge behind
corrective lenses.

			VET 1 
	Up I would say... What would you
	say?

			VET 2 
	Up.

			VET 1 
		(signals)
	Up ribbon!

One end of the ribbon is moved up. The two VETS study it.

			VET 2 
	Down I would say... What would you
	say?

			VET 1 
	Down.

			VET 2 
		(signals)
	Down ribbon!

Suddenly there is a commotion. The WOMEN who are setting up
the tables all rush to the door as the OLDER WOMEN come in
with the wedding cake. The OLDER WOMEN look half-frozen and
as they move toward a table the cake receives a great chorus
of Uhh's and Ahh's. Suddenly one of the OLDER WOMEN
collapses. Friends rush to her aid, seat her in a chair and
give her wine. The WOMAN takes the glass, tosses it off in
one swallow and grins. EVERYONE laughs.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - BOTTOM OF HILL - DAY

A big, battered old shark-finned black Cadillac approaches,
coming fast.

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

NICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE and ALBERT are all laughing. NICK is
at the wheel.

			VINCE
	Hit it, Nick!

			OTHERS
	Go Nick! Hit it, baby!!!

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

The car bangs over potholes and slams into the grade. We
watch as it reaches the half-way point, then the three
quarter mark...

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

NICK bends forward over the wheel, peering out through the
slapping wipers.

			GUYS IN THE CAR
		(chanting)
	Do it, Nick! Do it! Go Nick, Go! Do
	it! Do it, Nick! Go!

The car fishtails, loses speed... to a creep.

			NICK 
	Back! All hands to the rear!

ALBERT and MERLE, who are sitting in front, immediately throw
themselves into the back seat on top of SAL and VINCE.

			GUYS IN BACK SEAT 
	Easy... 'At's it, easy! Easy,
	Nick... Easy!

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY

The Cadillac inches up the last ten feet, gains level ground
and skids to a stop. From inside comes a MUTED CHEER.

INT. BRIDE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

ANGELA is dressed in her white bridal gown and veil. She is
plump, pretty, with a solemn, round face and big brown eyes.
ANGELA leans forward into a mirror.

			ANGELA
		(sincerely)
	I do.

A pause. ANGELA scowls and tries it again.

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
		(heartfelt)
	I do.

ANGELA tries it a few more times. It sounds worse and worse.

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
	I do, I do, I do!!!

ANGELA stares at herself. Now she looks desperate and
unrelievedly forlorn. Bursting into tears she throws herself
on the bed. Someone has slipped a photograph under the
pillow. The photograph is face down and as ANGELA pulls it
out she sees that something is written on the back:

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
		(reading, slow)
	"This is it -- more or less...
	Love, Mom."

ANGELA frowns, turns the photograph over. It is a picture of
Michaelangelo's "David". ANGELA stares at the figure for a
long, long moment...

			ANGELA (CONT'D)
	Oh, wow.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY

The place is packed with boisterous STEELWORKERS drinking
boilermakers. Deerheads are mounted in a long row over the
bar, and hand-painted murals decorate the walls. The murals
depict hunting scenes and display an eerie tone -- at once
comical and frightening -- as if the animals held some secret
from the hunters, some power beyond their own.

JOHN bangs out from behind the bar with a tray of beer. At
the same moment SAL comes in with NICK, MERLE, ALBERT and
VINCE. JOHN, who is a great bear of a youth, puts down his
tray, wraps his arms around SAL and begins jumping him around
the floor, grinning ear to ear. The STEELWORKERS turn, desert
their places and swarm around SAL, joking and shouting
congratulations.

INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

LINDA is thin -- a skinny slip of a thing with a hauntingly
lovely face. Wearing her bridesmaid's dress she stands alone
in the kitchen, staring at the ceiling. Thumping noises are
coming from the room above. The thumping gets louder.
There is a crash, then another crash, as if furniture were
being thrown around. A MAN'S VOICE begins cursing and there
is more thumping and crashing. Suddenly there is a thud...
and then silence.

LINDA bites her lip. She crosses to the stove, ladles stew
into a bowl, butters bread, pours a cup of tea and puts it
all on a tray.

INT. LINDA'S HOUSE - FATHER'S BEDROOM - DAY

The room is a wreck of broken furniture. Chairs are turned
over, lamps are smashed and the pictures hang cockeyed on the
wall. In the middle of the room, face down on the floor, is
LINDA'S FATHER. His coat is torn, one shoe is missing and he
holds a half-empty bottle in his hand. Behind him, through
the open window, snow is blowing in.

LINDA comes in with the tray. She stands for a moment
expressionless, looking down at her father. Then she sets the
tray on the bureau and kneels beside him.

			LINDA 
	Daddy?

			FATHER
		(mumbles)
	Go... fucking hell!

LINDA reaches down, takes her FATHER by the shoulder and
rolls him over. It takes some effort and the face that comes
up is gray, unshaven and implacably bitter. Saliva dribbles
from his mouth, there is a cut with the stitches still in it
seaming his forehead and as LINDA looks at him he begins
cursing again.

			FATHER (CONT'D)
	Fucking shit... all around, like a
	sea! Like an ocean!

LINDA gets up and closes the window. She comes back, gets
down on the floor beside her father and pushes him toward the
bed. Then, hiking up her bridesmaid's dress, she takes him by
the shoulders again and heaves him onto the coverlet. The
effort is almost too much for her. Tears begin to burn in her
eyes, but when he slips back she tries again. The father
groans, begins to mumble, and then, when she almost has him
on the bed, he suddenly lifts his hand, catches her full in
the face and pushes her violently across the room.

LINDA crashes backwards over a fallen chair and smashes into
the wall. As she gets to her feet her father advances on her.

			FATHER (CONT'D)
	Fucking bitch... All bitches!

He swings, catches her in the face again, hard.

			LINDA
	Daddy...! Daddy, it's me!

			FATHER
	Hate 'em. Fucking bitches!

LINDA'S FATHER swings at her again, loses his balance and
falls on the floor. LINDA stands looking at him, holding her
jaw. She is crying. Tears are streaming down her face. 

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF HILL - DAY

Seven MUSICIANS, carrying their instruments, file silently
through the falling snow.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND JOHN'S BAR - DAY

The WOMEN are all gathered, some fifteen or twenty, ranging
from grandmothers to young wives. About half of them wield
rolling pins or heavy pans. As the last reinforcements arrive
-- TWO HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS -- a roar of laughter
comes from inside.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - DAY

NICK, SAL, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are dancing. The
MUSIC is at top volume and the smoke is thick enough to cut
with a knife. Suddenly, from the back, comes a CHORUS OF
SCREECHES AND FEMALE RECRIMINATIONS. The door to the alley
bursts open and the HEFTY LADIES WITH TRUNCHEONS appear. The
STEELWORKERS take one look, gulp their drinks, grab their
heads in their hands and rush for the front door.

EXT. JOHN'S BAR - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

The STEELWORKERS stream into the snow with the WOMEN close
behind. Several blows are delivered and the howls of
complaint are met with angry commands to hurry and get
dressed for Sal's wedding.

CAMERA CLOSES ON SAL, who emerges with NICK and MERLE. The
snow hits him a sobering blow and he comes to a stop.

			SAL 
	Boy, this is it. This is really
	it... I mean... here I go.

SAL'S MOTHER hurries out of the alley. She is crying.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	My beautiful boy! My angel... who
	is leaving his own mother.

She throws herself in SAL's arms, sobbing.

			SAL 
	Momma...

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	So cold is your heart to leave your
	own mother?

			SAL 
	Momma, I'll be right upstairs.

SAL throws a look to NICK and MERLE. They gesture with
sympathy and study the snow flakes.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	So cruel is your heart? Is your
	heart so uncaring?

			SAL
		(a litany now)
	One flight, Momma. It's one flight.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

The trailer is a dented two-tone pink and cream job which
looks as if it had been purchased third-hand off a
construction site. It stands on cinder blocks in a small lot
which has been cut out of the side of the hill. A wrecked
school bus decorates it to the right. On the left is a bare
branched tree. NICK's black Cadillac is parked in front and a
light shows from inside the trailer.

CAMERA PICKS UP MERLE who is strolling toward the trailer
whistling through his teeth. He is wearing his tuxedo and
carries a knapsack and a deer rifle. He mounts the cinder
block steps and pounds on the trailer door. NICK opens the
door and waves him in.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

The place is cramped, littered with camping paraphernalia. A
deer head is mounted above the sink and NICK, who is half
into his tuxedo, is applying waterproofing to a pair of heavy
boots. MERLE smiles, throws his kit on the stove and sits.

			MERLE
		(indicates the
		waterproofing)
	You should have put that on last
	night.

			NICK 
	I know.

			MERLE 
	That way it sets.

			NICK 
	Yeah.

Pause.

			MERLE 
	I just wait. You know?

			NICK 
	Huh?

			MERLE 
	I just wait. For this... It's what
	I wait for... I wait all year.

			NICK 
	So do I.

			MERLE 
		(sharp)
	You do?

			NICK 
		(nods)
	Yeah.

NICK grins, takes down his rifle and begins wiping the oil
off it.

			MERLE 
	You think about it?

			NICK
	Yeah.

			MERLE
	So do I.
		(watches Nick for a
		minute)
	I want to be ready... You have to
	be ready... It has to be there, in
	your mind.

			NICK
	The shot?

			MERLE
	Fucking A.

			NICK
	I don't think about the shot that
	much.

			MERLE
		(firmly)
	You have to think about the shot.
	It's the shot. The shot's it.

			NICK
		(uncertain)
	Yeah... I guess.

			MERLE 
		(studies him)
	What do you think about?

			NICK 
	I don't know... I guess I think
	about the deer... Being out, maybe.
	I don't know. I think about it all.
	Hell, I like the trees, you know? I
	like the ways the trees are, all
	the different ways the trees are
	too.

			MERLE
		(with a glance to the
		window)
	I'll tell you something, Nick. I
	wouldn't hunt with anyone but you.
	I won't hunt with a yo-yo.

			NICK 
		(laughs)
	Yo-yo! Who's a yo-yo?

			MERLE 
	Who's a yo-yo...? Who do you
	think's a yo-yo! They're all yo
	yo's. I mean they're all great
	guys, for Christ's sake, but... The
	point is, Nick, without you I'd
	hunt alone. Seriously. I would.
	That's what I'd do.

			NICK
		(laughs)
	You're a fucking nut. You know
	that, Merle? You're a fucking
	maniac!

			MERLE 
	Yeah.
		(he grins)
	When it comes to hunting, that's
	true.

Cursing and banging from outside. NICK opens the door. JOHN
and ALBERT, both in tuxedoes and loaded down with gear, are
pounding on the trunk of the Cadillac, trying to get it open.
NICK and MERLE go out. 

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

			NICK 
	Albert! For Christ's sake... John!
	Wait a minute, you guys!

			ALBERT
	It won't open.

			NICK 
	You gotta hit it here. Here,
	Albert, not there.

			ALBERT 
	Where should I hit it? Just show me
	where I should hit it.

			NICK
	Here. Hit it here.

ALBERT hits the trunk in the indicated spot and the lid snaps
open.

			ALBERT 
	Hey, that's neat.

NICK nods.

			ALBERT (CONT'D)
	That's new, isn't it?

			NICK 
	Couple of weeks... Listen --

			ALBERT 
	I love this car. Some cars sit, you
	know? This car, a car like this...
	grows. I mean you never know, with
	a car like this, where this car has
	been.

VINCE comes up, also in tuxedo, and dragging a totally
disorganized clutter of hunting gear behind him.

			VINCE 
	Hey, guys...

			JOHN
	Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup
	de Ville.

ALBERT looks around at his friends. He surveys the back end
of the Cadillac with simian pride. Then he expands his chest,
thumps on it with both fists and yodels out a magnificent,
mile-carrying Tarzan call. As the echo of it comes back the
church bell begins ringing down the street and a group of
excited BRIDESMAIDS come, hurrying up.

			BRIDESMAID 1
	Albert, what are you doing!

			BRIDESMAID 2
	Hurry up, you guys!

			BRIDESMAID 3
	Who's got their carnations?

			BRIDESMAID 4
	Here. They're right here.

			BRIDESMAID 1 
	Look at you! You're all a mess!

			BRIDESMAID 3
	Put on their carnations!

			BRIDESMAID 1 
	Who's got a pin?

As the BRIDESMAIDS begin straightening ties and putting on
carnations, NICK hears someone call his name. He turns to
find LINDA standing beside the trailer where she can't be
seen. She looks pale and very frightened and she holds a
small suitcase in her hand.

			NICK
		(crosses)
	Linda...

			LINDA 
	Hi.
		(forces a smile)
	Nick, your shoes are soaking.

			NICK 
	Linda, what's the matter?

			LINDA
		(tries to toss it off)
	Oh... You know...

She fights against it but the tears begin to come. NICK looks
around, pulls her inside the trailer.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAY

NICK clears a place on the couch. LINDA sits, holding her
suitcase in her lap.

			LINDA
		(with great effort)
	I was just wondering... Nick...
	You're going hunting... If I could
	use this place to stay, because...

			NICK 
	Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.

			LINDA 
	I'd want to pay you... and I was
	thinking --

			NICK 
		(kneels in front of her)
	Linda... Hey, Linda...

			LINDA
	I would want to pay you, Nick...
	and I was thinking --

			NICK
	Linda, Linda...!

			LINDA
		(very small, looking into
		his eyes)
	What?

			NICK
	Will you marry me?

			LINDA
		(after a long, long
		moment)
	Okay.

			NICK
	Would you?

LINDA nods - a solemn nod.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	You would?

LINDA's lip begins to tremble. Tears stand in her eyes and
she gives a little toss of her head.

			LINDA
	Who else, dummy?

NICK stares at her. He can still hardly believe it.

			NICK
	This is terrific...! This is really
	terrific!

LINDA nods. She is suddenly excited, suddenly radiantly
happy. She takes the suitcase off her lap and throws herself
in NICK's arms.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	I don't know what we've been
	waiting for!

			LINDA
		(eyes closed, loving him)
	I don't know! I don't know either!

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - NIGHT

SAL and ANGELA stand facing each other as the PRIEST reads
the Holy Sacrament of Marriage.

			PRIEST 
	"Blessed be the Kingdom... now and
	forever unto Ages and Ages...

As the PRIEST continues with the Holy Sacrament CAMERA PICKS
UP FACES IN THE CONGREGATION. We see SAL'S FAMILY. We see
ANGELA'S FAMILY. We see the VETS from the V.F.W. Post. We see
the STEELWORKERS from the bar and the WIVES and MOTHERS who
chased them home to change. They are hard faces -- working
class faces -- but we sense a fortitude among the
congregation, a community of both heart and spirit.

CAMERA PICKS UP NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN standing
in a row opposite the BRIDESMAIDS. The guys all look slightly
disheveled. Their tuxedos are all too small and their shoes
are soaking wet from walking in the snow.

NICK catches LINDA's eye and they hold each other across the
intervening space like two children who are amazed.

The PRIEST hands white tapers to the bride and groom. CAMERA
CLOSES SLOWLY ON THE PRIEST. The man is impressive -- gentle
yet full of power. The PRIEST lights the tapers -- first
ANGELA's, then SAL's -- and looks out across the assembled
congregation.

			PRIEST 
	"For everyone that does evil hates
	the light, and does not come to the
	light, lest his deeds will be
	reproved."

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TOP OF THE HILL - NIGHT

Save for a lone figure trudging home, the street is deserted,
left to the gently falling snow. In the background the
massive silhouette of the steel mill is plainly visible, lit
with fire.

INT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - NIGHT

NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN join with the BRIDESMAIDS
to assist the PRIEST in the crowning of SAL and ANGELA.

The PRIEST crowns SAL first.

			PRIEST 
	"The servant of God, Sal, is
	crowned for the servant of God
	Angela, in the Name of the Father
	and of the Son and of the Holy
	Ghost. Amen."

Now ANGELA is crowned.

			PRIEST (CONT'D)
	"The servant of God, Angela, is
	crowned for the servant of God,
	Sal, in the Name of the Father and
	of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.
	Amen."

Guiding the couple by their joined hands the PRIEST leads SAL
and ANGELA around the analoy. The movement is very precise,
very formal, a circling to represent eternity.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

The Band is going full blast and the whirling COUPLES, young
and old, are laughing.
We see SAL and ANGELA, NICK and LINDA, VINCE, ALBERT and
JOHN. The only one of the group not dancing is MERLE. MERLE
is drinking, standing alone on the side of the floor chugging
beer in tense, rapid-fire gulps. We sense immediately that he
feels out of place, at a loss to join spontaneously in the
spirit of the party. MERLE finishes the beer, crumples the
can and starts on another. As he picks up the second can he
notices that a SAD-LOOKING GIRL is sitting against the wall
behind him, waiting for someone to ask her to dance. The SAD
LOOKING GIRL gives MERLE a smile. MERLE pretends not to see
and moves behind a post.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLES - NIGHT

The wedding cake that was carried in earlier has now been
attacked from all sides, but the miniature bride and groom
are still standing in the middle. Unnoticed by each other
SAL'S MOTHER and ANGELA'S MOTHER eye the little figures. Both
women are in rather teary condition and begin moving toward
the cake. Suddenly, as the CROWD shifts, they encounter each
other face to face. Smiles are exchanged -- strained smiles,
which get stretched and stretched and stretched. Then, in
unison, they desert the smiling and remove their respective
offspring from the cake. SAL'S MOTHER looks down at her sugar
coated groom and ANGELA'S MOTHER looks down at her sugar
coated bride. Then they eye each other, burst into tears and
throw themselves in each other's arms, moaning and sobbing.

INT. V.F.W. POST - COAT ROOM - NIGHT

Another COUPLE tries to enter the rack. It is pretty full.
They finally find an empty place and squeeze in.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

NICK comes off the floor with LINDA and throws an arm around
MERLE.

			NICK 
	Sit with Linda, man, will ya?...
	Give her a beer.
		(to Linda with great
		solicitude)
	Would you like a beer?

			LINDA
		(puzzled)
	Sure.

			NICK 
	What kind of beer would you like?

			LINDA 
		(laughing)
	I don't know.

			NICK
		(to Merle)
	Give her Miller's. Miller's High
	Life.

NICK takes off. LINDA sits down at a table and MERLE goes to
the cooler to get a Miller's. He gropes around in the tub,
finds one and pops the tab. Suddenly he notices that NICK has
crossed to the SAD-LOOKING GIRL by the wall. He has stopped
in front of her and is asking her something. The SAD-LOOKING
GIRL gives a blush, gets out of her chair and NICK takes her
in his arms and begins to dance. The SAD-LOOKING GIRL looks
transformed. She begins chattering and laughing.

MERLE crosses back to LINDA and gives her the beer. As he
pulls up a chair to sit down beside her he stumbles and
nearly loses his balance. He is very drunk.

			MERLE 
	Sorry.

			LINDA
		(laughs)
	It's okay, Merle.

NICK swings by with the SAD-LOOKING GIRL and waves.

			MERLE 
		(catching Linda's
		expression)
	I guess you like Nick.

			LINDA 
		(nods)
	Yes.

MERLE doesn't say anything for a moment. He seems to be
trying to contain a floodtide of emotion.

			MERLE
	Fuckin' Nick... 
		(clears his throat)
	Fuckin' Nick... gives. 
		(he nods, bangs his fist
		on the table)
	Gives. Fuckin' Nick gives.

INT. V.F.W. POST - COATROOM - NIGHT

The rack is still jammed with COUPLES but the laughing and
giggling has now given way to the sound of heavy breathing
and low moans.
What light there is comes from the colored glass ball
revolving above the dance floor, where the MUSIC is now
playing sweet and low.

The front door comes open and a U.S. Army SERGEANT steps into
the darkened hallway. The man wears his dress green uniform.
On his chest is a row of battle ribbons and his shoes are
brightly polished.

			SERGEANT
	Pow!

The SERGEANT gives a beery chuckle and moves toward the dance
floor.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLE AREA - NIGHT

The SERGEANT passes between groups of celebrating GUESTS,
plucks a beer from one of the coolers and sits down alone at
the end of one of the white trestle tables.

INT. V.F.W. POST - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT

ALBERT gives his Tarzan cry, suddenly picks his GIRL off her
feet and marches around holding her above his head.

			GIRL 
	Albert, what are you doing...
	Albert!

INT. V.F.W. POST DANCE FLOOR - ANOTHER LOCATION - NIGHT

VINCE and JOHN are standing together. VINCE is going bananas
because his girl, MARSHA, is dancing too close to FRED.

			VINCE 
	Look at that, see... Watch. Wait a
	minute, watch. There! D'j'u see
	that? D'j'u see the way he... You
	know what that guy is doing? That
	guy is squeezing her ass!

			JOHN 
	Oh, well...

			VINCE 
	Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?!
	The guy is actually... He did it
	again! That's what he's doing...
	He... He's reaching in, John, to
	her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna
	kill him right now.

VINCE marches up and taps FRED on the shoulder. FRED releases
MARSHA. MARSHA waits, one hand on her hip, while the two of
them exchange words. VINCE turns MARSHA, points to her ass.
FRED turns MARSHA, pints to the small of her back. VINCE is
hopping up and down now. So is FRED. MARSHA, who is getting
bored, points to the door. VINCE and FRED bang out. As soon
as they have gone MARSHA is taken by someone else who puts
his hand right back where FRED had it.

INT. V.F.W. POST - TRESTLE TABLES - NIGHT

NICK, SAL and MERLE are standing together, looking at the
SERGEANT.

			MERLE 
	Nick, he just came back.

			NICK 
	From Nam?

			MERLE 
	Fucking A. See that ribbon in the
	left. That's Quan Son. That fucking
	guy was at Quan Son!

MERLE gestures with his head. NICK and SAL cross with him to
the SERGEANT.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	We, ah... We're going too.

The SERGEANT looks at them and delivers a big, blank smile.

			SERGEANT 
	Pow!

			MERLE 
	What?

The SERGEANT keeps smiling.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(to Nick)
	What'd he say?

			NICK 
	Pow.

			MERLE 
	Pow?

			NICK 
	Pow.

			MERLE 
	Oh.

MERLE nods.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(clears his throat)
	Uh... well, maybe you could tell us
	how it is over there?

			SERGEANT 
	Pow!

			MERLE 
	Pow?

			SERGEANT 
	Pow!

MERLE looks at NICK. NICK looks at SAL. They all begin
scratching their heads, trying not to laugh.

			MERLE
	Well, thanks a lot.

They turn away and then, when they are out of earshot, they
all break up, howling.

			SAL
	Who the hell is he?

			MERLE
	Who the hell knows!

			NICK
	Is he from here?

			MERLE
	Hell no!

			NICK 
	Well, where's he from?

			MERLE AND SAL
		(in unison)
	Who the hell knows!

			MERLE
		(soberly)
	Maybe he's lost.

			SAL AND NICK
	Lost???

			MERLE
		(throws up his hands)
	Well, I don't know!

INT. V.F.W. POST - NIGHT

The GUESTS have formed in a long double line which extends
from the dance floor right out into the street. Everyone is
pretty drunk and they are all armed with streamers and bags
of rice. As SAL and ANGELA appear from out of a back room
there is a great rowdy CHEER. The MUSICIANS strike up a
MARCH. Followed by the MUSICIANS, showered with streamers,
rice, advice and encouragement, SAL and ANGELA walk the
gauntlet toward the street, where a glossy, bright red
Pontiac with headers and straight pipes is being revved in a
series of ear-splitting crescendos.

EXT. V.F.W. POST - STREET - NIGHT

JOHN, ALBERT, MERLE and VINCENT are standing by the door.
Their tuxedos are stained and torn. Their carnations are
squashed and their clip-on bow ties are either missing
entirely or dangling from the open collars of their shirts.
VINCE looks the worst, with a black eye and half his pant leg
torn away, and they are all guzzling beer.

			VINCE 
	Bullshit! That's bullshit!

			MERLE 
	You wanna bet?

			VINCE 
	I'll betcha! That's bullshit and
	I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!

	How much? How much do you wanna
	bet?

	I'll betcha! I'll betcha... I'll
	betcha twenty dollars!

EXT. V.F.W. POST - PARKED PONTIAC - NIGHT

SAL and ANGELA emerge to more CHEERS and a shower of
streamers and rice. ANGELA is helped into the Pontiac on the
right. NICK throws an arm around SAL and walks him around to
the driver's seat.

			NICK 
	Don't worry what it says in the
	book.

			SAL 
	Right.

			NICK 
	Just forget that. Forget what it
	says in the book.

			SAL 
	I'm gonna start slow... At the top.
	Then I'm gonna work down.

			NICK 
	Great. That's great.

			SAL 
	That's my plan.

NICK gives SAL a hug. SAL gets in the car.

			NICK
	See you Monday.

			SAL
	See you Monday.

INT. PONTIAC - NIGHT

SAL looks over at ANGELA.

			SAL
	All set, hon?

ANGELA nods. SAL puts the car into gear and starts slowly
off. Fists pound on the car. Rice and streamers shower down.
Suddenly, through the front windshield, MERLE appears, stark
naked, running in front of the car with colored paper
streamers floating out from his upraised right hand. For a
split second SAL cannot believe what he is seeing. He throws
a look at ANGELA. ANGELA covers her mouth in amazement and
then quickly shifts the hand to cover her eyes.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

MERLE weaves down the street in front of the growling red
Pontiac. MERLE is not just running. He is leaping and
bounding, as if released from gravity and entered into a
realm of pure ethereal space.

NICK, ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN pound down the street behind the
Pontiac, ALBERT carrying MERLE's clothes.

			GUYS
	Look at that! Fuckin' guy! Fuckin'
	Merle!... Unbelievable!

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

The road forks, one road going high to a parking area, the
other descending to the valley below. MERLE swerves up the
incline toward the parking area, while the Pontiac goes
straight and disappears down the hill.

ALBERT, VINCE and JOHN stagger to a stop, panting helplessly.
NICK grabs MERLE's clothes from ALBERT and takes off up the
hill.

EXT. HILLSIDE PARKING AREA - NIGHT

MERLE stands motionless, looking out across the valley as
NICK approaches. The night is brilliantly clear and the fires
from the mill light up the sky with an eerie glow.

NICK comes to a stop a few feet away.

			NICK 
	Merle?

MERLE turns. His face has a strange, distant look, and he
gives NICK an almost feral grin.

			MERLE 
	You think we'll ever come back?

			NICK
		(startled)
	From Nam?

			MERLE 
	Yeah.

NICK moves up beside him. He doesn't know what to say.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	I love this fuckin' place... That
	sounds crazy. I know that sounds
	crazy, but I love this fuckin'
	place... If anything happens, Nick,
	don't leave me there. I mean it.
	Don't leave me... You gotta
	promise, Nick. You gotta promise me
	that.

			NICK
		(half laughing)
	Merle --

			MERLE 
	Promise! You gotta promise!

			NICK 
	You got it.

MERLE lets out his breath. It is as if some great weight had
been pressing on him.

			MERLE
		(with a laugh)
	Let's go huntin'. I mean let's do
	it!

NICK'S battered old shark-finned Cadillac comes screaming
past.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN, all of them still in
tuxedos, are jammed in the car between knapsacks, sleeping
bags, six packs of beer and deer rifles.

	Let me be free! Let me be free!
	If... you... will let me be free...

	Wa-wa-wa!... Waaaaa!!!

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

Tale Cadillac comes blasting by...

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

NICK is hunched over the wheel, his eyes gone completely
glassy. MERLE and VINCE are on the nod, while ALBERT and
JOHN, both half asleep, are having a lead-voiced
conversation.

			ALBERT
	She fucked you?

			JOHN
	She fucked me.

			ALBERT
	She fucked me too.

			JOHN
	She fucked you?

			ALBERT
	She fucked me too.

There is a long pause. They both struggle to keep their eyes
open.

			JOHN
	She fucked us both.

			ALBERT 
	Yeah.

			JOHN 
	Fucking women, man...

			ALBERT
		(shakes his head)
	I know...

INT. CADILLAC NIGHT

NICK'S head is sunk below the upper rim of the steering
wheel. One eye is entirely shut and the open one seems close
to death. Suddenly his head snaps up. He slams his foot down
on the brake and the Cadillac fishtails, rubber screaming, to
a jolting stop.

EVERYONE in the car comes awake ten bleary eyes staring out
through the windshield.

There are deer in the road, fifteen or twenty of them
standing in the headlights.

EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

VINCE, ALBERT, NICK and JOHN pile out with their rifles.
VINCE immediately slips and falls down.

			VINCE 
	Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!

			JOHN 
	Who's got the ammo?

			ALBERT 
	Ammo! Get the ammo!

			VINCE 
	I'll get it! Where is it?

			JOHN 
	It's in the trunk!... It's in the
	trunk! I'm telling you, it's in the
	trunk!

VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush around to the trunk. ALBERT
begins pounding on it.

			VINCE 
	There, Albert! Hit it there!

Pushing and shoving each other, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN rush
around to the side of the car. As they pass along the
embankment at the side of the road there is a soft sound,
like a sigh, and all three of them simultaneously vanish.

NICK, who has been watching, stares at the place where his
three friends disappeared. He takes a few steps forward,
realizes what has happened and doubles up in the middle of
the road, helpless with laughter.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(getting out of the car)
	Man, let's go hunting!... Where are
	they?

NICK makes a gesture, a downward pointing of his finger.
VINCE crosses to the side of the road.

EXT. RAVINE - NIGHT

The slope is a good 45 plus. At the bottom, barely visible,
three tiny figures flop in the snow.

EXT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

VINCE looks down at the three hunters with an expression of
absolute disgust. He looks at NICK -- flat on his back,
pounding his feet, howling -- and then he looks at the deer.
The deer are still watching. If anything they have edged
closer and their massed expression of polite curiosity throws
VINCE into a blind rage.

			VINCE 
	Get out of here, damn you! Go
	home!... Scat!... Shoo!

VINCE, whose rifle is fully loaded, slams a shell into the
chamber and lets off a barrage of shots above the deer.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Bastards! Assholes! Get lost!

EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAWN

The sky is cold -- first light -- with low, wind-driven
clouds. CAMERA TILTS DOWN and we see NICK's Cadillac coming
up a narrow road flanked by precipitous, heavily forested
ridges on both sides.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAWN

The Cadillac seems minuscule, overwhelmed by the massive,
black slopes looming up from the road.

INT. CADILLAC - DAWN

Everyone is eating cold hot dogs, ripping them out of a half
dozen plastic packages, dipping them in a jar of mustard and
stuffing them down. Hot dog juice has dripped over
everything, potato chips are littered everywhere and both
beer and milk are being passed around.

			ALBERT
	Fuel up. Need fuel.

			JOHN
	Those are mine!

			ALBERT
	You want 'em?

			JOHN
	Damn right!

			ALBERT
	Gimme a Hostess Twinkie, Merle.

			MERLE
	Here's a Hershey.

ALBERT tears off the wrapper, dips it in the mustard and
glomps it down.

			JOHN
	That's mustard!

			ALBERT
		(mouth jammed full)
	What?

			JOHN
	You just put mustard on your
	Hershey bar.

			ALBERT
		(nods)
	Good... Pass the beer.

			VINCE
		(pointing to a location
		beside the road)
	Here, here! This is it!

			MERLE
		(milk slopping over him)
	Watch it, shithead!

			VINCE
		(pounds Nick on the
		shoulder)
	Here! This is it!

			ALBERT 
	It is not!

			VINCE 
	It is too! Now you passed it!

			MERLE
	It's ahead, by the tree.

			NICK
	It's ahead, Vince.

			VINCE 
	That isn't it! There's no way
	that's it... Unless they changed
	it. They might have changed it.

NICK pulls to a stop on the shoulder.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	They changed it. That's what they
	did. This is it but they changed
	it.

EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN

The sky is just turning grey. A cold wind is blowing, moaning
in the trees and swirling a fine haze of snow across the open
roadway. The guys all pile out in their wrecked tuxedos.

			VINCE
	This is it. Definitely. This is it,
	but they changed it.

			ALBERT 
	You're full of shit.

			VINCE 
	Who's full of shit?

			ALBERT 
	You're full of shit!

			VINCE 
	I'm telling you, they changed it!

			ALBERT 
	They did not!

			VINCE 
	They did too!

			ALBERT 
	Jesus, it's freezing!

NICK, MERLE and JOHN have the trunk open and are taking stuff
out. MERLE strips down where he stands and begins putting on
his hunting clothes. ALBERT and VINCE grab their things and
follow the example of NICK and JOHN, who are changing on the
corner of the seats.

			NICK 
	Whee-uu!

			ALBERT 
	Jesus!

			JOHN 
	Holy shit!

			VINCE 
	Merle, hey Merle, you got any
	socks?

MERLE, who is crouched down studying the hillside, looks
over.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(rummaging around in the
		mess of things he has
		brought)
	Never mind, Merle. Never mind, I
	got 'em... Where the hell are my
	pants? Anyone see my pants?... Who
	the hell took my pants!

VINCE begins plunging around.

			OTHERS 
	Fuckhead! Watch it!

			VINCE 
	Somebody took my pants... I know I
	brought pants.

VINCE tears into another pile of equipment, comes up with
nothing and steps out of the car.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	All right. All right, you guys.
	Whoever took my pants, I want 'em
	back!

EXT. ROADSIDE AREA - DAWN - LATER

Shots are ringing out in the hills. NICK, ALBERT and JOHN
stand by the roadside while VINCE and MERLE glare at each
other. VINCE is still in his tuxedo pants, is still wearing
his dress shoes and is draped in a gigantic red goose down
vest that could only have come from ALBERT. MERLE's knapsack
lies on the ground in front of him and we can see that it
contains a pair of Vibram-soled mountain boots.

			MERLE 
	Sure I got boots. I got boots right
	here.

			VINCE 
	Then lemme have 'em.

			MERLE 
	No.

			VINCE 
		(both hands in the air)
	No!!!?

			MERLE 
	No.

			VINCE 
	What do you mean, no???

			MERLE
	That's it. No. No way.

			VINCE 
	Some fuckin' friend... You're some
	fuckin' friend, Merle!

			MERLE 
	You gotta learn, Vince! You come
	out here... You got no jacket, you
	got no pants, you got no knife and
	you got no boots. You think
	everyone's gonna take care of you!
	That's what you always think, but
	this time you're wrong. This time
	you're on your own!

			ALBERT
	Merle, give him the boots.

			MERLE
	No. No boots. No nothin'.

			VINCE 
	You're one fuckin' bastard, Merle.
	You know that? You're one fucking
	bastard!

			MERLE 
		(snapping it out, jabbing
		his finger at the ground)
	This is this, Vince. This isn't
	something else. This is this!

			VINCE 
	You know what I think? There's
	times I think you're a goddamn
	faggot!... I fixed you up a million
	times, Merle!
		(to the others)
	I fixed him up a million times! I
	don't know how many times I fixed
	him up... and nothin' ever
	happens... Zilch! Zero!... The
	trouble with you, Merle, no one
	knows what you're talking about!
	"This is this"? What does that
	mean, "this is this"? I mean is
	that some faggot bullshit, or is
	that some faggot bullshit!!! And if
	it isn't, what the hell is it???

			JOHN
	Vince. Hey, you guys --

			VINCE
		(hopping now)
	Take last night...! Last night he
	coulda had twenty fuckin' deer!
	More! He coulda had more! And look
	what he does! I mean look what he
	fuckin' does!!!

			JOHN 
	Vince!!!

JOHN throws up his hands in a comical way.

			JOHN (CONT'D)
	I'll get the boots.

			ALBERT
		(in agreement)
	Get the boots.

			JOHN
		(crossing to Merle's
		knapsack)
	I mean let's get going before --

MERLE -- who has remained completely calm throughout VINCE's
tirade -- pumps a shell in the chamber of his rifle. JOHN
freezes in his tracks and stares at him, his face gone white.

			MERLE
	I said no.

JOHN looks at ALBERT, who is right behind him, and they both
back away. VINCE, who is standing directly opposite MERLE,
begins to tremble. His mouth comes open, closes and comes
open again. Urine begins trickling out from the bottom of his
pants leg, staining the snow. Suddenly, NICK steps forward.
He looks at MERLE, crosses to the knapsack, takes out the
boots, walks over to VINCE and throws them on the road.

			NICK
		(gently, to Merle)
	Let's hunt.

INT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

The place is about nine-by-twelve. The floor is rotted out,
boards are missing from the walls and the entire structure is
canted to the right. Hanging from the roof peak is a hissing
Coleman lantern which sways in the wind.

VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN are sacked out, sound asleep. Beer
cans -- some old, some new -- litter the floor. Wet clothes,
most of them bloody, hang from tie-boards and nails. Strung
up on the end wall are two deer carcasses, one of them with a
knife jammed in it where steaks have been cut out.
Snow is blowing in -- dry, crystal bright. It swirls over
everything and settles on the sleeping figures on the floor.

CAMERA DISCOVERS MERLE AND NICK. They are both in sleeping
bags, lying on rusted bedsprings at either side of the broken
door. The wind gusts and moans. The cabin shudders and then
there is a sudden lull.

			MERLE 
	Hey, Nick?

			NICK 
	Huh?

			MERLE
	Tomorrow I go with Vince.

			NICK
	Hunt with Vince?

			MERLE
	Yeah... I mean so he knows... He
	doesn't even know.

EXT. THRUWAY PITTSBURGH OFF-RAMP - TWILIGHT

Traffic is heavy, an unending flow of cars, a river of
headlights suspended on a curved concrete trestle which seems
to float in thin air. Behind is the mill, belching steam and
ablaze with fire.

NICK's Cadillac appears, horn blaring, weaving through the
traffic. The car sits low. Trussed to the hood, to the roof,
to the trunk, are the carcasses of five deer. Rope-ends
flutter and bang in the wind. The car shudders and thuds.
Inside, grinning maniacally, NICK, MERLE, VINCE, ALBERT and
JOHN are all shouting and guzzling beer.

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - TWILIGHT

The Caddy appears, swerving onto Columbine with tires
screaming and NICK still leaning on the horn. The guys are
all hanging out the windows, shouting to FRIENDS, whistling
at GIRLS and banging a triumphant tatoo on the doors.

			ALBERT
	Maxie! Hey Maxie wha'd'ya say!

			JOHN
	Hey Geraldine, let's eat!

			VINCE
	Nothin' to it, asshole! Piece o'
	fuckin' cake!

As the car ascends the grade the mill appears behind it,
seeming to loom upward under the pink-streaked twilight sky.

CAMERA HOLDS AS THE CAR COMES TOWARD IT. The headlights blaze
white, like huge hungry stars, and the eyes of the dead deer
on the fenders glitter gold and green and red.

ALBERT leans out the window and gives his Tarzan call... IT
SEEMS TO ECHO, AS IF COMING FROM FAR AWAY,

							FREEZE FRAME...

EXT. CLOSE-UP OF JUNGLE LEAF - DAY

The leaf is being eaten by an exotic-looking insect. After
each bite, the insect lifts its head, produces an exceedingly
thoughtful expression, and chews.

WE HEAR THE BUZZ AND CREAK OF OTHER INSECTS, THEN A DULL,
FLUTTERING DRONE. THE DRONE GROWS LOUDER...

EXT. HELICOPTER SQUADRON - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY

There are twenty of them, coming fast and low, just over the
tops of the trees. Sunlight gleams on their paint and
murderous-looking rockets are packed to their bellies in fat
clusters, like eggs.

Suddenly, in unison, they fire the rockets.

EXT. RANGE OF LOW HILLS - SOUTH VIETNAM - DAY

As the rockets streak away the lightened choppers shoot
upward, lost to sight. There is an eerie silence and then the
hillside explodes, vanishes in a sheet of smoke and flame two
miles wide.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

A platoon of AMERICANS have been ambushed on the road. The
bodies lie helter-skelter -- headless, armless, legless, guts
spilled in the dirt. No one moves and there is absolute
silence except for the low buzz of flies.

A V.C. LIEUTENANT steps into sight. He gives a brusque
command and V.C. SOLDIERS step out of the jungle. The
LIEUTENANT bayonets a few of the fallen U.S. SOLDIERS --
idly, without much interest -- and then cracks a joke as he
rubs his finger in the Americans' blood. The V.C. SOLDIERS
laugh, spear a few AMERICANS themselves and repeat the joke.

There is a slight sound. The V.C. LIEUTENANT spins and gives
a low command. Fifty feet away there are three grass huts.
He signals his SOLDIERS to spread out and then he starts
toward them.

INT. GRASS HUT - DAY

South Vietnamese VILLAGERS -- women, children, and a few old
men -- sit huddled in the semi-darkness. The WOMEN hold their
hands over their BABIES' mouths. Flies buzz and there is a
look of stark terror in their faces.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

One of the fallen AMERICANS moves. CAMERA CLOSES ON THE
SOLDIER. His face is in the dirt and flies are nuzzling at a
gash in his temple. The face is unshaven, frighteningly
gaunt, but we recognize that it is MERLE.

A WOMAN'S SCREAM comes from the direction of the huts. A shot
rings out. MERLE pulls himself to his hands and knees and
stands there, on all fours, like a dog.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY

The V.C. roust the VILLAGERS from their huts, smashing them
in the back with rifle butts. One of the SOLDIERS emerges
from a hut carrying two small BABIES upside-down by their
feet. One of the WOMEN cries out. The SOLDIER gives her a
kick, swings one of her BABIES in the air and lets it go. The
BABY turns over and over against the blue sky. As the BABY
comes down ANOTHER SOLDIER catches it through the neck on the
end of his bayonet.

EXT. DUSTY ROAD - DAY

MERLE strips a B.A.R. from one of his dead companions, slams
a fresh clip in it, jams two extras in his pants and starts
for the grass huts. His movements are slow, almost dreamlike,
and his face is expressionless, like someone risen from the
dead.

EXT. GRASS HUTS DAY

The VILLAGERS -- about twenty of them -- have been formed in
a line. As the SOLDIERS look on the V.C. LIEUTENANT walks up
and down trying to extract information. The SPEARED BABY lies
in the dust between the two groups. The SECOND BABY tries to
play with it. The SOLDIER who threw the dead baby in the air
squats nearby and yawns.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

MERLE approaches between the huts. He takes a quick look
around the corner, finds the V.C. all bunched in a neat
package and draws back.

CAMERA CLOSES ON MERLE'S EYES. They are cold, dreaming
things, glittering blankly.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - DAY

MERLE spins out with the B.A.R. on full automatic. The V.C.
SOLDIERS go down screaming, arms and necks thrown back, in a
thin mist of spraying blood.

ABOVE THE CHATTER OF MERLE'S B.A.R. WE HEAR A GROWING ROAR.

EXT. APPROACHING AMERICAN HELICOPTERS - DAY

There are five of them, coming in low under the tops of
nearby trees.

EXT. GRASS HUTS - THE VILLAGERS - DAY

The VILLAGERS stand motionless, staring at the helicopters
and frozen with terror. They turn. They start to run. And
then they disappear in a roaring wall of burning napalm.

EXT. GRASS HUTS AFTER NAPALM ATTACK - DAY

MERLE stands alone with his B.A.R. surrounded by clouds of
billowing black smoke. There is no sound but the rush of
heated air and the faint crackle of flames. MERLE'S clothes
are burning. Flames are licking up his trouser legs and a
blob of napalm is burning fiercely on his helmet.

In front of MERLE the SOLDIERS and the VILLAGERS lie in two
charred heaps. The BABIES lie between them. Both are
motionless now, like two roasted stones.

An AMERICAN LIEUTENANT steps out from behind one of the
burning huts. MERLE and the LIEUTENANT spin on each other and
then the LIEUTENANT lowers his carbine.

			LIEUTENANT
	What the hell are you doing here?

			MERLE 
		(numb)
	Saving lives.

MORE AMERICANS appear, some twenty of them, coming out of the
trees in a long line. Among them are NICK and SAL.

			LIEUTENANT
	Move it out, girls! Move it out!

The LIEUTENANT heads down the line. NICK stares at MERLE.

			NICK
	Merle?... Jesus, Merle!

MERLE turns and looks at NICK. There is no recognition. He
seems to be looking right through him.

SAL comes up behind NICK.

			SAL
	Hey...! Hey, Merle!

A shot rings out. The LIEUTENANT goes down and suddenly the
whole line of AMERICANS is caught in a murderous cross-fire.
Grenades rain out of the trees. MERLE, NICK and SAL dive for
cover.

Out of the smoke V.C. SOLDIERS begin to appear, more and more
of them, swarming out of the jungle in scores.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

We are looking at the ground where three pits have been dug
and fitted with bamboo gratings which are held down by
stones. The ground is ankle-deep in running mud and the pits
are filled with water to within a foot of the bamboo
gratings. In each of the pits are about a half-dozen men --
SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their hands grip the gratings
and their eyes are hollow. Other than an occasional groan
there is only the sound of the falling rain.

A V.C. SOLDIER trudges out of the jungle. As he reaches the
pits he notices the hands, curses and begins jumping up and
down on the bamboo gratings. The hands disappear. As soon as
one comes back, the SOLDIER stomps on it, shrieking with
laughter. Then, almost as an afterthought, the SOLDIER pulls
down his pants and squats above the center grating.

CAMERA TILTS SLOWLY UPWARD. We see the clearing in its
totality. It is a raw hole hacked out of the jungle and
contains only two structures. One is a large bamboo "tiger
cage" with a few leaves tied to its top. The other is a small
hut with a thatched roof. The walls of the hut are open and
we can see V.C. GUARDS moving about inside.

A cry comes from the hut. There is the THUD of a rifle butt
on flesh and the cry abruptly stops.

INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY

In the middle of the hut is an American kitchen table with a
rose-patterned plastic top. At opposite ends of the table are
two chairs. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONER sits in one of the
chairs. In the other chair, facing him, is MERLE.
The SOUTH VIETNAMESE has a welt on his head and one of the
half-dozen V.C. GUARDS in the hut is screaming at him. In the
middle of the table, between the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and MERLE,
is a single-action .45 caliber revolver with an American
eagle carved on its ivory grip.

MERLE sits quietly, waiting, but his eyes are working, taking
in every detail of the scene. The V.C. GUARD gives the SOUTH
VIETNAMESE a final cuff, takes up the revolver with a
dramatic flourish and loads one cartridge into the chamber.
Immediately the OTHER GUARDS begin placing bets. The GUARDS
are a ragged bunch -- wet, half-drunk on captured Budweiser,
and it takes some time to straighten things out.

MERLE looks off to his right:

INT. THATCHED HUT - REVERSE ANGLE - DAY

We see more SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN prisoners standing
against the wall. Most of them have been badly beaten and all
have their elbows tied behind their backs. In among them,
standing beside one another, are NICK and SAL. NICK looks
grey, like a skinny ghost. SAL is out of control, sobbing
quietly.

INT. THATCHED HUT - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAY

The betting is now completed. The V.C. in charge waves the
.45 around and calls for silence. Then, closing the cylinder
containing the single bullet, he points the revolver at the
ceiling and clicks through the empty chambers until the
revolver goes off with a ROAR. Bits of thatch flutter down
from the ceiling. The V.C. GUARDS shout enthusiastically and
grin.

MERLE sits motionless. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE across the table
from him begins shaking uncontrollably.

The V.C. in charge now reloads the revolver with one
cartridge, snaps the cylinder shut, puts the gun on the table
between MERLE and the SOUTH VIETNAMESE and gives it a good
spin.

The revolver slows and finally comes to a stop pointing at
MERLE. MERLE stares at it for a long beat. Then he picks it
up, spins the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and
pulls the trigger. The hammer falls on an empty chamber with
a loud CLICK.

MERLE places the revolver back on the table and pushes it
toward the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE begins to
tremble again. Fumbling horribly he finally manages to get
the gun in his hand. He spins the cylinder, cocks the hammer
and puts the gun to his temple. The gun weaves around.
The SOUTH VIETNAMESE closes his eyes and pulls the trigger.
There is a loud CLICK.

MERLE takes the revolver again. He spins it, cocks it -- all
in one smooth motion -- puts it to his temple and pulls the
trigger. There is another CLICK.

MERLE pushes the gun back across the table. This time the
SOUTH VIETNAMESE takes it up with sudden confidence. He spins
the cylinder, cocks it, puts it to his temple and pulls on
the trigger.

THERE IS A ROAR. THE PISTOL IS FLYING IN THE AIR AND THEN THE
MAN'S HEAD, HALF-EXPLODED, CRASHES OVER ONTO THE KITCHEN
TABLE.

MERLE doesn't even blink. The GUARDS begin hooting and
laughing, wiping pieces of brain from their clothes, and
MERLE watches them, watches every gesture, every movement...
like a cat.

EXT. THATCHED HUT - LATER DAY

A pile of bodies lie by the steps in the pouring rain. The
bodies are both SOUTH VIETNAMESE and AMERICAN. Their heads
are all variously blown to pieces and SEVERAL HUGE RATS are
already feeding on them.

INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY

NICK is at the table now, opposite a SOUTH VIETNAMESE. He
holds the pistol by his chin, spins the cylinder. His face is
twitching, dripping sweat and both he and his opponent are
holding onto each other's eyes as if they had been at it for
a long time.

NICK raises the pistol to his temple, CLICKS OUT. The GUARDS
murmur. NICK pushes the pistol across the table.

INT. THATCHED HUT - PRISONER END - DAY

There are no Americans left to play except SAL. The sobbing
has stopped but SAL is shaking and trembling and his eyes
wander around in their sockets as if they been cut loose.
MERLE, who lies on the floor nearby, is trying to talk to
SAL. As he does so we hear the CLICKS coming from across the
room and the excited MURMURS of the GUARDS as their betting
choice survives another round.

			MERLE 
	You can do it, Sal.

			SAL 
	No. No, no.

			MERLE 
	Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have
	to do it.

			SAL
	I want to go home, Merle.

			MERLE 
	You have to think about this, Sal.
	Listen to me, Sal! You have to
	think about this.

			SAL 
		(tears again)
	This is horrible!

			MERLE 
	Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do
	it they'll put you in the pit. If
	they put you in the pit, Sal,
	you're gonna die... Sal, do you
	understand?

			SAL 
		(nods)
	Merle, I wanna go home!

There is an EXPLOSION from the other end of the room. SAL'S
eyes go wide and he lets out a whimpering SCREAM. The GUARDS
open a path and NICK appears. His knees won't support him and
the GUARD who is holding him throws him on the floor.

			MERLE 
	Listen to me, Sal. Do it! You have
	to do it!

The GUARD who delivered NICK jerks SAL to his feet and drags
him of f to the table.

INT. THATCHED HUT - TABLE AREA - DAY

SAL is thrown in the chair. A SOUTH VIETNAMESE is placed
opposite him. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE is a kid, even younger
than SAL, and he is trembling with terror.

			SAL 
	Hey, listen, you can do it. 
		(Sal nods, smiles)
	Believe me, you can do it. We can
	both do it. Then we go home, see?
	Then we go home!

SAL looks down. The pistol is ending its spin and the muzzle
comes up pointing at the SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The SOUTH
VIETNAMESE stares at the gun and tears begin to fill his
eyes. The GUARDS begin yelling at him, urging him on and then
SAL gives him a SMILE OF SUCH UNWAVERING FAITH that the SOUTH
VIETNAMESE picks up the gun, fumbles the cylinder around,
cocks it and puts it to his temple. For a moment SAL and the
SOUTH VIETNAMESE look at each other. THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE IS
TAKING HIS FAITH STRAIGHT OUT OF SAL'S EYES AND NOW SAL GIVES
HIM ANOTHER ENCOURAGING NOD.

The SOUTH VIETNAMESE BOY squeezes the trigger. THERE IS AN
EXPLOSION AND HIS HEAD DISINTEGRATES WITH A ROAR.

SAL sits motionless, his jaw hanging open and his face formed
in an expression of terrible puzzlement. Then his face begins
to move, begins to twitch, as if the muscles were trying to
discover a frown. SAL looks around. He looks back again at
the place where his friend was sitting and he begins to cry.

INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - FOLLOWING DAY

A half-dozen SOUTH VIETNAMESE sit huddled together in the
muck on the uphill side. A seventh lies sprawled on his back,
DEAD. The rain pours through the few leaves placed on the
roof and splashes in great cascades in the middle of the
floor.

On the downhill side are SAL, NICK and MERLE. SAL is in a
fetal position, gripping his knees and rocking himself back
and forth. His eyes are vacant and his face is fixed in an
expression of horror, as if he were still watching the boy at
the table blow himself away. Beside SAL is NICK. NICK sits
slumped against the bamboo. One knee is raised and he is
picking at the threads of his trousers where they have torn
at the knee.

MERLE IS STANDING, GRIPPING THE BAMBOO WALLS OF THE CAGE AND
LOOKING OUT AT THE "PITS".

EXT. THE PITS - MERLE'S POV - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

The pits are about twenty feet away. Running mud and water
gurgle into them, coming out through shallow trenches on the
downhill side. There are fewer hands than the day before, far
fewer. The nearest pit only has one pair and as MERLE watches
he sees that these hands are struggling to keep their grip.

SUDDENLY ONE OF THE HANDS SLIPS AWAY. THE HAND COMES BACK FOR
A MOMENT, THEN BOTH HANDS DISAPPEAR.

INT. TIGER CAGE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE turns away from the "pits". He looks down at SAL, then
he looks at NICK. His expression is one of exasperation, as
if he had been having a long argument.

			MERLE 
	I'm telling you, Nick, no one's
	going to come.

			NICK 
	What are you, God?

			MERLE
	Listen, asshole, it's up to us!

			NICK 
	They bombed last night, right?
	Didn't they bomb? If they bombed
	last night, they could bomb
	tonight. They could be up there
	right now!

			MERLE 
	What are you, hoping?

			NICK 
	What else?

			MERLE 
	I thought you might be praying.

			NICK 
	I'm doing that too.

			MERLE 
	I suppose you wish you were
	somewhere else?

			NICK 
	What do you think?

			MERLE 
	Nick, you're wasting your time...
	Listen to me! You're wasting your
	time! This is no fucking time for
	hoping or praying or wishing or any
	other shit! This is it. Here we
	are... And we gotta get out!

			NICK 
	You're right... Okay, you're right.

			MERLE 
		(grabs him)
	Get off your ass, Nick. Get off
	your fucking ass and stand up!!!

			NICK
		(stands)
	Okay, okay!
		(he straightens his
		shoulders)
	Okay. Okay, you're right... What
	about Sal?

			MERLE 
	Forget Sal.

			NICK 
	What do you mean?

			MERLE 
	I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take
	it, Nick.

			NICK 
	Forget Sal?

			MERLE 
	Forget Sal... Listen to me --
	forget Sal! I've been working on
	Sal since dawn, Nick. Sal's in a
	dream and he won't come out.
	LISTEN!!! From here on you gotta go
	for you. You hear me? For you!

			NICK 
	Merle...

			MERLE 
	LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR
	HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD
	TOO!

A shout comes from the thatched hut. The SOUTH VIETNAMESE
whip around in fright. MERLE and NICK turn.

Through the bars of the "tiger cage" we see the V.C. GUARDS
coming down from the thatched hut. The GUARDS are all
drinking beer again and the GUARD IN CHARGE is waving the
pearl-handled revolver.

NICK looks at MERLE. The sight has totally unnerved him.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(calm)
	We gotta play with more bullets.

			NICK 
	We what?

			MERLE 
	We gotta play with more bullets,
	Nick. It's the only way.

			NICK 
	More bullets in the gun?

			MERLE 
		(even)
	More bullets in the gun... The
	trouble is that still leaves one of
	us with his hands tied up, so that
	means we gotta play each other.

			NICK 
		(numb)
	With more bullets?... Against each
	other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you
	fucking nuts!!!

			MERLE 
	Nick... NICK!!! It's the only
	chance we've got!

NICK stares at MERLE. Rain is pouring off them in rivulets
and the VOICES of the approaching GUARDS are getting louder.

			NICK 
	How many bullets?

			MERLE
		(watching him)
	Three bullets -- minimum.

			NICK 
		(panic)
	No way. No fucking way!

			MERLE 
		(evenly, holding him with
		his eyes)
	I'll pick the moment, Nick. The
	game goes on until I move. When I
	start shooting, go for the nearest
	guard and get his gun.

			NICK 
	No. No way!

			MERLE
	When you get the AK, open up. You
	got me? Open up.

			NICK
		(screaming)
	YOU'RE CRAZY!!!... NO WAY!... NOW
	YOU'RE CRAZY!!! YOU'RE COMPLETELY
	CRAZY!!!

The GUARDS begin screaming orders from outside the cage and
ONE OF THEM lets off a blast of automatic rifle fire which
shreds the bamboo roof just above the PRISONERS' heads. NICK
and MERLE grab SAL and drag him to the door.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

As the PRISONERS emerge from the "tiger cage" the GUARDS
smash them with their rifle butts, screaming orders. In the
melee SAL is separated from NICK and MERLE, both of whom are
knocked to the ground by furious blows. When they get to
their feet they see that SAL is wandering off alone in the
direction of the "pits". One of the GUARDS spots SAL and
clubs him down.

SAL gets up and begins wandering off again. The GUARD clubs
him down again, turns to the GUARD IN CHARGE and begins
complaining. The GUARD IN CHARGE dispatches a SECOND GUARD to
help the FIRST and the TWO GUARDS open the bamboo grating on
one of the "pits".

MERLE turns to NICK, who is standing beside him.

			MERLE 
	It's up to you, Nick. Now it's up
	to you.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - THE "PITS" - DAY

SAL has absolutely no comprehension of what is about to
happen to him. His eyes are dreamy, far away, as if he had
mentally transported himself to some distant place. There are
great gashes in his head from the blows he has received and
as he stands waiting in the pouring rain he looks exactly
like a very small child who has experienced some terrible
confusion.

Suddenly the GUARD standing beside SAL wrenches him around.

We see the pit now, CLOSE UP. There are four bloated CORPSES
floating in the muck.

We SAL'S FACE, CLOSE UP. He gives a CRY and tries to turn
away.

We see the GUARDS pick SAL up, SCREAMING. We see the SPLASH
as SAL hits the water and then we see him surface between the
bloated CORPSES, STILL SCREAMING, paddling desperately and
trying to find something solid to hod him up.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - WAITING PRISONERS - DAY

NICK stands motionless, stunned, listening to SAL'S SCREAMS.
MERLE has his attention focused on the GUARD IN CHARGE and
when he glances in their direction MERLE slugs NICK in the
stomach and begins beating him furiously to the ground. NICK
struggles to his feet. MERLE attacks him again and now, as
the GUARD IN CHARGE comes over to see what's going on, MERLE
begins hopping up and down, pointing at NICK, pointing at the
revolver in the GUARD'S hand and screaming.

			MERLE
	Him and me!!! Him and me!!!

The GUARDS look at each other, interested.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Him and me, goddamn it! Him and me!

INT. THATCHED HUT - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE and NICK sit facing one another across the rose
patterned kitchen table. The GUARDS are all grinning and even
the SOUTH VIETNAMESE are watching with grim fascination. NICK
has the revolver. He is trembling visibly. Already MERLE has
managed to draw the GUARDS in closer and as NICK spins the
cylinder and cocks the hammer MERLE jumps up and begins
pounding on the table.

			MERLE 
	This is it, motherfuckers! Now he's
	going to do it! Watch! You watch!

NICK almost loses what little control is left and his hand
begins shaking violently.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Look at him! See! This is it and he
	knows it!

Side bets begin changing hands.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Last chance to lose your money
	there, guys. Goodbye money! Hurry,
	hurry. Here he goes!

NICK puts the revolver against his temple and pulls the
trigger. There is a dull CLICK.

NICK puts the revolver back on the table. His hand is shaking
so badly it falls with a clunk. MERLE grabs it, spins it,
sticks it to his temple and CLICKS OUT, talking all the time:

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	This is stupid! You understand
	stupid? On and on! At this rate
	we'll still be here tomorrow!
		(throws the revolver on
		the table)
	Wait a minute. I know! Hey, I got
	it. More! Put in more! You
	understand more? More! More
	bullets!
		(he mimes with his
		fingers)
	Three bullets! You understand
	three? That way BLAM! BOOM!

MERLE hops up and down, laughing maniacally.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	KA-POWIE!!! BA-ROOM!!!... 'Cause I
	want that bastard! Him I want boom!
	Him or me!!!

The GUARD IN CHARGE looks at his COMPANIONS. They all begin
shouting for him to go ahead. The GUARD IN CHARGE purses his
lips, as if imitating a general coming to a decision, and
then nods his assent. The GUARDS all howl. MERLE joins right
in.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	He's terrific! Great fucking guy!

The GUARD IN CHARGE takes the revolver, opens the cylinder
and begins sticking in two more cartridges.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	KA-POW!!! BA-ROOMIE!!!

MERLE hops up and down again, then screams at NICK, jabbing
his finger at him, as if in fury.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Both of us may have to pull on
	this, so get your shit in fuckin'
	shape!!!
		(to the GUARDS)
	Him or me!!! Now we got it, him or
	me!!!
		(he rubs his hands and
		sits back down)
	Place your bets, motherfuckers! Now
	we're going! Now we got a game!

The GUARD IN CHARGE places the revolver on the table, spins
it.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Watch! Now watch! He's going to get
	it. And then KA-POW! BA-ROOMIE!!!

The muzzle stops pointing at MERLE. MERLE scowls, looks over
at the GUARD IN CHARGE. The GUARD IN CHARGE has lifted the
barrel of his AK 47 and is watching him with caution. The
OTHER GUARDS, who are totally caught up in the game, are
yelling and shouting.

			MERLE 
	You guys think I'm in trouble,
	right?

MERLE picks up the revolver, spins the cylinder, cocks it...

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	No way! Never!!!
		(he begins to chant)
	MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!
	MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!
	MERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA!
	MERLE LIVES LONG!
	Lemme hear it. Come on,
	motherfuckers, lemme hear it!

MERLE starts it again. The GUARDS who are bett ing on him
JOIN IN:

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(with GUARDS)
	MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!
	MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!
	MERLE IS MAGIC! -- HA!
	MERLE LIVES LONG!

MERLE takes a glance at the GUARD IN CHARGE again. The GUARD
IN CHARGE is still eyeing him with caution.

MERLE places the revolver to his temple... and CLICKS into an
empty chamber.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	See! Nothing to it.

He pushes the gun across to NICK. Then he stabs his finger at
him, screaming again, as if in a fit of rage.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	You got an empty chamber and it's
	in your mind! Just put that empty
	chamber in the gun!

NICK looks down at the revolver and picks it up. He stares at
MERLE for a moment. Then he spins the cylinder, cocks the
hammer, Puts it to his head... and CLICKS into an empty
chamber.

The GUARDS let out expressions of disbelief. Those betting on
NICK begin taunting those betting on MERLE.

MERLE sits motionless, as if stunned, as if utterly defeated,
his brow furrowed in a mighty frown.

NICK pushes the revolver across the table. His face is
twitching but he gives the gesture a certain flair, as if
throwing back a challenge.

MERLE stares at the revolver -- stares at it with an
expression of utter gloom. Then he reaches out, takes the
revolver in his hand and pulls it toward him, as if he no
longer possessed the strength to pick it up.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(gloom)
	Who's for Merle?
		(he thumps his fist on the
		table)
	Is anyone for Merle???

MERLE roams a glowering eve over the watching GUARDS, as if
suddenly discovering himself among traitors. Slowly, he
pushes himself to his feet. The gun is still on the table,
still in his right hand, and as he gets up he lets his body
sag over it.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Who here is for Merle...?

There is absolute silence now except for the drumming of the
rain. It is as if the war had disappeared, vanished. The
GUARDS stand motionless, hardly breathing, so captivated by
MERLE'S performance that they suddenly resemble little
children.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Who... here... is for Merle...?

MERLE begins his chant again. His voice is low, very
dramatic, and the GUARD IN CHARGE joins right in.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(with GUARDS)
	MERLE IS MIGHTY! -- HA!
	MERLE IS STRONG! -- HA!
	MERLE IS MAGIC -- HA!

MERLE snaps the revolver level in his hand and BLASTS the
GUARD IN CHARGE, hitting him full in the face. At the same
time NICK throws himself into the GUARD who is standing
behind him, spins and slams the GUARD'S AK 47 into his chin.
TWO MORE SHOTS BLAST OUT FROM MERLE'S .45 and we see TWO
GUARDS crash over the kitchen table. NICK now opens up with
AK 47, and as MERLE backs off beside him, also with an AK 47,
they GUN the remaining GUARDS to the floor.

It is over in an instant. The BODIES lie in a bloody, tangled
mess under a pathetic paper lantern. The rain drones on --
uninterrupted, undiminished, eternal...

EXT. CLEARING IN THE JUNGLE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

Barely visible against the dripping foliage -- like a shadow 
is a startled V.C. SOLDIER. The man takes a half-step
forward, unslings his rifle and OPENS FIRE.

INT. THATCHED HUT - DAY

The SOUTH VIETNAMESE PRISONERS are hit where they stand. NICK
spins, BADLY WOUNDED. MERLE throws himself on the floor and
lets go with the AK 47.

EXT. BAMBOO GROVE - HEAVY RAIN - DAY

MERLE appears carrying NICK on his back. NICK is unconscious
and the effort that MERLE has expended to get him this far
can be measured in MERLE'S eves, which burn like dead coals.
As MERLE approaches, traversing the bamboo grove along the
side of a steep hill, we suddenly see SAL, stumbling along
behind and attached to MERLE by a short rope.

MERLE comes to a stop, unshoulders NICK and lays him on the
ground. As MERLE stands looking at NICK, gasping for breath,
SAL hunches down and stares at the endless trunks of bamboo
with an expression of pure terror.

			SAL 
	Where are we going, Merle? Are we
	going home?

There is a sound, so faint as to be almost imperceptible.
MERLE throws himself on SAL, slamming one hand across his
mouth and raising the other in case he has to silence NICK.

For a moment there is nothing -- silence. The rain drones on
and we can hear NICK'S breath, which comes in short, shallow
rasps.

The sound comes again and suddenly a PLATOON OF V.C. SOLDIERS
appear, coming down through the trees. Their passage is
almost completely silent and they go by on both sides, moving
down the hill.

CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON MERLE'S FACE. His gums are bleeding
and his skin is drawn tight so that every bone stands out in
his skull. His teeth are bared, his eyes are hollow and he
looks within a hair's breadth of being completely mad.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - NIGHT

A huge battle is taking place nearby. The earth trembles and
shakes and gigantic explosions intermittently light the sky.

MERLE staggers down a ravine with NICK, loses his footing and
slides to the bottom where he lies in the mud, motionless,
too tired to move.

SAL comes down behind. He is hunched over, like a gnome. The
rope which MERLE has tied around his neck drags in the mud
and his eyes are huge with terror.

			SAL 
	Merle?

			MERLE
		(a whisper)
	Right here.

SAL crouches down in the mud.

			SAL 
	Where are we going, Merle? Are we
	going home?

			MERLE 
		(barely moving his lips)
	Right here.

Another explosion lights the sky, this one much closer. In
the flash we see that a red American car is stranded in the
middle of the road. There is another explosion and another
flash. The car is dusty, spattered with mud, but otherwise it
appears miraculously unharmed.

NICK'S breath rattles in his throat. MERLE, who lies beside
NICK, holding him, has closed his eyes. SAL, who is the only
one who has seen the car, stares at it hard, and for a long
time, trying it out with one eye and then the other.

			SAL 
	Merle?

No answer.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Merle?

Still no answer. SAL goes over to MERLE and shakes him.
Getting no response he crosses fearfully toward the
automobile. When he gets to within a foot of it, he reaches
out and touches it.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Merle. Merle, a car!

As the flashes continue to light up the sky, SAL peers at the
tires and begins kicking them.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	Hey! Hey, gee!

SAL crosses to the window and looks in. There is no damage
whatsoever, the keys are dangling from the ignition. SAL
pulls open the door and climbs in. He pumps the accelerator,
hits the starter...

THERE IS A FLASH OF FIRE, THEN A HUGE EXPLOSION AND THE CAR
GOES UP IN A FIREBALL OF FLAME.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - BURNING CAR - NIGHT

MERLE has dragged SAL from the car and thrown him in the
ditch below NICK. SAL is horribly burned and MERLE kneels
over him -- out of breath, tears streaming from his cavernous
eyes -- howling with helpless rage.

			MERLE
	Damn it!!! God damn it!!!

MERLE looks down at SAL. SAL'S face in a mass of raw flesh
but his eyes look up at MERLE with lunatic, unwavering trust.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
	Sal!
		(more gently)
	Sal... Goddamn it, Sal, don't you
	know anything?

			SAL
	Where are we going, Merle? Are we
	going home?

			MERLE
		(nods)
	Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.

EXT. CRATERED ROADSIDE - FOLLOWING DAY

REFUGEES are streaming down the road in a desperate,
frightened human torrent. There is every imaginable means of
conveyance -- from bullock carts to motorbikes -- but the
vast majority, carrying their meager belongings, are fleeing
on foot. The burned-out car is still in the middle of the
road and the great human tide streams around it, as if it
were an island. In the distance comes the sound of machine
gun fire and mortars are coming in nearby. MEDVAC helicopters
clatter overhead with wounded strapped to baskets on the
skids. Now and then an ARMY CONVOY comes through, blasting
the REFUGEES into the ditch.

MERLE sits alone on the embankment by the side of the road.
NICK and SAL are gone and the area is littered with fresh
bandage packages and throw-away medical supplies. Suddenly a
jeep pulls up with a two-star GENERAL in it.

			GENERAL
	Where's your unit, soldier?

MERLE stares at the GENERAL -- blankly, without
comprehension. Finally, after a long moment, he gives a
slight shrug.

			GENERAL 
		(to his DRIVER)
	C'mon. We'll take him along.

The GENERAL and the DRIVER get out and start up the
embankment toward MERLE.

			GENERAL (CONT'D)
	Little R and R and you'll be
	standing tall again, son... Damn,
	this is steep!

			DRIVER 
	Uh-oh. Sir.

The GENERAL looks up at MERLE. MERLE is holding the pearl
handled revolver and he cocks the hammer with an audible
click.

			GENERAL 
	Uh-oh.

The GENERAL and the DRIVER turn tail, scramble back down the
embankment and pile in the jeep.

			GENERAL (CONT'D)
		(as they take off)
	Y'know, there's more fucking
	maniacs coming out of this
	conflict...

MERLE watches them go without expression. On the road below
the REFUGEES stream past -- by the hundreds, by the
thousands, by the tens of thousands. For a long moment MERLE
watches, then he jams the gun in his pants and stands.

EXT. EVACUATION ROUTE - DAY

MERLE is walking with the fleeing REFUGEES. CAMERA PANS,
HOLDING ON MERLE as he grows smaller and smaller -- to a
speck in the vast human torrent.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - SAIGON - DAY

The room is tiny, a cubicle furnished with a chair. NICK is
alone, standing at the window looking out. He wears ill
fitting civilian clothes whose colors are too bright for-the
pallor of his skin. Around his neck is a piece of plastic on
which is stapled a colored paper marker. Departing aircraft
thunder overhead and there is the sound of some nearby
hydraulic mechanism.

EXT. LOADING RAMP (NICK'S POV) - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY

Black BODY BAGS are laid out in countless rows on the hot
concrete TWO PFC's are stacking them on pallets and MORE
PFC's, driving hydraulic LIFTERS, are loading the pallets
into the cavernous hold of a huge JET TRANSPORT.

INT. OUT-PATIENT ROOM - U.S. MILITARY HOSPITAL - DAY

NICK turns away from the window and sits down in the chair.
Suddenly the door bursts open and a harassed DOCTOR comes in.

			DOCTOR
	Is your name Solomon?

NICK shakes his head.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	Are you sure?

NICK nods.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	Lemme see this.

The DOCTOR looks at the paper marker on NICK's neck.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	Is this yours?

NICK nods.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	This isn't yours. This can't be
	yours! I'm going to take this one
	off and cut it up...
		(he extracts a pair of
		scissors and does so)
	Shred it... so no one gets a hold
	of it. What I'm going to do now,
	I'm going to give you this one.
		(he staples a new marker
		around NICK's neck)
	There. How's that? Does that feel
	better?

NICK nods. The DOCTOR directs a finger at him.

			DOCTOR (CONT'D)
	That one's yours.

The DOCTOR slams back out the door. Another jet thunders
overhead. The hydraulic LIFTERS on the loading ramp shriek
and whine...

NICK reaches for the new paper marker on his neck and peers
down at it from the corner of his eye. It seems to remind him
of something and he takes out his wallet. In his wallet is a
PHOTOGRAPH of LINDA. NICK peers at the photograph intently,
then closes his wallet and puts it away.

INT. U.S. ARMY TELEPHONE CENTER - SAIGON - DAY

Banks of telephones line the wall. Stretching out from the
telephones are long, ragged lines of SERVICEMEN waiting to
call home. The room is huge, full of echoes. Re-enlistment
posters are plastered everywhere and CANNED LATIN MUSIC is
playing.

NICK stands in one of the lines with only one person in front
of him. He looks anxious. He takes out his wallet again,
peers intently at LINDA'S PHOTOGRAPH, then puts it back.
NICK takes a half-step forward -- staring at the telephone --
and then he stops, frozen with fear.

			GUM CHEWER BEHIND 
	Go on, babe. Take it. 'S all yours!

			NICK
		(mumbles)
	You go ahead.

CAMERA HOLDS ON NICK as he turns out of the line and heads
for the exit under a long row of CLOCKS.

EXT. BUSY STREET - SAIGON - DAY

NICK comes along the sidewalk in a CROWD OF PEDESTRIANS. He
is drunk and he moves aimlessly, as if he had been drifting
along for hours. As he comes to a stop, staring at a SOUTH
VIETNAMESE who has lost both legs, he fumbles in his pocket
for a pint of whiskey, empties the bottle and drops it in the
gutter. Suddenly, across the street, something catches his
eye.

			NICK 
		(calling)
	Sal...! Sal!!!

NICK throws himself into the traffic, headlong, without even
looking.

Vehicles swerve and screech to a stop. NICK dodges between
them, gains the sidewalk on the other side and claps his hand
on the back of a passing SOLDIER. The SOLDIER turns. It is
not SAL at all and the resemblance is not even close.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Sorry... Thought you were someone
	else.

The SOLDIER continues on his way. The CROWD streams on, a sea
of bobbing, brilliant color. NICK gropes in his pocket and
produces another pint bottle. He unscrews the cap and downs a
long swallow.

INT. BAR - SAIGON - NIGHT

The place is very dark. LOUD MUSIC is playing. Partially-clad
BAR GIRLS are dancing with the CUSTOMERS, while above, on a
kind of trapeze, NAKED GIRLS are performing obscene
contortions.

NICK sits at one of the tables. By now he is very drunk and a
BAR GIRL is giving him her undivided attention.

			NICK 
	I love Linda, see. I love Linda
	more than I can even say.

			BAR GIRL 
	Everybody love Linda.

			NICK 
	That's right. That's exactly what I
	mean!

			BAR GIRL 
	I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda
	so much!

			NICK 
	Only,good people love Linda, see.
	What Linda has, Linda --

			BAR GIRL 
		(in his ear)
	How you like to have nice fuck with
	Linda? You like that? Special,
	crazy fuck just like with Linda?

			NICK 
		(stares at her)
	You mean...?

			BAR GIRL 
	I show you. Come. You come. 
		(pulls him to his feet)
	Linda have special, crazy fuck.
	That right?

NICK nods. He looks as if he might be about to cry.

			BAR GIRL (CONT'D)
	I give you special, crazy fuck,
	just like Linda. Come. You come.
	Linda cry, make crazy moan?

NICK nods.

			BAR GIRL (CONT'D)
	I give you cry, crazy moan. Come.
	You come.

INT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT

The BAR GIRL comes around the corner with NICK, guiding him
to a flight of narrow stairs. She has one hand around his
waist and the other down the front of his pants.

			BAR GIRL
	You like to call me Linda now?

			NICK 
	Linda, yeah.

			BAR GIRL 
	You call me Linda, just like home.

Suddenly NICK draws to a stop, staring at a small window at
the end of the corridor. He tears himself loose from the BAR
GIRL and pushes up against the glass.

EXT. NARROW STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

Seated on the sidewalk against the wall of the opposite
building is an OLD MAN surrounded by a collection of white
ceramic elephants. A truck roars by in front of him.
Motorcycles sputter past and PEDESTRIANS hurry in both
directions. The OLD MAN sits motionless, like the guardian of
some timeless, silent kingdom.

INT. CORRIDOR - BAR - NIGHT

NICK spins away from the window.

			NICK 
	Hey... Hey, elephants! Look at
	those elephants!

The BAR GIRL stares at him.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Linda loves elephants! Linda... she
	loves 'em!

NICK turns and charges back down the corridor with the BAR
GIRL hot on his tail.

			BAR GIRL 
	Wait! First I give you special
	fuck!

			NICK 
	Elephants! Make way... I gotta get
	elephants!

EXT. NARROW STREET - NIGHT

NICK paces up and down in front of the OLD MAN and his
ceramic elephants.

			NICK 
	Great... These are great. I wanna
	tell you these are great elephants!
	I'm going home, see... Stateside in
	a few days and my wife Linda, she
	loves elephants. She... she has a
	thing for elephants because
	elephants... Elephants go on. You
	know what I mean? They go right on.
	I don't know if they cry. Maybe at
	night. I mean... What I mean is my
	two best buddies are dead, see,
	MIA, who knows, and they would have
	liked some elephants also
	because... How much are these
	elephants? I mean let's talk
	elephant.
		(notices a GROUP OF STREET
		URCHINS)
	Hey you guys...! Over here! Come
	over here and carry elephants!

The STREET URCHINS come running. They are ragged,
malnourished, ranging in age from about six to nine. They are
covered with sores. One of them ~as lost an eye and another
has lost a hand.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Everyone take an elephant!
		(to the YOUNGEST URCHIN)
	You know how to carry an elephant?
		(the URCHIN nods)
	That's what I thought. Right off I
	figured you as that kind of guy.
	Hey, wait a minute, I gotta get
	change. Take an elephant! Everyone
	take an elephant and then form up.
	Right here. Over here, like this,
	in a nice long elephant line...
	Good. That's good. Man, look at all
	these elephants! One, two, three,
	four, five, six, seven, eight,
	nine, ten... eleven elephants!
		(surveys them)
	Hey, but you gotta stand tall to
	carry elephants.
		(he illustrates)
	Better. That's better. I mean...
	God damn, I mean that's elephants
	now! Wait. Now you wait while I get
	change.

NICK dives into a nearby bar.

INT. NEARBY BAR - NIGHT

The place is as dark as the one before. MUSIC BLASTS from a
jukebox and two vaseline-covered GIRLS are dancing. As NICK
crosses to the bar to get change there is a WHISTLING SCREAM
and then the FRONT WALL OF THE BUILDING DISINTEGRATES IN A
ROAR OF NOISE.

NICK pulls himself out of the debris. There is absolute
silence in the WRECKED BAR but rockets are coming in all over
the city and the EXPLOSIONS rumble and roar.

EXT. NARROW STREET AFTER ROCKET EXPLOSION - NIGHT

A nearby building is burning fiercely. The street is deserted
except for the sprawled CORPSES of the STREET URCHINS which
lie this way and that, like broken dolls.

NICK walks out past the CORPSES. The street is littered with
fragments of broken ceramic -- gleaming, pure white, like
chunks of snow.

EXT. DESERTED STREET - SAIGON - NIGHT

The sky is alight with fires. Now and then HUGE EXPLOSIONS
rock the night and SIRENS wail.

A lone figure appears, walking down the middle of the street.
As the figure approaches we see that it is NICK.

			NICK
		(toneless, over and over)
	Hey, hey, the wind does blow. 
	Hey, hey, the snow does snow. 
	Hey, hey, the rain does rain...

NICK swallows, as if to force back some overwhelming emotion.
Then, squatting down under a lamp post, he begins again.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Hey, hey, the wind does blow.
	Hey, hey, the snow does snow...

NICK takes out his wallet, opens it hurriedly to the
PHOTOGRAPH OF LINDA and peers at it with a kind of ferocious
determination, as if this link were the last, as if by
staring at it hard he could make it hold.

			NICK (CONT'D)
		(his voice thin, cracking)
	Hey, hey, the wind does blow.
	Hey, hey, the snow does snow --

There is the sharp report of a pistol SHOT and then, as NICK
spins, staring at a shuttered building, there is the
unmistakable sound of APPLAUSE.

NICK stares at the building for a long moment, then he
crosses toward it.

EXT. YARD BEHIND BUILDING - SAIGON - NIGHT

A tiny light glows inside a paper lantern. Lying on the
around are three CORPSES, all of them Asian, all of them
expensively dressed and all of them with their heads blown
off. As NICK stands looking at them a door comes open on the
back of the building,and TWO BURLY MEN bring out another
corpse. The body is that of a young American. Like the Asians
he is expensively dressed and he is dead from a bullet in the
right temple.

			MAN (V.O.)
	If you are brave and lucky I can
	make you rich.

NICK turns. A MAN is standing in the shadows of a small grape
arbor, eyeing him with a look of cold amusement. The MAN'S
accent is French. Beside him, on a small white table, is a
bottle of champagne and several glasses.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	You have played?

NICK stares at the MAN, nods.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	Once you have played it is not so
	hard. Cigarette?

NICK shakes his head.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	You seem... disturbed.

			NICK
	I... No. You do this for money?

			MAN 
	Mais certainment... A great deal of
	money. Naturally I do not do it
	myself. I myself do not possess the
	nerve.
		(smiles)
	But I am always... how do you
	say... looking out for those who
	do... It is a thing quite rare.
	Champagne perhaps? Tch, tch. Don't
	say no. When a man says no to
	champagne, he says no to life and
	that no man must ever do.
		(gives NICK a glass)
	Where did you play?

			NICK 
	Up north.

			MAN 
	Ah yes. Of course... So few
	survive.
		(smiles)
	La creme de la creme... How did you
	obtain release?

			NICK 
	Playing.

			MAN
		(raises his eyebrows)
	Playing?

			NICK
	We... Three bullets.

			MAN 
	And then you...

The MAN makes a clicking sound, three times, as if firing a
pistol. NICK nods.

			MAN (CONT'D)
	How extremely clever. That is
	really most extraordinaire... Allow
	me please to introduce myself. I am
	Armand... And you are?

			NICK 
	Nick.

			ARMAND 
	Nick. C'est extraordinaire! Do you
	know that I have a cousin who is
	called Nicholas and a nephew
	Nickolai. So you are, comme on dit,
	en famille. In the family.

There is another SHOT from inside and another round of
APPLAUSE.

			NICK 
	I have to go.

			ARMAND 
	But you must come in.

			NICK 
	No, I --

			ARMAND 
	But I insist.

			NICK 
	I have to go.

			ARMAND 
	You are frightened, no?

NICK nods.

			ARMAND (CONT'D)
	Of what is there to be afraid? The
	war? The war is no problem. It is a
	joke, a silly thing. I make one
	call and get you out.

ARMAND refills NICK's glass. NICK looks at it. The glass is
as thin as paper and the sparkling bubbles dance and hiss.
NICK lifts the glass and empties in one swallow.

			NICK 
	See, I'm going home.

			ARMAND 
	Ah yes. Of course.
		(smiles)
	To the girl who waits.

			NICK 
		(gives him a look and
		sits)
	Yeah... Do you mind if I sit?

			ARMAND 
	But of course! Please make yourself
	comfortable. Perhaps you would
	enjoy some fresh caviar, or une
	petite glace, or --?

			NICK 
		(weary, shaking his head)
	No. None of that.

			ARMAND 
	Unfortunately I must now go in, but
	I leave you my card. Naturellement
	I pay my players cash American.
	Just so you know.

ARMAND disappears in the darkness. Then his VOICE comes
again.

			ARMAND (V.O.) (CONT'D)
	However, should you prefer German
	marks, or perhaps Swiss francs,
	this of course can be arranged.
	Everything can be arranged.

ARMAND moves around the side of the building and the sound of
his FOOTSTEPS fades away. The TWO BURLY MEN come lurching
with another CORPSE. Laughter comes from inside the building
and there is a glimpse of AN ELEGANTLY DRESSED WOMAN seated
at a cafe table. The BURLY MEN return to the door and shut it
tight. In the distance the sky goes up in a huge flash of
fire and then the sound of the EXPLOSION rolls across the
city like a great dead wind.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - WINTER - DUSK

The trailer is all decked out with bunting and stuck, like a
plum cake, with tiny American flags. Stretching from the
trailer to the side of a house across the street is a huge,
hand-lettered banner which says "WELCOME HOME NICK!" and it
whips and it snaps in the cold winter wind.

NICK's battered old shark-finned Cadillac is in the yard.
Alongside it are a bunch of newer cars and PEOPLE are coming
from all directions, spilling in and out of the trailer and
congregating in excited, foot-stomping, half-frozen groups.

EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS - COLUMBINE AREA - DUSK

We see the OLD PRIEST on his way from the church. We see the
OLDER WOMEN, wrapped in shawls and carrying cakes and
cookies, trudging up the hill. We see ALBERT, JOHN and a
bunch of STEELWORKERS, all of them half-bombed, dragging two
cases of beer on a child's sled. We see LINDA peering out the
trailer window, pale and anxious-looking. We see VINCE, who
is unofficial lookout, jumping up and down at the approach of
every car and screaming, "This is it! This is Nick!" and
then, when it isn't, saying, "Not yet! Just hold your water,
I'll tell you when!"

And we see an empty street into which SIX VETS from the VFW
Post come tottering. The VETS are all in their old uniforms.
While three of them attempt to make MUSIC on a BASS DRUM, a
FIFE and an old Army BUGLE, the other three attempt to sing.

			VETS 
	Three cheers for the red, white and
	blue...!

			VET #1 
	This is hard.

			VET # 2 
	Christ Almighty, it's fifty years!

			VETS 
	Three cheers for the red, white and
	blue...

INT. TAXICAB - DUSK

NICK sits hunched forward in the back seat surrounded by
unwrapped cartons containing electric appliances he has
bought for LINDA. NICK looks nervous, VERY NERVOUS.

Suddenly, as the cab comes over the crest of a hill, the
trailer looms into sight, straight ahead, with VINCE hopping
up and down in the snow and the OLD VETS all marking time
under the flapping banner.

			CAB DRIVER 
	Whadda welcome! Will you lookit...
	Whadda welcome!

NICK stares at the approaching trailer.

			NICK 
	That's not it.

			CAB DRIVER 
	What're you, crazy? That's not
	it??? You said a trailer. You said--

			NICK 
	That's not it. Keep going. Go
	straight.

			CAB DRIVER 
	Hey, now listen. Now you said --

			NICK 
	I'm telling you that's not it! Now
	keep going!

NICK throws himself down on the floor.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Just keep going! Just keep going
	straight!

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK

LINDA is outside, standing with VINCE and ALBERT.

			VINCE 
	This is him. I'm telling you, this
	is Nick!

The TAXICAB comes thudding by. LINDA, VINCE and ALBERT all
watch as it disappears over a rise.

			ALBERT
		(to VINCE)
	I thought that was it.

			VINCE 
	So he's in the next one, Albert. I
	mean take it easy. I mean you're
	driving everybody nuts!

			VETS (V.O.)
		(singing raggedly)
	Three cheers for the red, white and
	blue...!

			VINCE
		(to LINDA)
	You okay?

LINDA gives a thin smile.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	It's gonna be the next one. Okay?

LINDA nods.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	It's gotta be the next one. I mean
	it's gotta be! Right, Albert?

			ALBERT
	Fuckin' A. It's gotta!

			VINCE
	It's gotta!

EXT. MOTEL - DUSK

A huge neon sign stands against the grey sky, buzzing
angrily, as if it were full of bees.

The TAXI DRIVER comes out of one of the units, gets back in
his cab and pulls away.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK

NICK stands in the doorway where the driver has left him. His
duffle bag and the cartons of electric appliances are piled
along the wall by his feet. His head is thrown back and he is
draining a bottle of whiskey, gulping it down in great raw
swallows. .

NICK lowers the bottle, catches his breath and goes at it
again. This time, as he lowers the bottle, the stark panic is
gone, but there is still fear -- blind, nameless fear, like
that of an animal run to the ground.

NICK crosses to the window, grips the frame with both hands
and looks out.

EXT. THE STEEL MILL FROM THE MOTEL (NICK'S POV) - DUSK

The five great stacks trail ribbons of black smoke across the
pale winter sky, Steam billows upward in huge, silver-edged
clouds and there is the flash and gleam of fire.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - DUSK

NICK turns back to the room. He stares at it blankly --
stares at the bed, stares at the bureau, stares at the chair,
then he picks up the bottle, closes his eyes and begins
gulping down whiskey -- gulping it hard, fast, as hard and
fast as he can.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NEW ANGLE - DAWN

The banner stretching to the house across the street has been
whipped to shreds by the wind. In the yard, parked beside
NICK's black Cadillac, is another car of about the same
vintage. There is a case of beer on its roof, the windows are
entirely frosted over and the engine is running. After a
moment TWO STEELWORKERS come down the street and knock on the
trailer door. TWO OLDER WOMEN emerge, putting on their coats,
and then LINDA comes to the door and tells the STEELWORKERS
she has no news. The STEELWORKERS and the OLDER WOMEN start
off, but now one of the WOMEN points to the frosted up car.
The STEELWORKERS go back, pound on the roof of the frosted up
car, pull open a few doors and go on their way. First thing
out is a GIRL. Next thing out is a SECOND GIRL. Their dresses
are rumpled and half-undone. Neither one has a coat and the
SECOND GIRL is missing a shoe. The GIRLS both plunge back
inside the car, where howling and cursing can now be heard.
The GIRLS both retrieve their coats. The SECOND GIRL gets her
missing shoe, plus a bra and a pair of panties.
She returns the panties to the FIRST GIRL, puts on her shoe
and they both take off at a fast trot. As the two GIRLS leave
there is a cascade of empty beer cans and ALBERT, VINCE and
JOHN all stagger out -- bleary-eyed, hung-over, half
undressed and freezing. LINDA comes out of the trailer with
coffee, but just as she emerges the whistle at the mill goes
off. ALBERT and VINCE begin yelling at each other, yelling at
JOHN and yelling at LINDA. Then they throw themselves back in
the car and start off. The case of beer on the roof crashes
to the street. They stop, pile out, pick up the cans, heave
them in the back seat and take off again.

JOHN says something to LINDA and goes on his way.

LINDA stands in the yard, alone, with the three cups of
coffee.

EXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN

NICK stands half-way down a rickety wooden stairway,
watching.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - ORIGINAL ANGLE - DAWN

LINDA turns and goes back inside the trailer.

EXT. ADJOINING OVERLOOK - DAWN

NICK swallows and starts down the stairway toward the
trailer. He hesitates, pulls the bottle from his pocket,
drains the last of it and tucks it under the stairs.
Straightening up, he claws at his hair, trying to comb it
with his fingers. Then he starts down again.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - DAWN

Cakes, cookies, six-packs of beer and bottles of wine cover
almost every inch of available space. LINDA sits on the
little settee, wedged between two cases of Coca-Cola and
hunched over a white sweater which she is attempting, with
painful slowness, to knit. LINDA is trying not to cry. She is
trying her God-damnedest.

There is a knock at the door. LINDA freezes. Then, trying to
be totally matter-of-fact, she puts down the sweater, crosses
to the door and opens it.

			NICK
	Guess who.

LINDA stares at him. NICK gives a little laugh and steps in.

			LINDA
		(throws herself in his
		arms)
	Nick! Oh, Nick, you're back!

She hugs him for a moment, as hard as she can, then they pull
apart.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought
	you were hurt, some accident. Maybe
	you fell or maybe some car...
		(back in his arms)
	I thought someone stole you away!

			NICK 
	No.

			LINDA 
	Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!

They pull apart.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	How are you?

			NICK 
	Fine. I'm fine. How are you?

			LINDA 
	Fine. I just go along, you know.
	Down at the market. Back here. I
	mean it just seems there's a
	million things to do!... Are you
	sure you're all right? I mean, what
	about the wound?

			NICK 
		(anger)
	That was nothing. That wasn't
	anything.

			LINDA 
	But --

			NICK 
	It was just the complications. I
	mean, you take a little thing over
	there and then you get
	complications. I mean all the guys
	had it.

			LINDA 
	I made you a sweater. 
		(she gets it)
	Here... You have to take that off.

NICK removes his coat. LINDA pulls the sweater over him

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	I couldn't remember your exact
	size.

The sweater is huge, a great rumpled thing reaching almost to
NICK's knees.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
		(smoothly)
	Oh, that's fine. Perfect... It is a
	little too big... 
		(she pulls the sweater
		back off)
	... but I can easily fix that.
	Easily. One thing about wool
	sweaters, they are such a cinch to
	fix.

She crosses to a garbage pail out of NICK's line of sight and
stuffs the sweater in it.

			NICK 
	How's the trailer?

			LINDA 
	Great. Fine... Once or twice it did
	fall off the blocks. I don't know
	what that's from.

			NICK 
	Frost.

			LINDA 
	Is that what it is? I couldn't
	figure out.

			NICK 
	Did you get hurt? You didn't get
	hurt?

			LINDA 
	Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump.
	Would you like a Coke? You don't
	drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What
	about champagne? Let's have
	champagne! I don't think we have
	champagne. Let's have this. See?
	Sparkling. I'll get you an opener.
	Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's
	just have beer. Do you want some
	cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we
	should have coffee.

She begins to sob. CAMERA CLOSES ON HER FACE:

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Nick? I'm so glad you're alive! I'm
	so happy! I... I just don't know
	what to do!

EXT. COLUMBINE STREET - DAY

NICK and LINDA are some distance away. NICK is shaking hands
with an ENTHUSIASTIC MAN while LINDA stands to one side,
watching his face, and so full of love that she seems about
to burst. ANOTHER MAN comes over. LINDA takes the MAN's arm
and presents him to NICK.

WE CANNOT HEAR WHAT IS BEING SAID. THE ONLY SOUND COMES FROM
THE MILL WHICH LOOMS UP BEHIND THEM OUT THE FROZEN VALLEY
BELOW.

INT. PIZZA PARLOR - TABLE BY WINDOW - DAY

NICK and LINDA sit opposite one another. Across the street a
coal train is rumbling slowly by and NICK is watching it. The
cars are black, interchangable, and they roll on and on.
Suddenly the last car appears. The car passes and there is
silence.

LINDA gives NICK a smile.

			NICK 
	It was all for nothing. Do you know
	that? It was all for nothing.

LINDA stares at him. She doesn't know what to say, how to
respond. NICK forces a grin, gestures with his hand and
shrugs. He picks up the check, stands.

			LINDA 
	Nick?... I just want to say how
	sorry I am about Sal and about
	Merle. How... I know you loved them
	and I know it's not the same. I
	mean now.

			NICK
	Naw, it's... I mean...

			LINDA 
	Maybe... I don't know, if you want
	to talk --

			NICK 
	Naw, it's... This guy wants his
	money.

INT. SUPERMARKET - BACK ROOM - DAY

The place is full of crates and boxes. ONE CREW is unloading
a tractor-trailer. ANOTHER CREW is stacking and unpacking.
NICK stands with LINDA and a red-faced, cigar-chewing MANAGER
who is pumping NICK's hand, slapping him on the back and
shouting orders all at the same time.

			MANAGER 
	You did a good job, kid. Pettrucio,
	here! You did a good job. Gimme a
	count on these pears! I think we
	got 'em now, know what I mean? The
	pears, the pears! Ask me, we got
	'em right by the balls, know what I
	mean? Have a cigar. The pears,
	Pettrucio, the pears!!!

He goes off.

			NICK
		(to Linda)
	Does this... I mean, how does this
	job work out?

			LINDA 
	Oh, it's great. Fine.

NICK nods. A STOCK BOY comes by and whistles.

			STOCK BOY 
	Hi you, hot lips.

			NICK 
	What do they... bother you!?

			LINDA
		(takes his arm, laughs)
	No-o-o!

			NICK 
	I'll kill 'em. Anybody bothers you,
	I'll kill 'em!

			LINDA 
		(gently)
	Nick. It's okay... It's okay.
		(gives him a squeeze,
		kisses him)
	I have to go now.

NICK nods.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Pick me up at eight.

NICK nods again. LINDA hurries off. The MANAGER comes in from
behind, clapping NICK on the shoulder and going for his ear

			MANAGER 
	That's one sweet little piece of
	ass. I'm telling you, that's one
	sweet little piece of ass. Who's
	got these pears, God damn it! Who's
	got the count on these goddamn
	pears!

EXT. STEEL MILL PARKING LOT - DAY

NICK stands by the entrance to the mill. It is cold and he
looks as if he had been waiting for some time. Suddenly
STEELWORKERS begin streaming out the doors, heading for their
cars. NICK cranes his neck and then he catches sight of
ALBERT and VINCE.

			NICK 
	Hey, Albert!

ALBERT turns. He grabs VINCE and pulls him through the
departing STEELWORKERS.

			VINCE 
	What the --!

			ALBERT 
	It's Nick!

			VINCE 
	Nick...?
		(sees him)
	Jesus, Nick!

VINCE grabs NICK's hand, shakes it. Then ALBERT does the
same.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Where the hell were you? We were
	all set -- beer, broads. Right? Am
	I right?

			ALBERT 
	Yeah.

			NICK 
	I got delayed. I --

			ALBERT
		(hugs him)
	Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you
	been doin', I mean...

			VINCE 
	Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants,
	Albert! I mean, what do you think?

			ALBERT 
	I know, but...

			VINCE 
	What do you think? You think he's
	been picking flowers? Fuckin' guy's
	been saving your ass, Albert.
	Everybody's ass! Even in Europe!

			ALBERT 
	Yeah. Oh, boy, yeah... Jes', you
	must be tired.

			NICK 
	I'm fine. Hey, I'm fine.

THEY start for the cars.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	How're you guys... I mean, how've
	you guys been?

			VINCE 
	Same old thing. Hey, same like
	always. Nothing's changed. Albert
	is getting fat.

			ALBERT 
	Look who's talkin'! Jes'! He got
	married! Vince got married!

			NICK 
	Married?

			ALBERT 
	Tell him, Vince.

			VINCE 
	Yeah. I did. Yeah...What the hell.

VINCE makes a gesture, shrugs.

			NICK 
		(after a beat)
	Well, who'd you get married to?

			VINCE 
	Aw, it's a long story!

			ALBERT 
	Tell him, Vince!

			VINCE 
	Well... you remember Cynthia?

			NICK 
	Cynthia! Sure.

			VINCE
		(nods)
	That's who.

			NICK 
		(fast recovery)
	Cynthia! Hey, that's terrific. I
	mean... Great! That's really great!

			ALBERT 
	Show him the gun. Hey, show him the
	gun, Vince.

VINCE looks around. Cars are streaming out of the lot, horns
blaring. VINCE pulls back his coat and shows a .38 Smith and
Weston in a holster on his hip.

			NICK 
	What the hell's that for?

			VINCE 
	What's it for??

			ALBERT 
	He's serious. Vince is fuckin'
	serious!

			NICK 
	You mean...?

			VINCE
	Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is
	for the guy that gets caught!

			ALBERT
	Vince thinks... you know...

			NICK 
		(nods)
	Hey... hey, let's drink!

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT

NICK comes through the CROWD OF STEELWORKERS shaking hands.
The STEELWORKERS treat him with immense respect. There are no
cracks; there are no jokes. They squeeze his shoulder, pat
his back, reaching out for him, touching him.

			STEELWORKERS 
	Nice going! Good going, Nick! You
	did good, boy; you did fine! Let
	him through! Damn good, boy! Let
	him through! He's all right! Did
	his part and he did it good! Let
	him through! Let's make a little
	room!

JOHN pushes out of the crowd.

			JOHN
	Nick! Hey, Nick!
		(gives him a big hug)
	Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay?
	You're okay, huh?

			NICK
	Fine. Hey, I'm fine.

			JOHN
	Sit down. Here. Right here.
		(calls)
	Albert! Vince!

JOHN pushes them all into a booth. A tray arrives loaded with
beer and shots of whiskey.

			JOHN (CONT'D)
	Here. Here we go.
		(he raises a beer)
	Here's to you, Nick!

			ALBERT
	Fuckin' A!

			VINCE
		(stands)
	Here's to Nick, you guys. He did
	his part. He did... what hadda be
	done... and so he did it... and
	here he is!!!

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT - LATER

NICK sits at the bar flanked by VINCE and ALBERT. Both VINCE
and ALBERT are completely glassed out. Behind, in the booths,
three or four STEELWORKERS are sleeping. JOHN moves around
behind the counter wiping things off.

			JOHN
	Rough, huh?

			NICK
	Rough.
		(he nods)
	We didn't have to do it, John.

			JOHN
	No?

			NICK
	No. How's Angela? How's she taking
	it?

			JOHN
	Not so good.

			NICK
	No?

			JOHN
	Worse since she talked to him.

			ALBERT
		(with a dull beery blink)
	Fucking A.

			NICK
	Worse since she talked to who?

			JOHN
	Sal.

			NICK
	Talked to Sal?
		(stares at him)
	Sal's alive?

			JOHN
	Kind of. You didn't know?

			NICK
		(pushes off the counter)
	Sal's alive???

JOHN, ALBERT and VINCE exchange glances, nod.

			ALBERT
	He's real bad, Nick.

			NICK
		(stares at them)
	Well, where the hell is he!!! I
	mean what are we all sitting here
	for!!!
		(tears begin streaming
		down his face)
	WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???

			ALBERT 
	Nick...

			VINCE 
	Hey, Nick...

			JOHN 
	Nick, we don't know where Sal is...
	Nick, Angela won't tell us.

			NICK 
	Why?... What do you mean?... Why???

			JOHN 
	Nick, she won't say why.

			NICK 
	But Sal's mother! What about Sal's
	mother!

			JOHN 
	She's out of her tree, Nick. She is
	straight out of her tree.

			NICK 
		(stares at them)
	Oh, Jesus.

He walks in a circle and then stops, staring at them.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Oh, Jesus!!!

NICK turns and goes out.

INT. SAL'S HOUSE - FRONT PARLOR - NIGHT

The room is very dark. ANGELA sits at a lace-covered table by
the window where a street lamp illuminates her in an eerie
glow. ANGELA holds a portable radio in tier hand, a very tiny
one, and she fiddles with the dial, going from one station to
another.

There is a sound from the hallway, then SAL'S MOTHER comes in
with NICK.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	I know I know you. So familiar.
	Such a familiar face. Oh, I know
	now! The toaster man! I'll go and
	get it for you.

SAL'S MOTHER goes out. ANGELA lights up a cigarette.

			ANGELA 
	You're back.

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			ANGELA 
	I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very
	glad.

			NICK 
	Angela, I just heard Sal was alive.

			ANGELA 
	Sure. Why not.

			NICK 
	Where? Where is he?

			ANGELA 
	Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital
	and they're fixing him up.

			NICK 
	You talk to him?

			ANGELA 
	Oh, sure... Twice a day.

			NICK 
	What hospital is he in? Where?

			ANGELA 
	Nick... Sal is very weak. He
	suffered a severe wound... and
	right now he doesn't want a whole
	lot of people to get involved in a
	whole thing.

			NICK 
	Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a
	long way.

			ANGELA 
	He doesn't want people bugging him,
	Nick!

ANGELA begins to tremble, jabs out her cigarette and stands
up.

She stares at NICK for a moment, goes to a telephone pad and
writes down a number in a tiny, nearly illegible scrawl. NICK
comes up behind her. ANGELA finishes, puts down the pen and
stands with her back against the wall. NICK tears off the
piece of paper, looks at it, puts it in his pocket.

			NICK 
	Angela...?

ANGELA laughs and gives a strange, twisted smile, avoiding
NICK's eyes.

			ANGELA 
	Did you ever think life would turn
	out like this?

			NICK 
	No.

			ANGELA 
	You know what Sal's got now?...
	Sal's got... one arm, Nick, and...
	that's it.

The door to the kitchen bangs open and SAL'S MOTHER comes in
with an electric toaster and a screwdriver.

			SAL'S MOTHER 
	Here. This is it. What you do, you
	stick this in here.

Pushes the toaster in NICK's arms.

			SAL'S MOTHER (CONT'D)
	Then you jab it, see. Jab it good.
	Something's in it. Hear? Listen.
	Something's in it. What? What's
	there?

EXT. RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT

NICK sits on the steps with the toaster that Sal's mother
gave him in his lap. It is snowing and from inside the church
we hear the CHOIR SINGING. The sound is massive, deep and
dark, like a great river rolling through the night.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK. He is staring at something, tears
glistening in his eyes.

EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - REVERSE ANGLE (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

We see a lone telephone booth at the curb. The door is half
open and snow is blowing in.

EXT. ORTHODOX CHURCH - ORIGINAL ANGLE - NIGHT

NICK closes his eyes, leans his head forward and takes it in
his hands.

INT. MOTEL NICK'S UNIT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

LINDA steps out of the shower and begins to dry herself.

			LINDA 
	It just seems sort of strange
	coming to a motel... Like a
	honeymoon. Or some kind of parlez
	vous ... Not parlez-vous!
		(she giggles)
	What am I saying? That's those
	cocktails! Parlez-vous!... What I
	mean is rendezvous. Some kind of
	rendezvous.

LINDA pulls on a short and very sexy nightie, then looks at
herself in the mirror. She is very excited, very nervous. She
strikes a pose, pulling up the bottom of the nightie and
poking a finger in her mouth.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Do you know what I mean?... Nick?

NICK doesn't answer. LINDA pulls the door full open, takes
one last look at herself and goes out.

INT. MOTEL - NICK'S UNIT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

As LINDA comes out of the bathroom her face falls and she
stops dead in her tracks.

NICK is lying on the bed -- sprawled on his back, one shoe
off and sound asleep.

			LINDA 
	Nick?

NICK doesn't stir, doesn't budge. LINDA crosses and looks at
him -- hungrily, top to bottom -- then she gives his toe a
wistful shake.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Nick...? Nick, it's me!

But NICK is out, gone. LINDA lets out a little moan and sits
down on the chair beside the bed. Then, almost immediately,
she stands and begins taking off his clothes. She takes off
his shoes, then both socks. As she goes to undo his belt, his
shirt, which is unbuttoned, falls slightly open, revealing a
fresh scar. LINDA stares at the scar for a moment, then she
slowly exposes the whole of NICK's chest.

NICK'S CHEST IS COVERED WITH A SERIES OF TERRIFYING FRESH
SCARS. THE SCARS ARE RAISED; THEY ARE INTER-CONNECTED AND
STUDDED WITH ANGRY SUTURE MARKS, LIKE A TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP OF
SOME UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUND.

CAMERA HOLDS ON LINDA'S FACE.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STEEL MILL - CASTING ROOM - DAY

NICK stands at the handle of a long metal rod. At the other
end of the rod ALBERT and VINCE are attaching metallic
strips. When ALBERT and VINCE have secured the strips they
signal to NICK and all three of them lower their goggles.

CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK. NICK is standing below a furnace
which is seven stories high, towering above him into a maze
of cat-walks and monstrous steel-hipped cranes.

ALBERT and VINCE give a signal and the CRANE OPERATOR raises
the door at the bottom of the furnace. NICK is now alone,
standing like Don Quixote with his lance. As NICK advances
toward the base of the furnace with his rod the surface of
his asbestos suit begins to smoke and bits of lint which have
stuck to it burst into flame. Within reach of the furnace
now, NICK pauses. Then, lifting the metal rod, he jams it
through the open doorway at the base of the furnace. There is
a white flash as the metallic strips explode and then a
geyser of molten steel erupts in a huge jet through the
doorway, passing NICK at the level of his shoulders and
showering him in a great cascade of white sparks.

INT. JOHN'S BAR - NIGHT

NICK sits at the bar, silent, hunched over a beer, lost in
thought. All around him STEELWORKERS are shouting, yelling,
cracking jokes. After a moment VINCE pushes in, claps him on
the back.

			VINCE 
	How's it feel, huh? How's it feel
	to be back?

			NICK
		(forced enthusiasm)
	Great. Feels great... Fuckin' A!

			VINCE 
	I mean, I guess you still think
	about Nam. Right? I mean --

			NICK 
	Naw.
		(shakes his head)
	Uh-huh.

			VINCE 
	Hey, Nick, you ever do it with one
	of those slants?

			NICK 
	No.

			VINCE 
	No!

			NICK 
	Never one.

			VINCE 
	Oh, Jesus!
		(looks around)
	You're kiddin'!

			NICK 
	One, Vince... you have to
	understand, doing it with one...
	would be... like nothing. They're
	small, see, so if you're smart you
	get about six or eight. I mean, if
	you want to have any fun.

			VINCE 
	Six or eight.
		(nods) 
	And they go wild?

			NICK 
		(lowers his voice)
	They have these little sticks,
	Vince. They call them "chomp
	chomps", and when you get these
	girls going, you have to stick 'em
	in their mouths.

VINCE stares at NICK. His respiration is up, his mouth is
bone dry and his eyes are as big as saucers. For a moment his
belief is total, then a frown crosses his face.

			VINCE 
	You're full of shit!

			NICK 
		(nods)
	Yeah.

			VINCE
		(pounding him on the head)
	And I believed you! I oughta punch
	you out! I oughta...! Hey. Hey,
	let's go huntin'! Albert! Hey,
	Albert! Let's go huntin'. What do
	you say? Nick? What do you say?

			NICK 
	Sure.

			ALBERT 
	Hey! Fuckin' A! Hey!

He spots JOHN passing with a tray of beer.

			ALBERT (CONT'D)
	Hey, John!

ALBERT scoops JOHN into his arms where he holds him from
behind.

			JOHN
	Yes, Albert?

			ALBERT
		(into his ear)
	John,we're going huntin'.

			JOHN 
	Who's going?

			ALBERT
	We're all going.

			JOHN
	Nick's going?

			ALBERT
	Nick, Vince, Albert and John.

			JOHN 
	No women?

			OTHERS 
	No! No women! Jesus! What are you,
	crazy?

			JOHN 
	Take these beers.

They all take a beer. JOHN raises his glass, solemnly.

			JOHN (CONT'D)
	Here's to huntin'.

			ALBERT 
	Hey! Fuckin' A!

			VINCE
		(hopping up and down)
	Just like always! Just like it
	always was! Right, Nick? Am I
	right?

			NICK 
	In the timeless words of Squire
	Albert...

VINCE cracks up, howling.

			VINCE 
	Squire Albert...

VINCE collapses on the floor.

			NICK
	In the timeless words of Squire
	Albert...

			ALL
		(in a ragged chorus)
	Hey! Fuckin' A!!!

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK sits on the bed in the back part of the trailer. His
hunting gear is piled on the floor, the lights are out and he
is staring at the telephone which is illuminated through the
window by a street light on the corner. There is a sound
outside, then the lights come on as LINDA enters with
groceries.

			LINDA
	Nick?

			NICK
	Right here.

LINDA crosses to the doorway.

			LINDA
	What are you doing?

			NICK
	Oh. Nothing... Sitting.

			LINDA
	You're going hunting?

			NICK
		(blankly)
	What?

			LINDA
	I see you're going hunting.

NICK looks at the equipment on the floor.

			NICK
	Yeah... All the guys, we're all
	going huntin'. Like we did. You
	know? Like we always used to.

			LINDA 
	That's wonderful. I think you
	should... fresh air.

NICK gets to his feet, suddenly. His face is twisted with
pain and his voice is cracked with emotion.

			NICK 
	You know how sometimes you're going
	along... You're going along... And
	that's all...! One thing is right
	after another, like steps... And
	you step along.

NICK can hardly breathe. It is as if he were choking.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	I don't know where that is... It's
	gone! That's gone!

A car pulls up outside. The HORN begins blowing, then VINCE
and ALBERT begin pounding on the wall of the trailer.

			VINCE (V.O.) 
	Let's go!!!

			ALBERT (V.O.) 
	Hey! Fuckin' A! Time to roll!!!

			NICK 
	I gotta go.

NICK swings his pack on his back, picks up his rifle and
heads for the door. LINDA follows, still clutching her
groceries, her emotions so pulverized she can't even speak.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	I'll be... I don't know... Couple
	of days.

NICK IS GONE. LINDA STANDS MOTIONLESS, CLUTCHING HER
GROCERIES, STARING AT THE TRAILER DOOR. IT IS DARK OUTSIDE.
SNOW IS BLOWING IN. THE DOOR CLOSES SLOWLY, WITH A FAINT
HISS, AND THEN CLICKS SHUT.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOOD FOREST - DAY

Snow is blowing, swirling past the trunks of stark, ice
covered trees. There is no horizon. Sky and earth are bound
in a moan of wind, in the faint creak of frozen limbs and the
whispering, fitful, spinning flakes.

NICK appears, suddenly, as a gust of wind shifts the slanting
snow. NICK is moving easily, heading slightly uphill,
following the contour of the slope. As he draws closer we see
that he is following a SET OF FRESH TRACKS.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - MIXED HARDWOODS - ROCK LEDGE - DAY

A magnificent SEVEN POINT BUCK stands by a grove of hemlocks,
looking down the slope.

NICK appears below, barely visible in the swirling snow.

The BUCK watches NICK for a moment, then turns unhurriedly
and vanishes into the trees.

EXT. RIDGE NEAR CAMP - DAY

VINCE is out of breath, clawing his way up a steep slope on
all fours. JOHN and ALBERT, who have reached a level area
above VINCE, unsling their rifles. SHOTS are going off in
every direction and the sound is so magnified by echoes that
it sounds like a full scale war.

			VINCE 
	What are you, kiddin'? Are you
	kiddin' me, Albert? Twenty times I
	coulda had her! She...! One time
	she begged me, practically begged
	me. Listen, I had her tit, which
	was out, in one hand, and my other
	hand... You know that mole on the
	inside of her right leg? Well, I
	was past that mole, way past that
	mole, and I was --

JOHN nudges ALBERT. FOUR DEER are coming down the slope,
single file. JOHN and ALBERT raise their rifles and FIRE. TWO
OF THE DEER FALL AND THE REMAINING TAKE OFF. VINCE, who is
just getting to his feet, unslings his rifle, trips and falls
down. JOHN and ALBERT drag VINCE to his feet and then rush
over to the TWO DEAD DEER.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(coming after them)
	Nice shootin', you guys. Not bad.
	Not half bad.

Leans his rifle on the horns of one of the fallen DEER.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	'Course how could you miss, right?
	Twenty, maybe thirty feet. I mean,
	if I'd'a been where you guys were --

			JOHN 
	Psst. Vince!

JOHN signals with his head. VINCE turns. ANOTHER DEER has
come out of the woods. The DEER is rattled by the gunfire and
peers at VINCE uncertainly. VINCE spins and grabs his gun,
which immediately goes off. He slams another shell in the
chamber and scrambles to his feet but the rifle sling is
hooked on the antlers of the DEAD DEER and another shot
ricochets off a nearby rock. JOHN and ALBERT dive for cover.
As they look up, they see the DEER trot down the slope and
then VINCE, firing wildly, running after it.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY

The wind is much stronger, moaning in the trees. NICK
appears, moving fast, at a near trot. Suddenly he stops,
listening. At the same moment there is a snort. NICK wheels.
The BUCK is behind him, bounding away.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - RIDGE TOP - DAY

The BUCK appears, trotting out of the swirling snow. Reaching
a deadfall the BUCK pauses, looking back, and then turns
sharp left and disappears.

NICK comes out of the snow. He is winded but still going
hard.

EXT. MOUNTAINS - DEADFALL - DAY

NICK reaches the deadfall, hesitates, then rapidly springs
over. As he touches down on the other side there is a
growling sound.

NICK grabs for the deadfall. The wind shifts and we see that
he has stepped onto a boulder which is loosely planted at the
top of a steep scree slope. As NICK watches, the boulder
begins to roll, then to bound, dislodging other rocks and
boulders, all of them bouncing and leaping and cracking...
and then falling -- soundless -- over a sheer ledge to
unknown depths below.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY

ALBERT and JOHN have dragged their TWO DEAD DEER to a log
beside the shack. They sit side by side, drenched in sweat,
guzzling beer out of both hands.

			JOHN
	Sweet! Oh, that is sweet!

			ALBERT 
	Hey! Fuckin' A! Just... just like a
	hot shit... except cold.

JOHN lowers his beer. ALBERT gives him a blank expression,
then cracks up. SHOTS explode nearby. At first the shots are
scattered but they quickly open into a FULL BARRAGE. ALBERT
and JOHN stand up.

EXT. HIGHWAY EMBANKMENT - DAY

The DEER that VINCE was chasing earlier comes hobbling out of
the woods pursued by a GROUP OF HALF-DRUNK HUNTERS. VINCE
comes barreling through the HUNTERS, shouting and screaming.
VINCE's clothes are in tatters, the sole is gone from one
shoe and the barrel of his rifle is jammed up with mud and
perceptibly bent.

			VINCE 
	I got this one!!! This one's
	mine!!!

VINCE loses his footing and rolls down the embankment, head
over heels.

EXT. DITCH - DAY

VINCE comes up ten feet from the bewildered DEER. He raises
his rifle, fires, and the BARREL SPLITS OPEN. SHOTS begin
coming in, thudding in the mud and ricocheting off rocks. The
DEER wheels out on the highway. VINCE heaves his rifle at the
DEER, draws his pistol...

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

Cars are parked on both sides of the road. HUNTERS are
sitting in the cars, drinking, eating sandwiches and warming
themselves at small fires. MORE HUNTERS are up on the
embankment.

			VINCE 
	I got this one!!! This one's
	mine!!!

The panicked DEER bolts down the highway between the parked
cars. The HUNTERS ON THE EMBANKMENT open fire. The HUNTERS IN
THE CARS dive for cover.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Hold your fire! I got this one!!!

VINCE FIRES, FIRES AGAIN. SHOTS are ringing everywhere.
HUNTERS are shouting, running, yelling. A car window goes
out, a headlight goes out. The DEER is hit, falls and gets
up. VINCE takes aim. A FLEEING HUNTER bowls him over. The
DEER bolts for the woods, bullets smashing all around it.
VINCE scrambles to his feet and plunges after it.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	I got it! I got this one!

EXT. WOODS - DAY

The DEER staggers through the trees, blood pouring from its
wounds. VINCE comes stumbling after it. HE FIRES, FIRES
AGAIN.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - DAY

ALBERT and JOHN stand with their beers, looking into the
woods. A shot zings by, close, and they dive behind a log.

The DEER comes out of the woods, barely able to keep moving.
VINCE appears, reeling. He takes aim at the DEER and there is
a DULL CLICK. VINCE jams his pistol back in his holster.

			VINCE 
	Gun! Gimme gun!!!

ALBERT indicates his rifle. VINCE stumbles over to it, rams a
cartridge in the chamber.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
		(looks around, bewildered)
	Where's it gone?

			JOHN 
	Inside, Vince.

VINCE staggers to the cabin door. The DEER is lying on the
floor, motionless, DEAD.

			VINCE 
	I got it! Hey, you guys, I got
	it!!!

EXT. MOUNTAINS - FROZEN LAKE - DAY

The wind is blowing in gusts, slanting the snow first one way
and then the other. NICK appears in the distance, a black
speck in the endless expanse of shifting white.

As NICK draws closer we see that he is near exhaustion. His
clothes are , caked with snow, his breath comes in a shallow
gasp and his gait is uneven, favoring one leg. As NICK
APPROACHES CAMERA HE FALTERS AND LIMPS TO A STOP. There are
no tracks. There is nothing to go by and he hunkers down in
the driving snow.

The wind bangs in from one way, then it shifts and bangs in
again from another way. Suddenly it stops entirely. In the
silence there is a sound -- the click of a hoof on rock.

NICK turns. The BUCK is standing on the shoreline, not thirty
feet away, looking down at him.

NICK pushes himself to his feet, raises his rifle and sights
down the barrel.

WE SEE THE BUCK THROUGH NICK'S SIGHTS. IT IS A CLEAR SHOT.
NICK'S FINGER IS ON THE TRIGGER. HE HAS ONLY TO SQUEEZE IT.

NICK LOWERS HIS RIFLE. THE BUCK SNORTS, TOSSES HIS HORNS AND
DISAPPEARS IN THE SLANTING SNOW.

NICK STANDS MOTIONLESS, STARING AFTER IT, SO WONDER-STRUCK HE
HAS FORGOTTEN TO BREATHE.

			NICK
		(grins)
	Damn... God damn...

EXT. MOUNTAINS - OVERLOOK - DAY

NICK sits on his haunches with his back against a sheer rock
face. As he devours a Hostess Twinkie he looks out over a
snow-shrouded landscape of such spectacular beauty that it
might be something from a dream.

			NICK 
		(shouts)
	Hey! Hey... okay!

INT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

The Coleman lantern hangs from the rafter, rocking in the
wind. NICK is propped against the wall, dozing. JOHN is out
cold. ALBERT and VINCE are both drunk and arguing bitterly.

			ALBERT 
	You're full of shit, Vince! You're
	so full of shit you're going to
	float away!

			VINCE 
	Who? Who is?

			ALBERT 
	You, Vince! You! You are! You're a
	crock! You're a walking, talking
	crock!... I mean, what do you know?

			VINCE 
	I know! I fuckin' know!

			ALBERT 
	You don't!

			VINCE 
	I do!!!

			ALBERT 
	I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince!
	With twenty guys you know!

			VINCE 
	She does not!

			ALBERT 
	Then what's the gun for! What's
	this for?

			VINCE 
	In case!!! The gun's in case!!!

			ALBERT 
	In case???!!! In case of what? In
	case you stumble on her, suckin'
	cock in the front fucking hall?!

			VINCE 
	She might!!! She might do it,
	Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell
	me that she does!!!

			ALBERT 
	She does, Vince! That's what I'm
	telling you! She does!!!

VINCE is sheet-white, trembling. He grabs up the pistol and
cocks it.

			VINCE
		(shrieking)
	Say that one more time!... Say
	it!!! Go on, say it!!!

NICK is half-way up the wall, still half-asleep, staring at
the pistol in disbelief. Suddenly he springs, seizes the gun
with one hand and slams VINCE to the floor. VINCE gets up.
NICK slugs him in the face, knees him in the stomach and
begins pounding his head against the wall. ALBERT lurches
over, pulls NICK away.

			ALBERT 
	Nick! Nick, you'll kill him!...
	Easy. Nick, easy! Hey, hey. Vince
	goes back a long way.

			NICK
		(grimly)
	Yeah.

VINCE gets to his feet. Blood is streaming down his face.

			VINCE 
	What the hell was that!
		(picks up the pistol)
	What did you think? Did you think
	it was loaded!

			NICK 
	You loaded it, Vince! I saw you!

			VINCE 
	The fuck I did!!!

			NICK 
	The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!

NICK takes the pistol.

			VINCE 
	What do you think? You think I
	don't know!!!

NICK looks at him, then he EMPTIES THE PISTOL INTO THE FLOOR.

For a moment there is absolute silence. The wind moans in the
trees, snow curls through the open door and JOHN, who is
still soundly sleeping, finds a new note on which to snore.

NICK looks down at the pistol, turns it over in his hands...

			NICK 
	I'm going to throw this fuckin'
	thing away.

NICK goes out.

EXT. BUSTED-DOWN OLD LOGGERS SHACK - NIGHT

For a moment NICK stands in the light from the door,
listening to the wind. He looks down at the pistol again,
then he heaves it into the trees.

The wind gusts. The snow swirls and hisses, slipping through
the woods in great streaming wraiths.

NICK watches it for a moment, then he turns and goes back in.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - DUSK

The trailer is lonely looking, DARK and cold. VINCE pulls
into the yard beside NICK's car and skips to a stop. NICK
gets out, says a few words to VINCE and everyone laughs. NICK
goes around to the trunk, removes his gear, slams the lid and
pounds on the car. VINCE takes off, thudding over the curb
with his load of THREE DEAD DEER.

NICK crosses to the trailer and goes inside.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

TWO DOZEN AMPUTEES in wheelchairs are watching a western.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

In the foreground a NURSE holds a telephone. Beyond the NURSE
we see a wizzened figure in a wheelchair coming slowly down
the polished corridor. As the figure draws closer we realize
it is SAL. SAL is dressed in a white hospital gown, the
bottom of which hangs over the front of the wheelchair and
trails limply on the floor. Both SAL's legs have been
amputated and he has lost one arm. His face is terribly
scarred and what expression he displays is centered in his
eyes.

SAL takes the telephone. THE SOUNDTRACK FROM THE MOVIE IN THE
RECREATION ROOM IS VERY LOUD.

			SAL
	Hello?

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK sits in a little chair by the window, still in his
hunting clothes, huddled anxiously over the receiver.

			NICK
	Sal? Sal, it's me, Nick.

			SAL
	Nick. Hey. How's things?

			NICK
	Oh. You know. How's it with you?

			SAL 
	Same. Hey. Same old stuff.

			NICK 
		(he can hardly hear)
	What's that noise?

			SAL 
	What?

			NICK 
	What's that noise?

			SAL 
	John Wayne... Listen, Nick --

			NICK 
	Great. Hey. That's great.

			SAL 
	Listen, Nick --

			NICK 
	John Wayne's great... Listen, Sal.
	Jesus. When are you getting out?

			SAL 
	I'm gonna stay here, Nick.

			NICK 
		(hearing it)
	What?

			SAL
		(with everything he has)
	Place is great. Really. One great
	place... Basketball, bowling. You
	name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of
	guys are making salad bowls. What
	I'll do is make a salad bowl for
	you, unless you'd rather have a
	pencil holder. The pencil holder's
	neat, I mean --

			NICK 
	Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John
	Wayne's making so much noise I can
	hardly --

			SAL 
	I gotta get back, Nick.

SAL looks around in desperation.

			SAL (CONT'D)
	They're passing out popcorn now, so
	I'll be talking to you... maybe
	next year.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK holds the receiver, staring into it. There is the SOUND
OF WHOOPING, GRUNTING, THUNDERING HOOVES...

			NICK 
	Sal?... Sal?

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR OFF RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT

SAL is wheeling himself rapidly down the polished corridor.
At the doorway to the recreation room he pauses, looking back
at the DANGLING RECEIVER. Then he turns and disappears into
the flickering darkness, where BUGLES are sounding a cavalry
charge.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK listens to the SOUND OF THE BUGLES for a moment, then
puts the receiver back on the telephone. He stands, walks
around in a little circle - pained, terribly upset. His eye
falls on the clock. It is nearly eight o'clock. He turns,
hurries out the door.

EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The lot is empty except for scores of abandoned shopping
carts which a CLERK is banging together.

NICK gets out of his car and goes in.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Two or three CHECKERS are closing out the registers up front.

			CHECKER 
	She's in back.

			NICK 
	Thanks.

			CHECKER 
	How was huntin'?

			NICK 
	Oh. Fine.

			CHECKER 
	Get anything?

			NICK 
	No.

			CHECKER 
	Too bad.

NICK goes down a long aisle of bright packages. Coming out at
the back he finds LINDA sitting in a green plastic chair,
crying.

			NICK 
	Linda... Honey, what's wrong?

			LINDA
		(helpless shrug)
	I don't know.

			NICK 
	Hey. Look. There must be something.

LINDA looks at him, tears streaming down her face.

			LINDA 
	I'm just so lonely.

			NICK 
	C'mon. I've got the car.

			LINDA 
		(shakes her head)
	I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll
	be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.

NICK walks back down the aisle between the bright packages.

INT. NICK'S CAR - SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The CLERK is still collecting abandoned shopping carts. The
carts crash and clank as the CLERK rams them together.

NICK sits behind the wheel, watching the clerk. His hands
begin shaking uncontrollably and he gets back out of the car.

EXT. SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT - NICK'S CAR - NIGHT

NICK watches the lights go out in the market. LINDA comes out
of the door and crosses towards him.

			NICK
	You okay?

LINDA nods. NICK fumbles for the door.

			LINDA
	Let's make love, Nick.

LINDA takes him in her arms and holds him tight.

			LINDA (CONT'D)
	Let's make love forever!

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

LINDA is asleep - lying on her back, arms flung out across
the pillows, like a dancer leaping.

NICK stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking
down at her. After a moment he draws the covers over her,
fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then
goes to the window.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF NICK'S TRAILER (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

The wind is blowing. Bits of trash skitter and swirl in the
frozen ruts and a cat comes by, MEOWING. Suddenly a MAN
appears walking slowly down the street. The MAN is elegantly
dressed in Western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest,
polished boots and a Stetson hat. As the MAN draws under the
light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at NICK's trailer.

THE MAN IS MERLE, OR IF NOT MERLE IT IS A FACE SO STRIKINGLY
SIMILAR THAT NICK ALMOST LETS OUT A CRY.

THE MAN UNDER THE STREET LAMP PAUSES, JUST FOR AN INSTANT,
THEN HE TURNS AND MOVES ON DOWN THE STREET.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK backs away from the window. For a moment he stands
motionless, hardly able to believe his eyes. He looks over at
LINDA, he looks down at a chair, then he pushes his face to
the window again.

EXT. STREET (NICK'S POV) - NIGHT

The street is empty. The MAN is gone.

INT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK hesitates, then he sheds the blanket and pulls on pants,
shirt, jacket and jams his sockless feet into a pair of
slices.

EXT. NICK'S TRAILER - NIGHT

NICK comes out into the street. There is no one in sight.

NICK crosses to the intersection of Columbine.

EXT. INTERSECTION OF COLUMBINE - NIGHT

No one. Nothing. A beer can rolling in the wind.

NICK jams himself against a wall, zippers his jacket. He is
irked with himself, a little frightened. Suddenly he hears a
car door close and en engine start up. A black limousine
pulls out of a nearby street and comes past him slowly. A
CHAUFFEUR is at the wheel.
The PASSENGER in back appears to be the MAN he saw, but the
MAN is looking out the window on the other side and his face
is not visible.

As NICK watches, the limousine rapidly gathers speed. The
tail lights grow small, then the car dips over a hill and
disappears.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - RECREATION ROOM - DAY

Sunlight streams through a window. The television is going.
In a far corner SAL sits in his wheelchair, sleeping.

CAMERA CLOSES SLOWLY ON SAL. His head has fallen to one side
and his single arm sticks into the air -- as if he had failed
in his grasp of something, as if he were drowning. On a tray
in front of him is an untouched breakfast of orange juice,
milk and a little box of Wheaties.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY

Someone is descending the stairs. After a moment the feet
appear, clad in expensive cowboy boots. We see expensive,
tailor-made trousers, a belt buckle embossed with a six
shooter... and then, suddenly, MERLE'S FACE.

MERLE slows in his descent, stops, looking at something.

EXT. V.A. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE (MERLE'S POV) - DAY

NICK is getting out of a cab. He pays the driver and starts
toward the building.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY STAIRWAY - DAY

MERLE watches NICK for a moment, his face utterly without
expression, then MERLE continues down the stairs.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY

NICK is pushing SAL down a walkway.

			NICK 
	Sal, we need you. We need you.

			SAL 
	Hey, Nick. How can you need me?

			NICK 
	We do, Sal. We do... You're the
	heart.

Turns SAL and sits on a bench.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna
	sit in that corner watching soaps
	and you're gonna die!... I'm not
	saying it's gonna be the same. It's
	not gonna be the same, but whatever
	it's gonna be we're all gonna do
	it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are
	gonna do it!

			SAL 
	Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin'
	scared to go home.

			NICK 
		(nods)
	I know. It's like coming from the
	moon. Or Mars.

SAL laughs.

			SAL 
	Did you go hunting.

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			SAL 
	Did you get one?

			NICK 
	No.

			SAL 
	You didn't get a deer?

			NICK 
	I tracked this one, a big buck.
	God, he was such a beauty--! What's
	this suitcase here?

			SAL 
	Where?

			NICK 
	Here. Behind you.

NICK pulls a suitcase off the rack behind SAL's chair.

			SAL 
	I don't know.

NICK sets the suitcase on a low wall and starts to undo the
clasps.

			NICK
	Maybe Angela brought you stuff. I
	know she said --

The suitcase slips over the back of the wall.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Shit!

NICK swings up on the wall and then he freezes. The lid of
the suitcase has popped open and bundles of money are
scattered all down the slope of a steep embankment.

			SAL 
	Mom keeps sending me socks, Nick. I
	mean, if it's socks or something
	just let 'em go.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - EMBANKMENT WITH MONEY - DAY

NICK looks down at the money scattered at his feet. The
bundles are made up of hundreds and they are everywhere.

			SAL (V.O.)
	Maybe you could use socks, Nick.
	Jesus, I mean, come to think of it
	socks are pretty expensive now.

			NICK 
	It's not socks, Sal.

NICK bends over the suitcase and begins going through looking
for identification. There is nothing. As he straightens up he
notices a wadded-up piece of paper lying beside one of the
bundles of bills.

The paper is about an inch square. The corners are tattered
and it looks as if it had been carried in someone's pocket
for a long time.

NICK picks the paper up, realizes it is a calling card and
unfolds it.

THE CARD READS "EXHIBITIONS". IT CONTAINS A TELEPHONE NUMBER
ON THE LOWER LEFT CORNER AND IS IDENTICAL TO THE CARD ARMAND
GAVE TO NICK WHEN HE CAME UPON HIM IN THE GARDEN BEHIND HIS
ROULETTE GAME IN SAIGON.

EXT. HOSPITAL GROUNDS - VALLEY OVERLOOK - DAY

NICK leans on a railing watching the black, interchangeable
cars of a coal train roll slowly by. SAL sits with the
suitcase of money in his lap, utterly bewildered, crying.

			SAL 
	Who is it, Nick? Who is it? I don't
	understand.

NICK looks at SAL. His head is spinning and he brings himself
back with effort.

			NICK 
	It's Merle, Sal.

			SAL
	Merle? ... Merle's alive?
		(NICK nods)
	How do you know?

			NICK 
	I saw him last night. I thought I
	was dreaming. I thought I was out
	of my mind.

			SAL 
	Merle gave me this?

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			SAL 
	But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where
	would a guy like Merle get money
	like this?

NICK is standing slightly behind SAL, looking down at the
money. The reality of what MERLE is doing, has nearly
overwhelmed him and it is only with tremendous effort that he
maintains a casual tone.

			NICK 
	Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's
	getting cold, Sal. I'm going to
	take you in.
		(starts off)
	We'll call Angela. The guys can
	help her bring you home... Did I
	tell you I was going on a trip?

			SAL 
		(panicked)
	Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You
	said you'd be --

			NICK 
	It's okay. Hey, it's okay! Just a
	week. Just to see Phantom Mary.

			SAL 
	Phantom Mary?

			NICK 
	Didn't I ever tell you about
	Phantom Mary?

			SAL 
		(laughs)
	No. 

			NICK
		(starts off again)
	Well... Phantom Mary's on my
	mother's side. Naturally no one
	there admits it because Phantom
	Mary's pretty weird... You want to
	hear the whole story?

			SAL
		(enthusiastically)
	Yeah!

			NICK 
	Like I say, Phantom Mary's pretty
	weird... Lives alone, lives way out
	in the middle of nowhere with a cat
	called Pajamas and a cow called
	Fred. Well, last week I got a call
	from Phantom Mary, which in itself
	was very strange...

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - U.S. ARMY AIRFIELD - TEXAS - DAY

The place is a madhouse of activity. As jets scream overhead
TROOPS embarking for Saigon are being counted and recounted.
SERGEANTS are yelling off names. CLERKS are typing forms and
papers. Forklift trucks weave in and out, DRIVERS cursing.

NICK is back in uniform. He stands at a window watching a jet
transport being prepared for loading. A CLERK comes by,
arguing with a SERGEANT. The CLERK sets down his clipboard to
consult the SERGEANT's papers. NICK picks up the clipboard
and moves into the CROWD.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - ANOTHER LOCATION - DAY

NICK spots a lone SECOND LIEUTENANT sitting on his gear. More
OFFICERS are waiting nearby but the SECOND LIEUTENANT seems
not to know them.

NICK moves in close enough to read the SECOND LIEUTENANT's
name tag.

			NICK
		(bawling)
	Biederman! Where's Biederman!

			LIEUTENANT 
	Here.

			NICK 
	You Biederman?

			LIEUTENANT 
	Biederman, yes.

			NICK 
	I got you on this flight,
	Biederman. Is that right?

			BIEDERMAN 
	Correct.

			NICK 
	Follow me, please.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

NICK walks along briskly with the LIEUTENANT at his side.

			NICK 
	Right this way.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - WAREHOUSE AREA - DAY

NICK comes to a door, opens it.

			NICK 
	Through here.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - UTILITY CLOSET - DAY

The LIEUTENANT walks into the closet and comes to a stop,
looking puzzled. NICK comes in behind him, closes the door
and picks up a length of pipe.

			NICK
	Take off the uniform.

The LIEUTENANT stares at NICK, dumbfounded.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Take off the uniform, Lieutenant!

The LIEUTENANT nods, begins taking off his uniform.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - UTILITY CLOSET - DAY

NICK has changed into the LIEUTENANT's uniform and tied him
to a chair. The LIEUTENANT is in tears. NICK is going through
his orders.

			LIEUTENANT 
	Please! Please mister, please! This
	is vital I go to Saigon. This is
	very important. Most important.

			NICK
		(exasperated)
	Listen, Biederman, I'm going to
	club you into the floor unless you
	tell me what the fuck is so
	important.

			LIEUTENANT 
	That I must not tell you. Top
	secret. You see there. Topmost
	secret.

			NICK 
	Biederman!

			LIEUTENANT
		(stiffly)
	I will not betray my country. No.
	Ne-ver!

NICK throws down the pipe in disgust, whips a gag around the
LIEUTENANT's mouth and ties it.

			NICK 
	When I get to Saigon I'll tell 'em
	where you are.

Slams the door.

EXT. SAIGON AIRPORT - TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT

Viet Cong SAPPERS have just attacked. A number of jet
fighters are burning, bodies are strewn over the tarmac and
jeeps with SOLDIERS are racing back and forth.
Out beyond, the jet transport taxis into view, lumbering like
a great silver monster out of the night.

INT. JET TRANSPORT - NIGHT

NICK stands in the aisle next to a COLONEL who is peering out
the window.

			COLONEL 
	Jesus Christ, they hit the airport!

NICK nods.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	Those fuckin' niggers. This time
	I'm going to eat balls!... You ever
	try 'em?

			NICK 
	Naw.

			COLONEL 
		(leans close)
	Not bad fresh, but they don't keep
	worth a pig's fart.

NICK nods. EVERYONE starts out.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	Lotta guys don't know that.
		(winks)
	Assholes!

EXT. JET TRANSPORT - DEBARKATION RAMP - NIGHT

A SIREN is screaming in the distance. NICK looks around
nervously. The COLONEL is still right in beside him.

			COLONEL 
	Tell you something else. Don't eat
	'em in the damn Delta. Unless you
	like 'em fishy... Some do. I don't.
	I never did.

The scream of the SIREN grows louder. Suddenly a Jeep careens
around the corner followed by a huge black Cadillac flying
American flags on the fenders. Both vehicles screech to a
stop and an MP jumps out of the jeep with a loud hailer.

			MP 
		(amplified)
	Lieutenant Biederman! Lieutenant
	Biederman report to the ramp!

			COLONEL 
	That's you.
		(grabs NICK's arm and
		waves)
	Right here, Sergeant! He's right
	here!

			MP 
	Right this way, Lieutenant.

NICK is hurried to the limousine where a SECOND MP holds the
door.

			SECOND MP 
	Quick as you can, sir. We're in a
	rush.

NICK gets in the limousine. The SECOND MP slams the door,
jumps in the front and they take off with sirens wailing.

INT. LIMOUSINE - SAIGON - NIGHT

There are jeeps with MP's ahead; there are jeeps with MP's
behind. Seated beside NICK is a gigantic MARINE CORPORAL who
stares rigidly ahead.

EXT. CAVALCADE - SAIGON - NIGHT

Pedestrians and bicyclists flee as the cavalcade comes
screaming down a wide boulevard.

EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - SAIGON - NIGHT

The jeeps peel off to the side. The gate swings open and the
limousine enters the compound.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - RECEPTION AREA - NIGHT

A STRING QUARTET is playing. GUESTS in evening clothes are
drinking champagne.

NICK enters with the MARINE CORPORAL and is whisked rapidly
down a hallway.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - KITCHEN - NIGHT

NICK stands in front of a huge range staring down at a table.
On the table there is a basket of eggs, an omelette pan and a
pile of mushrooms. Across from the table six SERVANTS with
napkins on their arms stand waiting with plates.

			MARINE (V.O.) 
	Sir?

NICK turns. The MARINE CORPORAL is holding a chef's hat. NICK
takes off his cap, puts on the chef's hat. Suddenly a door
comes open and the AMERICAN AMBASSADOR and his WIFE come in.

			AMBASSADOR 
	Henri! So good to see you. How are
	you? How are you? Darling, this is
	Henri. Henri, my wife Elizabeth.

			WIFE 
	My pleasure.

			AMBASSADOR
	Henri, we are starved. Six
	omelettes, s'il vous plait.

			WIFE
		(hissing)
	Avec champignons.

			AMBASSADOR
	Avec champignons.
		(back to his WIFE)
	Fines herbes?

The WIFE shakes her head. The AMBASSADOR winks.

			AMBASSADOR (CONT'D)
	Avec champignons.

The AMBASSADOR and his WIFE hurry out. There is dead silence.
NICK pulls the MARINE CORPORAL to one side, points to his
crotch.

			NICK
	Pee-pee.

INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CORRIDOR OFF KITCHEN - NIGHT

NICK comes down the corridor behind the MARINE CORPORAL. As
he passes a straight-back chair standing against the wall he
picks it up and swings it down on the MARINE CORPORAL'S head.
The blow is ferocious. The chair splinters into pieces and
the MARINE CORPORAL goes down with a dull thud.

NICK stands for a moment, looking at him. Then he kneels,
removes his pistol and jams it in his belt.

EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - WALKWAY TO PEDESTRIAN EXIT - NIGHT

Three MARINE GUARDS are standing at parade rest by an open
iron gate.
As NICK appears in his white chef's hat the GUARDS snap to
attention and he walks into the CROWD OF ASIANS streaming by
outside.

EXT. TELEPHONE BOOTH - BUSY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

NICK takes out his wallet, extracts the tattered calling card
that he found with SAL'S money and dials the number. He lets
it ring a long time but there is no answer.

EXT. DESERTED STREET WITH SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

NICK is not sure where he is. Suddenly he stops, recognizing
the yard with the little grape arbor where he met ARMAND.

EXT. YARD BEHIND SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

The yard is grown over. As NICK goes in there comes a low
buzz of flies. He trips over something, draws back. Seeing a
candle on the little table under the grape arbor, he crosses
and lights it.

The yard is full of discarded champagne bottles, red velvet
cushions and rotting CORPSES. NICK leans over one of the
CORPSES. The skin is falling away and the eye sockets writhe
with maggots.

NICK straightens, looks around.

			NICK 
	Merle!!!

The back door to the building is open. NICK draws his pistol
and goes in.

INT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - NIGHT

NICK finds his way blocked by a door. He steps back, hurls
himself against it. The door gives way with a crash and he
staggers into the middle of a small stage hung with red
velvet curtains and furnished with a table and two chairs.

Out beyond the proscenium, huddled together in a litter of
broken cafe tables, a FAMILY OF REFUGEES stare at him in
terror from the other side of a small fire.

			NICK
		(waves pistol)
	It's okay.

The REFUGEES cower back even further.

			NICK (CONT'D)
		(screaming)
	It's okay, God damn it! It's all
	right!

POUNDING and BANGING come from the direction of the front
door. NICK crosses...

INT. SHUTTERED BUILDING - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

NICK readies his pistol, cautiously unbolts the door and
jerks it open. The COLONEL FROM THE AIRPLANE tumbles in and
falls flat on his back. Standing in the doorway, lit by the
headlights of two cars, is a party of U.S. OFFICERS, ARVN
OFFICERS and WHORES.

			COLONEL
		(no attempt to get up)
	Hey, good buddy, how you doin'?
		(gestures)
	This is Biederman, you guys.
	Biederman, this is Son Loc, Tu Fon,
	Huckerbelly and Potts. What's the
	story here, Biederman? We're
	looking for... Wait a minute.

He fishes a piece of paper out of his breast pocket.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	Here it is. Chez Armand.

			WHORE 
	Chez Armand not here! Chez Armand
	has gone to other spot!

			COLONEL 
		(gets up)
	Honey, c'mere. Come right here.

The COLONEL opens a brown paper bag he is carrying and
presents her with a large red, white and blue dildo.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	This is for bein' so smart.

The WHORE shrieks with pleasure. EVERYONE laughs.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
		(arm around WHORE)
	Let's go! Mount up! C'mon
	Biederman!

The COLONEL throws an arm around NICK and they all start for
the cars.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
		(to NICK)
	Boy, do I love this conflict.
	Huh?... What the hell were you
	doin' in there?

			NICK
	You know a guy named Merle?

			COLONEL 
	Merle? That's who we're looking
	for. Merle.

			NICK 
	Yeah?

			COLONEL 
	Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes
	says he goes one more... He
	retired, you know.

			NICK 
	Yeah?

			COLONEL 
	Now he's back.

Pulls NICK close so he can whisper in his ear.

			COLONEL (CONT'D)
	He eats 'em... Sure... He eats 'em
	raw!

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - SAIGON OUTSKIRTS NIGHT

An elegant house of French design is ablaze with lights. The
house is encircled by a stone terrace on which tables have
been set up. Over the terrace and strung out for a hundred
yards into the surrounding trees are countless paper lanterns
which bob and sway in the wind. GUESTS are everywhere --
wandering in and out of the house, sitting at the tables and
strolling under the trees. For the most part the GUESTS are
AMERICANS and SOUTH VIETNAMESE. The majority of these are
OFFICERS IN UNIFORM, but there are numerous CIVILIANS mixed
among them and the CIVILIANS are attired in everything from
sports shirts to white linen suits and tuxedos. As to
nationality there are no limits. There are FRENCH, GERMANS,
BELGIANS, SWISS, CHINESE, BRITISH and AUSTRALIANS. WHORES and
MISTRESSES abound. WIVES are not greatly in evidence, except
to dog the heels of heavily armed ARVN GUARDS who wander
about, glass-eyed, drinking champagne.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - PARKING AREA - NIGHT

Jeeps, personnel carriers, trucks and light tanks are parked
side by side with gleaming Mercedes limousines, staff cars
from various government agencies and a blitz of civilian
vehicles running from sedans to motor scooters.

More vehicles arrive by the minute and exotic couples, like
plumed birds, debark in the swirling dust.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - CLEARING IN TREES - NIGHT

A dozen ARVN helicopters have put down between the trees. One
has crashed and lies on its side with a broken rotor.

There is a mounting clatter in the distance and another
helicopter comes out of the sky. As it sets down a dashingly
handsome AIR FORCE OFFICER hops out and extends a hand to his
WIFE. When his WIFE has descended the OFFICER opens a back
compartment in the fusilage and carefully takes out their
BABY. He hands the BABY to his WIFE and they stroll off
toward the house.

INT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT

Gambling tables are set up in all the rooms. The betting is
heavy, champagne flows like water and the atmosphere is one
of reckless abandon, as if money, like love, were good for an
hour.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE STAGE - NIGHT

Low bleachers covered in red velvet are set in a semi-circle
facing a small stage. The stage is lit with a single,
blindingly bright spotlight and is furnished with a table and
two velvet-covered chairs. Two CONTESTANTS, both of them
VIETNAMESE, sit opposite one another. Between them, lying on
the table, is a revolver. Both CONTESTANTS are dressed in
tuxedos. Both wear red numbers on their downstage arm.

Although the bleachers are not yet full, eager BETTORS jam
the first three rows. Here CLERKS with change trays take the
bets, signalling each transaction to a MARKER who chalks the
shifting odds on a large board.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, standing in the aisle, staring in
disbelief at the evolution of the game he once played.

Now a REFEREE enters the stage carrying two strips of scarlet
cloth.

			REFEREE
		(amplified)
	Game number seven. Gentlemen will
	please wrap.

The CONTESTANTS wrap their heads with the scarlet cloth.

			REFEREE (CONT'D)
		(as he loads revolver)
	One cartridge. Game to be played to
	completion. Forfeit automatic after
	delay of one minute.

The REFEREE places the pistol back in the center of the table
and spins a wheel whose -intervals are alternately marked L
and R. The wheel clatters to a stop with the marker on L.

			REFEREE 
	Gentleman on the left will now
	commence play.

The REFEREE steps out of the light. A gong sounds. The
CONTESTANT on the left picks up the pistol, spins the
cylinder, cocks it and

places it to his temple. He hesitates, pulls the trigger...
and clicks out.

NICK is unable to bear it. He turns, starts around toward the
back of the stage. AS NICK MOVES THROUGH THE GUESTS WE HEAR
THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER CLICKING, AMPLIFIED OVER A P.A.
SYSTEM. WE HEAR THE CLICK OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED...

NICK turns. The SECOND CONTESTANT has the pistol to his
temple. He pulls the trigger... THE GUN GOES OFF WITH A
DEAFENING ROAR and he topples on the floor.

The FIRST CONTESTANT STEPS FORWARD AS THE SPOTLIGHT NARROWS
TO CONTAIN HIM ALONE. HE BOWS, CLASPS HIS HANDS ABOVE HIS
HEAD AND DANCES AROUND.

NICK stares at the FIRST CONTESTANT celebrating his victory.
He looks around him. BETTORS are screaming and yelling in
five languages.

NICK starts off again, hurrying.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - BACKSTAGE AREA NIGHT

NICK comes upon a pile of six naked CORPSES with their heads
blown off. Opposite the CORPSES -- sitting, standing, pacing,
squatting in the dirt -- are a GROUP OF WAITING CONTESTANTS.
Some of these are AMERICAN. Most are SOUTH VIETNAMESE,
several of whom have come with WIVES and FAMILIES. A few of
the contestants are well dressed, most are in rags. THREE. OF
THE WAITING CONTESTANTS ARE WEARING TUXEDOS.

Suddenly a WOMAN WITH A BABY lets out a shriek. NICK spins.
TWO BURLY MEN appear, bringing the CORPSE OF THE SECOND
CONTESTANT. As the WOMAN WITH THE BABY begins sobbing and
screaming with grief the BURLY MEN strip the tuxedo off the
SECOND CONTESTANT and then, as each article is summarily
removed, they begin dressing one of the WAITING CONTESTANTS
in it.

			ARMAND (V.O.) 
	If you are brave and lucky I can
	make you rich.

NICK turns and finds ARMAND behind him. ARMAND studies him
for a fraction of a second and then smiles.

			ARMAND (CONT'D)
	C'est tres amusant... You have been
	promoted. And to a Jew... I am
	joking of course. Naturellement.
	Seriously, Nick, may I hope that
	you have come to play?

			NICK 
	I came to see Merle.

			ARMAND 
	Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?

			NICK 
	Yeah.

			ARMAND 
		(studies him)
	You are his friend.

			NICK 
	Where is he???

			ARMAND 
		(faint smile)
	Merle is under his tree... Beside
	the terrace. You can't miss him.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TREES BY TERRACE - NIGHT

GUESTS are still coming in from the cars, strolling down
through the trees in bright coveys and flocks, chattering
like birds.

Laughter comes from the terrace. Glass tinkles and the tiny
lanterns bob and sway.

NICK appears, hurrying down the steps. Suddenly he stops.

MERLE is sitting at a table under a nearby tree. He is alone,
dressed in a tuxedo, watching the arriving GUESTS with an
expression of dreamy detachment, as if they were rain drops,
or snow flakes, or falling stones.

			NICK
		(shouts)
	Merle!

MERLE turns, watching NICK as he crosses toward him. When
NICK reaches the table, he stands.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Merle...! Jesus! Hey, how are you?

			MERLE 
	Nick!... I thought you went home.

			NICK 
	I did. I... This is stolen. I came
	back.

			MERLE 
	Sit down.

NICK sits. MERLE's self-possession has thrown him. He doesn't
know where to start.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(breaking the silence)
	How's Linda?

			NICK 
	Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the
	hell are you doing?

			MERLE
		(eyes him)
	I like it, Nick.

			NICK
	Merle... Hey, Merle, listen... 
		(stares at him)
	Why?

For a moment MERLE doesn't answer. His eyes are pale, like
faded robin's eggs, and they seem to look through NICK, as if
to some landscape far beyond.

			MERLE
	I like it because it's simple.

A BEAUTIFUL VIETNAMESE GIRL steps up and whispers something
in MERLE's ear.

			MERLE (CONT'D)
		(stands)
	I have to go, Nick. We'll have a
	drink.

MERLE and the VIETNAMESE GIRL move into the CROWD.

			NICK
	Merle...! Merle, wait!

NICK starts after them. He can see them ahead, moving rapidly
through a GROUP OF ARVN OFFICERS and WHORES.

			NICK (CONT'D)
	Merle!!!

NICK sees he can never overtake them directly. He cuts around
to the terrace.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT

NICK maneuvers his way down to the end of the terrace.

			NICK 
	Excuse me... Sorry... Sorry...
	Pardon.

NICK reaches the end of the terrace. MERLE and the BEAUTIFUL
VIETNAMESE GIRL have disappeared.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - TERRACE - NIGHT

NICK sits at one of the tables. The terrace is deserted.

			REFEREE (V.O.)
	Gentleman on the right will now
	commence play.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - HOUSE - NIGHT

The gaming tables are utterly deserted. AS NICK WANDERS
THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS THE SOUND OF THE GAME CONTINUES OVER
THE P.A. SYSTEM -- THE SOUND OF THE CYLINDER SPINNING, THE
SOUND OF THE HAMMER BEING COCKED... AND CLICK AFTER CLICK
INTO EMPTY CHAMBERS.

Suddenly NICK can stand it no more. He turns and starts
toward the entrance to the bleachers.

A SHOT EXPLODES OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM. NICK freezes, then he
runs.

EXT. RUBBER PLANTATION - ROULETTE THEATRE - NIGHT

NICK appears at the back of the aisle between the bleachers.
The CROWD is going wild, yelling and screaming. NICK pushes
through a group of BETTORS and then stops. A look of stunned
relief spreads over his features.

On the stage a tall figure stands alone in the spotlight,
head bowed in acknowledgement of the OVATION.

NICK grins. He begins yelling and screaming along with
everyone else.

On the stage the tall figure raises his head, pumps his fists
in the air and begins hooting maniacally.

... WE NOW SEE, AS DOES NICK, THAT THE TALL FIGURE IN THE
SPOTLIGHT IS NOT MERLE AT ALL. IT IS MERLE'S OPPONENT.

INT. V.F.W. POST - BASEMENT - DAY

Pipes crisscross the ceiling and there is the faint hiss of
leaking steam. Seated on a bench and all dressed-up in their
uniforms are FIVE OLD VETS. TWO VETS are on the nod. THE
OTHER THREE -- rheumy-eyed and ancient -- give patient
attention to the SIXTH VET who stands beside the boiler with
a bugle, trying to play TAPS.

			VET 1 
	Up a little there... What would you
	say?

			VET 2 
	Up.

The VET WITH THE BUGLE tries it again, flubs it, starts
over...

INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY

Three tables have been set up in the middle of the floor. The
tables have been laid with white cloth and the OLDER WOMEN
are setting out fresh flowers and laying the places for a
funeral breakfast. They work in silence, fussing over the
placement of each knife and fork.

AS THE WOMEN WORK WE HEAR THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR SINGING AS
THE SERVICE PROGRESSES IN THE CHURCH. AT FIRST THE SOUND IS
BARELY AUDIBLE, EASILY MATCHED BY THE FAINT NOTES OF THE VET
WITH THE BUGLE IN THE BASEMENT BELOW.
BUT NOW THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR GROWS -- A SOUND AS DEEP AS
WATER, AS DARK AS NIGHT; A SOUND LIKE STONE.

Gradually, one by one, the OLDER WOMEN stop fussing with the
table. They stand motionless, listening.

EXT. GREEK ORTHODOX CHURCH - FRONT STEPS - DAY

A HEARSE waits at the curb. The day is windless, cold and
grey Snow is drifting down and the gleaming vehicle emits a
ghostly cloud of white exhaust.

THE SOUND OF THE CHOIR IS MUCH LOUDER, ASCENDING IN DARK
TRIUMPH TO A SUDDEN, FINAL NOTE.

In the ringing silence of the MUSIC'S END the doors to the
church swing open. NICK, VINCE, ALBERT and JOHN appear with
MERLE's flag-draped COFFIN. Followed by MOURNERS, they bear
the COFFIN slowly down the steps.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Snow drifts down from a leaden sky as the MOURNERS stand
together on a steep hillside of tilted, weather-worn
headstones. The mill looms behind them, breathing roiling
clouds of steam and uttering a dull concordia of clanks and
groans.

EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - DAY

The PRIEST completes his reading of the 23rd PSALM. The
MOURNERS join in the LORD'S PRAYER.

CAMERA CLOSES ON NICK, VINCE, ALBERT, JOHN and SAL. They help
SAL to the side of the grave. It is awkward. The chair gets
stuck and they have to carry it. THEY ALL pick up a handful
of dirt and then, following NICK's lead, they throw it in.

NICK steps back from the grave, nods to the VETS. The VETS
come to attention. The VET WITH THE BUGLE steps forward and
tremblingly, but perfectly, PLAYS TAPS.

INT. V.F.W. POST - MAIN HALL - DAY

The meal is over. The WOMEN are drinking coffee, the MEN are
smoking and putting down the beer. There is muted laughter
and conversation.

NICK sits at the head of one of the tables, flanked by LINDA
and SAL. He looks stunned. His food is untouched, there are
tears in his eyes and he hardly seems to know where he is.

			LINDA 
	Eat something, Nick. Eat a piece of
	toast.

NICK nods, picks up a piece of toast and then, forgetting all
about it, lays it absently on his plate.

VINCE comes up behind NICK, looking somewhat officious in a
new blue suit.

			VINCE 
	You want to say a few words, Nick?
	I think you should. Like that would
	wind things up.

NICK nods. VINCE raps on a glass.

			VINCE (CONT'D)
	Quiet!... Quiet!!!... Awright,
	everybody, Nick has a few words.

			NICK
		(very shaky)
	I just... would like to say a few
	words... about Merle. I guess Merle
	always wanted something... I don't
	know... better. That fucking guy,
	he saved my Life. He saved Sal's...
	What Merle liked, he liked things
	right... But then there wasn't any
	place for that... that he could
	find.

Tears are streaming down NICK's face and he sits down,
looking miserable.

			VINCE
		(hisses)
	John! Play something!

JOHN goes to the piano, hurried along by VINCE. He sits down,
casts a quick glance to the ceiling and begins playing
"America The Beautiful".

A FEW VOICES being SINGING. OTHERS join in. ALBERT stands up.
Then EVERYONE stands up.

DEFIANCE

          1 NEW YORK CITY - PARK AVENUE - NIGHT - 1982 1
          A TAXI pulls over to a curb where an ELDERLY MAN waits with
          his MIDDLE-AGED SON in THE RAIN.

          MIDDLE-AGED SON
          (as they climb in)
          23rd and Lex.
          The CABBIE grunts a reply.

          MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D)
          How ya doin', Papa, you doin'
          alright?

          ELDERLY MAN
          Fine, fine...

          MIDDLE-AGED SON
          This is just a check-up, okay?
          Doctor Katz says you'll outlive us
          all.
          (looks out the window)
          Traffic isn't bad. We should be
          back in time to watch the Mets.
          He notices his father is STARING, wide-eyed, at the cabby's
          HACK LICENSE. We glimpse only the last name..."Bielski."

          MIDDLE-AGED SON (CONT'D)
          Papa? .Papa, what is it?
          IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR, the old man catches the furtive
          eyes of the cabby.

          ELDERLY MAN
          ...You. Can it be?
          The eyes in the mirror look away. And then back.

          ELDERLY MAN (CONT'D)
          Bielski. Can it possibly be?
          As we PUSH IN on the eyes in the mirror, we HEAR THE

          DESPERATE RASPING SOUND OF PANTING.

          CUT TO:

          2 A MAN RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE THROUGH THE WOODS. 2
          Bombs EXPLODE all around as he passes dead bodies and BURNT-
          OUT VEHICLES. Without slowing he discards a WW II Red Army
          helmet, a field jacket, a heavy pack, anything that might
          impede his flight. He glances back up over his shoulder.
          The sky is filled with BOMBERS. He runs on.

          4 THE VILLAGE OF NALIBOKI 4
          A typical Eastern European shtetl. LOCAL POLICE help German
          Einsatzgruppen, mobile killing squads, round up Jews.
          PEASANTS beat them with sticks as they are herded into lines.
          One man tries to run and is beaten.
          Others look on, or look away with indifference as they are
          loaded onto waiting trucks.

          5 TWO MEN HIDE IN THE NEARBY WOODS (ZUS & ASAEL BIELSKI) 5
          We study their faces: a turbulent portrait of impotent rage,
          terrible fear, overwhelming grief, and secret relief.

          ASAEL
          Where are they taking them?

          ZUS
          --Shveig! Shveig!

          ASAEL

          BUT--

          ZUS
          Just shut up! Please...

          6 AN ALLEY WAY IN NOVAGRUDOK 6
          The man we last saw in flight (TUVIA BIELSKI) wearing the
          remnants of his uniform, slips down a cobble-stoned street.
          He ducks into a doorway as A PATROL passes by.

          6A A REMOTE FARM 6A
          Zus and Asael move warily through a barnyard. A tethered
          dog BARKS furiously. A farmer challenges them.

          WALENCKI
          (in Russian; subtitles)

          WHAT DO YOU WANT?
          Walencki brandishes a pitchfork.

          ASAEL
          (in Russian; subtitles)
          Some food...?

          WALENCKI
          They are looking for you people.
          The two brothers glance nervously around.

          WALENCKI (CONT'D)
          Get away from here! GO!
          ZUS, the older of the two brothers, takes a menacing step
          toward the farmer but his younger brother holds him back.

          Zus. Let's go.
          As they retreat toward the woods, Zus warns the farmer.

          We'll be back.

          7 A BOURGEOIS APARTMENT -- DAY 7
          Tuvia is getting dressed as AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN -- his wife,
          RIFKA -- stands by the window, smoking a cigarette.

          TUVIA
          And no news of my brothers?

          RIFKA
          They are used to trouble, they'll
          be all right.

          TUVIA
          If you stay, you'll have to go to
          the ghetto.

          RIFKA
          I can get false papers and pass as
          a gentile. So can you.
          Tuvia shakes his head, no. He finishes dressing. Theirs
          is a relationship long past passion.

          RIFKA (CONT'D)
          Will you at least stay tonight?

          TUVIA
          I need to see to my family. Will
          you come?

          RIFKA
          To the country? No.

          8 A MODEST MILL - LATER THAT DAY 8
          A PAIR OF LEGS lie motionless behind a trough. Beyond, A
          MAN'S TORSO. Zus and Asael stare in mute horror.

          ASAEL
          Papa-- Gottenyu...
          Flies buzz about dead LIVESTOCK. A WOMAN'S BODY lies nearby.

          9 CONTINUED: 9
          A table set for dinner. Candles lit. An open book. A
          NOISE from a cupboard. Zus grabs a hatchet.
          From the root cellar, a YOUNG BOY, 14, appears. His face
          is dirty and tear-streaked. They go to embrace him.

          ASAEL
          Aron.
          The boy (ARON) recoils. He is disoriented and WILL NOT

          SPEAK.

          9A EXT. MODEST MILL - MOMENTS LATER 9A

          Loaded down with possessions, Asael hurries back to the
          woods. Zus pauses long enough to pry the mezuzah from the
          door.

          CUT TO:

          10 THE FOREST AT DUSK 10
          Aron stares mutely straight ahead. Asael is shaking
          uncontrollably and crying. Zus is at a loss what to do.

          ZUS
          Stop it...
          But Asael is lost in a confusion of grief and panic.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Stop it. STOP IT!
          Finally Zus grabs him in a gesture halfway between violence
          and comfort...and holds him as Asael rocks back and forth.

          CUT TO:

          11 THE NALIBOKI FOREST AT DAWN - VIEWED FROM ABOVE 11
          A million acres of dense, impenetrable woods and swamps.

          12 ASAEL AND ARON SLEEP HUDDLED ON THE GROUND 12
          The sound of a FOOTSTEP. They sit up in terror.

          TUVIA
          If I was a German you are dead.

          ASAEL
          Tuvia!
          Asael leaps up to embrace him as if he were salvation itself.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Papa and Mama. They killed them.

          Asael clings to him. Even Aron allows himself to be held.
          Tuvia hold them silently. Zus appears, hatchet in hand.

          ZUS
          Big brother returns.
          Tuvia and Zus look at each other warily.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You saw them?
          Yes. Tuvia saw them. Zus takes the mezuzah from his pocket,
          tosses it to Tuvia.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Welcome home.

          13 LATER - THE NALIBOCKI FOREST - A LOAF OF STALE BREAD 13

          Are you going back to the army?

          TUVIA
          There is no more army.
          Asael worships his big brother.

          ZUS
          Hope at least you killed a few.
          Tuvia just stares at him.

          ASAEL
          What is it like? To be in a war?

          TUVIA
          It wasn't war. It was something
          else.
          Zus eyes him carefully.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Where is Sonia and the baby?

          ZUS
          Horodysze. Hiding in a cellar.
          I'll bring her when it is safe.
          Where is Rifka?

          TUVIA
          In Novgrudok. She wouldn't leave.

          ZUS
          You are still separated?

          Zus chews with the open-mouthed relish of a peasant.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          So why exactly have you come back?
          Tuvia just stares at him. The reason is obvious as he holds
          his younger brothers.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You have a plan?

          TUVIA
          Is there anything left to eat?
          Only a few potatoes in Asael's bag. WORMS writhe among
          them.

          ASAEL
          Zus finished the last of the sausage.
          Tuvia glares at Zus, who glares back. Sibling rivals.

          ZUS
          Stankowicz' farm is closest.

          ASAEL
          He has dogs.

          ZUS
          Fuck the dogs. Wilencki then.

          You think Wilencki is going to give

          good time to stop?
          A moment of decision. Who holds the balance of power?

          The farmer (WALENCKI) who threatened them with the pitchfork

          Where is your gun, farmer?

          WALENCKI
          I have no gun.

          Aron has been left alone. He holds a STICK which he "shoots"
          like a gun -- kachew -- as he creeps from tree to tree.
          Aron freezes. SOMETHING is moving in the trees. He
          crouches. A dark blur. An animal? It moves off. He follows.
          The shape appears again. It's a SMALL GIRL, roughly Aron's
          age. Aron waves at her. The girl stares, then runs off.
          Aron hurries after her into a wooded grove, then stops short.

          A PILE OF NAKED CORPSES.
          Overflows a newly-dug trench. The small girl runs to A
          MIDDLE-AGED MAN with a crude Star-of-David sewn to his
          tattered coat. He holds an OLDER GIRL, 14, in his arms.
          Nearby, three or four OTHERS emerge from hiding. Starved,

          Zus can't help but laugh as well. Even in grief there is
          laughter. A glimpse of ties that bind them.

          ASAEL
          I can't believe Papa's dead.

          ZUS
          Bernicki.

          ASAEL
          The police captain?

          TUVIA
          We don't know he did it.

          ZUS
          He always had it in for Papa.

          TUVIA
          We don't know he did it.

          ZUS
          So we will go and ask him if he
          did.

          ASAEL
          Koscik has a pistol. He showed it
          to me once.

          ZUS
          One pistol isn't enough. We need
          rifles. Machine guns.

          TUVIA
          Machine guns? You're going to take
          on the whole German army?

          ZUS
          Just because you didn't...
          The SOUND of footsteps. Zus jumps up cocking the rifle.
          ARON emerges from the trees. And then, behind him, THE
          SURVIVORS he discovered among the corpses.
          THE MIDDLE-AGED MAN holds a teenage GIRL by one hand and
          carries his younger daughter.

          MIDDLE-AGED MAN
          The child is hurt.
          The brothers stare at him. Wary and unwelcoming.

          TUVIA
          Set her down.
          The man lowers the child to the ground. She isn't moving.

          MIDDLE-AGED MAN
          I am Avram Rubinski. This is my
          daughter. She-- The Germans--

          He cannot bring himself to say the words. OTHERS shuffle
          forward, still in shock, barely able to speak their gratitude
          as Tuvia offers chunks of bread and cheese. The man tries
          to feed his daughter. She is barely alive.
          Asael turns to Aron. Gently.

          ASAEL
          Where did you find them?
          Aron still won't speak. Asael addresses the other girl.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Your sister is sick?

          LITTLE GIRL (RACHEL)
          They kept her for a week.
          We fill in the rest.

          ZUS (O.S.)

          TUVIA--
          Zus has moved out of earshot. Tuvia joins him.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          We cannot feed them.

          TUVIA
          I'll go ask Koscik for food.

          ZUS
          And the pistol.

          TUVIA
          And the pistol.
          Without another word, he starts off.

          ZUS
           Remember to say please.

          TUVIA
          I cannot thank you enough.
          They sit in Koscik's warmly-lit kitchen. Koscik's WIFE
          stands silently by the stove, glaring at Tuvia.

          KOSCIK
          Your father was a good man.

          TUVIA
          He said the same of you.
          Tuvia can't help but notice Koscik's wife giving him the
          evil eye. Koscik produces a bottle of vodka.

          KOSCIK
          Ignore the bitch.
          (raising the bottle)
          To the dead. God rest their souls.
          (in Russian; subtitles)
          Bitch-- Do you want vodka?
          His wife just glares at him.

          KOSCIK (CONT'D)
          I live with this, can you imagine?
          HEADLIGHTS sweep over the window. A CAR is fast approaching.

           Hide yourself. ...The barn.

          He climbs a ladder and is startled to find FIVE MORE MEN
          AND WOMEN in hiding. They stare in mute terror.

          23 OUTSIDE THE BARN 23
          Koscik greets A BELARUSSIAN POLICE CAPTAIN and his SONS as
          they exit the car. They speak in Russian, with subtitles:

          KOSCIK
          Working late, boys.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          Hunting Jews. Our new bosses are
          very organized.
          Koscik offers the bottle.

          offering a year's free tax for every
          one you turn in. -

          KOSCIK
          A Jew is worth that much? Do you
          pay more for a fat one?
          They laugh appreciatively.

          24 IN THE LOFT 24
          A man COUGHS then shrugs an apology. Tuvia glares at him.

          25 BACK TO THE COURTYARD 25

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          Caught five of them hiding in a
          ditch. Smelled so bad I was afraid
          the Germans wouldn't want them.

          KOSCIK
          Maybe for a reduced price.
          More laughter. More vodka.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          You know the Bielski's?

          KOSCIK
          Sure.

          POLICE CAPTAIN

          Anybody caught helping them is in

          Been at it since dawn. The wife
          doesn't like these long nights.
          He tries to hand back the bottle to Koscik.

          KOSCIK
          Keep it.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          Bribing an officer of the law?
          Maybe you have more of this black
          market vodka hidden in the barn?

          KOSCIK
          Take a look. And clean out the cow
          shit while you're back there.
          The policeman laughs and climbs back into the car.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          You'll keep your eyes open, yes?

          KOSCIK
          Good hunting.

          28 MOMENTS LATER - IN THE BARN 28
          Koscik and Tuvia speak in harsh whispers.

          --If the laborers find them tomorrow,
          I will be denounced--

          --And feed them how? I can't care
          for my own family.
          Behind them, several of the REFUGEES have emerged from their
          hiding place. They stare at Tuvia balefully.

          29 MOMENTS LATER - BY THE ROADSIDE 29
          The refugees are loaded with provisions. A young man, PINCHAS
          ZUCKERMAN, has a tethered GOAT. Another man carries a violin
          case. Koscik hands Tuvia another bottle of vodka.

          You people. Why is it so fucking
          hard to be friends with a Jew?
          They embrace.

          For a dumb schoolboy, you mean.

          SHIMON
          My whole life I presumed to teach
          others the right way to live. I

          this isn't. You'll forgive me if
          recent events have somewhat shaken
          my resolve.

          Shimon takes a book from his coat, rips out pages covered

          Sit.
          The son obeys. The SOUND of the rain on the tin roof is

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          And you know why I am here.

          POLICE CAPTAIN
          ...what are you talking about?

          Or lose my job.

          TUVIA
          And it's a good job, isn't it? You

          holds Aron; Avram keeps his surviving daughter close.
          And there is Tuvia -- sitting by the fire. Zus takes the

          His sons.
          Zus nods his approval.

          ZUS
          How was it?

          TUVIA
          What?

          ZUS
          To kill them. It was good, no?

          TUVIA
          Shut up.
          Tuvia stares into the fire. He is dirty and tired. Zus
          looks around.

          ZUS
          What are we going to do with these
          others?

          TUVIA
          I don't know--

          ZUS
          The women will slow us down. And
          your old teacher--

          TUVIA
          You're afraid he's going to beat
          you for forgetting your homework.

          ZUS
          We have to be able to keep moving,
          and quickly.

          TUVIA
          I agree. But they're here.
          They consider their predicament.

          We'll sleep farther up the trail.
          If anyone comes, they'll find them
          first. The gunshots will give us
          time to escape.

          ZUS

          Tuvia, I have pity for them all,

          BUT--

          TUVIA
          They are family.

          ZUS
          And how will we feed this family?

          TUVIA
          We'll water the soup.
          One of the new arrivals is a DARK-HAIRED BEAUTY. Tuvia and
          Zus watch her pass. Zus is particularly interested.

          Food, such as it is, is being handed out to SEVERAL NEW
          ARRIVALS. Asael brushes Aron's hair. Rachel sits beside
          her grieving father. She looks at Aron. He looks back.
          Nearby, Tuvia and Malbin are building a shelter. Malbin is
          hopelessly inept. A wall COLLAPSES.

          TUVIA
          Fuck me! Have you never used a
          hammer?

          MALBIN
          Uh. No.

          TUVIA
          What is it you do, then?

          MALBIN
          I suppose...you'd have to say...I
          was...am...an intellectual.

          TUVIA
          This is a job?

          MALBIN
          I published a small magazine...
          actually a journal...well, more
          like a pamphlet.
          Zus passes them, his arm around the dark-haired beauty.

          ZUS
          Tuvia, this is Rona. Rona is my
          forest wife.

          TUVIA
          I see. Congratulations.
          Zus winks and walks past. Malbin and Tuvia watch them.

          MALBIN
          Interesting concept.

          Suddenly the camp grows quiet.
          TWO YOUNG MEN who have emerged from the forest, their clothes
          dirty and torn. One of them aims an army-issue rifle.

          ZUS
          Hello, boys, what can we do for
          you?

          YOUNG MAN #1
          Food. We want food.
          Everyone remains still. Zus eyes his own rifle nearby.

          ZUS
          These little shits are holding us
          up.
          The Young Man motions his partner to take Zus's rifle.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You little shits have the balls to
          shoot me?
          In response, the young man CHAMBERS A ROUND.

          This is all the food we have. You
          are welcome to share.

          Or perhaps you'd prefer I shove
          them up your ass.

          TUVIA
          Where are you from?
          The young man glares at Zus. Then, to Tuvia:

          YOUNG MAN #1
          Horodyszcze.
          The name freezes Zus in his tracks. His wife is there.

          PERETZ
          We haven't eaten in two days. My
          name is Peretz, this is Jacov.

          JACOV
          Two days ago there were three
          thousand Jews in Horodyszcze. Now
          there are fifty. Me and him, we
          hid in a wall.

          ZUS
          You know a woman there, Sonia
          Bielski?
          The men look at one another.

          JACOV
          We knew her.
          Zus can hardly bring himself to ask the next question.

          ZUS
          ...There was a child.
          Jacov shakes his head. Sorry.
          Zus leans his head against a tree. After a moment he begins
          to BEAT HIS HEAD against it until BLOOD pours down his face.

          ASAEL
          (to the newcomers)
          His family.
          Tuvia puts his arms around his brother. Zus's shoulders
          begin to heave. Soon his body convulses with deep wracking
          sobs. He is absolutely unself-conscious in his grief.

          I know.

          ZUS
          Mama. Papa.
          Their heads are close together, their faces wet with tears.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Why not us?

          TUVIA
          I don't know.

          ZUS
          I thought they'd be safe. I should
          have been with them.

          TUVIA
          No.

          ZUS
          I could have protected them.
          Tuvia just holds him. He, too, is crying quietly.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Better to be rabbits? Hunted?
          Hiding? No...
          Zus breaks free of Tuvia's embrace and walks away.

          41 LATER - BY THE FIRE 41
          Jacov and Peretz are eating. Between ravenous bites--

          PERETZ
          We are looking for partisans.

          JACOV
          What is the name of your otriad?
          Tuvia laughs ruefully.

          ASAEL
          What is an 'otriad?'

          TUVIA
          An armed brigade.

          JACOV
          We heard the Russians are beginning
          to organize.

          ASAEL
          Then we are the Bielski Otriad.
          You want to join?

          PERETZ
          (looks around)
          The Russians are fighters.

          JACOV
          --But you need a gun to join them.
          Without a gun you are nothing.
          They sabotage railroads and kill
          Germans.

          ZUS (O.S.)
          We will kill all the Germans you
          can handle. Starting tonight.
          They stare up at him, his face a mask of blood and filth.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          If you're not afraid to use that
          rifle.

          42 MOMENTS LATER - JUST OUTSIDE OF CAMP -- 42
          Zus is loading Wilencki's gun.

          TUVIA
          --we must get what we need without
          killing. We can't make more enemies--
          Zus concentrates on opening the breach.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          --It won't bring your family back

          TUVIA
          So this is God's work you're doing,

          You are making the decisions now?
          A stand-off. Zus stares back at him. The struggle for
          command has grown more obvious.

          We wait for dark.

          earlier scene.

          Who are you?

          (REALIZING)
          You don't understand. They made me
          give them my truck...
          Zus FIRES. Jacov and Peretz follow suit. The man goes
          down. They throw his DEAD BODY onto the burning truck.

          CUT TO:

          43A A CLUSTER OF HOUSES - LATER THAT NIGHT 43A
          Zus and Peretz are backing out of an open doorway, FIRING
          BACK INSIDE AS THEY GO. From within, the sound of SCREAMS.

          ZUS

          THIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU

          COOPERATE WITH NAZI SCUM..!
          FACES appear furtively at the windows of nearby houses.
          Zus addresses the little neighborhood, delirious with joy.

          44 A ROADSIDE DITCH - LATER THAT NIGHT 44
          Tuvia and Asael lie in on one side of a road. Tuvia has
          looped ONE END OF THE WIRE around a post.

          45 IN THE DITCH ON THE OTHER SIDE 45
          Zus, Peretz, and Jacov WRAP THE WIRE to a tree.

          The lights of a MOTORCYCLE, a GERMAN COURIER.

          47 IN THE DITCH 47
          Tuvia waits until the BIKE is almost upon them. Then he
          TIGHTENS the WIRE so it stretches INVISIBLY ACROSS THE ROAD.

          48 THE MOTORCYCLIST IS GARROTED 48
          by the wire. His bike goes sliding away as the Bielski's
          swarm him, KILLING HIM with the last bullet from the
          Mahkarov.
          ZUS rummages through the downed-bike's saddlebags. He finds
          a beautiful KNIFE and lifts it up triumphantly.

          PERETZ
          Look--!
          MORE HEADLIGHTS fast approaching.

          TUVIA
          Hide! Everyone!
          They all scramble back into the ditch, dragging the dead
          courier with them.

          49 A GERMAN STAFF CAR 49
          approaches. As its headlights pick up the downed motorcycle,
          it slows and pulls off to the side --

          50 DIRECTLY OVER THE DITCH 50
          Where Tuvia and Zus are concealed. From within the car, we
          hear VOICES SPEAKING GERMAN. A YOUNG PRIVATE gets out and
          walks up the road to investigate.

          PRIVATE
          (in German; subtitled)
          It's one of ours, but no one is
          here. Maybe he was drunk?
          From the car, an SERGEANT yells a reply.

          SERGEANT
          (in German; subtitled)
          Move it off the road before the
          convoy passes. I'll report the
          sonuvabitch.
          As the soldier drags the bike off the road, AN OFFICER steps
          out of the car and lights a cigarette.
          He's followed by the Sergeant. He carries a Schmeisser
          SUBMACHINE GUN dangling from his shoulder.

          51 IN THE DITCH - ZUS 51
          can see the Sergeant's feet peeking out over the ditch.

          A STREAM OF PISS
          Cascades onto him. He tries to inch his body away...

          THE PISSING SERGEANT
          catches the flicker of MOVEMENT below, SEES Zus lying in
          the ditch. Stunned, he tries to zip up his fly. It catches.
          ZUS LEAPS UP brandishing the KNIFE. He's on the Sergeant
          before he can get the gun off his shoulder. Stabbing him
          through his greatcoat, the BLADE BREAKS OFF IN HIS HAND.
          MEANWHILE, THE LIEUTENANT drops his cigarette, reaching
          under his coat for a pistol. Tuvia TACKLES him. The GUN
          skids away. They roll around on the road, CLAWING, PUNCHING,
          BITING. Tuvia SLAMS the man's head against the pavement.

          52 UP THE ROAD 52
          The Private sees Asael and Peretz coming at him. Jacov
          follows with his rifle. The Private turns and runs down
          the road. They give chase.

          53 FROM INSIDE THE CAR 53
          Another OFFICER is in the back seat with A WOMAN. He reaches
          for his gun, stands up in the seat and begins FIRING WILDLY
          at Tuvia. TUVIA ROLLS UNDER THE CAR, avoiding the burst.
          MEANWHILE, ZUS USES THE HANDLE OF THE KNIFE to BREAK the
          Sergeant's nose. He RIPS the SCHMEISSER away, firing point-
          blank into the man, whose greatcoat CATCHES FIRE.

          INSIDE THE STAFF CAR
          The officer takes close aim at Tuvia, just as ZUS TURNS THE
          MACHINE GUN on the car BLOWING OUT THE WINDOWS, killing the
          Officer and the woman -- and saving his brother's life.

          54 MEANWHILE, DOWN THE ROAD 54
          Jacov fires at the Private, MISSES. The man keeps RUNNING.
          Jacov fires again. MISSES AGAIN.
          FINALLY his THIRD SHOT hits him in the leg. The Private
          keeps running. Limping now.

          JACOV
          I got him!
          Peretz and Asael can now catch up to the soldier.

          FROM FAR AWAY
          We SEE them knock the Private to the ground, KICKING him
          until Jacov catches up to them and FIRES A FINAL SHOT.

          

          

          

          
           GREEN Revision - 8-8-07 31.

          55 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 55
          Tuvia stands, out of breath.

          TUVIA
          Stupid! The gunfire could be heard
          for miles.

          ZUS
          He was pissing on my head.
          Zus is high from the killing, covered in the dead man's
          blood. He begins calling out orders.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Peretz, Jacov, check the car for
          guns...
          (to Tuvia)
          This one's yours.
          He presents him with the Schmeisser as if it were a trophy.
          Tuvia accepts it, checking the gun efficiently.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          I'll check his pockets for more
          ammo.

          TUVIA
          Hurry--!

          AT THE STAFF CAR
          Peretz and Jacov emerge with two MACHINE-PISTOLS, several
          BOTTLES OF SCHNAPPS and a beautiful LEICA CAMERA.

          JACOV
          They were on their way to a party!
          They toss one bottle to Zus and another to Tuvia.

          56 UP THE ROAD 56
          Asael stands over the dead Private. He isn't much older
          than Aron.

          57 BACK AT THE STAFF CAR 57
          ZUS rifles the pockets of the dead Sergeant for ammo. He
          finds cigarettes and the man's wallet. He opens it.

          ZUS
          Welcome to Belarus, herr Henkel.
          A CHAMPAGNE CORK POPS as Peretz and Jacov toast their
          victory.

          PERETZ
          Now we are real Partisans...

          JACOV
          To the Bielski Otriad!

          58 SUDDENLY - ANOTHER SET OF HEADLIGHTS 58
          are rounding the bend. Troop trucks. The Staff Car was
          leading A CONVOY.

          TUVIA
          Into the fields! RUN!
          Tuvia pulls Peretz off the road, but Jacov reloads his rifle
          and begins to FIRE at the approaching trucks.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Jacov, NO!
          THE TRUCKS STOP. Troops pour off and begin RETURNING FIRE.
          Jacov is CUT DOWN by a MACHINE GUN.
          Peretz, Zus, and Tuvia race into the WHEAT FIELD. It's not
          clear if they can make it into the woods. A FLARE IGNITES
          OVERHEAD turning the wheat fields BRIGHT WHITE in flickering
          incandescence. Malbin is almost paralytic with fear.
          ASAEL doesn't know which way to run. He plunges into the
          WHEAT FIELD...but ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD.
          ONE OF THE TRUCKS drives forward, CUTTING HIM OFF, using
          its SPOTLIGHT to reveal him. FIFTEEN SOLDIERS start after
          him.

          59 SEEN FROM ABOVE 59
          We watch as they CONVERGE on him.

          TUVIA, ZUS AND PERETZ
          Have almost made it into the woods when PERETZ IS HIT. He
          falls. Tuvia and Zus pick him up and half-carry, half-drag
          him into the sanctuary of the forest.

          TUVIA
          Zus. His rifle.
          Zus races back to pick up Peretz's weapon.

          60 ASAEL, MEANWHILE 60
          has realized his mistake. He tries to circle back toward
          the woods but the SOLDIERS move to CUT HIM OFF. He is fast,
          but not fast enough. We realize he isn't going to make it.

          61 IN THE WOODS 61
          Tuvia and Zus look at the scene with mounting horror.

          TUVIA
          Asael...
          He rips the rifle from Zus's hands. For a moment we think
          he's going to go back after him. Instead, he wedges the
          rifle into a tree-trunk and takes careful aim...

          THE SPOTLIGHT SHATTERS
          Plunging the field into darkness as the flare burns out.
          ASAEL seizes the moment and dives to his knees, disappearing
          from view and CRAWLING NOW rather than expose himself.
          AN IRRIGATION DITCH is nearby. Frantically he DIGS into
          the soft mud on its banks. As he scrapes his hands raw, he
          can HEAR his pursuers drawing near, CALLING OUT to one
          another.

          CUT TO:

          62 THE FOREST CAMP - DAWN 62
          A somber mood. Tuvia watches someone scrape at the porridge
          congealed in an empty pot. OTHERS stare listlessly into
          space. ONE MAN chews on a piece of leather, ANOTHER sucks
          on an old chicken bone.
          Zus, meanwhile, is in the middle of a nasty drunk from the
          captured schnapps. Nearby, Aron shares his ration of bread
          with Rachel. Little enough, but a connection is made.
          Peretz lies nearby. Malbin is trying to comforts him.
          There is nothing that can help him. Malbin looks to Tuvia.

          SHIMON
          They thought you were bringing food.
          Tuvia just stares at him.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          Did the farmers stop you?
          Still no answer from Tuvia.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          They had guns? Dogs?

          TUVIA
          No.

          SHIMON
          I don't understand.
          Tuvia says nothing. Nearby, a child cries in hunger.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          The Talmud says if you save a life
          you must take responsibility for
          it.

          Again I have no idea what you are
          talking about.
          Around them, the beseeching eyes of so many hungry faces.

          SHIMON
          I think you do.

          VOICE
          You are the Bielski's?
          A MAN stands in the clearing. BEN ZION GULKOWITZ is tall,
          well muscled, a rifle strapped over his shoulder.

          ZUS
          How'd you get past the Lazar?

          BEN ZION
          Who?
          Zus stands unsteadily, then lurches into the woods, leaning
          on an occasional tree for support. He finds the erstwhile
          sentry --LAZAR -- ambling toward him.

          ZUS
          You shit! You worthless shit!
          Zus punches him, knocking him the ground. In a sloppy,
          drunken frenzy, Zus SLAPS him again.

          TUVIA
          Enough!

          ZUS
          He walked right by you! Someone
          could have been killed!
          Tuvia pulls Zus off him.

          TUVIA
          I said, enough!
          (to Lazar)
          Get up! Get up!

          ZUS
          If we were real partisans he'd be
          shot.

          TUVIA

          ZUS
          MISTAKE! We cannot make mistakes!
          As Zus goes for Lazar again, Tuvia roughly PULLS HIM OFF.
          Zus goes flying, tripping over, landing on his ass.

          TUVIA
          That's right, Zus. No mistakes.
          Like last night.
          (looks at him)
          First they will torture Asael...and
          then they will hang him.
          Tuvia walks away, leaving his brother on the ground.

          63 BACK IN CAMP 63
          Tuvia rejoins them. Ben Zion looks up at him.

          BEN ZION
          You are Tuvia Bielski.

          TUVIA
          You know me?

          BEN ZION
          I am Ben Zion Gulkowitz.
          Ben Zion is besieged by questions about friends and family.

          MIRIAM
          Pardon me, you are from Vilna. My
          sister lives on Passaya Street.

          BEN ZION
          The SD came without warning.
          Hundreds were taken. No one knows
          where.

          THE WOMAN begins to cry.

          MIRIAM
          My poor sister...dear God, no...
          Meanwhile, Peretz's MOANING ceases. A woman grumbles:

          WOMAN #1
          We'd be better off in the ghetto...

          TAMARA
          At least here we are safe.

          LOVA
          There at least we had hope...

          SHIMON
          No. Here, we have hope.
          A FEW MORE join in, grumbling their dissatisfaction. Others
          take the opposite position. These are Jews, after all, and
          arguing is a revered sport and a pastime. It escalates.

          WOMAN #1
          We are hungry!
          This is a defining moment for Tuvia. When at first he
          speaks, it is awkward, ineffectual amid the growing tumult.

          TUVIA
          I know we have no food. But
          tomorrow... tomorrow will be another
          mission.

          RONA
          Look what happened the last time.

          TUVIA
          That was a mistake! But the mistakes
          we made will not be made again!
          More objections. Tuvia must raise his voice to be heard.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          We could be here a long time. And
          we have to prepare.

          LOVA
          How?

          TUVIA
          Better security. Better at getting
          food and information--
          (talking over their

          OBJECTIONS)
          --at making shelters. Whatever is
          needed. We all participate. We
          don't work against each other.
          At this he looks directly at Zus. Daring him to object.

          Not right now. We cannot afford to
          lose friends like Jacov and Peretz.
          A small voice speaks up.

          ARON

          Everyone stares. It is the first time Aron has spoken.

          --cannot lose anyone.
          He looks from face to face. Filthy, ravaged, many of them
          with tears in their eyes. This is what they need --
          leadership, faith, something to believe in.
          And gradually, his tentativeness and awkwardness is replaced
          by something else. A new voice. From deep inside.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          ...We will map out where we've been
          so as to not visit the same farms
          too often. And we take only from
          those who can afford to give, and
          leave those who can't alone.

          LOVA
          The poorest farmer has more than
          us.

          TUVIA
          True. But what I am saying is...
          what I mean is... We are not thieves.
          (his resolve growing
          with every word)
          Or murderers. We may be hunted
          like animals but we will not become
          animals.
          (looks at them all)
          We have all chosen this -- to live
          free, like human beings, for as
          long as we can. Each day of freedom
          is an act of faith. And if we die
          trying to live, at least we die
          like human beings.
          His mission statement. A vision of their future.
          Everyone nods in mute acknowledgement. Zus lowers his head.
          The shift in power between them has occurred. Tuvia has
          emerged as the undisputed leader.

          Hello.
          She refuses to be flattered. In Russian:

          In the barn.

          67 IN THE BARN 67
          Zus calls out.

          ZUS
          Koscik, put your pants back on and

          He steps into the shadows to find:

          KOSCIK HANGING FROM A THRESHING HOOK

          BELLA
          We must have got lost a dozen times.
          I was absolutely resigned to die.

          ZUS
          No...

          BELLA
          Tell him, Chaya. Was it not the
          absolute worst? And that farmer,
          Mr. Koscik, kept making the most
          vulgar jokes, he said any girl who--
          As they continue out of earshot, it appears as though Zus
          would be happy to listen for hours.

          71 A TOWERING PINE FOREST 71
          Aron and Rachel are walking through the woods. For a brief
          moment, viewed through the eyes of the young, we see these
          woods as a magical place. Strange mushrooms, gnarled roots,
          an enormous spider's web glistening with dew.

          72 THE CAMP HAS BEGUN TO SHOW PROGRESS 72
          Sentries are posted. Zus expertly helps with the building
          a bunker ("zemylanka"). There's a more permanent kitchen,
          a wash trough, a clothesline. Pinchas tends his goat.
          Though primitive and raw...a haven.

          SHIMON AND MALBIN ARE DIGGING A HOLE
          Their bickering will become for them, as time goes on, a
          sport and a pastime.

          MALBIN
          You're trying to tell me all politics
          is meaningless.

          SHIMON
          In the West a monster with a little
          mustache, in the East a monster
          with a big mustache. This is all I
          need to know about politics.

          MALBIN
          Your messiah will have a mustache,
          too, and a full beard.

          SHIMON
          No. The messiahs are all in
          politics, and they're killing us.
          Zus unloads two cut and stripped trees.

          MALBIN
          And Roosevelt? He has no mustache.

          SHIMON
          My life in these woods is much easier
          because of Mr. Roosevelt, thank
          you.

          73 WALKING THROUGH THE CAMP TUVIA AND ASAEL 73
          review their plans.

          TUVIA
          We need to know what's going on in
          the villages, how the Germans patrol,
          who the informers are--
          He realizes that Asael is not fully concentrating; instead
          he is watching as Chaya walks past.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Are you listening to me?

          ASAEL
          Yes.

          TUVIA
          What's her name?

          ASAEL
          Chaya. [I believe.]

          TUVIA

          (YELLING)

          CHAYA!
          He waves as Chaya turns to look in their direction. Asael
          smiles, embarrassed.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          So talk to her.

          ASAEL
          I hardly know her.

          TUVIA
          You spent three days in a cellar!
          Asael blushes, returns the focus to their prior conversation.

          ASAEL
          Malbin says the Piznarksi granary
          is full. We need two guns at
          least...

          TUVIA
          Whose turn to go?

          ASAEL
          Zus.

          TUVIA
          You go along, just to make sure he
          understands my orders.
          Asael nods.

          74 NEAR A SHED ROOF - BEN ZION 74
          We notice a FEW NEW FACES. Their number has exceeded twenty.
          Among them are two lumbering, dark-skinned men, ARKADY and
          MOTL LUBCZANSKI. Ben Zion is showing Lazar and the other
          newcomers how to clean a weapon.

          BEN ZION
          This is not a gun. It is Bar
          Kochba's spear. It is Ehud's sword.
          You fix the patch to the rod--
          They do as he instructs.

          BEN ZION (CONT'D)
          --then run it through the barrel...
          and don't lose the patch in the

          BARREL--
          Lazar looks up, sheepishly.

          LAZAR
          I lost my patch.
          ARKADY LUBCZANSKI whispers contemptuously to his brother,

          MOTL...

          ARKADY LUBCZANSKI
          The village idiot.
          Zus shoves Arkady out of the way and approaches Lazar, who
          cowers. But rather than abuse him, Zus removes the patch
          from the rifle and hands it back to him.

          LAZAR
          Thank you, Zus.

          ZUS
          (returning the rifle)
          It's nothing.

          76 A ROADSIDE - NEXT DAY 76
          KISSELY is a MILKMAN with bright red hair and a bushy
          mustache. He leads a horse-drawn CART laden with milk cans.
          ZUS AND THE OTHERS rise up out of the ditch. In Russian:

          ZUS
          (a pleasant tone)
          Good morning, friend. Getting an
          early start to market? Could you
          possibly spare us a bit of milk?
          Zus' tone is belied by the rifle in his hand.

          KISSELY
          This is what I'm required to give
          the Germans. If I don't meet my
          quota they'll shoot me and my family.
          Zus is tempted to shoot him himself.

          ASAEL
          (to Zus)
          Leave half. He can't go to the
          Germans empty-handed.
          Zus glares at Asael.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Tuvia's orders.
          Zus shakes his head, climbs onto the wagon and begins
          removing cartons.

          We are so grateful, comrade, for
          your cooperation. What a lovely
          coat. Is that a fur collar?

          joins the others lugging milk cans along the forest path.

          LAZAR (V.O.)

          HALT! WHO GOES THERE!
          Zus shakes his head. Lazar stands, pointing his weapon.

          ZUS
          Lazar, you can see it's us, you
          idiot. You only ask, 'who goes
          there' when you don't know who it
          is.

          LAZAR
          Sorry, Zus.

          78 THE CAMP 78
          is a beehive of activity. Shimon and Malbin are digging.

          MALBIN
          Even Spinoza said existence can be
          substantiated by empirical evidence.

          SHIMON
          All your secular learning, yet you
          know nothing of life.

          MALBIN
          How can you say this? Learning is
          my life.

          SHIMON
          And for every fact that goes in
          your head, another comes out your
          rear end.
          CHAYA and BELLA receive the bounty from the foragers.

          Milk, eggs -- Chaya, our brave men
          have brought us a feast!

          ZUS

          I don't think we've been properly
          introduced. Arkady Lubczanski.

          CHAYA
          Hello.

          ARKADY
          You are Chaya?

          CHAYA
          ...Yes.

          ARKADY
          You are getting along all right?
          Anything you need? An extra blanket?

          CHAYA
          Oh. Well... Yes, that would be
          nice.

          ARKADY
          You'll have it by tonight. Something
          nice and soft.
          (smiles at her)
          I couldn't help but notice you don't
          have a husband yet.

          No. But thank you for explaining
          it.
          She hurries away. Malbin sits down wearily beside Shimon.

          MALBIN
          Descartes at least provided for the
          subjective nature of experience.
          He takes a spoon from his sock.

          SHIMON
          Yes. You annoy me therefore I exist.

          MALBIN
          You are not eating?

          SHIMON
          By my best calculation, today is
          High Holiday. I am fasting.
          Malbin can't believe this. He rolls his eyes and digs in.
          One of the NEWCOMERS has brought a violin. He begins to
          play. A bittersweet melody. People stop talking and listen,
          eyes filling at this reminder of a sweeter, civilized time.
          Ben Zion has left the new arrivals and approached Tuvia.
          He looks grave. Tuvia immediately knows something is wrong.

          TUVIA
          What is it?

          BEN ZION
          The new ones, they are from
          Novagroduk. Your wife--
          Tuvia tenses. Ben Zion hesitates...

          BEN ZION (CONT'D)
          They say...She was killed last week.
          (at a loss)
          I'm sorry.
          Tuvia nods. No outward display of grief. An awkward moment.

          TUVIA
          Thank you for telling me.
          (changes the subject)
          We have to dig a trench around the
          new zemylanka. If it rains I'm
          afraid water will seep in.
          Tuvia clearly cannot deal with his news.

          BEN ZION
          I'll see to it, then.

          Jacob's ladders. Like in his dream.
          Asael says you can see the angels.
          They walk on, eventually coming upon RAILROAD TRACKS. A
          TRAIN is rounding the bend, headed in their direction.

          RACHEL
          Can we stay to watch?

          ARON
          If we hide.
          They move back into the trees as the train NEARS: a slow-
          moving engine pulling a line of WOODEN CATTLE CARS.

          RACHEL
          Is that a Nazi train?

          ARON
          If we had some dynamite we could

          Aron can't help but be pleased by this notion.

          small barred windows. And every now and then a gaunt,

          SHIMON
          I am sorry for your loss.
          Tuvia nods. He is deep inside himself.

          SHIMON (CONT'D)
          Do you want to say the Kaddish?
          When at last Tuvia speaks, it is almost to himself.

          TUVIA
          She was a beautiful woman. But
          cold. Not a day went by she didn't
          remind me I wasn't a good provider.
          For years it wasn't really a marriage
          at all. And now...
          He lowers his head. All Shimon can do is sit beside him.

          Why is there a rule against women
          having guns?

          ZUS
          There aren't enough for the men.

          Women need guns, too.

          ZUS
          What for?

          BELLA
          For protection.

          ZUS
          Women have men for protection.
          Bella bites her lip. She's a virgin but also realistic.

          BELLA
          I want protection.
          She steps closer and takes Zus's hand...under her coat...onto
          her breast...never taking her eyes off him.

          QUIET! NOT ANOTHER WORD!!!
          THE POLICEMEN begin FIRING. TWO of the group are KILLED.
          Tuvia roughly pushes people deeper into the woods.

          TUVIA
          Lova, Ben Zion -- stay with us.
          Asael, keep them moving. Don't
          stop!
          THE POLICEMEN enter the camp. A submachine gun RAKES a
          shelter. KISSELY has found the escape trail into the woods.

          KISSELY
          This way--

          86 THE FOREST IS DEATHLY STILL 86
          Tuvia and Zus usher the group across the river and up the
          embankment.

          TUVIA
          Go! Go! Move!
          (holding back)
          Isaac, keep them moving! Zus, Asael,
          Ben Zion...
          Tuvia motions for them to take defensive positions while
          the others escape.-
          The policemen emerge hurriedly through the trees and begin
          crossing the river.
          SHOTS rings out. A Policeman goes down. The German Soldier
          is shot in the leg. They are dragged from the water.

          The policemen exchange apprehensive looks.

          WHERE ARE YOU FROM?

          POLICEMAN

          KARELITZ!
          The confrontation changes languages.

          BEN ZION

          I'M FROM KARELITZ, TOO. I LIVED BY

          Derisive laughter from the trees.

          POLICEMAN
          Give us Bielski and the rest of you
          can go free!
          Behind a tree, Tuvia is surprised by the mention of his
          name.

          TUVIA
          You are from Belarussia, pig! Why
          do you work for the Germans against
          your own people?

          KISSELY
          For the same reason you steal from
          the poor. To survive.
          ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT. Kessely is hit in the arm.

          The policemen are having similar thoughts.

          SUDDENLY - A POLICEMAN BREAKS AND RUNS AWAY
          Soon it's a full-scale retreat.

          AFTER A MOMENT
          Tuvia, Zus, Lova & Ben Zion emerge. Zus picks up the dead
          German's machine pistol.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          They'll be back.
          (looks around)
          We have to find a new camp.

          ZUS
          Next time just draw them a map.

          TUVIA
          What does that mean?

          ZUS
          It means -- we should have killed
          the fucking milkman. Your policy
          of diplomacy is shit.
          Zus is breathing hard, full of the adrenaline of battle.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          ...Two are dead. Winter is coming
          and now we have no shelter. Why?

          as the group trudges along -- weighed down by cooking gear,
          food, guns, etc. Asael takes the iron cauldron from Chaya.
          Zus and Bella walk side-by-side. Pinchas leads his goat.

          MALBIN
          Where is he taking us? My feet are
          going to fall off.

          SHIMON
          A great rabbi once said, "wherever
          I go, I am always going to the land
          of Israel."

          MALBIN
          Well, maybe rabbis should give better

          89 A HILLSIDE 89
          The group is sprawled on the ground. Four people share a
          single cigarette. Shimon and Malbin hardly have the energy
          to argue. Pinchas feeds his goat. Tuvia walks among them.

          TUVIA
          Rest and eat. I need volunteers
          for a scouting party.
          Zus raises his hand. Tuvia nods in grudging gratitude.
          However mixed his feelings, Zus can always be counted on.

          Tuvia looks at Zus, who shrugs. They are in unfamiliar
          territory. As they move cautiously forward:

          A MAN IN A RED ARMY TUNIC
          steps into the path, holding an automatic rifle. He WHISTLES
          softly. More ARMED MEN materialize, surrounding them.

          GRAMOV

          WHO ARE YOU?
          Tuvia instantly grasps the situation. He salutes.

          Zus's finger tightens on the trigger of his submachine gun.

          Tuvia maintains his composure.

          A primitive tent camp. RUSSIAN PARTISANS move about, quiet
          and cold-eyed men wearing remnants of Red Army uniforms.
          Zus can't help but be impressed by the array of weaponry.
          VICTOR PACHENKO emerges from a tent. A former lieutenant,
          dashing in a fur cap and long officer's coat. He addresses
          them in Russian.

          VIKTOR
          I am Viktor Panchenko, commander of
          the October otriad. We have had
          complaints of a Jewish gang stealing
          from villages loyal to us.
          (a steely look)
          How do you respond to these charges?

          TUVIA
          When you take food it is from loyal
          supporters. When we do, you call
          it stealing.

          VIKTOR
          We are soldiers.

          TUVIA
          And we fight a common enemy. The
          motherland doesn't distinguish
          between Jews and non-Jews.
          Viktor is amused by this bit of Soviet dogma.

          VIKTOR
          But Jews do not fight.

          VIKTOR
          We will see. Select your best
          fighters and send them to us.
          Zus looks at Tuvia, knowing he has no choice.

          TUVIA
          We are honored to be of service.
          Tuvia and Zus SALUTE and head back the way they came.

          ZUS
          (under his breath)
          So we're partisans now.

          Tuvia and Malbin are working together on a new bunker.
          Malbin expertly nails a header across a doorway.

          I haven't read a book in months.

          TUVIA
          I haven't read one in years.
          Malbin looks up from his work.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          I wasn't a very good student. You
          can ask Shimon.

          MALBIN
          .I did.
          Tuvia laughs ruefully. Considers him for a moment.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)
          Might I make an observation?
          Tuvia gestures, go ahead.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)
          We need to be strong, but--

          TUVIA
          ...But--?

          MALBIN
          Other things are important, too.

          TUVIA
          Such as?
          Malbin tries to think how best to put it.

          MALBIN
          Community.
          Tuvia considers the word. As if trying it on for size.

          TUVIA
          You have more ideas? About all
          this?

          MALBIN

          You are the man of her dreams? The

          months, not to mention years of sibling rivalry, translates
          into fists and elbows.
          Ben Zion moves to break it up. Tuvia and Zus turn on him.

          Zus gains the upper hand and starts to beat the crap put of

          realizing that they have crossed some line.

          He looks at Asael.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Are you coming?
          Asael looks at one brother, then the other. Once again, he
          is in the middle. He looks at Chaya, then back at Zus.

          ASAEL
          No.

          ZUS
          Good. I'll dance at your wedding.
          He stops by Bella's side, touches her arm, then disappears

          several ELDERS of the ghetto Council

          ELDER #1
          We are not so naive as to believe
          they won't kill some of us. But
          all the Jews? It makes no sense.
          They need us to work. In the
          factories. The labor camps.
          Tuvia notices A PRETTY GIRL standing on a chair in order to
          hear. Her name is LILKA and we will soon come to know her.

          ELDER #1
          We too have heard of such places.
          But have you seen them yourself?
          Can you tell me, with absolute
          certainty, that we are not just as
          likely to die out there with you in
          the woods with Winter coming on...?
          Someone WHISTLES from the street below. A tense moment.
          Another whistle. All clear.

          ELDER #1 (CONT'D)
          --Do you think we haven't all
          considered running away? For every
          one that leaves they kill twenty.
          How can I sacrifice thousands for
          the sake of a few?"
          Tuvia looks at them, rubbing his face in concentration.

          TUVIA
          What if we were to take all of you?

          ELDER #1
          The old, the sick? There are
          thousands. How will we live?

          TUVIA
          We will protect you. We have made
          alliances with the Russian Partisans.

          Tuvia looks at him in disbelief. Such madness is
          incontrovertible. A suspended moment.

          LILKA
          I am going.
          This breaks the log jam. Several others join in, "We are

          squeeze through into the adjoining alley. Behind them, a
          hundred more await their turn.
          Out in the alley, Asael stops them momentarily as a car
          goes by at the end of the street, then gives the all-clear.

          The new ARRIVALS file in. Men wear citified coats and some
          women have furs. They eye the veterans, thinking, 'how
          dirty they are'; the veterans eye them warily, wondering,
          'How will we feed them?'
          A handmade sign reads, "New Jerusalem." Chaya is re-united
          with her parents. She holds Asael's arm and looks up at
          him with absolute rapture. She is his.
          Malbin is collecting valuables. One WELL-DRESSED WOMAN is
          reluctant to part with her jewelry.

          Nearby, Shimon is INTERVIEWING another line of arrivals.

          SHIMON
          --How about carpenters? Any

          OPPENHEIM is an old man with thick glasses.

          OPPENHEIM
          I am a watchmaker.
          Tuvia has walked over to observe.

          Guns? No.

          TUVIA

          See if you can fix this trigger.
          Oppenheim slips on a pair of spectacles and studies the
          mechanism. It sticks. He digs into his pocket and produces
          a small file and expertly begins to shave the metal spur.
          He tests it, then hands it back to Tuvia, who CLICKS the
          trigger.

          All attention turns to him. The Lubczanski brothers grumble

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Once you are settled, you'll be

          Idly, she begins to ITCH her scalp. Then her leg. In the

          Pachenko watches as Zus follows the approaching truck through
          binoculars, then cocks the heavy machine gun.
          The truck SLOWS TO A CRAWL as it encounters an overturned
          PEASANT CART blocking the road.

          104D BACK TO THE WEDDING 104D
          As Asael kisses the bride, Tuvia is staring not at the
          newlyweds but rather at Lilka, who has washed and let down
          her hair. She glances up and meets his eye, then looks
          away.
          As Asael crushes the traditional glass underfoot:

          104E ZUS OPENS FIRE. 104E
          The driver SLUMPS over the wheel and the truck careens lazily
          off the road.
          GERMAN SOLDIERS spill out, blindly returning fire as Zus's
          fighters SWARM down the hill. Several are HIT right away.

          104F INTERCUT: THE GROWING ECSTASY OF THE WEDDING CELEBRATION 104F

          WITH THE FRENZY OF BATTLE.
          People dance and sing, their joy juxtaposed with the
          murderous intensity of the firefight, their twirling
          movements a cracked mirror of the death agonies of fighters
          of both sides as they are hit and fall.

          104F CONTINUED: 104F
          Some of the inexperienced Jewish fighters freeze, some fire
          their weapons blindly. Ben Zion does well. ZUS RUNS AMONG
          THEM, fiercely EXHORTING them to attack.

          ZUS
          Get up! Move! SHOOT OR I'LL SHOOT

          YOU...

          FROM A VANTAGE POINT IN THE ROCKS
          Viktor watches, heartened by Zus' natural aggression.
          GERMAN SOLDIERS TAKE COVER behind the overturned truck
          effectively RETURNING FIRE. Several partisans are KILLED.
          ZUS PULLS A POTATO MASHER GRENADE from his belt and RUNS AT
          THE TRUCK in a mad headlong assault.

          ZUS (CONT'D)

          ARRRRGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
          He ROLLS THE GRENADE under the truck and dives away as it
          EXPLODES. The remaining Germans RAISE THEIR HANDS.
          CHEERING PARTISANS leap into the truck, capturing an arsenal
          of rifles and ammo. THE JEWISH FIGHTERS join in the looting.
          Boots, coats, blankets, etc.
          Zus approaches the wounded and captured German prisoners,
          kneeling in surrender, hands behind their necks.
          Without hesitation, he shoots them, point-blank, one after
          another.
          VIKTOR approaches Zus, who salutes.

          VIKTOR
          You are related to Bielski?

          ZUS
          I am a Bielski, too.
          Viktor looks at him appraisingly.

          VIKTOR
          Indeed.
          He walks away. Zus has found a home.

          109 THE RUSSIAN WINTER (MONTAGE- MUSIC OVER) 109
          SNOW covers the camp. A driving wind. Bundled in scarves,
          overcoats and as many layers as they can wear, Bella and
          Chaya break ice in a pot. Tamara takes FROZEN LAUNDRY from
          a line.
          In a bunker, Malbin and Shimon shiver under a shared blanket.
          Women and children stare blankly into space.
          Riva unwraps rags from a man's foot and examines his toes,
          BLACK with frostbite.
          Asael and Tuvia are making their rounds. They pass Aron
          and Rachel who have built a snowman which they top off by
          adding a German helmet with a bullet hole in it.

          109A IN A STORAGE AREA 109A
          Asael shows Tuvia the last few potatoes.

          ASAEL
          There is talk of returning to the 
          ghetto.

          TUVIA
          Madness.

          ASAEL
          They've barely eaten in days. Even
          when our food missions manage to
          get through, there are armed patrols.
          Farmers who once helped us now guard
          their barns with shotguns.
          Tuvia considers for a moment.

          TUVIA
          Send out more missions. And bring
          shotguns.
          Tuvia sets off. In every face he passes, there's misery
          and accusation in the shivering bodies and trembling blue
          lips. Children stare at him with sunken, haunted eyes.

          109AA A MAKESHIFT STABLE 109AA
           Tuvia visits his beautiful horse. He unties him.

          109AB LATER - IN THE FOOD LINE 109AB
           A whisper runs through the group..."meat"..."what kind?"..."
           Where'd it come from?"
           Tuvia watches them eat hungrily.

          109E A STABLE - NIGHT 109E
          Snow falling outside. Several partisans are singing. Zus
          is drinking heavily with Viktor; they take pinches of salt
          with each swallow. Viktor finishes a bottle, tosses it.

          VIKTOR
          Another dead soldier!
          Zus looks at him, bleary-eyed, confused. Viktor explains:

          VIKTOR (CONT'D)
          More dead soldiers than empty
          bottles.

          ZUS
          (slurring his words)
          That is so...Russian.
          He cracks open another bottle and takes a big slug.

          VIKTOR
          At least you drink like one.

          ZUS
          'A Jew can't drink, a Jew can't
          fight.' What is it we are good at,
          Viktor? Dying. That is what we
          are good at.

          yours...

          I know who you mean... The Great
          Tuvia Bielski. Savior of the Jews
          and all around Big Shit.

          VIKTOR
          You compete with him.

          ZUS
          He competes with me.

          VIKTOR
          My older brother and I have the
          same relationship.

          ZUS
          He is a Big Shit also?

          VIKTOR
          A soldier.
          (a long moment)
          He was killed in the first hour of
          the German invasion.
          This sobers them up a bit.

          109F IN THE ZEMYLANKA 109F
          LILKA is shivering, her eyes inward and unfocused.

          TUVIA
          Lilka?

          LILKA
          Sorry, Tuvia. I was...thinking.
          It's nothing.
          He looks at her intently, knowing there's more.

          LILKA (CONT'D)
          ...Every time new people come into
          camp, I keep hoping... even though,
          I know...

          ...I'm sorry.

          TUVIA
          Everyone here has lost someone.
          She looks up at him, helpless to be so revealed.

          LILKA
          You too?

          TUVIA
          (a small nod)

          He takes off his wool coat and puts it around her shoulders.

          LILKA
          No. Today I go on my first food
          mission.
          Tuvia's order has consigned her to this dangerous duty.

          TUVIA
          I will have Asael send someone else.

          LILKA
          No. I must go now. I want to go.
          She is clearly scared but desperate not to show it. He
          reaches into his belt and hands her a revolver.

          TUVIA
          You know how to use this?
          She nods. Leaving, she passes the Lubczanski brothers, who
          are on their way in.

          No? We were told, 'hands off,'
          property of the Commander.
          Tuvia just stares, daring him to continue.

          111 LATER THAT DAY 111
          Tuvia walks past the now-empty stable heading into the woods.
          A voice calls out of the misty snow.

          VOICE

          HALT! WHO GOES THERE--!

          TUVIA
          Lazar. I am coming from camp. The
          danger is from those coming to camp.

          No sign of the food mission?

          LAZAR
          Not yet.
          Tuvia looks anxiously into the deep woods.

          111A MEANWHILE - DEEP IN THE WOODS 111A
          Lilka and Shulman are walking backwards, retracing their
          steps to obscure their footprints in the drifting snow.

          SHULMAN
          We mustn't have any tracks leading
          back to base.
          He loads two sacks of food onto her shoulders.

          SHULMAN (CONT'D)
          Stay on this side of the creek until
          you reach the river then up the
          hill.
          (points the way)
          I'll wait here for the others.
          She nods and trudges on toward camp through waist-deep snow.

          112 BACK IN CAMP - OUTSIDE A MAKESHIFT INFIRMARY 112
          As they head toward a zemylanka, Riva is briefing Tuvia on
          the sick. Every now and then, he glances toward the woods.

          RIVA
          --several cases of pneumonia...
          Also I'm beginning to see signs of
          scurvy. No one's had a vegetable
          in weeks.

          LAZAR
          Tuvia!
          Lazar is dragging a WOUNDED MAN back into camp.

          RIVA 
          Bring him to the infirmary.
          Tuvia glances back toward the woods. Looks at his watch.

          RIVA (CONT'D)
          ...Shulman will look after her.
          He looks up. She looks at him sympathetically. Apparently
           his interest in Lilka isn' quite as secret as he imagines. 

          112A BACK TO THE WOODS 112A
          Exhausted, cold and alone, Lilka is becoming increasingly
          disoriented in a snowy landscape where every tree looks

          alike. She turns in a circle, trying to decide which way
          to go.
          A MANGY DOG appears out of nowhere, its coat matted, its
          ribs showing, a wild look in its eye. It GROWLS ferociously.

          But the dog, as ravenous as she, smells the food and won't
          back down. It inches forward, FOAMING at the mouth.
          Lilka tries to step back but the dog LUNGES, snapping its
          jaws. It's terrifying. She looks desperately for help.
          Suddenly the dog LEAPS at her. She turns away and it rips
          a sack from her shoulder, knocking her down. Viciously it
          begins tearing the sack apart in search of the food within.
          A SHOT RINGS OUT. The dog drops.
          Lilka holds the smoking gun in two hands. Grimly, she pockets
          the weapon, picks up the sack of food, and starts off.
          Reconsidering, she walks back and hoists the dead dog onto
          her shoulder, too. More food.

          Riva bandages Edjelman's head. Tuvia looks at all the sick.

          What's wrong with them all?

          If it's typhus we're in trouble.

          The partisans have ampicillin. But
          they say they need it for themselves.
          In the background Lilka enters, face scratched, blood smeared

          it's in gear when we get back.

          Across the square, the police station looms.

          TUVIA
          You don't have to do this.

          ZUS
          I don't?
          (a bitter laugh)
          What about the typhus?

          So more die. They will anyway.
          A grim smile from Zus. Tuvia is broken up inside.

          ZUS
          I have been given this mission by
          my superior officer.
          He starts to get out the cab. Tuvia reaches into his pocket,
          takes out the mezuzah that once blessed their parents' home.

          TUVIA
          Zus...
          (hands him the mezuzah)
          For luck.
          Zuz pockets it and joins the others creeping into the
          shadows.
          But rather than follow them into the police station, we
          HOLD on Tuvia's face. Suddenly we HEAR The sound of gunfire.
          Then nothing. Ten seconds. More gunfire. Twenty. It is
          excruciating. Thirty. The longest CLOSE-UP in film history.

          117 INTERCUT - FLASHES OF WHAT IS HAPPENING INSIDE... 117
          Ben Zion bursts in and opens fire, killing two policemen.
          Krensky jumps the counter and smashes the transmitter.
          A policeman appears behind them on the stairs and shoots
          Krensky in the back. Ben Zion whirls and kills him.

          117A TUVIA WANTS TO HELP. HE PULLS HIS GUN, UNLOCKS THE DOOR. 117A

          OPENS IT. STOPS. HE HAS PROMISED TO WAIT WITH THE TRUCK.
          Zus, meanwhile, rummages cabinets, looking for ampicillin.

          BEN ZION
          Let's GO!
          In the back room, Zus keeps rummaging. A window EXPLODES.
          Ben Zion is hit. Mortally wounded, he sinks to his knees,
          returning fire as Zus reappears.

          118 TUVIA WATCHES 118

          struggles into the passenger seat, BLEEDING FROM HIS

          Tuvia absorbs the accusation as if taking a punch.

          TUVIA
          So you're a communist now, Zus?
          Zus lays his head back on the seat, closes his eyes.

          121 IN A ZEMYLANKA - LATER THAT DAY 121
          Tuvia is still drinking heavily. He is COUGHING STEADILY,
          his face sweaty with fever.
          The SOUND of angry voices from outside the bunker.

          122 OUTSIDE - IN THE FOOD LINE 122
          Arkady Lubczanski has pulled a knife on Asael, who backs
          away, STUMBLING into a group of bystanders.

          ARKADY
          Next time, I cut off your nose,
          pisher.
          Tuvia emerges from his bunker. He is weaving a bit and his
          words are slurred.

          TUVIA
          Whassa problem, Arkady?

          ARKADY
          Those who risk their lives to bring
          back food deserve a larger portion
          than those who risk nothing.

          ASAEL
          Everyone gets the same portion.

          ARKADY
          Not when you're serving, pisher. I
          see you digging to the bottom of
          the pot for your little forest cutie
          and her parents...

          is stealing he'll face consequences.
          Asael is astonished that Tuvia would go against him in public
          and embarrassed by his public drunkenness.

          ASAEL
          What consequences?
          Others are closely watching this test of Tuvia's authority.

          TUVIA
          Reduced rations for one week.

          ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY DECISION?
          Arkady is tempted to take him on. But he backs down.

          His eyes meet Lilka's. She looks away. Asael takes Tuvia's
          arm and pulls him aside.

          ASAEL
          Tuvia, I would never--

          TUVIA
          Yes. I know.

          ASAEL
          Then why am I to be punished...?
          Tuvia just takes another swallow from his bottle.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Fischer is with them. So is Levine.
          On food missions, they take first
          for themselves and only bring back
          what's left over--
          Tuvia's head is throbbing. He closes his eyes.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          --and they spread rumors, that you
          are power-hungry and corrupt, that
          you take whatever woman you choose--

          Asael looks at him. No longer the brother he once idealized.

          IN THE SHORTER LINE
          Motl, Arkady, Fischer, Levine and a few others are enjoying
          real food. Lazar calls out from the other line.

          Hey, Arkady This isn't soup, it's

          ARKADY
          I will piss on your head and you 
          will say it's raining. Eat it. 
          The rest of Lubczanski's cabal laughs.
          TUVIA emerges from his bunker. The first thing he sees is
          Asael, whose face is BATTERED AND SWOLLEN.

          TUVIA
          What happened?
          Asael just looks over at the food line -- where Arkady has
          grabbed Chaya by the waist -- to the delight of the others.
          Tuvia strides over to them.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          What is this?

          ARKADY
          New policy. Fighters get better

          Against my orders...

          ARKADY
          You are no longer Commander. Sorry.
          Tuvia nods, considering his remark for a moment.

          AND THEN TAKES OUT HIS PISTOL AND SHOOTS ARKADY IN THE CHEST!
          He then turns the gun on Motl and the others -- they
          literally cower in fear. He raises his voice to those
          watching.

          TUVIA
          As long as I am the leader of this
          group, you will obey my commands. 

          THERE WILL BE NO MORE COMPLAINING! 

          NO MORE SITTING! NO MORE DOING 

          NOTHING. ANYONE WANTS TO LEAVE, 
          THEY LEAVE. NOW! The rest work. 
          Every morning we get up and we work. 
          WE WORK. In the snow and the cold 
          and the dark. Tomorrow we begin to 
          build ten new zemylanka, we double 
          the number of food missions. 
          ...We work.
          (looks down at Arkady)
          Take his body into the woods and
          leave it for the wolves.

          subtly move out of his way and whisper after he is gone.

          he was a Partisan. He told me to
          follow him and he took me to this

          Inside me something broke....I wanted

          No. You mustn't tell him!

          Lazar spotted another patrol.
          They're getting closer.
          Tuvia nods. Suddenly, he HEARS a strange sound. An animal?

          Do you hear that?

          134 IN THE WOMEN'S ZEMYLANKA 134

          tired of being the arbiter of other peoples' fate.

          LILKA (CONT'D)
          ...You tell us to hold onto our

          suffering and death. It's our only
          hope.
          Tuvia is undone by her intensity. The very nearness of
          her. The smell of her newly-washed hair. The glow of her
          skin.

          body on the ground. And then they look at each other, their

          Tuvia and Viktor walk into the woods. Zus waits with other
          BODYGUARDS as Asael joins them. Zus wears a Nazi jacket.

          ZUS
          He doesn't look good.

          ASAEL
          I could say the same about you.
          Where'd you get the jacket?

          ZUS
          Let's just say the former owner no
          longer had need of it.
          Zus winks. The other bodyguards stare impassively.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          Embrace me.
          Asael looks confused for a moment, then embraces him.

          ZUS (CONT'D)

          (WHISPERING)
          Hide this.
          (shoves a revolver
          into his pocket)
          Wolnicky stores ammunition for us
          in his barn. There's no guard.
          He slaps Asael fondly on the cheek and rejoins his comrades.

          140 VIKTOR AND TUVIA 140
          sit on a downed tree and converse in Russian, with subtitles:

          VIKTOR
          You found these on the prisoner?
          Tuvia nods. Viktor studies the scout's documents. Tisking.

          TUVIA
          We can't fight an entire division.

          VIKTOR
          The battle on the Eastern Front has
          begun. The more troops we engage
          here, the fewer they have to attack
          the Motherland.

          VIKTOR
          My orders are to take command of
          all partisan operations. You will
          bring the rest of your fighters to
          me.

          TUVIA
          And the others? Old people, women
          and children.

          VIKTOR
          In war there are casualties.

          TUVIA
          And if I refuse?

          VIKTOR
          You are officially a deserter. Do
          you know the policy on dealing with
          deserters?
          Viktor unfolds a paper flyer from his pocket.

          VIKTOR (CONT'D)
          ...The Germans are offering fifty
          thousand marks for information
          leading to your capture.
          (hands it to him)
          Not a very flattering likeness.
          Too Jewish.
          Viktor rejoins his bodyguards, turns back for a last word.

          VIKTOR (CONT'D)
          Have your men in my camp by tonight.
          He walks off. Asael takes the wanted poster from Tuvia.

          ASAEL
          I wouldn't show this around. There
          are some who'd turn you in for less.

          CUT TO:

          141 LATER - A SPOTTER PLANE BUZZES HIGH ABOVE - HUNTING 141
          Down below, Viktor and the Russian partisans have struck
          their tents and hidden beneath the sheltering trees.
          Viktor's gaze follows the plane. He gives an order into a
          field radio. Zus has been listening.

          ZUS
          You want them to find Tuvia's camp.
          Viktor just looks at him.

          ZUS (CONT'D)
          You're deliberately sacrificing
          them so we can remain safe?

          VIKTOR
          No. So we can keep fighting.
          Everyone must sacrifice in the
          struggle.

          ZUS
          Those are my brothers.

          VIKTOR
          I am your brother! He is your
          brother! Comrade Zus. Your Jewish
          sentimentality is heart-warming,
          but counter-revolutionary.
          Zus has secretly known he would hear these words. He grips
          his rifle but holds his tongue.

          BACK TO:

          142 THE SPOTTER PLANE -- FLIES OVER THE BIELSKI CAMP 142
          Tuvia stares up at it. Have they been spotted?
          Shimon is sitting nearby with a group of children. He looks
          pale. His cough is worse. He is very ill.

          SHIMON
          ...but the children of Israel were
          afraid to leave Egypt. Until Moses
          said, 'Do not trust in me, trust in
          God.' He will take care of you'
          (a wrenching cough)
          And so tomorrow we celebrate the
          Passover by sitting around and
          arguing just as we have done for
          centuries.
          Tuvia stares at them, a curious expression on his face.
          Malbin comes to stand beside him.

          MALBIN
          (looking at the plane)
          Did it see us?

          TUVIA
          Tomorrow is Passover. Yes?

          MALBIN
          ...How should I know?

          TUVIA
          Moses. The Exodus.
          Malbin doesn't get it at first.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          --He left before Pharaoh could stop
          them.
          Now Malbin understands. He looks at Shimon.

          MALBIN
          You want to move them all? The
          old, the sick. They'll never make
          it.
          It isn't the first time Tuvia has consigned people to their
          death, and apparently it won't be the last.

          TUVIA
          We leave now. Spread the word.

          143 MOMENTS LATER - THE BIELSKI CAMP 143
          is a blur of activity as everyone mobilizes for evacuation.
          Sacks and cooking equipment is tied onto impromptu packs.
          Asael and Malbin coax the older people into motion--

          ASAEL
          Come, tateh--

          OPPENHEIM
          But my tools--
          The SOUND of approaching aircraft. Tuvia searches the sky.
          Riva pairs each of the elderly with a child. Tamara tucks
          her newborn under her coat.
          The SOUND of the approaching aircraft grows LOUDER. People
          look up, shielding their eyes. Then from out of the sun,
          two ominous silhouettes:

          STUKA DIVE BOMBERS!

          TUVIA

          TAKE COVER!

          144 THE SCREAMING WHISTLE OF THE FIRST BOMBER 144
          panics the crowd.

          Some race into the forest; others are frozen. Tuvia grabs
          people and bodily drags them to cover.
          STRAFING 20MM CANNON chew up the ground.
          Several people are hit before they can reach cover. Lilka
          herds everyone she can into:

          145 A BUNKER 145
          where people crowd in like sardines. Chaya and Riva gather
          children around them. They hear the WHISTLE of an incoming
          shell....BOOM! Dirt from the roof rains down on them.

          146 BOMBS BEGIN TO RAIN DOWN 146
          Dirt and debris everywhere. AN INCENDIARY SHELL HITS high
          in a tree. Its branches burst into flame.
          An hysterical woman leaps out of a bunker and is BLOWN APART.

          147 MEANWHILE - IN VIKTOR'S CAMP 147
          Zus listens helplessly to the distant sound of bombs dropping
          on his brothers.

          148 BACK IN THE BIELSKI CAMP - A DIRECT HIT ON A ZEMYLANKA 148
          It explodes into a million pieces. Wood shrapnel everywhere.
          Where once was a bunker, now there is only a gaping crater.
          Tuvia races into the maelstrom to help the wounded.

          AN EXPLOSION KNOCKS HIM DOWN
          He tries to clear his head but he cannot focus. ALL SOUND
          FADES AWAY to be replaced by a high-pitched hum.

          149 TUVIA'S WORLD IS IN SLOW-MOTION 149
          Falling dirt and debris, tumbling bodies, exploding bunkers --
          a surreal effect.

          150 IN REAL TIME -- THE CAMP IS BEING TORN APART 150
          Cowering in safety, Malbin sees Tuvia lying in the open and
          gathers his courage -- RACING through danger to his side.

          MALBIN
          Are you alright?
          Tuvia shakes his head, points to his ears. He cannot hear.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)

          ARE...YOU...ALRIGHT?
          When Tuvia speaks, his WORDS sound DULL and MUFFLED.

          TUVIA

          MUST...GO!

          MALBIN

          ...WHAT?

          TUVIA

          THE GERMANS...COMING...!
          Malbin looks around, panicked. Asael appears out of the
          smoke, yells at Malbin above the din.

          ASAEL
          Get them out of the bunkers!
          Malbin runs off. Asael helps Tuvia to his feet. A nearby
          explosion SHOWERS THEM with dirt as they CRAWL to safety.
          The world RAMPS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED at a dizzying rate.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          We need to hold them off...until
          the rest are safe.
          Tuvia still can't hear. Asael pantomimes firing a rifle.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)

          ...HOLD...THEM...OFF!
          Tuvia nods, trying to clear the buzzing in his head.

          TUVIA

          ...MACHINE GUN...

          ASAEL
          With Levine and Miriam... There.
          (points out positions)
          Lazar, Rosa, and Schmuel. There
          and there.
          (Tuvia nods)
          And me.
          Tuvia shakes his head, no.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          Yes.
          He runs off. Still clearing his head, Tuvia regains his
          footing -- suddenly realizing the the bombing has stopped.

          But the group's natural reaction is to stay huddled in safety

          MALBIN (CONT'D)

          THE COSSACKS ARE COMING!
          This gets the job done. People begin to crawl out.

          152 OTHERS EMERGE FROM THE BUNKERS 152
          YOUNG PEOPLE holding hands with OLD, PARENTS with CHILDREN
          on their backs. Tuvia urges Lilka and Bella to hurry them
          into the woods.

          153 MEANWHILE -- THE ASSIGNED DEFENDERS, MEN AND WOMEN ALIKE 153
          take up their assigned positions: Levine mans the heavy
          machine gun behind a log; Lazar, Miriam and Rosa in the
          trees.
          Tuvia anxiously waits for the last of the women and children
          to disappear into the forest.

          A SUDDEN SILENCE DESCENDS - EVERYONE LOOKS TO THE SKY
          Tuvia realizes the bombers have broken off their attack.
          He knows the ground troops will soon follow.
          He turns to Asael, grabbing his shoulders.

          TUVIA
          Don't try to fight... Just slow
          them down. Then join us.
          Asael nods. No need for more words. They embrace fiercely.
          Asael pushes Chaya toward Tuvia.

          ASAEL
          Take her.
          She resists, clinging to his arm for a moment.

          TUVIA
          Come.
          He forces her to join him and catch up to the others.

          154 THE CAMP 154
          is eerily quiet as the dust begins to settle. The defenders
          check their weapons with grim efficiency. They are no longer
          inept innocents; they have become warriors.

          155 DEEPER IN THE WOODS 155
          Tuvia catches up with the fleeing group and urges them on.

          156 MOMENTS LATER -- THE DEFENDERS WAIT ANXIOUSLY 156
          We study their faces. Beautiful in their stoic acceptance.

          The defenders RETURN FIRE. Levine fires the machine gun;
          Miriam feeds the belt.

          157 UP AHEAD WITH THE FLEEING GROUP 157
          Tuvia hears small arms fire. He knows what it means.

          158 BACK AT THE CAMP 158
          The rear guard action can't hold out for very long. Tree
          by tree, they begin to fall back.
          Asael fires blindly into the murky shadows. The SOUND of a
          man crying out.
          Then Levine is hit. Miriam pushes him out of the way and
          TAKES OVER. She expertly kills several assault troops who
          appear out of the woods.
          The rest of the attackers TAKE COVER.

          159 WITH THE FLEEING GROUP 159
          Malbin waits anxiously for Tuvia, clutching a map.

          MALBIN
          (struggling to control
          his panic)
          This swamp here...goes...for miles.

          TUVIA
          Show me.

          160 BACK AT THE CAMP 160
          Lazar runs from tree to tree, keeping up a steady stream of
          fire. He is surprisingly brave. Until A GRENADE flies out
          of the woods and lands at his feet, killing him instantly.
          The Assault Troops have begun to outflank them. Asael is
          suddenly in jeopardy. Sara sees the danger.

          MIRIAM

          GO!
          Miriam keeps their ATTACKERS pinned down as the two men
          race for new positions. Then she is hit. She keeps firing
          anyway, her finger locked on the trigger even as she is
          dying.
          More troops begin firing from their flank. Asael has no
          choice but to break off. They race into the woods.

          161 BACK TO THE FLEEING GROUP 161
          Tuvia hears the guns go silent. This, too, has meaning.

          162 A RISE REVEALS THE IMMENSITY OF THE KRASNAYA GORKA SWAMP 162
           Malbin stares at what lies ahead.

          his head)
          ..Asael?
          Malbin shakes his head once more. Asael is not coming back.
          Chaya begins to weep. Riva comforts her.

          SHULMAN
          We've got to keep going!

          BELLA
          The Germans will be here any minute!

          Yes. Fight!

          SHULMAN
          That's crazy!
          Tuvia is in hell. If he waits for Asael, he risks them all
          being caught. Suddenly it all falls apart. Tuvia sinks to
          his knees as if his legs can no longer bear his weight.

          MALBIN
          Tuvia--?
          Tuvia can't speak. He has no more answers. Nothing to
          say. He stares at the impenetrable swamp. The end of the
          line.
          The sudden vacuum of leadership is felt by them all. They
          stare at one another, anxious and rudderless.

          WOMAN (ZOE)
          My father cannot make it.

          RONA
          There are snakes--
          Tamara's newborn is crying. She tries to comfort it. An
          old woman stares at the swamp in terror.

          TUVIA--
          And still Tuvia is silent.
          More arguing. A general MURMUR of dread is rising.
          Malbin goes to kneel beside Shimon, who is covered in sweat --
          undone by the forced march.

          MALBIN (CONT'D)
          What's wrong with him?

          Malbin hears something, looks up.

          FROM HIGH ABOVE - THE SPOTTER PLANE APPEARS
          They have been found. Lilka kneels beside Tuvia.

          She takes his hand silently.

          LILKA

          COME--
          He shakes his head.

          TUVIA
          You have a weapon?
          She shows him her revolver. He checks the clip, then looks
          into her eyes.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Use it on yourself before you let
          them take you.
          She nods gravely. Suddenly a VOICE interrupts.

          VOICE
          Why are we stopping?
          Everyone turns. It's Asael. Back from the dead. He hands
          off a wounded comrade to Riva's care.

          ASAEL

          (WILD-EYED)
          They're coming!
          (to Tuvia)
          Why aren't we moving?
          Tuvia looks up at him, lost. Almost helpless.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          We must keep going!

          TAMARA
          In there?

          RONA
          It is impossible!
          More murmuring. Asael raises his voice.

          ASAEL
          Nothing is impossible! What we
          have done is impossible!
          The murmuring quiets.
          Asael meets Tuvia's eyes. He is literally willing his older
          brother to be strong for them, as he has been, time and
          again.

          ASAEL (CONT'D)
          God will not part these waters. We
          will do it ourselves.

          RONA
          But how?

          Take the rope from your pack.
          (confused; he obeys)
          Now, you....give me your belt.

          SHULMAN
          We don't have enough rope.

          ASAEL
          We'll link arms. Make a chain. A
          human chain.

          MOTL
          What are you talking about?
          Tuvia is deeply moved. His little brother has become a
          man. Once more, he finds his voice.

          TUVIA
          Each person takes care of the other.
          (meeting Asael's eye)
          .Give him your belt.
          Asael nods at Tuvia gratefully. The group is hushed,
          apprehensive. Then:

          ONE MAN
          Removes his belt and offers it to Asael.

          ANOTHER STANDS, HOLDING HIS BELT
          And then another. One by one they offer them. There is
          something quietly heroic in the gesture.
          Tuvia looks at the group, looks away, fighting back emotion.

          TUVIA
          No tracks on land. Get back in.
          It is almost impossible to make any progress. Especially
          when one is weak and malnourished.

          162C IN A DEEP BOG 162C
          The mud sticks to their clothes, faces. Soon they are
          indistinguishable from their surroundings.
          When one person sinks in the muck, it takes three to get
          him back on his feet. The column slows.
          Tuvia gestures for them to keep moving. They can't.
          Literally cannot. He begins to physically push them on.
          Sometimes harshly. Eventually they are moving again.

          CUT TO:

          163 A GHOSTLY LANDSCAPE 163
          Gnarled bare trees shrouded in mist. They trudge forward,
          their expressions wan and empty. Tuvia find Malbin and
          pulls him aside.

          TUVIA

          (WHISPERING)
          How much farther?
          Malbin shrugs his shoulders. Who knows...?

          163A THE WATER IS ALMOST HEAD HIGH 163A
          Parents hoist children onto their shoulders, hold weapons
          overhead as they claw at tall reeds to propel themselves
          forward, step by tortuous step.
          SHIMON clings to a tree. His wracking cough is terrifying
          and he is deathly pale.

          TUVIA
          Come...
          Shimon can't catch his breath, he just shakes his head, no.
          He can't go on. Tuvia half-drags, half-carries him onward.

          They rest, eat what little food is left. A litter carrying
          Shimon is deposited on dry ground. He is barely alive.

          MALBIN
          Is he...?
          Tuvia shakes his head. It's only a matter of time. The
          Spotter Plane drones overhead.

          TUVIA
          Take off your glasses. Reflections.
          Tuvia moves off to check on the others.

          MALBIN
          Shimon, listen to me, the physical
          plane is just an illusion. Only
          the spiritual plane is real.

          SHIMON
          (fighting for breath)
          No. The physical plane is where
          man acts to redeem himself.

          MALBIN
          You've redeemed yourself enough,
          you should shut up now.

          SHIMON
          Look who's talking about shutting
          up... I need to tell you something.

          MALBIN
          (leans closer)
          What is it?

          SHIMON
          You shouldn't think so much. The
          world around you is beautiful.

          MALBIN
          (stunned; looks around)
          This world?

          SHIMON
          Even this one.
          Tuvia has come to sit beside Lilka. She leans into him.

          TUVIA
          We're lost.

          LILKA
          No. ..No.
          She puts her arms around him.

          sit around a campfire at the edge of the swamp.

          FROM NEARBY
          The LIGHTS of their fire can be seen flickering through the
          reeds as the ragged column MOVES SILENTLY past.

          TUVIA
          Not a sound. Pass the word.
          We watch as the ORDER is passed down the line.
          Parents hold hands over their childrens' mouths. Shimon is

          Panchenko and a few others are on horseback. Behind them
          the rest of the Partisans are marching away.
          Zus and the Jewish fighters are on foot, awaiting orders.

          PANCHENKO
          You will hold this crossroads until
          the brigade has completed its
          retreat.
          Zus looks around at the position.

          ZUS
          For how long?
          Panchenko's orders are never to be questioned.

          PANCHENKO
          Until you are ordered to withdraw.

          ZUS
          And if we cannot hold the position?
          Panchenko looks at Gramov, who stands nearby cradling a
          submachine gun.

          PANCHENKO
          Comrade Gramov will enforce
          discipline, if necessary.
          Gramov smiles. The implications are clear: nobody retreats.

          PANCHENKO (CONT'D)
          You have served us well, Comrade.

          ZUS
          (a wintry smile)
          I am so honored, Comrade.
          Panchenko wheels his horse and gallops off. Zus and his
          men take cover in the woods.
          In the distance we can HEAR the unmistakable SOUND of
          approaching armor. Lova kneels beside Zus.

          LOVA
          What are we doing here? Zus?
          Half a mile down the road, A TANK rumbles into view.

          LOVA (CONT'D)
          Tell me. Who are we doing this
          for?
          With a shaking hand, Zus tries to light a Molotov cocktail
          but his matches are wet. He reaches into his pocket for
          more. Instead he finds the mezuzah that was once affixed to
          his family's door.
          As he stares at it, the SOUND of the approaching tank grows
          louder.

          169 ON THE OPPOSITE BANK 169
          Asael pulls people up onto dry ground. They lie there,
          freezing and exhausted. Some cannot control their shivering.

          SHULMAN
          What's next...Sinai?
          Tuvia can't help but laugh. Soon they are all laughing.
          It ripples throughout the group. Joyous. Contagious. An
          overwhelming feeling of relief.
          They are safe.
          Tuvia lies on the ground. All the adrenaline has suddenly
          left his body. Then Aron appears, tugging at his sleeve.
          Shimon is asking for him.
          Tuvia kneels down beside his teacher, whose eyes are closed.
          Malbin is weeping quietly. Who will he argue with?

          SHIMON

          .Tuvia...

          I know... ... But just...in case... .I
          thank....HIM... .and I thank you.
          He closes his eyes.
          It's too much for Tuvia. Hard as he tries, he cannot stop
          the tears from filling his eyes.

          170 SUDDENLY -- UP THE RIVERBANK 170
          Trees begin to FALL OVER -- as if pushed by a dinosaur.

          A PANZER TANK
          emerges onto the banks, less than a quarter-of-mile away.

          ITS TURRET BEGINS TO SWIVEL
          The menacing gun turning in their direction.

          171 THE GROUP IS CAUGHT OUT IN THE OPEN. 171
          THE TANK ROARS FIRE. The first round EXPLODES among them.
          Several are killed.

          TUVIA
          Back to the river!
          He pushes people down. They cling to the banks, cowering.
          THOSE WITH WEAPONS take cover, using the embankment as if
          it were the lip of a trench.
          They RETURN FIRE -- old men, young women, even some children.

          172 A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY ADVANCES 172
          behind the tank, using it as protection.
          Aron kills one. But the Germans are well-trained. They
          direct a withering fire -- forcing the partisans to keep
          their heads below the embankment.

          BUT THE TANK IS UNSTOPPABLE
          It turns its attentions on the riverbank -- its first round
          SAILS OVERHEAD, sending up a huge geyser of water.
          But the next round PLOWS INTO THE EARTH, tearing a huge
          chunk of earth and killing two of the brigade.
          TUVIA grabs a satchel and begins filling it with grenades.
          He throws the satchel over Malbin's head, grabs his arm and
          races, crouching low, beneath the lip of the riverbank.
          Asael provides covering fire. So do Lilka, Chaya and the
          women alongside the men.

          UP AHEAD
          A stand of trees hides Tuvia from view as he climbs out of
          the river and heads into the forest. He pulls Malbin down
          just as A SQUAD OF GERMAN INFANTRY approaches and begins to
          set up a heavy machine gun.

          Tuvia POPS UP behind them, spraying them with his submachine
          gun. He then turns the heavy machine gun on the infantry
          advancing behind the tank -- to devastating effect.
          But now, the tank turns its attention to Tuvia. Its machine
          gun begins to chew up the forest, forcing Tuvia to take
          cover.
          Without pausing to think, Malbin grabs a grenade from the
          satchel and races toward the tank.
          It falls pitifully short, exploding harmlessly as Malbin is
          cut down.

          Bullets tear chunks out of trees as he tries to take cover.

          THE TURRET SWIVELS IN HIS DIRECTION
          It is only a matter of moments before he is dead.

          WHEN SUDDENLY FROM OUT OF THE WOODS
          Zus and the rest of Jewish fighters emerge, firing on the
          run. Without regard for his own life, Zus charges.
          The German infantry is caught in a cross-fire as the Bielski
          brigade climbs out the river, firing wildly.
          Zus guns down the tank commander manning the machine gun
          from the open hatch. Jumps onto the tank and DROPS A GRENADE
          inside. An EXPLOSION of BLACK SMOKE BILLOWS.
          Zus stands up amid the billowing smoke. He sees Tuvia who
          is staring back at him.

          174 BOTH GROUPS MEET - THE DESTROYED TANK SMOLDERS NEARBY 174
          Asael is the first to reach Tuvia, who is carrying the German
          assault machine gun.

          TUVIA
          Only weapons and ammunition! Spread
          the word.
          Tuvia hands him the machine gun.

          ASAEL
          Anything else?
          Tuvia looks at him. Is he fucking with him? Just a little.

          TUVIA
          Go on.
          Lilka is carrying a small child.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)
          Lilka, please help. We've got to

          TUVIA
          Everybody gather your things! We
          have to get out of the open!
          Nearby, Aron removes the machine from the tank and hands it
          to Zus. Bella approaches. Zus embraces her.
          Tuvia seizes one of the German rifles. He yells to Shulman.

          TUVIA (CONT'D)

          Bella the machine gun from the tank and approaches.

          Where is the rest of your unit?

          ZUS
          Good question.

          They walk in silence. Lilka comes to walk beside him,
          resting her head on his shoulder as they walk.
          Tuvia looks up at the shafts of light slanting through the
          towering trees, as if allowing himself to appreciate its
          beauty for the first time.
          Suddenly, he stops, listening, puzzled.

          TUVIA
          Don't you hear it?

          ZUS
          What...?

          TUVIA
          Nothing. Isn't it beautiful?

          And as THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL AWAY he is already hurrying
          to catch up with the others.
          As they all disappear from sight into the sheltering darkness

 Four Feathers Screenplay by Michael Schiffer revised by Hossein Amini based on the book by A.E. Mason EXT. TRAINING GROUND/ WESTMINSTER barracks/ LONDON - Day. Through a veil of dust we see two lines of uniformed cavalry, stretched out across the parade ground. There's a tense silence except for the occasional flourish of hooves. A horseman steps out of each line. LIEUTENANTS HARRY FEVERSHAM and JOHN DURRANCE face each other across the wide expanse. Already we feel the keen sense of competition between them. DURRANCE raises his sabre first. His horse sets off at a slow trot. His troops follow in perfect time. HARRY waits a moment, then raises his own sword. A sea of sabres rises up in response. The two lines approach each other at a steady canter. A smile of anticipation lights up DURRANCE's face. He's a born soldier, enjoying himself. HARRY looks more nervous. He's not as easy as Durrance in the saddle. It's a skill he's acquired over the years rather than been born to. DURRANCE seems to sense Harry's doubt. With a loud whoop he kicks his horse into a gallop and points his sabre forwards. His troops echo his war cry and descend on the opposing line at speed. HARRY checks his troops and responds. The two lines bear down on each other, hooves thundering, sabres pointed. DURRANCE charges recklessly. His eyes are fixed on Harry all the time. HARRY holds his gaze, but doesn't look as sure of himself. He's thinking too much, trying too hard. His horse senses it and slows a fraction. The troops behind him lose their cohesion as they draw level. DURRANCE sees the momentary lapse and waves his men on at full tilt. They pass through HARRY's troops in a perfect line, panicking their mounts, cheering triumphantly. HARRY's formation loses its shape. There's no doubt who's won the drill. DURRANCE wheels his horse around and grins at HARRY through the clouds of dust. CREDITS ROLL. INT. Changing room/ WESTMINSTER BARRACKS - day. Moving through clouds of steam we see the CAVALRY OFFICERS washing themselves in wooden bathtubs. There's a din of voices, soldiers re-living the day's drill, those on Durrance's side still crowing over their victory. DURRANCE walks with his arm around HARRY. With them is another friend, LIEUTENANT TRENCH, a squat bull of a man. DURRANCE ...How many does that make it Harry? harry It's not something I count. DURRANCE How many Trench? harry Trench can't count. TRENCH grabs HARRY in a neck hold. He lets go as he spots another friend of theirs, LIEUTENANT CASTELTON, sitting in a bathtub, staring out. TRENCH sneaks up on CASTELTON, and ducks his head under the water. CASTELTON comes up, spluttering. He reaches for a bar of soap and hurls it after TRENCH. CASTELTON ...Idiot. INT. WILLOUGHBY's rooms/ barracks - day. A fifth friend, LIEUTENANT WILLOUGHBY, stares at himself in the mirror. His hair like his uniform is perfect. There's a loud knocking on his door. trench o/s ...Miss Willoughby, Miss Willoughby we're waiting. WILLOUGHBY finally stops preening himself as he hears his friends picking the lock. He gets up reluctantly, taking one last look at his reflection in the mirror. EXT. BARRACK GATES/ LONDON STREET - DAY. The OFFICERS pour out of the barrack gates in full regimental unifom, a sea of gleaming red. We pick out HARRY, DURRANCE, TRENCH, WILLOUGHBY, and CASTELTON, laughing amongst themselves, taking turns to tease each other, inseperable. INT. carriage/ HAnsom cab/ london streets - day. The friends share a flask of whisky as they sit in the back of the carriage. WILLOUGHBY passes it on without taking a sip. harry Who are you planning to impress tonight? trench (Grinning) Anna What's-her-name. DURRANCE Anna What's-her-name's father more like. Don't think we're going to take you any more seriously when you're promoted. wILLOUGHBY (Quietly confident) We'll see about that. A chorus of mocking 'ooohs' from the others. TRENCH notices CASTLETON staring out of the window. trench What's so interesting about a London street? CASTELTON (Reflecting) Ask me that when we're in Bombay. TRENCH rolls his eyes and turns to DURRANCE. treNCH Is Ethne going to be there? We catch a hint of shyness in DURRANCE at the mention of Ethne's name. DURRANCE I think so. HARRY watches DURRANCE, a little uncomfortably, as if he's holding something back. EXT. PARTY/ india office building/ london - night. CARRIAGES line the entrance to the India Office. INDIAN VALETS in turbans and robes escort the GUESTS to the entrance, holding umbrellas over them. The five friends crowd under a single umbrella. WILLOUGHBY makes sure he's in the middle, he doesn't want to get his uniform wet. TRENCH nudges him into the rain. INT. The Durbar court/ party/ INDIA office - night. Palm trees and fountains dominate the room. The ladies are dressed in ballgowns, the Officers in regimental colours. The full pomp and ceremony of Empire is on display. HARRY, DURRANCE, WILLOUGHBY, CASTELTON and TRENCH have gathered by the bar, a little overawed by the occasion. trench (Admiring the passing women) I'm going to ask someone to dance. willoughby (Admiring the passing Generals) You said that ten minutes ago. trench I'm waiting for Castelton. CASTELTON stares at the ARISTOCRATIC WOMEN, paralysed with shyness. trench (Pouring him another drink) ...Just look dreamy. I'll do the talking. DURRANCE smiles as he listens to them. He turns to HARRY. DURRANCE Can you see Ethne? harry Not yet. HARRY seems uneasy again. We sense there's something on his mind, something he wants to tell Durrance. DURRANCE doesn't pick up on it. He finishes his whisky and looks back into the throng. WILLOUGHBY Harry, your father... HARRY looks away from DURRANCE. He sees his father, GENERAL FEVERSHAM, shaking hands with some COLLEAGUES across the room. INT. seating area/ durbar court/ india office - night. GENERAL FEVERSHAM is deep in conversation with his friend, COLONEL SUTCH, a fellow veteran of the Crimean war. HARRY moves discreetly into their field of vision. GENERAL FEVERSHAM (His face lighting up) Harry... Immediately we feel the bond between father and son. harry (Greeting Colonel Sutch) How are you Colonel? COLONEL SUTCH Fine Harry. Relieved to see a few familiar faces. When are you boys shipping out? harry Next month. COLONEL SUTCH Your father and I served in Bombay. There are worse places they could have sent you. harry Yes Sir. HARRY smiles politely. SUTCH is sensitive enough to see that his mind is on other things. He lets father and son talk. GENERAL FEVERSHAM Is Ethne here? HARRY Not yet. They both smile, as if they share a secret. GENERAL FEVERSHAM reaches out and straightens his son's collar, trying to make him look as presentable as possible. INT. dance area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. TRENCH and CASTELTON are dancing with two GIRLS: TRENCH waltzing boisterously, CASTELTON taking it all very seriously. INT. another area/ durbar court/ india office - night. WILLOUGHBY has found a place amongst a group of SENIOR OFFICERS. He stands next to COLONEL HAMILTON, the Commander of their regiment. COLONEL HAMILTON ...If I had a choice we'd be on our way to the Sudan. Deal with this Dervish uprising once and for all. 2nd colonel You prefer a tour in the Sudan to India Willoughby? wILLOUGHBY I don't know about that Sir, but I agree with Colonel Hamilton, we're going to have to fight the Mahdi sooner or later. WILLOUGHBY trails off, leaving COLONEL HAMILTON to continue. INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. DURRANCE downs another whisky. He looks less sure of himself in this social whirl than he did in the barracks. A few WOMEN cast admiring glances in his direction but he doesn't notice them. His eyes keep searching the crowd for Ethne. INT. seating area/ durbar court/ india office - night. HARRY gazes through the crowd at DURRANCE. DURRANCE catches him staring and raises a glass. The two friends smile at each other. INT. STAIRWAY/ india office - night. A group of late arrivals hurry up the stairs towards the party. ETHNE EUSTACE, is several steps ahead of her father DERMOD, and her friend, CAROLINE ADAIR, a young widow in her 30's. INT. ENTRANCE/ durbar court/ india office - night. ETHNE's eyes search the crowd as soon as she walks through. She stops as she sees DURRANCE at the bar. Her eyes stay on him a moment, but it's only to see if Harry's nearby. When she realises he isn't she looks away. Finally she sees him, standing with GENERAL FEVERSHAM and COLONEL SUTCH. She takes her father DERMOD's hand, and leads him in their direction. INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. CASTELTON and TRENCH are back at the bar, arguing. CASTELTON Your sole purpose in life is to annoy me. trench She couldn't see me. CASTELTON I could see you. I can see you everywhere I look. Pulling those stupid faces at me. willoughby Now Ladies. DURRANCE joins in the laughter but he seems distracted. He takes another gulp of whisky and looks around the crowd. His eyes stop as he sees ETHNE. A smile lights up his face, but it's short lived. Across the courtyard HARRY appears, greeting ETHNE. Their hands touch briefly. The noise fades in DURRANCE's head. He stares in silence. HARRY shakes DERMOD's hand warmly. DERMOD slaps him on the back, as if he's congratulating him. DURRANCE's eyes take in the smallest details now. Even though he can't hear a word, the scene before him reveals itself more and more clearly. COLONEL SUTCH raises his glass. GENERAL FEVERSHAM, DERMOD, and CAROLINE ADAIR respond. HARRY and ETHNE move closer, a little coyly, as if the toast is for them. DURRANCE looks pale. We feel the disappointment in his eyes as he realises what's happened. HARRY's arm moves around Ethne's waist, a libery that can only mean they're engaged. INT. fountain area/ durbar court/ india office - night. HARRY and ETHNE glance at each other tenderly. ETHNE Did you tell them? harry I was waiting for you. ETHNE Not even Jack? harry Not even Jack. The two of them look towards DURRANCE for the first time. INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. DURRANCE looks up as ETHNE and HARRY make their way through the crowd. He gathers himself, and walks towards them, concealing his feelings: DURRANCE Congratulations. harry How did you know? DURRANCE Nothing escapes me Harry... (Kissing ETHNE on both cheeks) I'm delighted for you both. ETHNE Harry wanted to tell you before anyone else. It's my fault. I asked him to wait. DURRANCE I'll still blame him. hARRY (Relieved that his friend's taking it so well) You were the one who introduced us. DURRANCE Did I? I'll be more careful next time. DURRANCE takes HARRY in his arms, slapping him on the back. WILLOUGHBY, TRENCH, and CASTLETON appear behind them, realising something's up. DURRANCE turns to them, beaming: DURRANCE Three guesses for Trench, one for everyone else. The friends let out a cheer as they realise what's happened. They crowd HARRY and ETHNE, congratulating them. INT. DANCE area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. TRENCH sweeps HARRY and ETHNE towards the dancefloor. trench (As if they have to dance in public as a punishment) ...Over there. Where we can see you. And remember you're not married yet. HARRY takes ETHNE in his arms. harry (Smiling ironically) Alone at last. TRENCH claps loudly as they dance. CASTLETON looks embarrassed by his friend. Behind them WILLOUGHBY congratulates DERMOD and GENERAL FEVERSHAM. INT. bar area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. DURRANCE watches the celebrations from the bar. He's smiling to himself, but it's the glazed smile of someone who's forcing himself to be happy. A quiet voice interrupts him: CAROLINE o/s Wonderful news isn't it? DURRANCE turns around to see CAROLINE, Ethne's friend, gazing at him. DURRANCE (Smiling automatically) Yes it is. CAROLINE Had Harry told you? DURRANCE I knew it was just a matter of time. (Changing the conversation) What can I get you to drink? CAROLINE Nothing thank you. DURRANCE (Nervous under her gaze) I'd ask you to dance, only I'm not sure how steady I am on my feet. CAROLINE (With the quiet confidence of an older woman) I'd love to dance. DURRANCE grins sheepishly, at a loss, as he is with most women. INT. DANCE area/ the durbar court/ india office - night. The waltz is in full swing. All the friends are out on the dance floor. TRENCH spins his GIRL around energetically, exchanging glances with other women as they pass. CASTELTON stares into his partner's eyes, already in love. WILLOUGHBY dances with an elderly WOMAN, probably some General's wife. DURRANCE waltzes with CAROLINE, avoiding her meaningful glances, looking over her shoulder for Harry and Ethne. EXT. PARTY/ india office building/ london - night. The rain pours in torrents. HARRY and ETHNE stand in the shadows of the building. Harry tries to kiss her and hold an umbrella over her at the same time. ETHNE What if I hold the umbrella? harry I'd have to kneel. ETHNE Nothing wrong with that. HARRY hands her the umbrella, bending under it. ETHNE (With irony as he kisses her more and more passionately) You're very distant tonight. harrY I'm locked in a barracks room all day. ETHNE What are you going to do in India? harrY Take you with me. ETHNE A Hindu wedding? harry Why not. ETHNE Not on your life. She walks away with the umbrella, leaving him exposed in the rain. ETHNE I want the full works. The Church near my home. A long speech from you. An entire regiment crossing swords. harry (Drenched) Done. ETHNE I don't believe you. HARRY makes a rush and grabs her, eneveloping her in his arms. ETHNE You're soaking wet. HARRY Whose fault is that. ETHNE squirms but loses herself in his embrace. As they start to kiss they're suddenly interrupted by TRENCH's braying voice in the distance. trench o/s (A regimental song) Goodnight, Ladies...goodnight, Ladies...goodnight, Ladies, we hate to see you go... HARRY shakes his head in despair. TRENCH, castelton, willoughby and durrance together o/s Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along...Merrily we roll along, until the morning comes... ETHNE smiles. ETHNE Duty calls. HARRY feels the quiet regret in her voice. harry We've two days leave before we sail. Once I tell them we're engaged I'm sure they'll give me more. ETHNE As long as you promise to make me miserable. Argue with me all the time so I don't miss you a bit. Her lightness is forced. harrY You'll be fine. ETHNE You don't have to reassure me. I'm a soldier's daughter. Everything under control. harry I've never kissed a stiff upper lip before. TRENCH's VOICE bellows out again as they kiss: trench o/s Goodnight, Ethne's...goodnight, Harry's...Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight... HARRRY and ETHNE ignore him, the rain falling all around them. INT. REGIMENTAL HALL/ WESTMINSTER BARRACKS - night. The regimental song turns into a deafening roar. All around the mess hall, OFFICERS are laughing and banging on tables. HARRY and DURRANCE stand on wobbly stools, downing pints of beer. As soon as their glasses are empty they set off down the hall at a sprint. It's an obstacle course. The two friends duck under two long tables, and crawl on their bellies, towards two more glasses. TRENCH and CASTELTON are busy laying bets on who'll win. DURRANCE and HARRY step over a bridge of chairs. They have to find a pint of beer hidden under one of them. DURRANCE finds his first. TRENCH looks at CASTELTON smugly, convinced he's going to win. HARRY and DURRANCE step-walk over two long benches. DURRANCE falls off. HARRY overtakes him. He throws his head back and finishes off another pint. CASTELTON stands up, cheering. HARRY and DURRANCE are level as they reach the last glass. As they start to drink HARRY stops, spluttering. harry This isn't beer, it's whisky. trench Down in one! HARRY drinks again, but he's fallen behind. The pint of whisky disappears down DURRANCE's throat. Grinning, he makes his way towards the finish line. HARRY pours the whisky over his head, conceding defeat. EXT. TRAINING GROUND/ WESTMINSTER barracks/ LONDON - Day. An obstacle course of a different kind. The CAVALRY are training, galloping at full tilt, HARRY and DURRANCE bringing up the front. At the sound of a bugle, they dismount their horses, and sprint towards a row of bayonets. They snatch up the weapons and charge a row of dummies. DRILL INSTRUCTOR ...In. Out. On guard... The blades tear into the dummies, exposing soft leaves and hard wood. DRILL INSTRUCTOR ...Hold the line...and charge... The OFFICERS charge towards a second set of targets. Teeth bared, they drive their bayonets into the stuffed dummies. CASTELTON's blade sticks in a chunk of wood. DRILL INSTRUCTOR ...In and out, Castelton, in and out... CASTELTON pulls in frustation. He can't get the bayonet loose. DRILL INSTRUCTOR ...They're coming at you boy. Rip it out or they'll stick you first. CASTELTON puts his foot on the dummy's head and tries to wrench the blade free. Even though it's only a training exercise, his panic is real. TRENCH slows down as he watches his friend struggling in vain. DRILL INSTRUCTOR ...Move on Trench. Castelton's dead. Enemy spear through his throat. The OFFICERS continue, bayonets thrust forward, leaving the struggling CASTELTON behind. EXT. STABLES/ training ground/ westminster barracks - day. The men are washing up after exercises, dousing themselves with cold water. Everyone's teasing CASTELTON, except for TRENCH. For once he keeps quiet, knowing how hard his friend's taking it. A SEARGENT-MAJOR enters and salutes. SERGEANT-MAJOR Gentlemen... fifteen minutes, in the briefing room. As he leaves, the MEN look at each other curiously. INT. BRIEFING ROOM/ westminster barracks - day. The Officers are assembled. HARRY, DURRANCE, TRENCH, WILLOUGHBY, and CASTELTON, take their places on the wooden benches. As he sits HARRY notices a map of Africa behind Colonel Hamilton. COLONEL HAMILTON ...Gentlemen... (when the room settles down) The 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards have been ordered to forego their posting to India... (Off murmurs of surprise) ...We ship out in three days, to establish a forward garrison in the Sudan... There's a buzz of excitement. COLONEL HAMILTON can hardly contain his smile. He turns to GENERAL HOLMBY: COLONEL HAMILTON ...General Holmby, Sir. GENERAL HOLMBY, a severe looking military man, stands and faces the OFFICERS. Their eyes are lit-up with anticipation, all except Harry, who stares ahead, slowly turning inward. GENERAL HOLMBY ...I'd like to apologise for not giving you men more notice. I know many of you will find it hard to see your families now. Unfortunately we had no alternative... He turns to the map and points out the Sudanese desert. gENERAL HOLMBY ...Three days ago, an army of Egyptian reserves led by General Hicks, was ambushed at Tashgil by the Mahdi's forces. Upoun attack the Egyptians fled, leaving General Hicks and the British Officers with him, to fight a heroic, but in the end hopeless rearguard action. All of them died, sword in hand... HARRY stares out silently, his whole world turned upside down. geNERAL HOLMBY ...I hesitate to call this a mission of vengeance, but the honour of our country is at stake. This Government has finally seen fit to send its own troops to war... There's loud cheering from the men now, regimental pride and bravado covering any trace of nerves. EXT. COURTYARD/ westinster barracks - sunset. The OFFICERS pour out into the courtyard, still exhilirated by the thought of seeing war. We hear TRENCH's voice rising above the others. trench ...I wish I had more than one life to give for my country. Two would make me feel a lot safer. HARRY laughs with the others, hiding his mounting anxiety. INT. HARRY and DURRANCE's ROOM/ BARRACKS - NIGHT. Laughter filters into Harry and Durrance's room. The two of them lie in their beds, watching the embers die out in the fireplace. DURRANCE (Gazing up at the ceiling where the noise is coming from) ...I listen to them laugh, and I can't help wondering which ones won't be coming back. The worse part is I think I even know who they are. haRRY Am I one? DURRANCE Of course not Harry. You're one of the lucky ones. Always have been. HARRY picks up the reference to Ethne but doesn't say anything. More laughter filters through. HARRY stares out in the darkness, tormented. DURRANCE What are you thinking? harry (Hesitating) I'm wondering what a Godforesaken desert in the middle of nowhere has to do with her Majesty the Queen. DURRANCE Ask Willoughby. He's on the Colonel's staff. harry I know what he'll say: 'It's not for us to question.' (A beat) Do you ever ask yourself why you're going? DURRANCE Not for the Queen. I hardly know her. (He smiles softly) Nor for the regiment. There isn't much of a military tradition in my family... (A beat) I suppose I'm going because you're going. You, and Trench, and Castelton, and Willoughby... (A big grin) Not much of a reason I know, but it reassures me. HARRY smiles, but Durrance's words only make him feel more ashamed of the fear he feels inside. harry Is there anything that frightens you, Jack? DURRANCE I'm frightened of not coming back in one piece. Much more than dying. I wouldn't know what to do with myself in a wheel chair. And I couldn't stand to be pitied. He puts the thought out of his head and grins. DURRANCE There's a Church near our house. Next to the pub. Every night at ten the drunks spill out, shouting at the top of their voices. That's where I want to be buried. Where I can hear them. harry Nothing's going to happen to you. DURRANCE It's out of our hands anyway. Might as well sleep easy... DURRANCE rolls on his side. HARRY looks back at the fireplace, as the last embers fade. EXT. REGIMENTAL COURTYARD - dawn. A cold blue light hangs over the barracks. The courtyard is empty, except for a few sentries on duty. Wagons pull in, loaded with supplies. INT. HARRY and DURRANCE's ROOM/ BARRACKS - dawn. HARRY buttons his uniform. He looks as if he hasn't slept. He turns to DURRANCE. His friend is still asleep. HARRY hesitates. He wants to wake him up, and talk, but in the end he turns away, and leaves the room. EXT. regimental COURTYARD - dawn. Harry walks slowly toward the Regimental Office. He glances up at the Regimental flag, flying beside the Union Jack. INT. ADCs' ROOMS/ THE REGIMENTAL OFFICE - dawn. WILLOUGHBY looks up from his desk as HARRY walks in. willoughby (Grinning) ...Harry. You're up early. HARRY smiles awkwardly but doesn't say anything. WILLOUGHBY senses something's wrong. willoughby (Concerned) ...What's the matter? HARRY looks at him for a moment, but then turns to Colonel Hamilton's other AIDE-DE-CAMP. HARRY I'd like to see the Colonel please. WILLOUGHBY stares in confusion. The AIDE-DE-CAMP disappears into the next door office. HARRY still can't bring himself to look at his friend. willoughby Harry, what's wrong?... He's interrupted as the AIDE-DE-CAMP walks back in. AIDE-DE-CAMP The Colonel will see you, sir. harry Thank you. HARRY walks into Hamilton's office. WILLOUGHBY stares after him, bewildered. INT. COLONEL HAMILTON's office - day. COLONEL HAMILTON glances at the letter HARRY has just given him. He stops reading after only a few words. COLONEL HAMILTON What the hell is this? HARRY My papers, sir. I wish to resign my commission. COLONEL HAMILTON doesn't appear to understand. He looks back at the piece of paper, as if he's misread something. COLONEL HAMILTON If it's leave you want, there's a different procedure. Normally I wouldn't consider it in the circumstances, but given you've got engaged... HARRY (Interrupting politely) I don't want any leave Sir. I wish to resign my commission. A long silence. COLONEL HAMILTON calmly puts the letter aside, and returns to his work, ignoring HARRY. harry Sir... COLONEL HAMILTON It's nerves. We all have them. HARRY Sir, I've made up my mind. COLONEL HAMILTON And I'm asking you to reconsider. HARRY I have considered, sir. And I've decided to leave the service. COLONEL HAMILTON Come back to me when you've discussed it with your father. HARRY It's not his decision, sir... HAMILTON explodes, all his repressed fury pouring out. COLONEL HAMILTON I do not accept these "papers," Lieutenant -- and do not accept that one of my men -- the son of a man with whom I was honored to serve -- would walk out on his Regiment -- HARRY Sir -- COLONEL HAMILTON -- on the very eve we're shipping off to war! (holding out the papers) Take these back! HARRY I will not, sir. Dead silence. harry I wish to resign my commission. HAMILTON stares at HARRY for what seems an eternity. He's struggling to make sense of something beyond his comprehension. Slowly he gathers himself and lowers his eyes, looking down at Harry's papers: COLONEL HAMILTON Very well. Then as the coward and disgrace you are, you may take yourself out of my office... (Signing Harry's papers) Please leave the barracks at once. You're belongings will be sent on. Face drained of color, Harry turns and leaves. INT. ADCs' ROOMS/ THE REGIMENTAL OFFICE - dawn. As the door opens, WILLOUGHBY stares at HARRY, speechless. HARRY lowers his eyes and walks on. INT. STAIRWAY/ BARRACKS - DAwn. HARRY walks down the stairway, gripping the bannisters. Two SOLDIERS salute him on their way up, but he doesn't respond. EXT. regimental COURTYARD - dawn. The supply wagons are being unloaded in the courtyard. HARRY walks between more SOLDIERS, his eyes fixed on the barrack gates. The only sound he hears in his head is the gentle flapping of a flag. INT. TRENCH and CASTELTON's ROOM/ BARRACKS - day. CASTELTON is packing his trunk, neat and fastidious, taking his time over every item. TRENCH waits for him impatiently. trench ...Why can't you do this after breakfast? We're not leaving till tonight. CASTELTON ignores him, folding his shirts. TRENCH turns to DURRANCE, exasperated. trench He packs three bibles. Can you believe it? Three bibles... DURRANCE grins. He glances up as WILLOUGHBY enters. DURRANCE ...Field Marshall Willoughby... WILLOUGHBY doesn't smile. He looks ashen faced. DURRANCE ...What's the matter? CASTELTON and TRENCH look up. willoughby It's Harry... (He still can't believe it) He's resigned. trench Resigned what? willoughby (Snapping at Trench) His bloody commission. What do you think?! There's a long silence. No-one knows quite what to say. DURRANCE finally speaks. DURRANCE What did Hamilton do? Refuse him leave? willoughby Hamilton didn't do anything. Harry went to see him of his own accord. Right after they changed our deployment. CASTELTON looks at TRENCH, as the insinuation sinks in. trENCH ...It's just a coincidence. He's having second thoughts about leaving Ethne. willoughby He was happy to leave her behind when we were going to India. No doubts then. DURRANCE (Jumping to Harry's defence) What's that supposed to mean? willoughby You tell me. He resigns his commission the very day we're sent to war. DURRANCE Harry's the best soldier in this regiment. wILLOUGHBY Obviously not when it counts. DURRANCE Why don't you say that to his face. CASTELTON (Intervening) We don't know the circumstances yet. (Reasoning with Willoughby) I think we should give Harry a chance to explain. willoughby (Bitterly) Harry's gone. He left this morning. Whilst you were all asleep. WILLOUGHBY turns away in frustration. He's as upset as the others, but he shows it in anger. TRENCH and CASTELTON look stunned. DURRANCE stares ahead in silence. trench Did he say anything to you, Jack? DURRANCE (Quietly) No. Nothing. DURRANCE remembers his conversation with Harry the previous night. WILLOUGHBY An action like this dishonors the entire Regiment. DURRANCE (Suddenly venting his anger on Willoughby) Will you forget about your bloody Regiment for once! WILLOUGHBY Alright then, it dishonours us! He stares at DURRANCE with conviction. willoughby He was my friend too, Jack... (A beat) ...but a man who isn't prepared to give his life for his friends, isn't a man at all... From the look on their faces, it's clear TRENCH and CASTELTON are beginning to agree with him. wILLOUGHBY This has to be answered. DURRANCE shakes his head, refusing to turn on Harry. He storms out of the room. INT. TRAIN to BINTREE - night. The whistle of a train. HARRY sits in a crowded carriage, looking stiff in his civilian clothes. He glances out of the window, but sees only his own reflection in the glass. EXT. ethne's carriage/ BINTREE - day. ETHNE drives the carriage through the country lanes, overjoyed to see HARRY. ETHNE ...How many days leave have they given you? harry How many days would you like? ETHNE They shouldn't have let you out of their sight. I'm going to kidnap you. harry I thought as much. This doesn't look like the way to your house. ETHNE laughs happily. HARRY can't quite bring himself to tell her yet. INT. village church near ethne's home - day. Dappled light shines in the small stone Church. ETHNE takes HARRY under the arm, and walks him up the aisle. harry Isn't this supposed to be bad luck? ETHNE Seeing me in the wedding dress is bad luck. This is practice. ETHNE looks towards the church benches, as if she's greeting the guests. harrY So I'm playing your father? ETHNE You have to be a little less steady on your feet. He's had a few to drink. harry (Taking slow deliberate steps) How is he? ETHNE Fine. He'll be thrilled to see you. ETHNE lets go of his hand as they reach the altar. She walks around him, and takes his other hand, as if he's the groom now. ETHNE "Do you Harry Feversham -- harrY (Skipping the rest) -- You may kiss the bride." He tries to kiss her. ETHNE (Laughing) You can't jump ahead like that. You have to let me enjoy my wedding. It's your fault the real one isn't for another year. HARRY hesitates, finally seeing his opportunity. harry There's nothing to stop us getting married whenever we like, Ethne. I've handed in my papers. A long silence. ETHNE stares at him, not sure she's understood. ETHNE ...When? harry Yesterday. I'd been thinking about it for a while. ETHNE Why didn't you tell me? Was it because of me? HARRY Because of you. Because of me. I couldn't see the point of continuing. The moment I fell in love with you my career in the army was over. ETHNE I would have supported your career. My mother did the same for my father. It's what's always been expected of me. harry I didn't think it was what you wanted. ETHNE still looks conflicted. ETHNE ...It is my fault Harry. I gave you the wrong impression. I'm really much more stoical than that. It wouldn't have been easy, but I'd have coped. I love you far too much to let a year make a difference. hARRY It wasn't what I wanted for us. (A hint of guilt as he hides the whole truth from her) I love this place. I love you in this place. We'll help your father with the farm. We'll get it going again. We'll begin our lives together. ETHNE is silent, moved by his words. harrY All I want is for you to be happy. ETHNE (The smile slowly returns to her face) I am happy Harry. She rests her head in his arms again. ETHNE As long as you're sure? hARRY Of course I'm sure. He holds her close, kissing her hair, hiding his eyes from her. EXT. courtyard/ ETHNE'S HOME/ BINTREE - DAY DERMOD's dogs leap on HARRY as he jumps off the carriage. HARRY Whoa! You ought to train these beasts Dermod. DERMOD I have. Trained them to scare away prospective son in laws. HARRY and DERMOD hug each other, already like father and son. INT. ENTRANCE/ ETHNE'S COUNTRY HOME - DAY A MAID hands ETHNE some letters and a parcel as she enters the house. HARRY follows her up the stairs. ETHNE Which room do you want? harry The one with the connecting doors. ETHNE You must have imagined that one. INT. the guest room/ ethne's house. day. Sunlight fills the room as HARRY throws open the blinds. He takes a long look at the fields outside. ETHNE (Glancing through her letters) I see you've moved in already. harry Why? ETHNE This one's addressed to you. She holds out the small parcel. HARRY walks over curiously. ETHNE (Teasing him) A secret admirer? harry (Teasing her back) I wonder which one it is. ETHNE I'll open it, thank you. She undoes the wrapping. There's a small white box underneath. She opens the lid. There's nothing inside, except three white feathers, pinned to three visiting cards. ETHNE's about to make a joke when she suddenly sees how pale HARRY looks. ETHNE What is it? (Looking at the feathers again) What does this mean? HARRY (Slowly) That there are some things that can't be hidden. ETHNE (Beginning to look worried) I don't understand. harry These are feathers of cowardice. ETHNE laughs, nervously. ETHNE What a horrible joke. harry It isn't a joke Ethne. They were sent in earnest. ETHNE By whom? Who sent them? (Her anger rising) How dare they!... harry (Reading the cards) Willoughby, Trench, and Castelton. ETHNE You see it is a joke. They're your friends. She looks to HARRY for confirmation. HARRY (All he can say) You're the most important thing to me. ETHNE (Panicked by his tone) Why are you saying that to me now? What is it Harry? harry We were told on Tuesday night that the regiment would be shipping out to the Sudan instead of India. That we'd be seeing war within a week. I handed in my resignation the following morning. There's a long silence as ETHNE takes it in. Like Durrance she won't accept it. ETHNE I don't believe that's why you resigned. You wouldn't have come to me like this. You wouldn't have been able to look me in the eye. HARRY stares at her guiltily, tormented. ETHNE (The tears shining in her eyes) ...I don't believe you. Three white feathers and our world is at an end. It can't be that simple... And still he doesn't answer. ETHNE ...Please Harry... You have to answer these charges... harry (Finally) I can't. All my life I've been following a path that's filled me with dread. I kept going because of the people behind me, and the people beside me, but all I wanted to do was turn and run. I didn't even have the courage to do that until I met you... ETHNE Don't use me as an excuse. harry Ethne -- ETHNE (Pulling away from him) -- This afternoon you told me you left the army because of me. Or at least you made me believe it. Tell me the truth? Would you have resigned if we weren't engaged? There's a long silence. These are the hardest words Harry's ever had to speak. harry Yes. I would have resigned. I wouldn't have gone to war for anything. ETHNE stares at him a moment, then removes her engagement ring from her finger, and holds it out to him. ETHNE I've no right to call you a coward, but you are a liar. Please take this back. HARRY takes the ring without protest. ETHNE turns and walks away. As she leaves she sets the feathers on the table, and closes the door behind her. HARRY listens to her footsteps fade. He walks towards the table. As he looks down he sees four feathers. Ethne has snapped the fourth from her fan. Very carefully, as if they were the most precious objects in the world, HARRY gathers them, his eyes shining with tears. EXT. LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. A burst of noise and colour. Rows of SOLDIERS march by, in perfect squares, proudly wearing their regimental colours. The wharf is lined with PEOPLE, cheering and waving flags, sending them off to inevitable victory. INT. stable deck/ troop ship/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. We can still hear the roar of the crowd outside. CASTELTON is trying to coax his horse into its box. TRENCH, and WILLOUGHBY, and DURRANCE wait for him. trench ...Come on Castelton. Give her a good kick. I want to wave to the ladies... EXT. wharf/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. The CROWD below cheers as the soldiers crowd the rails. EXT. rails/ troop ship/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. TRENCH waves at the crowd as if he were the Queen. CASTELTON is lost in the scale of it all. DURRANCE stares at the tiny figures, wondering if Harry's amongst them. willoughby (Interrupting his thoughts) ...Jack, I wanted to apologise for the other day. My argument wasn't with you. DURRANCE It's forgotten. DURRANCE keeps staring into the crowd below. EXT. wharf/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. HARRY stares up at the ship, a ghost amongst the cheering faces. The SOLDIERS at the rails look like specks, but Harry knows his friends are somewhere up there. EXT. officer's stand/ wharf/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. A line of RETIRED OFFICERS, salute as the vessel finally sets off. Amongst them is GENERAL FEVERSHAM, Harry's father. He stands at attention. EXT. LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. The celebrations over, the CROWD moves away from the docks. HARRY searches through the throng for his father. EXT. HANSOM CABS/ LONDON DOCKS - NIGHT. GENERAL FEVERSHAM and COLONEL SUTCH wait in line for a hansom cab. The two old soldiers look frail in the falling rain. As they're about to climb onto a carriage, a voice calls out: HARRY (o.s.) Father...? The General turns around. His eyes fill with emotion as his son approaches. HARRY ...I need to talk to you, Sir. There's a long silence as GENERAL FEVERSHAM gazes at his son. HARRY looks as if he hasn't slept in days. His eyes are swollen and bloodshot, full of heartbreak and shame. For a moment it seems as if the old man will take him in his arms and comfort him, but instead he averts his eyes, and climbs into the carriage. COLONEL SUTCH looks at HARRY regrettably, as if to say there's nothing he can do. EXT. LONDON STREETS - night. NEWSBOYS follow HARRY home, trying to sell him their newspapers, refusing to take no for an answer. NEWSBOY ...It's a commemorative issue, Sir. War in the Sudan... HARRY buys a paper just to be rid of him, only for another NEWSBOY to take his place. SECOND nEWSBOY Different paper Sir, London Times. commerative issue... INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT - DAY. The sound of guns echoes in the distance. HARRY looks up. His face is unshaven, his eyes glassy from lack of sleep. Another volley sounds outside. HARRY gets off the floor and walks over. As he does so we see the piles of newspapers that have gathered on his floor over the past few weeks. The regimental guns boom outside. HARRY opens the window. He wants to hear them more clearly. He wants to be reminded of his shame. He walks back to the day's newspapers and kneels down amongst the mess. We see headlines of massacres and slaughters, beneath them artist's impressions of the Mahdist atrocities. EXT. LONDON STREETS - day. The NEWSBOYS run from HARRY now, mistaking him for a tramp. He catches up with one of them, forcing some money on him. NEWSBOY (Giving him a paper) British defeat in the Sudan! Hundreds dead!... HARRY flicks through the newspaper anxiously. EXT. war office/ LONDON - day. CROWDS have gathered outside the War Office. The mood has changed from celebration to panic. PEOPLE are stunned by the news of defeat, desperate to hear if their loved ones are alright. SOLDIERS hold back the surging mass. Only small groups are allowed in at a time. INT. corridor/ war office BUILDING/ LONDON - day. HARRY hurries down the corridor towards an area where the names of British casualties have been pinned to a notice board. PEOPLE swarm past him in the other direction. Some of them look relieved, others are overwhelmed by grief. HARRY hurries on, his heart pounding. INT. CASUALTY LIST/ war office BUILDING/ LONDON - day. HARRY pushes through the CROWD of peering heads. As he finally elbows his way to the front he glimpses the long list of casualties. His eyes look through the D's first. Durrance's name isn't there. No sign of Castelton under the C's. HARRY is jostled backwards as he searches for the other names. With a fierce effort he gets to the front again. No Trench under T, no Willoughby under W. They're all safe. HARRY's body slackens with relief. EXT. harry's appartment block/ LONDON STREET - day. HARRY looks drained as he reaches the front door of his building. As he opens it his LANDLADY walks out. landlady There's someone to see you Sir. They're waiting upstairs... HARRY doesn't wait for her to finish. INT. STAIRWAY/ harry's appartment block/ LONDON STREET - day. HARRY bounds up the stairs, expecting to see Ethne. He stops suddenly as he sees COLONEL SUTCH instead, waiting outside his door. He hides his disappointment with an awkward smile. hARRY Colonel Sutch... SUTCH can't help staring at HARRY, shocked by the state he's in. INT. HARRY'S APARTMENT - DAY. HARRY tries to make the room look more presentable, gathering up the newspapers and maps off the floor. He finally stops what he's doing and turns around. harry (Quietly) How is he? COLONEL SUTCH He's been very withdrawn. I've tried to persuade him to leave the house but he's a stubborn man. harrY Will he see me? COLONEL SUTCH I don't think so... (He pauses) ...but if it's money you need he won't cut you off. He hinted as much to me. harry I don't need money, Sir. HARRY turns away. SUTCH looks torn. As a soldier he disapproves of what Harry's done, but as a family friend he can't help feeling sorry for the boy. COLONEL SUTCH You were never cut out for this proffession. harrY (A thin smile) Was it that obvious? COLONEL SUTCH It was to me. Ever since you were a child. I only wish I'd said something to your father. HARRY turns and faces him. harrY (With an almost morbid curiosity) How did you know I didn't have it in me? COLONEL SUTCH What difference does it make? harrY It does to me, Sir. It's all I think about. What makes a man a coward? COLONEL SUTCH (Losing patience) That's enough Harry. Get on a grip on yourself. You're no use to anyone, sitting here all day, driving yourself mad... The outburst seems to release SUTCH from his soldier's reserve. He's all concern now. COLONEL SUTCH What's done, is done. harrY (Quietly) No Sir, it isn't. HARRY reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small white box. He opens it in front of SUTCH. There are four white feathers inside. SUTCH stares at the names on the cards. COLONEL SUTCH (Stunned) Who sent you the fourth? Jack? harrY Ethne. SUTCH looks up in surprise, beginning to realise the full extent of Harry's heartache. COLONEL SUTCH Throw them away. They don't mean a thing. HARRY They do to me, Sir. They're all I have left of my friends. COLONEL SUTCH Harry, this is morbid. harrY I don't mean it that way... (Trying to make him understand) You see, if there was something I could do, something so undeniable...I'm not saying it would change anything, it's too late for that...but if the feathers can be given, then they can be taken back. COLONEL SUTCH Harry, your friends are in Egypt. HARRY Yes Sir. In Alexandria. They transfer to Suakin in a fortnight. SUTCH doesn't understand at first. Then he looks at the newspapers and maps spread out across the floor, and begins to see the method in Harry's madness. COLONEL SUTCH (In disbelief) ...You're a civilian. Even if you find them, there's nothing you can do. harry I'm well aware of my chances. COLONEL SUTCH Then what's the point!? (Staring at him in dismay) You think Ethne will take you back? Is that what you think?! From the look in his eyes it's clear the thought had entered his head. Sutch's words bring him back down to earth. His voice is quieter now, resigned. harrY I don't have any choice... (With a terrible honesty) I'm not sure how much longer I can live with myself, here, like this... COLONEL SUTCH stares at him with pity, seeing the depth of his anguish. haRRY I'm leaving for Egypt tomorrow. COLONEL SUTCH (He realises there's no point trying to dissuade him) Do you want me to tell your father? harry Only if something should happen to me. I'll write and let you know how I am, as often as I can. COLONEL SUTCH What about Ethne? HARRY has to think long and hard about this. The thought of her fills him with sadness. hARRY I'd rather you didn't tell her anything. After all I've put her through the least I can do is let her forget me in peace. COLONEL SUTCH looks moved by his predicament, and impressed by these first, grasping signs of nobility. harrY Maybe I'll come back sooner than I think -- hear the guns booming off the African coast, and take the first ship home. COLONEL SUTCH I doubt it, Harry. COLONEL SUTCH smiles weakly. EXT. HARRY's POV. VIEW OF THE AFRICAN COAST - day. Through the shimmering heat we see the outlines of the African mountains: an arid moonscape, dust clouds blowing in the wind. EXT. port of ALEXANDRIA - DAY. The same veil of dust blows through the crowded port. HARRY covers his eyes. His hair is longer now, his face gaunt and bearded. Clutching his suitcase, he moves through the throng. EXT. streets of ALEXANDRIA - DAY. The alleyways look almost dreamlike through the shimmering heat. It's as if we're in Harry's head, reflecting his state of mind. A crowd of URCHIN BOYS are following his every step, imitating his langorous walk. HARRY doesn't notice them. His gaze is riveted by the sights around him: the MERCHANTS beckoning him into their shops; the BRITISH SOLDIERS on leave, sheltering in the cool hollows of the cafes and whorehouses; the BEGGARS, hunched up against the stone walls, their faces covered with flies. Through the arches of the Souk, a wedding procession appears. The BRIDE and GROOM sit on brightly painted donkeys. All around them WOMEN and CHILDREN clap and shrill. HARRY catches a glimpse of the bride's face. She gazes at him for a moment, then looks away. INT. COLONIAL HOTEL/ ALEXANDRIA - DAY. The colours of the Souk give way to the cool white emptiness of a colonial hotel. ENGLISH GUESTS talk in hushed whispers as EGYPTIAN WAITERS serve them tea. HARRY sits in a corner of the lobby, nursing his drink, observing a group of ENGLISH OFFICERS, laughing amongst themselves. HARRY looks thoughtful, wondering how to approach them. Suddenly he hears a commotion. A drunk BRITISH CORPORAL is escorted out of the hotel by a group of SENIOR OFFICERS. He shouts and swears, but they ignore him, throwing him out of the door. HARRY gets up as he sees his chance. INT. EGYPTIAN bar - brothel/ BAZAAR/ ALEXANDRIA - night. The rhythmic beating of drums. Tattooed WOMEN dance on a makeshift stage, mesmerising the crowd of eager SOLDIERS. HARRY sits with the drunken BRITISH CORPORAL. The man's eyes keep drifting longingly towards the stage, as if he hasn't seen a woman in months. HARRY fills his glass. BRITISH CORPORAL (Resuming their conversation) ...It's all reconnaisance trips. The river's too swollen to move troops in numbers. Her Majesty's army's rotting in Suakin. harry Which other regiments were with you? BRITISH CORPORAL They're all there: the Hussars, the Highlanders, the Grenadiers...Which newspaper did you say you were from? hARRY The London Times. BRITISH CORPORAL You must think I'm a disgrace? 'Sand happy'. That's what those Officers called me. harry How much longer do you think the troops will be held up in Suakin? BRITISH CORPORAL As long as they can if they're lucky. (He finishes his drink) Does the Prime Minister read your paper? harrY I imagine so. BRITISH CORPORAL Then tell him from me we're on a losing wicket here. These bastards aren't scared of anything. If they saw death walking down the street they'd hide in an alleyway and try to pick him off with a stone. How do you fight people like that... He tries to drain the last few drops from his empty glass, then looks over longingly, at the tattooed DANCERS. EXT. SAND STORM/ desert near SUAKIN/ sudan - DAY. Thick gusts of sand blow at us. As the swirling clouds settle we see a group of misshapen figures, huddled together. As they finally rise and start to move, we realise they're BRITISH SOLDIERS, on camels. Amongst the dust caked faces we see TRENCH, CASTELTON, WILLOUGHBY and DURRANCE. EXT. DESERT near SUAKIN/ SUDAN - DAY. The sand storm has cleared, and in its place a harsh desert sun beats down. The COLUMN OF BRITISH SCOUTS trudges forward. DURRANCE rides at the front, looking as if he were born here, eyes alert to every shimmer and nuance. Up ahead he sees a large mound of stones standing out amongst the mud flat. He drives his camel forward. As he approaches he sees that it's a dervish burial mound. Skulls and skeletons are splayed across the rocks. WILLOUGHBY rides up through the ranks and joins him. WILLOUGHBY What do you think? DURRANCE I think they're trying to frighten us off. We should keep pressing forward. WILLOUGHBY offers DURRANCE his water flask. DURRANCE takes a drink. DURRANCE (Pulling a face) It's bloody whisky. wILLOUGHBY (Grinning) My camel drinks the water. EXT. burnt out fortress/ desert - day. As the camels tread their way through the sun baked shingles a ghostly fortress appears on the horizon. The men start loading their rifles instinctively. EXT. courtyard/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. All that's left of the fortress is a grim skeleton. The Union Jack lies ripped to shreds, halfway down its flagpole. The BRITISH SOLDIERS gaze at the destruction. Their camels sense their tension and rear a little in the eerie silence. As ever, TRENCH is the first to break the ice. trench (Jumping off his camel, walking towards the fortress well) I don't know about you lot, but I'm going to grab a drink before Mustapha does. "Mustapha" the camel whinnies as if he's understood every word. The MEN start laughing. DURRANCE The water's probably poisoned. trench (Leading his camel towards the well instead) Mustapha, be my guest. There's more laughter. DURRANCE smiles but his eyes are still alert. Above the fortress tower he sees a flock of birds taking flight, rising up gracefully towards the desert sun. Suddenly amidst the laughter and chatter, one of the SOLDIERS topples off his camel. His FRIENDS laugh: friendS ...Capshaw you dosy bastard... ...Camilla's tired him out... CAPSHAW doesn't move. CASTELTON's the first to realise something's wrong. He jumps off his camel and turns CAPSHAW over. Half the soldier's face has been blown off. Raw bone glistens underneath. CASTELTON rears back in horror. CASTELTON Sniper! Panic erupts. The SOLDIERS leap off their camels, using them as shields. The sniper's bullet rings out and sends one of the animals crashing to the dirt. The men start to run now, seeking shelter in the surrounding hutments. The sniper's gun rings out repeatedly. EXT. HUTMENT/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. DURRANCE and CASTELTON duck into the hutment. DURRANCE ...Keep him pinned. He's up in the tower. CASTELTON unleashes a volley of shots. DURRANCE moves quickly to the other side of the hutment and climbs out of the window. EXT. courtyard/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. The camels circle around themselves in panic. TRENCH weaves his way between the rearing animals, protecting himself from the sniper. A shot rings out and spits dust in his face. trench (Whispering in anger) You bastard... EXT. outer perimeter/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. DURRANCE runs around the back of the fortress, breathing hard. EXT. courtyard/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. A second shot spins TRENCH round, grazing him in the arm. trench (His voice rising) You bastard! A third shot narrowly misses. TRENCH is up and running now, not waiting for the fourth. trench (Shouting like a madman as he charges towards the hutment) You bastard! You bastard! You bastard! EXT. outer perimeter/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. DURRANCE has a clear view on the sniper's tower now. From below he can see the man's rifle edge out, fire, and then withdraw. DURRANCE heads quietly towards the tower stairs. EXT. STAIRS/ SNIPER's TOWER/ burnt out fortress - day. Several of the steps are missing from the rickety stairway. DURRANCE climbs over them as lightly as he can. Up above he can hear the sniper's rifle ringing out. EXT. castelton's HUTMENT/ burnt out fortress/ desert - day. CASTELTON fires another round at the sniper's tower. TRENCH sits on the floor, cursing as he bandages his grazed arm. EXT. SNIPER's TOWER/ burnt out fortress - day. DURRANCE raises his head cautiously. At the tower window he sees the DERVISH SNIPER firing his rifle. DURRANCE hesitates. He could kill the man easily, but it would mean shooting him in the back. He can't bring himself to do it: DURRANCE Drop it! The DERVISH SNIPER stops still. He turns around slowly and looks DURRANCE in the eye. A contemptuous smile flickers across his face. Very slowly, he takes a bullet from his pocket and slips it in the rifle. He doesn't even look at DURRANCE. There's a terrifying, suicidal calm about him. DURRANCE studies his enemy, admiring his utter contempt for death, and then fires two bullets into his head. EXT. TENTS/ THE BRITISH CAMP/ suakin/ sudan - night. Bonfires flicker across the British camp. DURRANCE sits outside his tent, bathed in firelight, watching some BEDU DANCERS performing for the BRITISH TROOPS. He seems far away, as if he's thinking about the day's kill. TRENCH's braying voice snaps him out of his reverie. treNCH (Showing off his wound) Look at this beauty... TRENCH sits down between DURRANCE, CASTELTON, and WILLOUGHBY. trench (Playful) It's true what they say. You haven't lived until you've been shot. CASTELTON It's only a scratch. trench You wouldn't understand. You haven't looked into the abyss. CASTELTON Shut up Trench... DURRANCE joins in the laughter but he still seems far away. wiLLOUGHBY (Noticing) Are you alright, Jack? DURRANCE (Smiling) Couldn't be better. WILLOUGHBY sees the haunted look in his eyes, but doesn't say anything. A SEARGENT-MAJOR interrupts. seRGEANT-MAJOR Lieutenant Durrance, Colonel Hamilton would like to see you in his tent, sir. trench Poor Willoughby, they've passed you over. WILLOUGHBY grabs a handful of sand and throws it at TRENCH. DURRANCE gets up to see what HAMILTON wants. EXT. COLONEL HAMILTON's TENT/ BRITISH CAMP/ suakin - night. COLONEL HAMILTON sits at a fold-up table, eating his dinner by candlelight. He turns around as DURRANCE walks in. He wipes his face with his knapkin and gestures for DURRANCE to sit. COLONEL HAMILTON ...Congratulations, it seems you had another successful day. DURRANCE (Too honest to accept the complement) We killed one Dervish sniper, Sir. COLONEL HAMILTON I'm giving you three weeks leave. DURRANCE looks surprised. DURRANCE I really don't need, or deserve any leave. COLONEL HAMILTON You certainly deserve it, every report I receive singles you out for praise. DURRANCE With your permission, I'd like to stay here with the rest of the regiment. COLONEL HAMILTON Permission refused. DURRANCE is too disciplined a soldier to protest. COLONEL HAMILTON ...Anyway the rest of the regiment is stuck here in Suakin until the Government agrees to send us to Khartoum... (Containing his frustration) You and several other Officers will be going to London, to convince parliament, and more importantly public opinion, that it is necessary to pursue this campaign with the utmost vigour. Do you have any questions? DURRANCE Yes Sir, why me? HAMILTON pauses. Then almost mischievously: COLONEL HAMILTON Because you're a hero. DURRANCE With all due respect Sir, I don't think we've been fighting long enough to have any heroes in this campaign. COLONEL HAMILTON That's my point. It's all about perception. DURRANCE sees there's no point discussing it further. He salutes and turns to leave. COLONEL HAMILTON A question Lieutenant? DURRANCE Yes Sir? COLONEL HAMILTON What is it you like about this place? DURRANCE chooses his words carefully. DURRANCE The freedom Sir. The fact that one is reduced to what one really is. COLONEL HAMILTON smiles softly, wondering if Durrance is insulting him, not giving a damn. EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. A searing white sun hangs over the desert. Somewhere amidst the rolling dunes and floating dust we see a caravan of camels, winding its way through the plateau. EXT. caravan/ desert between egypt and sudan - day. HARRY rides at the front of the caravan with GUSTAVE, a sun blackened french slave-driver. Behind them ride SAADI, his Dinka assistant, and three beautiful DINKA SLAVEGIRLS. gustave ...The British soldiers rent my girls off me for three dhirrams an hour. Well worth the trip to Suakin. HARRY smiles distractedly. His eyes are fixed on the majestic landscape before him, miles and miles of rolling desert. gustave (Recognising the first time awe one feels for the desert) Don't fall in love too quickly. Nothing turns on you like the sand. He looks back at the DINKA SLAVEGIRLS, who are whispering amongst themselves. gustave Shut up!!... (To Saadi) Keep them quiet! What do I pay you for?! SAADI says something to the SLAVEGIRLS in their native Dinka tongue. From the deference in his voice it's clear the women are from a higher caste than him. EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. A breeze blows sand-drifts across the desert floor. As a veil of dust clears, HARRY sees the bones of a camel, forming a perfect skeleton on the floor. gustAVE Bones are a good sign. We must be near a well. EXT. well/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. The skeletons lie thick around the well: six or seven men in Bedu Robes, sprawled within yards of the precious water. gustave (As Harry stares at the bones) What else is there to fight for in a desert. At least it makes sense of war. SAADI hoists some water up in a goatskin canteen. He offers the canteen to GUSTAVE. The French slave-driver is about to take a drink when he hears one of the DINKA SLAVEGIRLS murmuring in her native tongue. He wheels his camel around angrily. gUSTAVE (To Saadi) What did she say? Before SAADI can make an excuse for her, the DINKA SLAVEGIRL starts cursing in her native tongue, her eyes fixed on GUSTAVE. GUSTAVE lashes out with his whip. The SLAVEGIRL's camel rears, throwing her to the floor. GUSTAVE rides towards her, raising his whip, ready to beat her. HARRY's camel suddenly lurches between them. At first it looks like he's lost control of the animal, but as he steadies his mount, it becomes clear he's put himself in Gustave's way. GUSTAVE sneers. With inch perfect skill, he starts to circle HARRY, trying to get a clear view of the girl. With equal skill, HARRY twists his own camel round, keeping her blocked from him at every turn. GUSTAVE grows impatient. He raises his whip, threatening Harry. HARRY doesn't flinch. His eyes are fixed on Gustave the whole time. Finally GUSTAVE backs down, intimidated by the mysterious stranger. He stares at HARRY, half in anger, half in admiration. gustave You ride well. With that he rides his camel back to the well. The DINKA SLAVEGIRL doesn't look at HARRY. She's too proud to acknowledge his help. INT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - night. A howling sandstorm blows outside the cave. The camels screech in the night, terrified by the wind. SAADI and the DINKA GIRLS shelter in the furthest corner of the cave. HARRY and GUSTAVE sit by a flickering fire. gUSTAVE ...What's your secret? Anyone who talks as little as you do must be hiding something? Did you kill a man? HARRY prods the fire, ignoring him. GUSTAVE turns around as he hears SAADI and one of the DINKA GIRLS whispering. guSTAVE Taiser vouz! Silence. GUSTAVE turns back to HARRY, looking pleased with himself. guSTAVE You have to break them. For their own good. They'll only be happy again when they forget what it's like to be free. (He looks at Harry mischievously) It's like a man who's been thrown over by a woman. At first he's defiant, then he's determined, but finally he longs to forget. HARRY gets up and walks to the other side of the cave. He hears GUSTAVE chuckling behind him. gUSTAVE ...Any secrets you have, the desert will find you out. EXT. PASS/ CLIFFS/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - night. A screaming gale howls through the desert pass. INT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - night. It isn't the storm that wakes HARRY up, but the sound of whispering. GUSTAVE is snoring by the fire. HARRY looks past him. He sees SAADI and the DINKA SLAVEGIRL he rescued earlier, lying in each other's arms, making love as quietly as they can. HARRY can't help staring. Their act seems to represent the ultimate defiance, he ultimate affirmation of their freedom. He feels a spark of hope in their hope. SAADI and the DINKA SLAVEGIRL finally come to rest in each other's arms. HARRY listens as they continue to whisper in their native tongue. He's about to close his eyes when suddenly the DINKA SLAVEGIRL gets up. HARRY watches curiously as she walks across the cave. She picks something off the floor. As she walks towards GUSTAVE HARRY suddenly sees that it's a sharp jagged rock. Before HARRY can say anything the girl falls to her knees and buries the rock deep into GUSTAVE's face. Almost simultaneously HARRY feels a sharp crack on the back of his head. He rolls away instinctively, but to no avail. The blows rain down. As he tries to protect his face, HARRY sees SAADI, holding a thick wooden club over him. The club hammers down, splitting Harry's fingers, tearing into his face, knocking any resistance out of him. As he stares up listlessly, HARRY sees SAADI standing over him, ready to finish him off. Suddenly a voice rings out, a woman's voice, calling Saadi off. HARRY's eyes drift away. INT. ARMY/NAVY CLUB - LONDON - day. We see ETHNE's face now, staring out. For a moment we think she's part of Harry's dream, but then the familiar noises of reality fade in, and we realise she's amongst a crowd of OFFICERS and JOURNALISTS, listening to DURRANCE lecturing about the Sudan: DURRANCE (Aware she's in the audience) ...Each moment we delay, we imperil General Gordon's life. The Mahdi is concentrating all his forces on Khartoum. At most the garrison can hold out for a few more weeks... EXT. ARMY/NAVY CLUB - LONDON - day. DURRANCE stands at the club entrance with ETHNE and her friend, CAROLINE ADAIR. ETHNE ...Caroline read about your lecture in the Times. We're both very proud of you. DURRANCE I'm glad you came. DURRANCE tries not to stare at ETHNE too hard. CAROLINE ...We have to be somewhere this afternoon, but if you're free this evening Lieutenant Durrance... DURRANCE I'm afraid I have to give another talk. ETHNE (Suddenly) Would you mind if I didn't come with you Caroline? I don't know the Gilby's all that well... CAROLINE hesitates. We see the reluctance in her eyes, but she's far too dignified to show it. CAROLINE You can do whatever you like, darling. EXT. LONDON/ STREET - day. DURRANCE and ETHNE walk along a crowded street. Passing WOMEN glance admiringly at DURRANCE in his uniform. ETHNE That's six I've counted. DURRANCE Six what? ETHNE Six married women, gawping at you. DURRANCE smiles shyly, wondering if she's flirting with him. INT. tea shop/ LONDON - day. A tinkle of china and cutlery. ETHNE and DURRANCE sit in a tea shop. ETHNE can't help sending up the place. She dabs her lips with her napkin, pretending to be all prim and proper. DURRANCE Do you want to go somewhere else? ETHNE No, it's lovely here. I'm teasing. DURRANCE looks out of place in the surroundings, and nervous around ETHNE. ETHNE (Trying to put him at ease) I want to hear all about the desert? She leans towards him, like a child waiting to hear a tale. DURRANCE isn't sure if she's aware of the effect on him. DURRANCE It grows on you. There's something about all that emptiness that concentrates the mind. ETHNE (Looking into his eyes) On what? DURRANCE (He hesitates) You spend a lot of time thinking about the people you miss -- especially at night -- You have the most vivid dreams, it's hard to believe they're not real... He stops as he sees the sadness in her eyes, reminded of the barrier between them. DURRANCE Have you heard from Harry? ETHNE (A beat) No. Have you? DURRANCE I went to see General Feversham. He refused to discuss it with me. ETHNE I know they had a falling out. She tries to sound casual, but DURRANCE feels how much the thought of Harry still pains her. DURRANCE (Testing her, almost in spite of himself) He's one of the people I think about all the time. ETHNE (Very deliberately) I don't as much as I used to. (Looking up at Durrance) I certainly wasn't until you brought him up. There's a touch of reproach in her eyes, but also something flirtatious. It's as if she's forcing herself to put Durrance above Harry in her thoughts. ETHNE When do you go back? DURRANCE Friday. ETHNE So soon? DURRANCE isn't sure how to read her disappointment. He feels conflicted about Harry, but he can't help being drawn to her. DURRANCE (Awkwardly) Are you sure I can't persuade you to stay in London a few more days? Listen to more of my boring lectures... ETHNE I thought the talk was fascinating. DURRANCE (Steeling himself) I really would like to see you again before I leave. There's something touching about Durrance's shyness: a contradiction between the fearless warrior and the tentative lover. ETHNE feels torn, but she wills herself on: ETHNE (Lightly, but acknowledging his invitation nevertheless) You could always visit us in Bintree. She feels her eyes drifting away from him, but she forces herself to look back, and holds his gaze. INT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. HARRY opens his eyes painfully. His face is still battered and swollen from Saadi's beating. As he picks himself up he sees Gustave's body, lying exactly where the Dinka slavegirl killed him, the jagged rock still embedded in his face. HARRY looks away as he hears a camel whinnying outside. EXT. cave/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. The camel is tied by some rope to a jutting rock, a goatskin canteen slung over its back. HARRY realises the Dinka girl he rescued has left them for him. He looks over the horizon. There's no sign of the Dinkas, only the vast desert waste. EXT. DUNES/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. HARRY urges his camel up the steep slope of a crescent dune. His battered face is burnt raw by the sun, his skin covered in blisters. He looks out hopefully as his camel finally conquers the sandy peak, but all he sees in its place are miles and miles of rolling dunes. EXT. water trough/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. Harry's camel noses its way into a shallow water trough. HARRY almost drops off the animal in his haste to drink. He digs his hands into the mud and cups some of the precious liquid in his palms. It's only after he's drunk that he realises there are dozens of tics, stuck to his arms, and face. EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - night. HARRY shivers in the cold night air, partly from the wind, but also from the fever he's caught off the tics. Hands trembling, he burns the blood gorged insects off his arm with a glowing stick from the camp-fire. EXT. shingles/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. HARRY's camel rears as it treads over the searing shingles. He topples off. Eyes half shut, he grabs the reins, making sure the camel doesn't run off. He takes a knife from his pocket. harry ...I'm sorry, I'm sorry... He cuts a slash in the camel's hide and puts his mouth to it. He sucks up what little blood he can, and rolls the liquid around his mouth. EXT. desert between EGYPT and sudan - night. HARRY talks to himself in the dark. His face is all puffed up with fever, his hair chalked with dust. Above him the stars glimmer, promising another day of relentless sun. EXT. DESERT HILLS/ desert between EGYPT and sudan - day. HARRY lies unconscious on the camel's back, roped to the animal. The CAMEL noses it's way through the desert floor, coming across a few shrubs. It tears them out of the earth, and starts up the hill, in search of more nourishment. HARRY slides precariously down the camel's back. Only the ropes hold him tight. As the camel finally reaches the top we see a vast plateau open up before us. The earth is still desert brown, but there are patches of green now -- and somewhere in the distance, the sky is blackening with rain. EXT. STREETS OF SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night. A torrential downpour floods the narrow streets of Suakin. A group of excited BEGGAR BOYS lead HARRY and his camel through the rain swept alleyways. EXT. LOCAL HOTEL/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night. HARRY lies shivering on a bunk bed, overwhelmed by fever. An ARAB DOCTOR treats his ravaged skin with balm. Behind them the BEGGAR BOYS argue with the ARAB HOTELIER, demanding more money for bringing the foreigner here. ARAB DOCTOR English? HARRY shakes his head no. EXT. marketplace/ STREETS OF SUAKIN/ SUDAN - day. Sunlight dries out the previous night's storm. HARRY wanders through the marketplace, wearing long Bedu robes now, limping from his desert ordeal. PASSERSBY pull away as they see his face, mistaking the open blisters for leprosy. EXT. RIVERBANK NEAR THE BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - day. A crocodile rears out of the water and tears a lump of meat off a hook. It disappears back under the surface, avoiding the trap. There's a cry of disappointment from the riverbank. A group of LOCAL CHILDREN are trying to catch the beast. TRENCH is their leader. CASTELTON smiles at his friend's antics. treNCH ...Don't give up lads. Give the old porker another whack. The BOYS have tied a pig to a stake, outside the water. They beat it with a paddle until it whines. Hearing the noise, the CROCODILE rears its head, and sweeps towards the remaining lump of meat on the hook. TRENCH and the BOYS swarm around the river expectantly. In their excitement they fail to notice the shrouded FIGURE watching them from the distance. It's HARRY, hidden beneath his Bedu robes. He gazes at his two friends longingly. Finally one of the BOYS sees him, and thinking he's a leper, starts throwing stones: sudanese boy Imshi, imshi. The other BOYS join in, yelling insults. TRENCH and CASTELTON pay no attention. They have no idea who it is. HARRY steps back slowly, the pebbles landing at his feet, still gazing at his friends. He knows he doesn't have the courage to face them yet, that it's too soon. INT. HAMILTON's TENT/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night. Colonel Hamilton's tent is lit in torchlight. Dozens of OFFICERS mill about, celebrating their orders to march on Khartoum. A MAJOR FROM ANOTHER REGIMENT ...It's hard to imagine anyone changing the Prime Minister's mind. COLONEL HAMILTON Even he reads the papers. They told him if he didn't send us to Khartoum he'd be indicted for murder... There's laughter all around. Across the tent, DURRANCE stands on his own, feeling out of place. WILLOUGHBY arrives with two drinks. wILLOUGHBY You're quite the hero tonight. DURRANCE The Colonel seems to be taking a fair bit of credit. They smile as they watch COLONEL HAMILTON holding forth. wILLOUGHBY So you had a good time in London? DURRANCE Better than I thought. wILLOUGHBY (Trying to make it sound casual) Did you look up Harry? DURRANCE (Hesitating) Nobody knows where he is. wILLOUGHBY Not even Ethne? DURRANCE (A little put out) Why should she? She's broken off their engagement. WILLOUGHBY notices the edge in his voice but doesn't say anything. DURRANCE feels a touch of guilt, surprised by his own jealous reaction. INT. HARRY's ROOM/ LOCAL HOTEL/ SUAKIN/ SUDAN - night. HARRY studies his face in the mirror: his blisters have dried into tough leathery skin, his eyes are hollow from recent hardships. He whispers to himself in broken Arabic, and dips his fingers into a dark, mud like substance. He applies it to his hair, his beard, and his teeth. EXT. COOLIES/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN - day. Long lines of DESERT AFRICANS have gathered outside the British camp, looking for work as coolies. There are Nuers, Dinkas, Somalis, Ethiopians, all of them wearing different clothes, and speaking different languages. Somewhere amongst them, we see HARRY, disguised in his Bedu robes. He's being examined by a BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR and an EGYPTIAN ORDERLY. BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR Tell him to remove his shirt. HARRY waits for the ORDERLY to translate before he opens his robes. His body is lean and tanned and scarred. BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR (Impressed by his physique) This one's been in the wars. Let me see his teeth. Again HARRY waits for the Arabic translation before he opens his mouth. BRITISH SEARGENT-MAJOR Good bones. Put him on the boats. HARRY is ushered off. As he walks away he hears an argument start up behind him. The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY is protesting to the SEARGENT MAJOR about hiring a fierce looking NUBIAN warrior. EGYPTIAN ORDERLY ...This man comes from a race of slaves. They have blood feuds with everyone. If you arm him it will mean trouble. None of the Egyptian soldiers will serve with him. The NUBIAN stares ahead in silence, expressionless. BRITISH OFFICER Alright, put him on the boats. The NUBIAN falls into line, behind HARRY. EXT. DRILL AREA/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN - day. WILLOUGHBY barks orders at the EGYPTIAN RESERVES, drilling them before departure. DURRANCE, TRENCH, AND CASTELTON walk out of their tent, imitating him. EXT. COOLIES/ BRITISH CAMP/ SUAKIN - day. HARRY watches his friends from afar. He sits amongst the COOLIES, holding out his soup bowl, waiting to be fed. The NUBIAN squats opposite him. HARRY can't help staring at the long white ostrich feather in his hair. The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY arrives and pours a rancid looking gruel in HARRY's bowl. He turns to the NUBIAN. EGYPTIAN ORDERLY (In Arabic) Is this good enough for you slave? The NUBIAN ignores him. The ORDERLY spits in the gruel before handing it to him. The NUBIAN takes it, and calmly downs it in one. The ORDERLY moves on in disgust. The NUBIAN looks at HARRY. HARRY braces himself and swallows the stew. EXT. CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - day. A heavy current rushes through the waters of the Nile. The cataracts are full of treachorous rocks, jutting out in all shapes and sizes. HARRY is force-marched with the other COOLIES, prodded on by the EGYPTIAN OVERSEERS. They drag the British supply boats through the cataract by hand, pulling on huge hemp ropes. In front of HARRY, the NUBIAN is being singled out for punishment. The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY lashes him repeatedly. The NUBIAN keeps pulling, ignoring the stinging pain. He looks back at the ORDERLY as if to say; "Is that all you've got?" EXT. SUPPLY BOAT/ CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - day. A supply boat rushes down a steep incline in the river. TRENCH yells at the top of his voice as the spray hits his face. CASTELTON stands beside him, staring at the banks of the Nile, watching the hundreds of COOLIES, dragging their boat through the cataracts. EXT. COOLIE CAMP/ CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - night. Drum beats fill the night sky. The reflection of the coolies' camp-fires glistens over the black water. Some are singing, others praying, but most lie fast asleep. HARRY sits on his own, warming himself by a fire, his body wracked with pain. As he reflects he hears the gentle tread of feet. He looks up to see the NUBIAN staring at him. The man squats down beside his campfire without asking. nubian (Abou fatma) (In English) My name is Abou Fatma. haRRY (Shaking his head as if he doesn't understand) Bedu. ABOU FATMA I was a scout for General Hicks. harry Arabi -- ABU FATMA suddenly launches into a flurry of fluent Arabic. HARRY stares at him in silence, unable to respond. ABOU FATMA There are many in this camp who would serve the Mahdi. When they find out there is a British spy amongst them, watching them, they will kill him. (Quietly mocking) It won't be long, Bedu. He turns to leave. HARRY hesitates, then: harry Shoukran. ABOU FATMA (Correcting his Arabic) Shoukhran. Their eyes stay on each other a moment. harry (Finally speaking in English) Why do you warn me? ABOU FATMA For money. harry I can't pay you. ABOU FATMA I can't help you. HARRY smiles. He gazes at the mercenaries's powerful features, and the long white feather in his hair. harrY What's the feather for? ABOU FATMA The first time I killed a man. (Pointing to a feather earring in his left ear) Five men. (and an ivory bracelet on his wrist) Ten men. (He takes a beaded necklace out of his pocket) This I will wear soon. I'm a good soldier. I will protect you. HARRY stares at him a moment, then takes out a small box from his pocket. He shows ABOU FATMA the four white feathers inside. ABOU FATMA looks at them, unaware of the irony in Harry's gesture, thinking he's saying he doesn't need help. ABOU FATMA (Gesturing to the welts on Harry's body) Underneath the flesh is white, and weak. Even if the Mahdi's men don't find you out, the whips will. harry I'll pay you one shilling a day. ABOU FATMA No. ABOU FATMA gets up, and walks away. HARRY can't help smiling as he stares after him. EXT. COOLIE CAMP/ CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - day. Screams of agony fill the air. The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY lies in a pool of blood, his belly sliced open, holding his guts in his hands. HARRY stands amongst the gathered crowd, watching horrified, as a BRITISH OFFICER kneels beside the dying man. BRITISH OFFICER Who did this to you? Who did this? The EGYPTIAN ORDERLY tries to speak, but all that comes out of his mouth is a froth of blood. His tongue has been cut out. HARRY looks around the crowd until he sees ABOU FATMA. The Nubian's eyes are expressionless. Around his neck he wears the beaded necklace now. EXT. CATARACTS of the nile/ sudan - day. The white sails of the British supply boats float through the hazy water. On the riverbank HARRY and the hundreds of other COOLIES drag them along. The OVERSEERS glance at ABOU FATMA warily, but none of them dare raise a whip to him now. INT. DURRANCE's tent/ BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - day. We can still hear the noise of the coolies outside. DURRANCE sits at a table, writing a letter. We glimpse the words: 'Dearest Ethne...' He stops as he hears a commotion outside. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - day. DURRANCE walks out of the tent. In the distance he sees a handful of ragged looking BRITISH OFFICERS being helped off their camels. As he stares more closely DURRANCE notices that many of them have terrible wounds. Those that can still walk are lead off to the commander's tent. EXT. general wolsey's tent/ BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - day. GENERAL WOLSEY and COLONEL HAMILTON are bent over a map of the Nile, discussing their progress with their AIDE-DE-CAMPS. WILLOUGHBY looks up as he hears the WOUNDED OFFICERS being led into the tent. He stops as he sees the terrible state they're in. Even WOLSEY and HAMILTON look shocked. GENERAL WOLSELEY (Slowly rising, saluting) What is it? WOUNDED CAPTAIN A letter, sir... from General Gordon. WILLOUGHBY notices one of the WOUNDED OFFICERS has tears in his eyes. GENERAL WOLSELEY What happened to you? WOUNDED CAPTAIN We were ambushed, Sir. More than half our company were killed. GENERAL WOLSELEY See that these men are tended to. AIDE-DE-CAMP Yes, sir. The WOUNDED OFFICERS are led out. WILLOUGHBY, like all the other Aide-de-Camps, looks dazed. GENERAL WOLSEY opens General Gordon's letter, and reads in silence. GENERAL WOLSELEY (Finally looking up at Colonel Hamilton) Gordon says he can only hold out for forty more days. It took eleven for these men to get here. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - night. DURRANCE, WILLOUGHBY, CASTELTON, and TRENCH sit around a camp fire, trying to ignore the hideous cries of the wounded British soldiers coming from the hospital tent. wILLOUGHBY (Recounting what he's heard) ...Wolsey's going to split the force. A River Column's going to continue down the Nile, whilst a Desert Column joins up with regiment at Abou Clea, and makes a dash for Khartoum. The piercing screams start up again. trench Don't tell me, we've drawn the short straw. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - day. Silence hangs over the British camp. The COOLIES are lined up under the scorching sun. The EGYPTIAN OVERSEERS walk past them, selecting some for the desert march, others for the river march. HARRY stands next to ABOU FATMA. Across the camp he can see DURRANCE, TRENCH, CASTELTON, and WILLOUGHBY, preparing their camels for the overland trek. haRRY (Whispering to Abou Fatma) I need to travel with the desert detachment. ABOU FATMA Two Shillings. HARRY nods. The EGYPTIAN OVERSEER finally reaches them. EGYPTIAN OVERSEER (To Abou Fatma, in Arabic) We'll keep you on the river. ABOU FATMA (A calm, menacing look in his eyes) With you? The EGYPTIAN OVERSEER hesitates, remembering what happened to his friend: EGYPTIAN OVERSEER (Gesturing to the desert column instead) Over there. HARRY falls into line behind ABOU FATMA. The EGYPTIAN OVERSEER doesn't seem to care. He's too relieved to be rid of the Nubian. EXT. DESERT COLUMN/ BRITISH CAMP/ CATARACTS - day. The Desert Column has assembled, fourteen hundred strong. SERGEANt at arms Column... FOR-WARD... march! DURRANCE, TRENCH, CASTELTON, and WILLOUGHBY, ride off at the head of the column. Behind them, the COOLIES carry heavy loads, HARRY and ABOU FATMA bringing up the rear. EXT. DESERT lanscape/ sudan - day. A region of jutting cliffs and giant rock formations. The Desert column rides through a narrow pass. DURRANCE's eyes are fixed on the ridges above them, any one of which could be hiding a Dervish sniper or scout. At the back of the column, HARRY's equally alert. He looks across the cliff walls. Suddenly he notices one of the COOLIES in front of him, listening intently to a high pitched whine coming from a nearby gorge. HARRY studies the man. He's a powerfully built NUER TRIBESMAN, yellow streaks running down his long black hair. Every time he hears the distinctive noise, he looks up, concentrating. HARRY edges closer to ABOU FATMA: harry (Indicating the whining) Do you recognise that sound? ABOU FATMA Mountain goats. HARRY doesn't look convinced. He stares at the NUER TRIBESMAN, walking ahead of them, glancing up from his heavy load every time he hears the distinctive cry. EXT. OPEN DESERT/ sudan - day. The wind blows gusts of sand into the camels' eyes. DURRANCE stares through the shimmering heatwaves. DURRANCE There's a sandstorm coming. COLONEL HAMILTON looks at the clear blue sky, seeing nothing to indicate a storm, but trusting Durrance's instincts. EXT. DESERT CAMP - night. HARRY and the other COOLIES gather sticks and desert shrubs, building a makeshift wall around the camp. The wind has picked up, blowing thick gusts of sand in their faces. As they work in the darkness and the dust, HARRY hears the whining sound he heard earlier. It's quieter now, but closer. ABOU FATMA hears it too. harry It's coming from inside the camp. They look around, but the dust obscures everything. The whining starts up again. HARRY concentrates until he thinks he knows where it's coming from. He checks to make sure the ORDERLIES aren't watching them, and then signals for ABOU FATMA to follow him. EXT. EDGE OF THE DESERT CAMP - night. Through the drifting clouds of sand we see a FIGURE crouching near the camp perimeter. It's the NUER TRIBESMAN Harry noticed earlier. Every time the wind picks up he calls out to the surrounding cliffs in a high piched whine. HARRY and ABOU FATMA watch him from behind a wagon. ABOU FATMA draws a knife from his boot. haRRY We need to find out who he's signalling. ABOU FATMA replaces the knife reluctantly, and points to a makeshift corrall where the camels are gathered. INT. TENT/ DESERT CAMP - night. The tent flaps blow in the storm. TRENCH, CASTELTON, and WILLOUGHBY shelter inside, sharing a bottle of whisky. DURRANCE sits apart from the others, reading a letter. treNCH Is that the same letter you read over and over again, or do you get a different one each day? DURRANCE (He can't help a smile) It's the same one, but it's twenty pages long. wILLOUGHBY He writes them to himself. Go on Jack, read us a line. DURRANCE Read your own. trench Don't be so coy, you're amongst friends. Grins all around. DURRANCE looks at letter and tempts them with a single line: DURRANCE "...I often think about our walks by the river..." He stops enigmatically to a chorus of protest: tRENCH More, more... DURRANCE hesitates, reluctant to break the confidence of a letter, but anxious to broach the subject with his friends. DURRANCE (Reading more quietly) "...Your letter surprised and delighted me...If I appear indecisive it's because I'm thinking of both of us...In the meantime I hope the length of my reply gives you some assurance of how very much I care about you..." DURRANCE lowers the letter and looks at his friends. treNCH So who's the lucky lady? DURRANCE (After a moment) Ethne...I've asked her to marry me...You probably gathered that from the letter. There's a long silence. Astonishment. Then suddenly TRENCH raises his glass and roars. treNCH Congratulations. wILLOUGHBY That's fantastic Jack. DURRANCE She hasn't said yes. trench Of course she will: "I hope the length of this reply gives you some idea of how much I bloody love you." DURRANCE "How much I care about you." treNCH Same thing. TRENCH fills his glass to the brim. DURRANCE laughs, relieved that his friends have taken it so well. It's only as he drinks that he catches a hint of disapproval in CASTELTON's eyes. CASTELTON raises his glass, trying to hide his feelings, but DURRANCE sees through him. The moment is interrupted by loud shouting outside: BRITISH CORPORAL o/s ...Something's up with the camels. CASTELTON I'll go. CASTELTON looks relieved to leave the tent, worried that his conflicting emotions will betray him. DURRANCE stares after him, not entirely free of the memory of Harry himself. EXT. DESERT CAMP - night. CASTELTON follows the CORPORAL through the windswept camp. Up ahead they can hear the camels screeching. CASTELTON covers his eyes from the dust. Suddenly he sees the silhouettes of two RIDERS, charging out of the corral. One of them stops and stares at him momentarily. CASTELTON (He can't see the man's face clearly, but his outline seems hauntingly familiar) Harry? The RIDER turns and charges out of the camp. The CORPORAL blows a whistle, reaching for his gun, firing after them. CASTELTON stares at the disappearing figures, wondering if what he saw was real, or a figment of his troubled conscience. EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE DESERT CAMP - night. HARRY and ABOU FATMA ride up a steep hill, shots ringing out behind them. EXT. RIDGE ABOVE THE DESERT CAMP - night. As the sands sweep past we see the Mahdi's scouts for the first time: four NUER TRIBESMEN, standing on a ridge, looking down on the British campfires below. As they hear the shots, they turn away from the cliffside, and mount their camels. EXT. VIEW FROM A CLIFF/ DESERT - day. The sand storm is still blowing, obscuring the sun. In the distance, the tiny figures of the NUER SCOUTS, can be seen riding across the arid sandscape. HARRY and ABOU FATMA watch them from the cliffs, and set off in pursuit. EXT. ridge/ VIEW on NUER's campfire/ DESERT - night. The Nuer's camp-fire glows far below on the valley floor. HARRY and ABOU FATMA have built their own fire in a crevice on the cliff wall, hidden from view. HARRY's eyes are fixed on the Nuer scouts, ABOU FATMA's are fixed on him. ABOU FATMA Why would a British spy be hiding from his own people? HARRY looks up at the Nubian, realising he can't keep up the pretence any longer. hARRY Because I'm not a spy. ABOU FATMA You're a deserter? harry (A long pause) Something like that. I was sent to fight, and I ran away. ABOU FATMA considers this for a moment. ABOU FATMA All soldiers run away. Only the good ones return. HARRY smiles. harry Shoukran. ABOU FATMA Shoukhran. HARRY looks away. Down below the Nuer's camp fire goes out. EXT. OPEN DESERT - night. The moonlight colors the dunes in blues and greens. HARRY and ABOU FATMA follow the Nuers' tracks through the virgin sands. EXT. crest of A hill/ OPEN DESERT - day. The sunrise casts a blood red light over the horizon. The four NUER SCOUTS appear on the crest of a hill. We see them clearly now, their long black hair streaked yellow, their faces painted ghostly white. They survey the land beneath them and gallop off. EXT. THE same HILL/ desert - day. ABOU FATMA and HARRY walk their camels quietly up the hill, following the Nuers' hoofprints. As they reach the top of the dune a vast plateau opens up beneath them. They see the NUER SCOUTS, riding along a winding trade route. At the end of the desert road stands a huge fortress. ABOU FATMA That is Abou Clea. A British fort. HARRY stares after the Nuer scouts, wondering why they're heading back into a British stronghold. The four riders merge into one of the caravans that dot the landscape. EXT. CARAVAN/ TRADE ROUTE TO ABOU CLEA - day. A long line of DINKA REFUGEES walk alongside one of caravans, begging for food. HARRY and ABOU FATMA ride near the back, their faces hidden by their Djellabas. EXT. FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. A village of tents has spread around the fortress walls. More STARVING REFUGEES clamour at the gates. HARRY gazes up at the garrison walls. BRITISH SENTRIES can be glimpsed high up. The fortress gates creak open to let the caravan through. HARRY lowers his eyes as he rides past the guards. EXT. courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. As he looks up again, HARRY suddenly feels a rush of panic. The fortress courtyard is filled with DERVISH WARRIORS. There are no British faces anywhere. HARRY glimpses a familiar red uniform, but as he stares more closely, his relief turns to horror. The British uniform is stained with blood. Wearing it is a fierce looking DERVISH WARRIOR with long braided hair. HARRY looks back at the ramparts. All the soldiers he thought were British sentries are in fact Dervish warriors, wearing the bloody uniforms of their victims. As he turns around, HARRY sees the worst sight of all. Hanging from scaffolds, are the chalk white bodies of the real British soldiers. HARRY is shaken out of his horror by a sharp hissing sound. ABOU FATMA glares at him to keep calm. DERVISH WARRIORS grab hold of their camels, and lead them with the rest of the caravan towards the stables. INT. stables/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. HARRY and ABOU FATMA tether their camels. Behind them the DERVISH WARRIORS unload the caravan's shipment of rifles. ABOU FATMA (Whispering to Harry) Follow me out. HARRY nods, still in shock. ABOU FATMA turns around and heads out of the stables, unchallenged. EXT. courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. HARRY follows ABOU FATMA through the crowded courtyard. His eyes are drawn to the torchlit faces all around him. The Mahdi's army is made up of dozens of different tribes: some in glowing war paint, others marked with ritual scars, wearing the dried viscera of their victims around their necks. The Dervishes' eyes seem to follow HARRY wherever he goes, staring out at him through their slit Djellabas. Suddenly HARRY feels a pair of hands grab him. He wheels around to see a huge DERVISH CAPTAIN towering over him. DERVISH CAPTAIN (In Arabic, studying Harry's features) Come with me. ABOU FATMA (In Arabic) Our caravan is waiting outside. DERVISH CAPTAIN (Waving Abou Fatma away) Imshi! ABOU FATMA murmurs something to HARRY in his native Nubian tongue, slipping in the English words: 'I'll find you.' DERVISH CAPTAIN (To Harry, in Arabic) Follow me! EXT. gallows/ courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. HARRY's heart is pounding as he walks back through the hellish courtyard. He isn't sure if the DERVISH CAPTAIN has realised he's British. It's only as he points HARRY towards the gallows that he realises the predicament he's in. DERVISH CAPTAIN (In Arabic; gesturing to a mound of British dead) Over there. HARRY hesitates, then walks over to the pile of British corpses, convinced he's going to be shot amongst them. DERVISH CAPTAIN (In Arabic; gesturing to the uniforms) Find one that fits. HARRY stares at him, then slowly begins to understand. He's been picked out as a pale looking Arab, one that might pass as a British officer from a distance. As he looks around he sees other DESERT ARABS, grinning at him, wearing their own blood stained British uniforms. HARRY kneels beside the slaughtered British soldiers. One of them still has his pipe stuffed between his teeth. As HARRY stares at the obscenity, his fear slowly turns to anger. With trembling fingers he unbuttons the dead man's jacket. As he slips the bloodstained British uniform over his shoulders we begin to see the change in his eyes. EXT. ABOU FATMA/ courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. ABOU FATMA wanders amongst the Dervish army, begging for alms, searching for Harry. Finally he spots him at the far end of the courtyard, sitting amongst the other DERVISH WARRIORS IN BRITISH UNIFORMS. EXT. HARRY/ courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. ABOU FATMA grovels at the feet of the DERVISHES, before he approaches HARRY. ABOU FATMA (In Arabic) Alms for the poor. HARRY turns around. His eyes are distant. He looks back at the spot he was staring at before. At first ABOU FATMA thinks he's in shock, but then he sees what HARRY's looking at. Across the courtyard stands a large tent, surrounded by flags. Waiting outside, are the four NUER SCOUTS. ABOU FATMA (Beginning to see his intent) We have to leave. harry Wait for me at the gates. (As Abou Fatma starts to protest) Imshi. The other DERVISHES look at ABOU FATMA threateningly. ABOU FATMA gets up and walks away reluctantly. Across the courtyard, the NUER SPIES have been ushered into the tent. INT. WAR COUNCIL tent/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. The MAHDI, a tall, gaunt, warrior in desert robes, listens to the NUER SCOUTS in silence. As they notify him of the British advance, he starts to draw a battle plan on the tent's sandy floor. His LIEUTENANTS move closer to see what he's planning. INT. WAR COUNCIL tent/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. Outside the tent more DERVISH WARRIORS have gathered to catch a glimpse of their revered leader. HARRY is amongst them. He stares at the white clad figures within. Suddenly he feels a pair of eyes on him. He turns to see the DERVISH CAPTAIN who stopped him earlier, watching him intently. HARRY moves off. The DERVISH CAPTAIN stares after him suspiciously. EXT. gates/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. ABOU FATMA waits anxiously outside the fortress gates. The hordes of STARVING BEGGARS are pushed back as a troop of DERVISH WARRIORS ride out, carrying the naked bodies of the British dead. ABOU FATMA stares after them, wondering what's going on. EXT. HARRY/ courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. HARRY looks behind him. Through the milling crowd he sees the DERVISH CAPTAIN, still following him. His heart pounding, HARRY heads towards the stables, trying to give him the slip. EXT. HARRY/ STABLES/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. Camels kick and snort in the stable. HARRY crouches down. Through the animals' legs he sees the DERVISH CAPTAIN enter. Suddenly the DERVISH CAPTAIN shouts at the top of his voice. The camels scatter, leaving HARRY exposed. The DERVISH CAPTAIN stares at him menacingly. HARRY bows, and starts to walk towards him, in supplication. His hand slips behind his back, groping for the knife that's hidden there. The DERVISH CAPTAIN barks at him to stay where he is. As he steps backwards, HARRY suddenly charges, and drives the dagger deep into his gut. The DERVISH CAPTAIN screams, but all that comes out is a terrible hissing sound. HARRY clamps his hand over the CAPTAIN's mouth and bends his head backwards. As they tumble to the ground, HARRY twists the knife in deeper. The Dervish bites down in agony, drawing a stream of blood from Harry's knuckles. HARRY rams his fist deeper into the man's throat, choking him slowly. Meanwhile his knife hand tears its way out of the Dervish's gut, and plunges back into his thigh. The CAPTAIN's eyes water in pain and fear. HARRY stares at him, crushing his spirit with his own unflinching gaze. As he feels the man's grip weaken, he pulls away sharply, and swings the knife down with all his force. The blade sticks in the DERVISH CAPTAIN's chest, sending his eyes spinning out of focus, forcing a rush of blood out of his mouth. HARRY watches in horror, as the man's eyes roll around, desperately trying to find their focus, then stop still. He feels his enemy's dying breath on his face, and hears a horrible sucking sound, as he withdraws the knife. HARRY's arm is elbow deep in gore. He turns away and tries to retch, but nothing comes out. He stays like that for a moment, bent over the bloody sand, contemplating what he's just done. Finally he gathers himself, grabs the dead man by the ankles, and drags him further into the stable. EXT. courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. HARRY brushes past the crowds of DERVISH WARRIORS, his eyes fixed on the fortress gates ahead. He's only a few yards away, when a DERVISH SENTRY calls out: DERVISH SENTRY (In Arabic) The gates are closed. HARRY stares at him dangerously. For an instant it looks like another fight may ensue, but then a calming voice calls out: ABOU FATMA (In Arabic) Let him give us alms. It will bring you both fortune in battle. ABOU FATMA sticks his hands through the fortress gates, along with the hundreds of other BEGGARS outside. HARRY begins to understand. He pulls out some coins from his robes, and approaches the BEGGARS. harry (Whispering to Abou Fatma, as he hands out alms) Go to the British camp. Tell them they're going to be ambushed. Tell them they have to change their route. It's a trap... ABOU FATMA stares into HARRY's eyes, seeing the change that's come over them. EXT. BRITISH COLUMN/ DESERT VALLEY - day. DURRANCE rides at the front of the column. He suddenly stops, and stares ahead in horror. All across the desert floor he sees the marble white bodies of dead British soldiers. Wild dogs chew at their remains. The whole of the column seems frozen for a moment. Then TRENCH suddenly breaks rank, and charges the animals, screaming at the top of his voice, dispersing them with his whip. EXT. tents/ THE SLOPE OF A HILL/ DESERT VALLEY - day. The column has set up camp until their dead comrades are buried. The OFFICERS dig the graves themselves, watched by the COOLIES now. A CORPORAL approaches WILLOUGHBY and salutes. CORPORAL A native to see you, sir. He says he has some intelligence regarding the route we're on. ABOU FATMA is pushed forward by the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. wILLOUGHBY (Eyeing him suspiciously) What intelligence? ABOU FATMA You must leave this area. The EGYPTIAN silences him with a slap to the head. EGYPTIAN CORPORAL This man is lying. He's a deserter. He stole the camels -- ABOU FATMA -- I went to Abu Klea. The Mahdi's forces have captured your garrison. They will attack you in this place. TRENCH and DURRANCE have arrived to see what's happening. TRENCH stares at ABOU FATMA menacingly, still seething over the treatment of the British dead. wILLOUGHBY (To Trench and Durrance) This is their idea of misinformation. (Toying with Abou Fatma) Who told you this? ABOU FATMA A British Officer. wILLOUGHBY (Mockingly) A General no doubt. What else did he tell you? ABOU FATMA (With equal disdain) That you wouldn't believe me. WILLOUGHBY smiles at the Nubian's gall, but TRENCH explodes at his insolence. trench (Grabbing Abou Fatma by the neck) I'll show you a British Officer... (Forcing him on his knees in front of one of the butchered corpses) This is a British Officer!... (Rubbing Abou Fatma's face into a patch of bloodstained sand) This is a British officer's blood. Lick it up! Every bloody drop!... The NUBIAN spins around, ready to strike. TRENCH draws his knife, daring him to make a move. ABOU FATMA (Controlling his anger) The Muslims bury their dead. Even the enemy dead. These bodies have been left here for a reason. To keep you here. To hold you up. wILLOUGHBY (Ignoring him) Take him away. Find out why he was sent here. Do whatever you have to do. The SOLDIERS disperse. Only DURRANCE stays where he is, thinking about the Nubian's warning. EXT. courtyard/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - day. A chant of 'Allah Akbar' rises over the fortress walls. Hundreds of WARRIORS kneel and pray in unison. HARRY does the same. EXT. tent/ BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. ABOU FATMA is on his knees, manacled to a tent pole. EGYPTIAN CORPORAL (In Arabic) ...You work for the Mahdi! ABOU FATMA (In English) I fought the Mahdi... The EGYPTIAN lashes him with a bull-whip. EGYPTIAN CORPORAL (In Arabic) ...Who sent you?! ABOU FATMA A British Officer. The EGYPTIAN starts whipping Abou Fatma again, ready to kill him. DURRANCE finally intervenes. DURRANCE That's enough... He kneels down beside ABOU FATMA, staring into his eyes. ABOU FATMA sees no mercy in his gaze, but at least there's a glimmer of curiosity. DURRANCE Why would you want to help us? ABOU FATMA The Mahdi is allied with slave traders... (pause) My family were taken prisoners and sold as slaves. DURRANCE considers Abou Fatma's answer. There's something about it that has a ring of truth. DURRANCE glances at the BRITISH SOLDIERS, digging graves in the open desert, and then stares up at the surrounding hills. EXT. gates/ FORTRESS OF ABOU CLEA - night. Through the clouds of dust we see the first of the Mahdi's army riding out -- ghostly DINKA WARRIORS, naked from head to foot, caked in white ash. Behind then come the NUERS, long streaked hair trailing in the wind, faces painted the colors of a nightmare. The HADENDOA spearmen follow, blood-stained feathers in their hair, banging on their calf skin drums. Last of all come the DERVISH RIDERS IN THEIR BLOODSTAINED BRITISH UNIFORMS. HARRY rides at the heart of the demonic troop, his eyes filled with dread. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. DURRANCE surveys the surrounding hills. CASTELTON watches him curiously. CASTELTON What is it Jack? DURRANCE's eyes stare at the horizon, still not sure. EXT. HILLS beyond ABOU CLEA - day. At a signal from the MAHDI, his army splits in two, some following the green flags, others the black. HARRY and the DERVISH RIDERS IN BRITISH UNIFORMS are told to wait. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. WILLOUGHBY and TRENCH join CASTELTON and DURRANCE at the edge of the camp. DURRANCE is still staring at the ridges above them. As they listen, they can just make out a distant rumble of thunder. DURRANCE looks up. The sky is perfectly blue. DURRANCE We'd better get the Gatling gun out. EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. NUER SCOUTS, daubed in yellow camouflage, appear out of the rocks. INT. CASTELTON's TENT/ BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. CASTELTON walks into his tent and searches through his belongings. He finds one of his bibles, kisses it for luck, and slips it in his jacket pocket. As he turns around he sees TRENCH grinning at him. trench You haven't got a spare one have you vicar? EXT. SLOPE OF A HILL/ DESERT - day. Through thick gusts of sand we see hundreds of bare feet and horses' hooves moving up the desert slope. The sand at their feet pours back down the slope like an avalanche. EXT. DURRANCE's POV/ CREST OF the HILL/ DESERT - day. As DURRANCE gazes up, the first of the Mahdi's army appear on the crest of the hill, a handful of SCOUTS, riding back and forth, judging the British numbers. As the SCOUTS disappear, a curtain of dust rises up behind them. As it settles, DURRANCE sees thousands of figures appear along the length of the hill, their green banners fluttering in the wind. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. Across the camp, CASTELTON and TRENCH stare mesmerised, as another huge army appears on the opposite hill. This time their banners are black. Panicked voices ring out. officers' voices Form a square...Form a square... EXT. CREST OF the HILL/ view of the british camp - day. The Mahdi's armies stare down from the wind whipped slopes, thousands of expressionless faces, listening to the British bugles shrilling down below. From above we see the British fighting square taking shape: red and khaki colors separating into units, the bright blue of the Egyptian uniforms forming a larger wall around the perimeter. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. The GRENADIER GUARDS are crouched in formation, rifles ready. TRENCH changes position, asking one of the other SOLDIERS to swap with him, settling down next to CASTELTON. trench You can't get rid of me that easily. CASTELTON's fear seems to vanish in an instant. EXT. GREEN FLAGGED ARMY/ CREST OF the HILL - day. A cry of Allah Akbar is picked up by thousands all along the ridge, turning into a deafening roar as the Green flagged Army finally charges. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. DURRANCE moves along the lines of RIFLEMEN, barking intructions over the wind. DURRANCE Fire at the horses. Fire at will. A volley of shots answers his call. EXT. GREEN FLAGGED ARMY/ slope OF the HILL - day. Enemy horses and riders collapse, sliding down the slopes. EXT. DESERT VALLEY - day. The British camp is shrouded in gunsmoke, flashes of orange light bursting through, the Gatling gun wreaking havoc. EXT. GREEN FLAGGED ARMY/ FOOT OF THE HILL - day. Through the sand drifts, we see the camels' hooves rearing up, bursts of arterial blood as the bullets tear into their hide. The HADENDOA SPEARMEN leap over the walls of torn flesh, and charge the British lines in a suicidal frenzy. EXT. CASTELTON/ BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. CASTELTON aims at the PAINTED WARRIORS. Every time he fires, someone falls. Every time he kills, he murmurs a prayer. TRENCH bites his lip so hard, his mouth fills with blood. He spits it out as he drops yet another man. EXT. BLACK FLAGGED ARMY/ FOOT OF THE HILL - day. The DERVISH HORDES keep coming, clambering over the bodies of their dead. EXT. HARRY/ ENTRANCE TO THE VALLEY - day. Far away, at the entrance to the valley, HARRY can hear the screams of the wounded and dying. Even the DERVISH WARRIORS seem apprehensive. Only the MAHDI is calm, waiting for his moment. He raises his hand, and signals for the horsemen in British uniforms to charge. EXT. DURRANCE/ BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. Enemy bullets crackle past DURRANCE's head, but he doesn't seem to notice. Through the smoke and dust he sees hundreds of enemy dead, lying in blood smeared heaps. The Dervish onslaught is less sustained now. The occasional STRAGGLER appears out of the haze and is blown away by a burst of gunfire. Suddenly DURRANCE hears the sound of a bugle. EXT. CASTELTON/ BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. CASTELTON and TRENCH hear the bugle too. They stop firing as they see the remnants of the black flagged army retreating into the hills. There's a moments confusion and then a roar of celebration around the camp as the SOLDIERS see a troop of BRITISH CAVALRY, riding out of the sand clouds towards them. EXT. HARRY/ DESERT VALLEY - day. HARRY stares in horror as he sees the BRITISH SOLDIERS, breaking rank, waving at the charging RIDERS, thinking they're British cavalry. HARRY kicks his horse and tries to weave his way out of the charging horde. EXT. BRITISH CAMP/ DESERT VALLEY - day. The BRITISH SOLDIERS gather at the camp perimeter to welcome the approaching cavalry. EXT. HARRY/ DESERT VALLEY - day. HARRY charges through the red uniformed Dervish ranks, ignoring orders to stay in line. At a signal from one of the DERVISH LIEUTENANTS, the horsemen raise their bows. EXT. DURRANCE/ BRITISH CAMP - day. DURRANCE stares curiously as a flicker of sunlight streaks across the heads of the distant riders. He watches the approaching dust cloud, wondering why it's coming at them so fast. Slowly he begins to make out the first figures. Something about them isn't right. Their uniforms hang too loosely. They ride too far apart. He reaches for his gun. EXT. HARRY/ DESERT VALLEY - day. HARRY breaks through the Dervish line. Behind him he hears the mounted ARCHERS stringing their bows. He drives his horse forwards, towards a lone BRITISH SOLDIER, standing on the camp perimeter. EXT. DURRANCE/ BRITISH CAMP - day. DURRANCE sees the lone rider, charging towards him, yelling at the top of his voice. He can't see the man's face or hear his voice, but he's convinced these riders are the enemy now. EXT. DURRANCE/ BRITISH CAMP - day. HARRY sees DURRANCE aiming his rifle, a moment too late. The gunshot sends his horse spinning to the ground. He feels the weight of the animal pin him down. As he looks up he sees the DERVISH RIDERS riding over him, letting their arrows fly. EXT. BRITISH CAMP - day. The sky above flickers with light as the arrows catch the sun. The steel shafts hurtle down, plunging into exposed eyes and throats. All around him CASTELTON sees SOLDIERS totter and fall, arrows sticking out of them like quills. He pulls out his revolver and starts firing at the onrushing horses. EXT. DERVISH RIDERS/ PERIMETER OF BRITISH CAMP - day. The DERVISH lances skewer the BRITISH SOLDIERS as they try to run back to their lines. Some of the DERVISH RIDERS dismount and finish them off with their daggers, and their bare hands. EXT. GREEN FLAGGED ARMY/ slope OF the HILL - day. On the desert slopes, the retreating green flagged army wheels around and charges back into the fray. EXT. WILLOUGHBY/ BRITISH CAMP - day. WILLOUGHBY looks up, and sees the Mahdi's black flagged army, also swarming back towards the British ranks. EXT. HARRY/ PERIMETER OF BRITISH CAMP - day. HARRY is still pinned. He slits the dead horse's belly with his knife, and slides his leg under the gore. He gets to his feet and runs towards the fighting, desperate to reach his friends. EXT. DURRANCE/ BRITISH CAMP - day. DUURANCE yells at the top of his voice: DURRANCE Close the square! Close the square! CASTELTON and TRENCH fire at the charging horses. As they fall, the other GRENADIERS take courage, and rush at their RIDERS, bringing them down in a volley of gunfire. The SOLDIERS clamber over the dead bodies and link up with the rest of their Square. EXT. HARRY/ PERIMETER OF BRITISH CAMP - day. HARRY can't see the British square reshaping, but he can see its rippling effect all along the DERVISH line. He cuts his way through like a beserker. Whatever doubts and fears his civilized self felt his primitive self now rejects. He fights like a man possessed. EXT. grenadiers/ british square - day. The BRITISH line pulls back, firing and reloading as it retreats. EXT. WILLOUGHBY/ PERIMETER OF BRITISH CAMP - day. WILLOUGHBY stares in horror at the bloodshed all around him. Through the hellish smoke he sees ABOU FATMA, still tied to the whipping post, staring at him in silent reproach. EXT. grenadiers/ british square - day. CASTELTON fires into the enemy ranks. He's out of ammunition. TRENCH is retreating with the other GRENADIERS. He sees his friend stalling and yells: trench Get back! Get behind us! CASTELTON doesn't hear him. His parade ground training is taking over. He lowers the rifle and fixes a bayonet on it. EXT. HARRY/ AMONGST THE CHARGING DERVISHES - day. Through the swarming ranks, HARRY glimpses CASTELTON, standing alone with his bayonet poised. He calls out as well. EXT. CASTELTON - day. CASTELTON hears nothing but the pounding of his own heart. The DERVISH WARRIORS swarm towards him. He disembowels the first WARRIOR, then swings his bayonet around to meet the next. The DERVISH impales himself, right up to his rib cage. CASTELTON tries to pull his blade free, but the bayonet is locked in bone now. EXT. TRENCH/ RETREATING grenadiers/ british square - day. TRENCH stares in horror as he realises what's happened. The noises around him seem to fade as he gazes at CASTELTON, straining as he did in the training ground, trying to pull the bayonet free. EXT. HARRY/ AMONGST THE CHARGING DERVISHES - day. HARRY runs as fast as he can, trampling over the dead soldiers and horses that litter the desert floor. EXT. CASTELTON/ ISOLATED FROM THE SQUARE - day. CASTELTON tries to loosen the blade, but it's no use. He looks up to see a storm of painted faces, rushing towards him, spears pointed at his eyes and guts. Somewhere amongst the screaming horde, he glimpses a familiar face, calling out. A smile flickers across his face. He mouths the words 'Harry' as the first of the Dervish spears sinks into his heart. EXT. TRENCH/ RETREATING grenadiers/ british square - day. TRENCH screams in agony as he sees CASTELTON disappear. He charges out of the retreating British line, swinging at everything in his way, breaking skulls and shattering bone. He's only yards away from CASTELTON when a blow to the back of the head sends him sprawling. EXT. DURRANCE/ RETREATING grenadiers/ british square - day. DURRANCE charges out of the British square as he sees his friends fall, firing round after round into the enemy ranks. Every time his gun empties, he picks up another from a dead soldier, and keeps going. EXT. HARRY/ AMONGST THE DERVISHES - day. HARRY drops to his knees, next to CASTELTON's body, protecting his friend's corpse from further abuse. EXT. TRENCH/ AMONGST THE DERVISHES - day. TRENCH stares up at the nightmare faces crowding all around him. The butt of a spear cracks open his head, reducing everything to a terrifying silence. He feels a sea of hands, reaching down, tearing his uniform, lifting him in the air. EXT. DURRANCE/ WALKING TOWARDS THE DERVISHES - day. DURRANCE charges towards the enemy, firing into their massed ranks, oblivious to any danger. One of his guns jams. DURRANCE keeps pressing the trigger. The gun suddenly backfires and blows up in his face. EXT. HARRY/ AMONGST THE DERVISHES - day. HARRY sees DURRANCE fall. He gets up and runs through the enemy ranks, pretending to be one of them. He leaps on DURRANCE as he tries to get up, pinning him to the ground, stopping him getting himself killed. The unsuspecting DERVISH WARRIORS sweep past them, towards their next victims. HARRY keeps DURRANCE pinned, until the enemy hordes disappear. Only then does he stand up. He looks down at his friend. DURRANCE doesn't seem to recognise him. At first HARRY thinks it's the sunlight blinding him, but then he sees the powder burns around DURRANCE's eyes. DURRANCE gropes around. He starts crawling away on his hand and knees. He crawls right into a mud bath of Dervish dead. He rears back in horror, and lets out a little cry of panic. HARRY slowly begins to understand. He watches in anguish, as his friend claws at his eyes, trying to rub the blindness out of them, his whimpers of panic turning into howls of agony. INT. BRITISH HOSPITAL SHIP/ ALEXANDRIA - day. The screams of the wounded BRITISH SOLDIERS echo all around the hospital ship. CAPTAIN CALDER, the Regimental surgeon, stands over Durrance's bed. DURRANCE stares out, blindly. CAPTAIN CALDER ...You ought to see a specialist once we're back. DURRANCE Is it part of your treatment to offer false hope? CAPTAIN CALDER Only for some. (reaching in his pocket) This came for you. He hands over a letter. DURRANCE sticks it in his top pocket. DURRANCE I'll read it later. (Grinning as he realises Calder hasn't caught the joke) If you wouldn't mind, Doctor... He hands the letter back to CALDER to read for him. CAPTAIN CALDER (Glancing over it) ..."Dear James, I hold in my heart all you have written me"... (He looks up) I feel a little awkward reading this... DURRANCE Don't. There's something strident in Durrance's voice, a brittleness that hides the insecurity inside. CALDER continues: CALDER ..."Knowing you as I do, and convinced as I am of your affections, I wish to go back on my previous fears. I'm writing now, to let you know how grateful I am to have you in my life -- and to say, with all my heart, how much I wish to be in yours...With all my love, Ethne." CALDER, lowers the letter, quietly moved. CAPTAIN CALDER Congratulations... DURRANCE stares out quietly. DURRANCE I knew a man once who went blind, a good man too, before...A year after you wouldn't have recognised him. He was the most selfish, exacting, egotistical human being you could ever meet. I wouldn't wish him on anyone... He smiles ironically, hiding the heartbreak inside. DURRANCE The one thing I want most in this life, finally comes to me when I can no longer accept it. INT. DRAWING ROOM/ CAROLINE's house/ OUTSIDE LONDON - day. ETHNE stares out of the drawing room window, waiting. Her friend CAROLINE sits at a table, pretending to be absorbed in her book, listening just as intently. There's the jingle of a carriage outside. CAROLINE That's him. ETHNE It isn't stopping. EXT. DURRANCE's carriage/ STREET/ caroline's house - day. DURRANCE stares ahead as the carriage passes Caroline's house. DURRANCE (To the Driver) Drive around once...Describe the entrance to me... INT. DRAWING ROOM/ caroline's house - day. ETHNE turns away from the window. CAROLINE Maybe you should have gone to the station to meet him. ETHNE He might have thought I was going because I imagined he was helpless. I don't want him to feel like that. There's a quiet resolve in Ethne's voice, as if she's been mulling over her future life with Durrance. The doorbell rings. ETHNE That must be him. CAROLINE gets up to answer the door. ETHNE walks to the window. Her movements are nervous, her eyes tense. The door finally opens. DURRANCE walks in, alone. As soon as ETHNE leaves the window he turns around and looks straight at her. ETHNE (Startled) It isn't true then, you can see... DURRANCE (Gently) It's perfectly true. I can't see a thing. ETHNE stops, feeling guilty. DURRANCE You moved from the window, that's how I knew. ETHNE I hardly made a noise. DURRANCE No, but the window was open. The noise outside grew louder. She tries to answer his smile. ETHNE Let me get you some tea, and then we can talk. DURRANCE (Sensing her tension) Yes, we have a lot to talk about. ETHNE's hand trembles as she pours the tea. DURRANCE interprets every sound. She picks up the cup and walks over with a smile, holding it out for him. DURRANCE I hate to sound humble, but I don't trust myself with a cup of tea yet. ETHNE feels stupid again. She sets the cup down on a table. DURRANCE (Gently) You're not bound, you know. There's a pause. ETHNE knows exactly what he means. ETHNE Bound by what? DURRANCE I wouldn't dream of holding you to your letter. Or a committment you made to a different man. ETHNE stares at him in surprise, and then in quiet admiration. ETHNE You're not a different man. DURRANCE I don't say it begrudgingly. I'm not being particularly noble or heroic either. It's something I've thought about long and hard -- ETHNE Jack -- DURRANCE -- Please hear me out... (With difficulty) I'm thinking of myself as much as you. I have to learn to accept what's happened. I have to learn to respect the person I've become. The only way to do that is to start again. ETHNE Why does it have to be without me? Her words make him hesitate. DURRANCE Because if I was with you, I'd spend every moment wondering how you really felt about me. ETHNE If you don't know how I feel about you, then that's a good reason to call off our wedding. Your blindness isn't. She stares at him, determined. DURRANCE looks touched by her devotion, but still doesn't feel worthy of her love. DURRANCE It has to be more than mere obligation Ethne, or even friendship. It has to be more than that... ETHNE suddenly reaches out and touches his face. DURRANCE stops as he feels her fingers. He's lost for a moment, unsure of himself. ETHNE leans forward and kisses him, tenderly at first, but then more and more passionately, proving herself to him, proving herself to herself. DURRANCE kisses her back, close to tears. EXT. PATIO/ caroline's house - DAY. A sharp clatter of hooves. DURRANCE rides his horse with the help of a GROOM, his face fixed in concentration. ETHNE and CAROLINE watch him from the patio. ETHNE (Gazing at him proudly) He seems to need his eyes less and less each day. It's incredible. Nothing escapes him. Sometimes I think he reads me like a book. CAROLINE You no longer have your face to screen your thoughts. ETHNE doesn't notice the edge in her voice. She's lost in her own thoughts. DURRANCE climbs off his horse and strides towards them, looking pleased with himself. DURRANCE (Wrapping Ethne in his arms) You smell wonderful. ETHNE And you smell like a horse. Go wash. ETHNE keeps smiling, even after DURRANCE has gone. CAROLINE watches her friend quietly, fighting the jealousy she feels within. A voice interrupts their separate thoughts: GARDENER o/s (Calling out) ...Someone to see you Miss Eustace. ETHNE looks up to see a UNIFORMED OFFICER, standing with the GARDENER, by the maze. She gets up curiously. EXT. garden/ maze/ caroline's house - day. As ETHNE approaches the soldier she suddenly stops, recognising him. It's WILLOUGHBY. wILLOUGHBY I went all the way to Bintree to find you. Your father told me you were here. I'm sorry I came unannounced, I needed to talk to you alone... ETHNE doesn't reply or return his smile. WILLOUGHBY seems to read her thoughts. wILLOUGHBY I understand how you feel, Ethne. All I can say is that we never set out to hurt you. What happened was between us and Harry, not the two of you. ETHNE (Coldly) What do you want, Tom? WILLOUGHBY hesitates, bracing himself. wILLOUGHBY ...I've seen Harry. In Suakin. He asked me to give you these... He holds out TWO SOILED WHITE FEATHERS. ETHNE stares at them, unable to speak, her whole world turned upside down. wILLOUGHBY He risked his life to save our regiment. He fought as if he'd been born to it. I've come to tell you I've withdrawn my accusation of cowardice against him, along with Castelton's. ETHNE (All she cares about) Is Harry dead? wILLOUGHBY He was fine when I saw him. He'd changed a great deal but he was in good health. ETHNE Changed how? wILLOUGHBY I didn't spend much time with him. I don't know what else to tell you Ethne. ETHNE Tell me everything Tom. Please... (Imploringly) If by your own admission you've hurt me, then I have a right to know. EXT. PATIO/ caroline'S house - DAY. CAROLINE watches curiously from the patio, as ETHNE and the mysterious Officer, walk into the maze, deep in conversation. EXT. maze/ caroline's house - day. ETHNE and WILLOUGHBY sit on a bench in the garden maze. wILLOUGHBY ...Nothing prepared us for what happened. We were two miles short of Abou Klea when we were ambushed. We managed to hold off the enemy, but at a terrible cost. A few days later Khartoum fell and the whole expedition was called off... TIME DISSOLVE BACK TO: EXT. BRITISH EVACUATION CAMP - ON NILE - DAY. WOUNDED BRITISH SOLDIERS lie in the open sun, moaning in agony, plagued by clouds of dust and swarms of flies. WILLOUGHBY stares out, numb to their suffering, thinking only of his own lost friends. The SHADOW OF A MAN in Arab robes hovers over him. WILLOUGHBY ...Get lost!... The ARAB doesn't move. wILLOUGHBY (Looking up furiously) Didn't you bloody hear me! Get lost!... WILLOUGHBY suddenly stops. He stares at the Arab as if in a dream. wILLOUGHBY ...Harry?... HARRY stares back at him through his black desert robes. HARRY I sent a man to you with a warning from Abou Klea. You wouldn't listen to him. You had him tortured instead. The confusion and shock bring pent-up tears to WILLOUGHBY's eyes. HARRY He told you a British Officer had sent him. Even if you didn't believe him, what would it have cost to take precautions. What more did I have to do? wILLOUGHBY (As the horror sinks in) I didn't know Harry...I didn't know it was you... (He still can't believe his eyes) ...What are you doing here in God's name?...What are you doing?... HARRY opens his hand to reveal a soiled white feather. WILLOUGHBY stares at it, in bewilderment at first,then slowly beginning to understand. wILLOUGHBY (He gazes at the feather as if it's the symbol of his own disgrace now) Give me the others. Give them to me. harry They're not yours to take back. WILLOUGHBY looks up at him through his tears. There's no condemnation in Harry's eyes, but no sympathy either. His experiences have changed him, turned him into a harder man. EXT. maze/ caroline's house - day. ETHNE gazes silently at the feathers in her hand. wILLOUGHBY ...He'd followed us all the way from Alexandria, looking for an opportunity to redeem himself. It was only after he left that I found out an Arab matching his description had also saved Jack Durrance's life. ETHNE looks up in surprise. willoughby Jack doesn't know. That was the way Harry wanted it. EXT. FLASHBACK/ BATTLEFIELD/ DESERT/ SUDAN - DAY. Smoke hovers over the corpse strewn battlefield. We see HARRY through the haze, carrying DURRANCE on his shoulders, staggering under his friend's weight. EXT. FLASHBACK/ HILLS ABOVE THE BATTLEFIELD/ SUDAN - DAY. HARRY and ABOU FATMA help DURRANCE up a steep mountain trail, as below them, the battle rages. EXT. FLASHBACK/ BANKS OF THE NILE/ SUDAN - DAY. DURRANCE's brow is beaded with sweat. HARRY cools his face with a wet cloth. DURRANCE murmurs questions in his feverish state, but HARRY remains resolutely silent. EXT. maze/ caroline's house - day. ETHNE stares at WILLOUGHBY, thinking only of Harry. WILLOUGHBY thinks she's staring at the medals on his chest. wILLOUGHBY (Embarrassed) I tried to turn them down. I told the committee I'd done nothing to deserve them. They didn't care. I think they pick their heroes' names out of a hat. (Trying to ease her pain) You asked me how he'd changed. All I can say is that you would have been proud of him. ETHNE I should have been proud of him before. Or at least I should have tried to understand. willoughby You can't blame yourself. ETHNE Why not, if you can. (She won't forgive herself) We all misjudged him, but I had the least excuse. He was the man I was supposed to love. Suddenly a voice calls out: DURRANCE O/s Ethne... They turn around, startled. DURRANCE stands at the entrance to the maze. WILLOUGHBY gets up nervously. ETHNE (Whispering urgently) Please, I don't want him to know you're here. WILLOUGHBY stops. DURRANCE looks in their direction. wILLOUGHBY (In disbelief) He can see us. ETHNE He can't see a thing. DURRANCE reaches out and feels the hedge, finding his bearings, taking slow steps into the maze: DURRANCE Ethne...? ETHNE keeps quiet. DURRANCE Ethne...? She watches DURRANCE, wracked with guilt. wILLOUGHBY (Beginning to panic) I've got to say something. ETHNE Be quiet. DURRANCE is only a few yards away from them now. He stares a moment, as if at ETHNE, then turns and walks back. EXT. window/ CAROLINE's house - day. CAROLINE sees DURRANCE, walking away from the maze, still calling out for Ethne. EXT. maze/ CAROLINE's house - day. Durrance's voice fades in the distance. ETHNE (Struggling with her emotions) I didn't want him to find out what you just told me. wILLOUGHBY Harry was his best friend -- ETHNE -- I'm engaged to Jack. I'm going to marry him. WILLOUGHBY stares in surprise. wILLOUGHBY ...I knew he'd proposed, I had no idea you'd accepted... (Considering the implications) ...I'd never have told you if I knew. I'm sure Harry wouldn't have wanted me to. ETHNE I'm glad you did. I needed to know. (Looking at him) Do you know where Harry is now? WILLOUGHBY hesitates. wILLOUGHBY He didn't tell me anything; I didn't feel I had a right to ask -- ETHNE -- Please, tell me the truth. There's no anger in her voice, only concern. WILLOUGHBY looks torn. wILLOUGHBY Some of our men were taken prisoner. The Dervishes took them South, in case we tried a rescue. Trench was among the missing. ETHNE smiles sadly, as if she has her answer. wILLOUGHBY (Trying to give her hope) Harry may be determined but he isn't mad. He'll look for Trench and then he'll come back. ETHNE He'll do whatever he has to do. There are still two feathers left. EXT. window/ caroline's house - day. From her window, CAROLINE sees ETHNE and WILLOUGHBY, saying goodbye, walking off in different directions. As ETHNE approaches the house, CAROLINE sees her gazing at something in her hand. INT. stairway/ caroline's house - day. CAROLINE walks down the stairs. CAROLINE Is everything alright? ETHNE (Forcing a smile) He was a friend of father's. He apologised for not introducing himself. He was in a hurry. CAROLINE doesn't press. She notices the two white feathers in Ethne's hand. INT. LIVING ROOM/ CAROLINE's house - night. ETHNE sits at the piano stool, still gazing at the feathers in her hand. She hears voices in the corridor. It's Durrance, asking Caroline where she is. ETHNE hears his footsteps approaching. She lifts up the piano lid and starts to play. The living room door opens. ETHNE ignores the quiet footsteps behind her. She feels DURRANCE listening to every note. His hands cover her eyes gently. ETHNE (Trying to smile) Who could that be... She removes his hands from her eyes, and kisses them. DURRANCE sits down beside her on the piano stool. DURRANCE What were you playing? ETHNE The Melusine overture. DURRANCE Cheerful stuff. He grins and starts to play the tune, perfectly. ETHNE looks on in admiration, trying to hide her feelings. DURRANCE Join me. ETHNE I'd rather listen. DURRANCE Please... Reluctantly ETHNE starts to accompany him. DURRANCE They say you can tell a woman's heart by the way she plays. ETHNE What if she can't play at all. DURRANCE It isn't how well you play, it's how passionately you stroke the keys. ETHNE presses the keys harder, pretending it's a joke, worried that he might see through her. DURRANCE I'd say you're in love. Even though it's said in jest, his words stick like a knife. The notes torture her. She suddenly gets up and walk away from the piano. DURRANCE (Following her footsteps) Where are you going? ETHNE I want to hear you play on your own. A moment's silence. Then DURRANCE turns back to the piano and starts to play -- quietly, tenderly. The haunting music breaks Ethne's heart. Almost involuntarily she starts to walk away from him, towards the open patio doors. DURRANCE (With a sudden flourish of the keys) There you go, I'm in love too... He swivels around and beams at her joyfully. ETHNE stares back at him, unable to speak. DURRANCE (Gazing at her adoringly) These past few days have been the best days of my life, blind or otherwise... His eyes shine in the candlelight, full of new-found hope. DURRANCE ...Before I came here I'd given up. I put on all kinds of fronts and defences, but deep down I was petrified. I had no idea what was going on around me, what people were thinking behind my back. I imagined the worst, so that nothing would surprise me, no-one would catch me out... He walks closer. DURRANCE ...You've made me realise I can't live like that. Whether one can see or not, there's no way of knowing how people really feel about you, all you can do is put yourself in their hands, and trust them unconditionally... ETHNE can't speak. DURRANCE I know how much you loved Harry... (A beat) ...for the first time I'm not afraid to admit it, I'm not not afraid to bring it up between us... (A beat) I'm not afraid, because of you Ethne, because of the way you've made me feel... He waits for an answer but all that greets him is silence. As he steps closer he suddenly loses her presence. A touch of panic enters his voice: DURRANCE Ethne...? The only sound he hears is the wind on the curtains. We see for the first time that Ethne's left, through the open patio doors. DURRANCE Ethne...? He turns around sharply as he hears a noise. CAROLINE stands in the doorway. DURRANCE walks towards her. DURRANCE (Touching her arm) I thought you'd disappeared. CAROLINE It's Caroline. Ethne's gone. DURRANCE pulls back, embarrassed. DURRANCE I'm sorry. CAROLINE She must be in the garden. DURRANCE (Trying to sound lighthearted) She was here a minute ago. It must have been something I said. CAROLINE (Every word is calculated) I don't think it was anything you said. She's been upset all afternoon. Ever since she spoke to Lieutenant Willoughby. DURRANCE Willoughby?... He looks perplexed. DURRANCE Willoughby was here? Why didn't he come and see me? CAROLINE I thought he did. I saw you walking into the maze to join them. She feels the impact on him -- the fact that he called out and no-one answered. DURRANCE (Trying to justify it to himself) He must have had his reasons. CAROLINE He brought her two white feathers. That's all I know. DURRANCE looks up, startled. DURRANCE ...Harry... CAROLINE watches his unseeing eyes trying to make sense of what's happened. She feels a touch of remorse as she sees him struggling with his emotions. Finally he looks up: DURRANCE Ethne obviously didn't want me to know... (Curiously) Why did you tell me? CAROLINE hesitates. CAROLINE I thought you should know. DURRANCE You're her friend. CAROLINE Yours too I hope. DURRANCE stares at her in silence, her intentions slowly becoming clear to him. DURRANCE You're not fair to Ethne. CAROLINE Are you? Her meaning is clear. Her words sting him deeply. DURRANCE How much of our conversation did you overhear? CAROLINE Enough. DURRANCE Then you should know I meant every word. (more with pity than anger) I love and trust Ethne unconditionally. Whatever doubts she's feeling, I know she'll resolve them. (With quiet dignity) I've put myself in her hands. A long silence. DURRANCE doesn't need to see CAROLINE to know she's in tears. CAROLINE ...The only reason I told you, was because you mean the world to me. DURRANCE (A gentle rebuff) I'm sorry, Mrs Adair. EXT. garden/ caroline's house - night. ETHNE sits in the garden alone, shivering in the wind, hating herself. EXT. THE CITY OF DONGOLA/ SOUTHERN SUDAN - night. The peeling CORPSE of a British soldier is dragged through the streets by a rope tied to a camel's back. LOCAL WOMEN tear at the dead man's uniform, grabbing at his testicles, spitting on his bloated face. HARRY slips out of the crowd, horrified by what he's seen, relieved it isn't Trench. EXT. DONGOLA/ SUDAN - day. The jeering women can be heard in the distance. ABOU FATMA sits in the shade, slurping an oily gruel. HARRY squats beside him. ABOU FATMA offers him the bowl. HARRY declines. ABOU FATMA You're surprised by the women? HARRY doesn't need to answer, his face says it all. ABOU FATMA They're always the most cruel. Amongst the Southern Tribes it's the custom for them to go into battle first, calling the men cowards until they're ready to fight. (Mischievously) It is the same in your country, no? HARRY looks up to find ABOU FATMA grinning at him. ABOU FATMA The woman you spoke of. Go back to her. Tell her you're ready. haRRY What did you find out about the British prisoners? ABOU FATMA There are very few of them left. He offers HARRY his food again. This time HARRY takes the bowl and swallows the rancid meat as if it's nothing. harrY Where are they being held? ABOU FATMA Your Army abandoned them. The shame is no longer yours. harry (Provoking him) Have I paid you for nothing, Abou Fatma? The Nubian looks up, stung by the talk of money, when he was only expressing concern. ABOU FATMA (Coldly) Twelve British soldiers were taken by boat from here to Omdurman last month. haRRY Shoukhran. ABOU FATMA You're a foolish man. Even for a British Officer. hARRY (Smiling) 'God protects the fool'. (Passing Abou Fatma the bowl) How would I get into the prison at Omdurman? ABOU FATMA (Sarcastically) Urinate in a holy well. harry That carries a penalty of death. All I want is to be imprisoned there. ABOU FATMA stops eating, realising HARRY is serious. ABOU FATMA You will die before your time. haRRY 'If it is the will of God.' ABOU FATMA (Impatient now) This man turned his back on you. Why should you give your life for his? harry Because he'd do the same for me. No matter what had passed between us. (Looking at the Nubian) I hope I'd do the same for you too. ABOU FATMA I have no need of such friends. The Nubian returns to his food, betraying no sentiment. HARRY reaches into his pocket and holds out five shilling coins. ABOU FATMA (Disdainfully) You owe me two shillings a day. This is too much. HARRY can't help smiling. haRRY You still haven't answered my question? ABOU FATMA You answered it yourself. God protects the fool. EXT. night MARKET/ outside the city of OMDURMAN - night. HARRY stumbles around the marketplace, strumming on a broken zither, pestering people for money, pretending to be mad. The passing crowds laugh at him and push him away. ABOU FATMA watches from across the street. HARRY staggers through the torchlit stalls. He sees a group of DERVISH WARRIORS, gathered around a fire. Their leader, a sickly looking EMIR, smokes a hashish pipe as he listens to his men recounting their feats of war. Next to him, lies a beautiful, jewel encrusted scabbard. HARRY thinks a moment, then approaches the group, strumming his zither, grinning at the men. Seeing the crazed musician, the DERVISH WARRIORS cover their ears. Some of them toss chunks of meat at him. HARRY picks up the dusty morsels, chewing them with relish, grinning like a happy puppy. ABOU FATMA watches as HARRY humiliates himself, playing his broken zither for the EMIR. The EMIR gazes back at him through bored, bloodshot eyes. As the WARRIORS laugh, HARRY suddenly bends down and snatches the Emir's scabbard. He runs off with it at speed, waving it around his head like a sword, yelling at the top of his voice. The DERVISH WARRIORS give chase, still laughing as they run after the lunatic. HARRY stumbles over a tent pole deliberately. The DERVISH WARRIORS swarm around him, caning him with their sticks. HARRY protects his face with his hands, pleading: harry (In Arabic) God loves the fool. God loves the fool... EXT. WELL/ outside the city of OMDURMAN - night. The whole marketplace has gathered to watch the madman punished. The WARRIORS hoist HARRY up onto a well, and shout at him to walk around the rim. Holding out his hands, HARRY starts to step around the ledge. As he glances down he sees the drop is at least thirty feet deep. Two of the WARRIORS jump onto the ledge behind him, blowing bugles in his ear. DERVISH WARRIORS (In Arabic) Faster thief...Faster... HARRY starts to walk faster, clapping in time with the WARRIORS, performing for the CROWD. harry (In Arabic) ...God loves the fool. God loves the fool... Another WARRIOR steps out of the crowd and starts prodding HARRY with his spear. The CROWD roars as HARRY almost topples into the well. He regains his footing and laughs back at them, clapping his hands, wriggling his hips. spectator's voiCE (In Arabic) Here's someone for him to dance with... HARRY looks down to see a hideous, half-naked HAG, being pushed towards him. The crowd clears a space for the two lunatics to dance. HARRY forces a crazed giggle as the HAG starts to undulate and thrust her hips at him. He echoes her movements, staring into her deadened eyes. The CROWD pushes them closer together. HARRY feels an overwhelming sense of pity and dread. The dreamlike intensity is getting to him. The tragic creature, shimmying before his eyes, is like a grotesque reminder of the woman he loved and lost. The HAG starts murmuring to herself. As he listens, HARRY realises she's singing -- a tuneless lament, remembered from long ago, sung without any understanding now. The emotion wells up in HARRY's eyes, even as he laughs at her. It's as if he's gazing into a crazy, distorted mirror. The EMIR stares curiously as he catches the emotion in Harry's eyes. He suddenly signals for his men to part the lunatics. HARRY is dragged away from the shrieking HAG, and flung before him. EMIR (In Arabic, suspicious now) Play for me fool... HARRY picks up his zither, and starts to play a tuneless din. EMIR (In Arabic) You're not mad. HARRY pretends not to understand. The EMIR suddenly cracks his cane down on Harry's hands, breaking his fingers. HARRY screams in agony: harry (In Arabic) ...God loves the fool... EMIR (In Arabic) The fool feels no pain. The EMIR beats him again with the cane. HARRY holds up his broken fingers in supplication, singing softly in his madman's gibberish. harry (In Arabic) ...God loves the fool... The EMIR's cane cracks open his face. He doubles over in agony, spitting out blood. ABOU FATMA watches, sickened, unable to do anything. Even the other spectators look shaken. HARRY slithers away in the dust, whimpering like an animal. EMIR (In Arabic) You're not mad. Tell me who are you? Tell me or I'll kill you... ABOU FATMA stares in silence, willing HARRY to speak. Many in the CROWD turn away, fearing the worst. The EMIR raises his cane. With a surge of effort, HARRY lifts up his blood soaked face, and grins at the EMIR. He looks barely human, his face ripped open, swollen beyond recognition. harry (Singing softly in Arabic) God loves the fool. God loves the fool... The EMIR hesitates, convinced nobody in their right mind could take this much pain. EMIR (In Arabic) He's mad. Take him to the prison. Let him sing for them there. He turns away and disappears into the crowd. ABOU FATMA stares at HARRY, with both pity and admiration. He whispers a prayer for his friend's safety. EXT. PRISON of OMDURMAN/ BANKS OF THE NILE - night. The evening prayers drift over the waters of the Nile. In the distance we see the prison of Omdurman, a huge dome of stone, surrounded by fifty foot walls on three sides, and the river itself on the fourth. INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - night. Hundreds of shapes move forward in the darkness. At first they look like a herd of animals, but slowly we recognise the grunts and cries as human. Faces come at us out of the dark, screaming and cursing, shoving each other violently, raising their faces to the ceiling, gasping for air. As our eyes adjust to the light, the vision of hell intensifies. The PRISONERS are manacled and herded into a space no more than thirty feet wide. They circle the room in a clockwise direction, pushed on by each other in perpetual motion, afraid that if they stop they'll be sucked under the maelstrom and trampled underfoot. The most fortunate are those who've found a resting space in the corners of the room. They cling to the walls, fighting off anyone who tries to share their sanctuary. From somewhere amongst them we hear a familiar voice: trench Get away! This is Ibrahim's space! TRENCH protects his corner, lashing out at anyone who tries to breach the space. He bellows at the top of his voice: trENCH Ibrahim, where are you?! A voice answers from the heaving mass. TRENCH holds out his hand and drags his friend, IBRAHIM, out of the scrum. trench (Sounding half crazed) You mustn't fall. You musn't fall. As if to prove his point, a fight breaks out at the far side of the room. TRENCH stands on tiptoes, as eager as everyone else to see the outcome. TWO PRISONERS try to strangle each other with their chains, fighting for an inch of space. It's hard to make out anything in the dark, but the savagery of the fight is reflected in the speed of flailing fists and feet. One of the PRISONERS finally loses his footing. In an instant he's sucked under. The victor laughs maniacally. The loser's cries continue for a moment and then stop suddenly as the trampling feet break his neck. TRENCH turns to Ibrahim, with the knowing look of an expert. trench We mustn't fall Ibrahim. We musn't fall. Suddenly there's a cry from outside the cell door. prison guards o/s (In Arabic) Back! Get back! The PRISONERS closest to the door push away. The head guard, the towering IDRIS-ES-SAIER, tosses in a blazing torch to clear some space. A NEW PRISONER is flung inside and the door slammed shut behind him. The other PRISONERS surge back, trying to reclaim their space. There are cries of pain as some of them tread on the blazing torch. The sheer weight of men quickly puts it out. The NEW PRISONER holds onto anything he can to stop himself falling. From his corner TRENCH looks on grimly. treNCH Watch Ibrahim. He's going to fall. The NEW PRISONER is swept up in the savage wave. As he approaches TRENCH's corner he tries to claw his way to safety. TRENCH beats him back with a flurry of blows. The prisoner disappears under the heaving bodies, but then he pops up again, gasping for breath. He fights with all his might, swinging his fists, clutching at anyone in his way. TRENCH looks impressed, but he knows it won't be long. trench He'll fall. Youssef will get him. As the NEW PRISONER swings towards them again, the prisoner behind him, YOUSSEF, slams his chains down on his head. The new arrival goes down hard. As he disappears, he screams out the name: "Trench!!!" TRENCH stares in disbelief, frozen for a moment, then bellowing like a bull, he charges out of his corner and flails his way through the heaving mass, trying to retrieve the fallen prisoner. TRENCH Help me Ibrahim...!!! The tall Arab fights his way to Trench. Together they pull the NEW PRISONER to his feet. They take him under each arm and fall in with the moving mass. treNCH We've lost our place. You mustn't fall. The man almost collapses, but TRENCH holds him up. He and Ibrahim keep walking the prisoner, trying to keep him conscious, knowing they have to fight till daybreak now. INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The sound of early morning prayers drifts into the House of Stone. Sunbeams pick out bloodmarks and broken nails where prisoners have tried to claw their way to safety. Half a dozen BODIES lie crushed on the floor, those who didn't make it through the night. Those who did, are ushered outside by the PRISON GUARDS, into the merciless heat. TRENCH and IBRAHIM support the NEW PRISONER. A fat, oily looking Prison Guard, HASSAN, sneers at TRENCH on his way out. HASSAN You've found a friend, English. TRENCH ignores him, blinking as he walks into the sun. EXT. courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The PRISONERS collapse as they stumble into the prison courtyard, exhausted by the previous night's efforts. TRENCH and IBRAHIM help the NEW PRISONER to the river's edge. EXT. RIVERBANK/ courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. TRENCH kneels beside the prisoner and pours some water over his face. The man opens his lips to swallow it. treNCH Don't drink. It's dirty. Your body isn't strong enough. Beads of sweat shine on the bearded man's ravaged face. TRENCH studies his features, wondering who he is. He digs out a copper coin from his shoe. treNCH (To Ibrahim) See if Hassan will sell us some drinking water. IBRAHIM sets off towards HASSAN, who's busy beating the other PRISONERS to their feet. treNCH (Looking back) You speak English? new prisoner (A trace of a smile appears on his cracked lips) ...I hope so, after all this time... TRENCH stares at him in surprise. treNCH ...How do you know my name? new PRISONER You told it to me yourself...the first time we met... (Imitating Trench weakly) "Trench by name, and Trench by nature. Good to meet you Feversham..." TRENCH stares in astonishment. trENCH ...Harry?... HARRY's eyes move around and find him, twinkling mischievously, despite all the pain. harrY (With ironic good humor) ...You look well... treNCH (Breaking into a smile) Not half as well as you... (Overwhelmed) What the hell are you doing here?... hARRY ...I'd come to rescue you...but now that you've rescued me...I have to save you twice... TRENCH stares at him in disbelief. hARRY ...I have some money to bribe the guards...There's a man waiting for us across the river...With camels and provisions... TREnch (Snapping out of his reverie, hushing him) Keep your voice down. TRENCH looks across the courtyard to make sure no-one's watching them. HASSAN is busy bargaining with IBRAHIM over the cup of water. treNCH (Under his breath) How much money? harRY Two hundred. TRENCH looks hopeful for the first time in weeks. TRENCH ...I knew it wasn't true. The guards kept telling me our army had left us behind. How far away are they? hARRY (Regrettably) They pulled out. Over a month ago. TRENCH stares in confusion. TRENCH Then who sent you? harrY You did. TRENCH doesn't understand. HARRY slowly opens his fingers to reveal a crushed white feather in his hand. TRENCH stares at it in bewilderment. Then suddenly he starts to laugh, full of anguish and joy, amazed by the madness of the world. EXT. PRISON GATES/ courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The compound gates rumble open. The Prisoners' RELATIVES are ushered inside, kept in order by the GUARDS' whips. The PRISONERS limp as fast as they can to receive any food their families have brought them. Before they can eat, the GUARDS have to be paid off, IDRIS first, then HASSAN and the others. As the feeding frenzy breaks out we hear Trench's voice: trENCH v/o ...Hassan's the only guard who's corruptible. For two hundred he'll get us on the graveyard detail... EXT. RIVERBANK/ courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. We see what he's talking about now. The dead bodies from the House of Stone are dumped in a row boat. The GUARDS order several PRISONERS onto the boat with them. They're too afraid to handle the corpses themselves. treNCH v/o ...The farthest the boat goes is a hundred yards from the opposite shore. We'll have to wait until you're strong enough to swim... HARRY watches the boat drift into the middle of the river. Ripples appear as huge CROCODILES move in to feed. The PRISONERS toss the bodies in the water. The corpses float for a moment, then suddenly vanish in a froth of blood. treNCH (Smiling grimly) You didn't think of that when you came? haRRY I didn't think of much when I came. TRENCH looks at him, still unable to believe anyone could be so reckless and so brave. trENCH All for a feather? hARRY (Lightly) More than one. TRENCH looks down at the sand, reflecting: trENCH Give it to me Harry. haRRY Why? treNCH So I can show you it means nothing -- that if I throw it in the river it'll float away -- end up between some Croc's teeth. harry (Smiling softly) Not this feather. It's got the measure of me. It'll float back and find me. The water laps quietly in the silence. trENCH There were a dozen British Officers here last month. Every time one of them died, the last words on his lips were: "Don't worry about me lads. Our boys will come and get you." They never did. Just you. I'd say you've done enough. haRRY Not until I get you out. trENCH You can hardly walk. harry I don't need to walk, I need to swim. He smiles at TRENCH affectionately. Across the river, the boat returns, silhouetted against the sunset. EXT. house of stone/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The PRISONERS are herded back into the House of Stone. HASSAN walks alongside TRENCH and HARRY, negotiating his bribe. hASSAN ...God put you here for a reason, English. He tests us. I have fifteen starving children myself to care for. treNCH (Taking his cue) I was thinking of your children Hassan. I'd like to help them. God favours the almsgiver. hASSAN For three hundred I could feed them for a year. treNCH I can afford two. From myself, Ibrahim, and the madman. HASSAN nods, accepting the offer, and walks ahead. INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - night. HARRY and TRENCH are in the thick of the crowd, fighting for space, trying to give each other strength. treNCH ...The first thing I do when I get back is book a table at Wilton's. A private room, all to myself, no bloody crowds... He shoves into the man in front, gaining a few more precious inches for them to breathe in. trench ...I'll start with a half shell of crab, then I'll order the mallard, medium rare. harRY A glass of Burgundy to wash it down. treNCH Nothing foreign. A pint of Stout'll do me fine. harrY (Grinning) Well I'm getting on the first train to Bintree, crowded or not. trENCH I'll drink to that... (He raises his hand, as if he's in a crowded pub, trying to get the Barman's attention) Two pints please... The two of them surge through the crowd, laughing like lunatics. treNCH A few more days Harry. A few more days... INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The morning call to prayer brings sobs of relief from the PRISONERS. HARRY, TRENCH, and IBRAHIM, lie in a corner of the room, exhausted by the night's efforts. HASSAN steps over the dead bodies littering the floor, and orders them to get up. hassAN (As planned) You three, take the bodies to the boat. HARRY and IBRAHIM get to their feet. TRENCH doesn't move. HARRY reaches down to give him a hand, when he suddenly sees how pale his friend is. He drops to his knees, feeling TRENCH's pulse. He's alive, but very weak. hasSAN (Looking at the unconscious Trench) You see, English. God didn't want you to leave. He has given you Umm Sabbah. TRENCH moans, gripped by Typhus fever. HARRY tries to help him up, refusing to believe their plans are dashed. hARRY (Whispering) Trench, get up. Get up... hassAN (Shouting at Harry in Arabic) Leave him. Carry the dead to the boat. HARRY ignores him, cradling TRENCH in his arms. HASSAN steps forward and lashes him hard across the back. harry (Still trying to rouse Trench) ...Get up Trench. Get up... HASSAN lashes him again. This time HARRY spins around and grabs the whip. He stares at HASSAN dangerously, the frustration and disappointment pushing him to the edge. HASSAN (In Arabic) He paid me to release you. If you don't want to go, you can rot with him. (Turning to Ibrahim) What about you?! IBRAHIM looks at TRENCH guiltily, then gets up, and walks towards the dead bodies. HARRY gathers TRENCH in his arms, and holds him protectively, like a faithful slave. HASSAN sneers, and strides out of the House of Stone. HARRY looks at TRENCH. His friend shivers feverishly. HARRY brushes the wet hair out of his face: hARRY We'll get you to Wilton's. Crab and Mallard, medium rare. EXT. RIVERBANK/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY watches from the shore, as IBRAHIM tosses the corpses overboard. Suddenly the Arab takes his chance and dives. He's only yards away from the boat when he's lifted into air by a huge crocodile, and dragged below the murky depths. All is still again. HARRY looks back at TRENCH, lying by the river's edge, lost in his own feverish dreams. INT. STUDY/ GENERAL FEVERSHAM's HOUSE/ LONDON - DAY. ETHNE sits across from GENERAL FEVERSHAM in the dimly lit room. There's bright sunshine outside but very little of it gets in. GENERAL FEVERSHAM seems much older than the first time we saw him, his eyes are withdrawn, his movements restless. He rings the handbell irritably. ETHNE Don't worry about the biscuits General. gENERAL FEVERSHAM I wanted some myself. I need something sweet in the afternoons, otherwise I fall asleep. (Catching himself) Not today of course. ETHNE tries to answer his smile, but neither of them is particularly convincing. gENERAL FEVERSHAM I'm very touched you've come all this way to tell me your good news. Jack'll make you a wonderful husband. ETHNE (Hiding all her doubts) He'll be pleased to hear that. gENERAL FEVERSHAM I'm very fond of the boy. GENERAL FEVERSHAM smiles weakly, and looks away. Whatever they talk about seems to come back to Harry. ETHNE finally broaches the subject: ETHNE Have you heard any news from the Sudan? GENERAL FEVERSHAM hesitates. gENERAL FEVERSHAM ...An old friend of mine came to visit me yesterday, Colonel Sutch. You probably remember him... ETHNE nods, panicking inside, sensing the old man's grief. gENERAL FEVERSHAM ...He used to receive the occasional letter from Harry, letting him know that he was alright... (His voice falters) ...Harry made him promise not to tell me anything, unless the letters stopped. I'm afraid they did. Over a month ago. ETHNE looks pale. She tries to hold back her tears for the General's sake. ETHNE I'm sure it doesn't mean anything. gENERAL FEVERSHAM I asked some friends at the war office to make some enquiries. According to their spies, all the British prisoners are dead. ETHNE can't speak. The old man fights his tears as well. gENERAL FEVERSHAM Would you like to see his letters? ETHNE (Barely a whisper) I'm not sure I could cope right now. geNERAL FEVERSHAM No, of course not. I'm sorry... ETHNE looks up, remembering his grief is as great as hers. ETHNE Have you looked at them? gENERAL FEVERSHAM Oh yes. They make wonderful reading... (His face lights up briefly) He travelled all the way from Alexandria to Suakin. Across three hundred miles of desert. From there he followed the camel corp disguised as a coolie. He fought with them at Abou Klea, excelled himself by all accounts, saved dozens of lives. If he was still a soldier they'd have probably given him the Victoria Cross. ETHNE (Her eyes shining with tears) You must be very proud. The old man nods, suffering again. geNERAL FEVERSHAM ...There isn't a trace of fear in the writing. That's what I find so hard to understand. That someone could be so terrified of going to war; and yet when the time comes to face it for real, he embraces it, almost gratefully... ETHNE (Sharing his guilt) We all misjudged him. gENERAL FEVERSHAM You only knew him a short time. I had no excuse. Seeing him overcome by guilt and grief, ETHNE gets up and takes his hand. GENERAL FEVERSHAM holds hers tightly. gENERAL FEVERSHAM My son loved Jack Durrance like a brother. I know he'd be happy for you. He'd want you to live your lives. ETHNE nods gratefully, unable to speak, her whole world falling apart. EXT. courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. The PRISONERS tear and claw at each other like wild animals, desperately trying reach a scrap of meat that's fallen to the floor. HARRY is in the thick of the fighting, elbowing and head-butting people out of his way. He's changed beyond recognition, and it isn't just physical. He fights with a primal savagery, oblivious to everything except the precious scrap of food. He finally gets hold of it, and swings his elbow round, breaking another PRISONER's nose. EXT. RIVER's EDGE/ courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. TRENCH lies by the riverside, sweating and shivering from fever, his eyes sunken back into his skull. HARRY kneels beside him, covered in blood. He holds out the scrap of meat. hARRY ...Trench. Food. You have to eat. TRENCH can't move his jaw, let alone eat. HARRY chews the meat for him. When it's soft between his teeth, he spits it out, and feeds TRENCH with his fingers. For all the primal horror, there's a touching human tenderness in the moment. Suddenly a pair of hands grab HARRY by the hair, and drag him away from TRENCH. It's IDRIS. The giant prison guard tears the scrap of meat from HARRY's hands and kicks him in the ribs for good measure. Spitting out blood, HARRY crawls after him, no longer having to play the madman, he's halfway there. hARRY (In Arabic) Food master, food master please... IDRIS lashes him with his whip. HARRY's body arches in pain but his brain hardly registers. He kisses the ground at Idris's feet, still begging for his scrap of food back. hARRY (In Arabic) Food master. Food... IDRIS walks away in disgust. INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - night. HARRY holds up the semi-conscious TRENCH, as they're buffeted around in the House of Stone. The other PRISONERS try to push them under, but HARRY defends TRENCH with the savagery of a veteran. A PRISONER tries to blind TRENCH with his hands, but HARRY grabs his fingers, sinking his teeth in as far as they will go. INT. house of stone/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. Daylight streams through the open doors. HARRY rests TRENCH against a wall, and scavenges amongst the bodies of the dead, searching for any money they may have hidden. EXT. courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY runs over to HASSAN, and drops to his knees in supplication, holding out a copper coin: hARRY (Pleading in Arabic) Food master. Food. My master needs food. HASSAN holds out his arm to reveal a stump where his hand should be. hasSAN (In Arabic) This is what Idris gave me for helping your master... (Spitting at Harry's feet) There's some food. HASSAN turns and walks towards the fortress gates. The other PRISONERS scramble after him, desperate to receive their daily handout from their RELATIVES. HARRY thinks about wading in and fighting them for it, but he has no energy left. He collapses in the sand, staring up at the sun. As he closes his eyes, he suddenly hears a whisper: ARAB BOY o/s English... HARRY looks up to see a small ARAB BOY, approaching him. The BOY stops as he sees HARRY's ravaged face, frightened by his mad, staring eyes. HARRY sees the piece of chicken in his hand, and waves him over. The ARAB BOY finally kneels down, and offers him the chicken bone. HARRY snatches it and gnaws on it like a hungry animal. It's only when he examines the meat, making sure there's enough left for Trench, that we realise how human he still is. He slips the half eaten chicken bone in his robes, and looks at the ARAB BOY gratefully. The ARAB BOY holds out some coins for him. ARAB BOY From Abou Fatma. HARRY stares at the coins. It's all the money he's ever paid Abou Fatma. harrY Money's no good anymore. We can't bribe the guards. I need him to buy food and medecine for my friend... He stops as he realises the ARAB BOY doesn't understand a word. He gives him back the coins: harrY (In Arabic) Tell Abou Fatma to buy us food. You bring me the food... He points to the other RELATIVES as if to explain. The ARAB BOY nods that he understands. HARRY is about to ask him more when he suddenly spots IDRIS walking towards them menacingly. harrY Go. Thank Abou Fatma. Thank him for me. The ARAB BOY gets up and walks away. HARRY watches him leave, already missing the human contact. As IDRIS approaches, he scrambles away, reduced to his bestial state again. EXT. courtyard/ RIVERside/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY pours water over TRENCH's face. hARRY ...You're better Trench. Much better. You may not feel it, but you look it... TRENCH opens his eyes, conscious enough for the first time in weeks, to see how much his friend has changed. treNCH (Smiling weakly) ...When I'm better...Will I look as bad as you?... HARRY smiles through bleeding gums and swollen cheeks. The evening prayer starts up behind them. TRENCH closes his eyes in despair. treNCH I don't think of God anymore when I hear that sound. It used to give me hope. Now all I feel is dread. hARRY Don't talk like that. We're going to get you through this. treNCH I don't want to get through this, Harry. What for? In the distance they hear IDRIS shouting at the prisoners, driving them back into the House of Stone. TRENCH ...There's only one thing that frightens me now. The thought that the closer I come, the more desperately afraid and sure I am that all this will end right here... when I so wish I could die at home... (fighting tears) In my own country -- in my own village...to be buried beneath the trees I know -- in sight of the church and houses I know...beside the trout stream, where I fished when I was a boy... (Trying to smile) Are you laughing yet?... HARRY No, I'm not laughing. HARRY fights his own pain. treNCH I don't think I can take it anymore, Harry... HARRY finds it hard to argue. Staring at TRENCH's ravaged face and withered body all he can do is nod in sympathy. EXT. courtyard/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY sits opposite the young ARAB BOY in the courtyard. There's a look of quiet resignation in his eyes as he stares at the small glass vial in his hand. hARRY (In Arabic) Thank Abou Fatma for me. Ask him to pray for us. The ARAB BOY nods sadly, as if he's seeing Harry for the last time. HARRY pats him on the shoulder, and gets up. INT. HOUSE OF STONE/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - night. HARRY and TRENCH lean against a wall, watching as the House of Stone fills with PRISONERS. TRENCH's eyes are filled with dread. hARRY (Quietly) ...We had a visitor today. TRENCH turns and looks at him. HARRY opens his hand to reveal the small glass vial. TRENCH stares at the dark liquid inside, slowly realising what it is. TRENCH Anything would be better than this. HARRY Are you sure? TRENCH nods, his decision made. hARRY (Slipping him the vial) The poison will take a few hours to work. You won't feel any pain. TRENCH (Smiling grimly) That'll make a change. HARRY looks at him sadly, then turns away, preparing for the inevitable charge from the other PRISONERS. trENCH ...One last thing, Harry... HARRY turns around. trENCH ...My feather...I'd like it back... HARRY stares in silence. TRENCH holds out his hand. HARRY takes it. As they finally let go, we see the soiled white feather in TRENCH's palm. TRENCH closes his fingers around it, gratefully. treNCH I hope it gives me as much strength as it gave you. Their eyes stay on each other, full of friendship and respect. Then, steeling himself, TRENCH snaps the vial, and starts to drink. HARRY Half... TRENCH stops. trENCH (Smiling sadly) I didn't mean to be a pig about it... He holds out the vial for Harry. HARRY takes it and swallows the rest of the poison. He grins at TRENCH. hARRY What do you say, we give them one last night of hell. trENCH I'll drink to that. Shoulder first, HARRY charges into the massing PRISONERS. TRENCH follows him, laughing through his tears. INT. HOUSE OF STONE - DAWN. Blinding sunlight. The PRISONERS stumble out of the House of Stone, covered in blood from the previous night's fighting. IDRIS looks down at the broken bodies at his feet. HARRY and TRENCH are amongst the dead. IDRIS prods them both with his spear, making sure. IDRIS (In Arabic) Take them to the boats. EXT. courtyard/ RIVERside/ PRISON/ OMDURMAN - day. A dozen BODIES are dumped, one on top of the other, in two funeral boats. HASSAN takes charge of one, IDRIS the other. EXT. BOATS/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. The GUARDS hold onto the sides of the boat, steadying themselves in case a crocodile tries to ram. The PRISONERS charged with throwing the bodies overboard, stare into the water, terrified of the unseen monsters lurking below. EXT. hassan's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. The corpses are piled high in Hassan's boat, a mass of chalk white flesh. As we follow a rivulet of blood into the heap, we see Harry's face. His eyes suddenly open. Very much alive. They move around, trying to locate Trench. Above him he feels the corpses being lifted off, easing the burden on his back. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. Arrows break the surface, as the giant crocodiles move in. EXT. hassan's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY finally glimpses TRENCH. His friend is still unconscious. In tiny movements, HARRY slips through the ice cold flesh that separates them, and slides over TRENCH's body, trying to ensure he's thrown overboard first. EXT. idris's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. Blood boils around the boats as more bodies are tossed overboard. As IDRIS stares into the murky depths, he sees a fifteen foot monster, dragging away a translucent corpse. EXT. hassan's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY and TRENCH are the only bodies left in Hassan's boat. HARRY braces himself as he's lifted into the air. His body is swung out three times and thrown overboard. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY feels the warm water envelop him. Any trace of paralysis the poison has left, disappears in an instant, driven away by sheer terror. Through the eerie green haze he glimpses the dreamlike silhouettes of the crocodiles, feasting on the corpses, dragging them along the river bed. HARRY's instincts are to swim away as fast as he can, but even now he remembers TRENCH. The water above him explodes as TRENCH is hurled in. HARRY swims up to the surface and grabs hold of his friend. EXT. idris's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. IDRIS stares curiously as he watches the two bodies drifting away. The water around them is bubbling but there's no blood. It's only as he looks more closely that IDRIS realises one of the bodies is kicking his feet, swimming away. iDRIS (In Arabic) Hassan. Behind you! EXT. HASSAN's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HASSAN turns around to see HARRY and TRENCH disappearing with the current. He takes out his pistol. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. Holding the unconscious TRENCH in his arms, HARRY swims towards the fastest point of the river, hoping the current will drag him away from the crocodiles and the boats. EXT. HASSAN's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HASSAN aims the pistol with his good hand. He's about to squeeze the trigger, when there's a loud explosion from the opposite shore. A bullet smashes through his skull and hurls him into the water. EXT. opposite shore/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. The MAN who fired the shot lowers his rifle. It's ABOU FATMA. He kicks his camel, and gallops along the riverbank, trying to keep up with HARRY and TRENCH in the water. EXT. IDRIS's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. IDRIS stares after them in fury. He orders the GUARDS to row into the current and give chase. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY and TRENCH tumble through the churning water, the current boiling all around them. There are splashes of water as bullets explode. EXT. opposite shore/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. ABOU FATMA dismounts as he sees HARRY and TRENCH being picked off. He takes up a position near the riverbank, and fires at the pursuing boat. EXT. IDRIS's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. IDRIS ducks as one of his GUARDS is hit. He shouts at the remaining GUARDS to fire back at Abou Fatma. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY and TRENCH keep disappearing under the water. As he surfaces briefly, HARRY looks around. He sees the current hurtling towards a row of jagged rocks. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. IDRIS aims at the distant figure on the riverbank, and fires a volley of shots. EXT. opposite shore/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. Two bullets spin ABOU FATMA round, grazing him in the leg, knocking the rifle out of his hand. Limping as fast as he can, he takes cover behind the camels. EXT. IDRIS's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. IDRIS looks back at HARRY and TRENCH, ready to pick them off. Suddenly his eyes stop. He sees the jagged rocks in his path. He yells at the GUARDS to row against the current. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. The current picks up speed as it hurtles towards the rocks. HARRY holds TRENCH tightly, anticipating the impact. The current sweeps them right through the rocks. EXT. opposite shore/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. ABOU FATMA watches from the riverbank as IDRIS's boat tumbles helplessly towards the rocks. EXT. IDRIS's BOAT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. The GUARDS leap off the boat at the last moment, but the current sweeps them up, and dashes their brains against the rocks. Only IDRIS holds on. The boat breaks up all around him, but protects him from the full impact. EXT. RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY and TRENCH surface on the other side of the rocks. Huge tree roots jut out near the riverbank. The current is still strong but it's swimmable. EXT. opposite shore/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. ABOU FATMA rides after the disappearing bodies. EXT. GIANT TREE ROOT/ RIVER/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY reaches out and grabs a jutting tree root. With his legs clamped around TRENCH, he pulls them out of the fastest point of the current. As he looks behind him he sees IDRIS disappear under the torrent. Catching his breath, HARRY starts to clamber along the root, trying to make it to the safety of the riverbank. TRENCH groans, fully conscious now. harrY We're going to make it. TRENCH stares at HARRY with an almost childlike trust. harrY See if you can touch the bottom. TRENCH dips his feet under, nodding as they touch the riverbed. harrY Grab the root. TRENCH grips the root. HARRY swims around him. harry Now walk to the riverbank. treNCH My legs are broken. harry Your legs are fine. The poison paralyses the body. It's worn off. Gripping the root, TRENCH starts to walk against the current, the water flowing up to his neck. Slowly the river shallows. HARRY looks relieved as his friend finally tumbles onto the riverbank and collapses. He's about to follow him, when suddenly a pair of hands shoot out of the water, and grab him around the neck. It's IDRIS. He's also managed to clamber his way to safety. With a howl of rage he pulls HARRY's face under the water. HARRY kicks and flails. With one huge hand IDRIS keeps him under the surface, with the other he holds onto the giant tree root. HARRY tries to loosen his grip, but he isn't strong enough. He reaches down into the riverbed, and gropes around until he finds a rock. He grinds it into IDRIS's wrist like a pummel stone. IDRIS whips his hand away in pain. HARRY is instantly sucked out of his grasp. The current smashes him headlong into another root, downriver. IDRIS stares at his escaped prey in fury. His anger clouds his reason. He lets go of his own root and lets the current drag him to HARRY's. EXT. RIVERbank/ OMDURMAN - day. HARRY drags himself towards the riverbank. He's only a few yards away when IDRIS's hands grab him again. HARRY turns around swinging and catches IDRIS on the jaw. Both of them tumble in the water. They wrestle beneath the surface, then shoot up again, tearing at each other like wild animals. IDRIS grabs HARRY by the hair, and slams his face down on his knee, smashing his nose. The searing pain staggers HARRY. He tries to crawl away, but IDRIS stamps on his back, flattening him. He drops to his knees, and grinds HARRY's face into the riverbed. As he pulls him back up by the hair, we see HARRY's mangled features -- a mask of blood, eyes staring out, jaws hanging open in defeat. For a moment time seems to slow, then suddenly, shaking his head free, HARRY screams a savage, primal cry, and drives his elbow back into IDRIS's face, shattering bone and cartilege. IDRIS falls back, stunned. HARRY has his chance to get away, but he's not interested now. He wades after IDRIS, an expression of pure, uncontrollable rage in his eyes. As IDRIS tries to pick himself up, HARRY slams both fists into his mouth, smashing his teeth down his throat. It's IDRIS's turn to look scared. He tries to crawl away, but the bloody faced demon is on him in seconds, ramming his head back under the water. IDRIS manages to kick him away briefly, but it only enrages HARRY. He comes back at IDRIS with a large rock between his hands, cracking his face open. And still he isn't finished. Sitting astride the gurgling prison guard, HARRY raises both arms as high as they'll go, and smashes the rock into IDRIS's face, again and again. The guard's blood splatters all over him, but HARRY hardly seems to notice. He's gripped by a savage, primordial fury. Everything he's suffered has built up to this point. He's at his highest and lowest ebb. His hands whirr up and down, his eyes glow feverishly, his lips curl in a terrifying sneer. Strong arms grab him from behind, but HARRY ignores them, hammering away. He's beyond hatred, beyond compassion, face to face with his deepest, darkest self. Again the arms try to pull him off, but HARRY brushes them aside. The blood and tears stream down his cheeks. He howls like an animal. His hands finally slow as his arms reach exhaustion. This time ABOU FATMA manages to pull him off. HARRY collapses in his arms and weeps like a baby, finally breaking out of the darkness, no longer sure who or what he is anymore. ABOU FATMA holds him tightly, hushing him, comforting him, understanding. EXT. country lane/ bintree/ england - day. A primal silence. Mist hovers over the emerald fields. In the distance a carriage approaches. As it draws nearer, we see HARRY, sitting in the back. His scars have healed, but his eyes have the far away look of someone who's seen too much. The outlines of the village church appear through the fog. HARRY hears a dog barking. hARRY (To the Driver) Could you stop here. EXT. church/ bintree - day. The barking grows louder as HARRY enters the churchyard. He sees a Collie, tied to a post. It's Dermod's dog. HARRY bends down and strokes the animal. Then he looks up through the open church door. INT. church/ bintree - day. At first HARRY doesn't see ETHNE. She sits quietly in one of the Church pews. It's only as she hears his footsteps that she turns around. Her eyes stop still. She stares at him in silence, taking in the ravages of time. All the diffidence and boyish charm she remembers have long since disappeared. In their place, there's an inner strength, and confidence. ETHNE Everyone said how much you'd changed. I didn't believe them. hARRY Do I look that bad? ETHNE Trench came to see me last week. He looked a good deal worse than you. hARRY He's suffered more. ETHNE That isn't what he told me. She stares at him with quiet pride. ETHNE May I have it back? hARRY That isn't why I came. ETHNE I'd still like it back. (She smiles sadly) I have three of them, I'd like four. HARRY stares at her, then takes out the fourth feather. hARRY I'm almost sorry to let it go. It's brought me a lot of luck these past few months. ETHNE takes the feather, unable to look at him. She stares at it in silence. ETHNE When did you get back? hARRY Two weeks ago. She looks hurt that it's taken him so long to come and see her, but she knows she has no right to expect more. ETHNE I'm glad you did what you did, on your own, without anyone's help. I'm glad for you, Harry. hARRY I did nothing on my own. You were with me the whole time. The tears begin to shine in her eyes. ETHNE You've heard our news?... hARRY Yes. ETHNE nods, unable to continue. hARRY I didn't come here to change your mind. (With quiet dignity) The most I hoped for -- and I hoped for it every day -- was that I could do enough to save the memory of what we had. So that you wouldn't always be ashamed of the time we spent together. ETHNE is too ashamed of herself to answer him. Her eyes drift to a crack of sunlight on the church wall, glinting through the stained glass windows. hARRY What are you thinking? ETHNE You'd laugh if I told you. harrY That might not be a bad thing. ETHNE I was thinking I'd get up and leave when that patch of sunlight disappeared. So far it's been quite resilient. She smiles gently. For a moment they're the Harry and Ethne of old. ETHNE I passed by your appartment the other day. hARRY (Surprised) When? ETHNE When you didn't come and see me... (She smiles sadly) I was in London for the day. It took me hours to pluck up the courage. When I finally drove by, your lights were off. hARRY I've hardly been out since I got back. ETHNE It was last Friday. Between five and six. hARRY (Pausing) I'd gone to see my father. ETHNE (Smiling ironically) Someone must be watching over us. The sunlight lingers precariously on the wall. ETHNE It will pass. You'll meet someone soon. Then you and her, and Jack and I, will sit over tea and chatter politely, as if there was never anything between us. hARRY That won't happen. ETHNE It has to happen. (The tears fill her eyes) Because I love you Harry...and I can't. I can't. The sunlight on the wall finally fades. ETHNE wipes her tears and gets up to leave. As she tries to walk past him, HARRY takes her in his arms. She doesn't resist. If anything she's relieved. They stay like that for a moment, holding each other, unable to do anything else. We feel their desperate longing, but there's a self imposed wall that keeps them apart. ETHNE pulls away gently. ETHNE I'll take you to the station. He nods. hARRY I wanted to look in on Jack. I'll leave him a note. ETHNE (Considering) No, he'd love to see you. He's staying at the vicarage. It's on the way. They're polite around each other now, like strangers. ETHNE slips past him with an awkward smile. HARRY waits before he follows her. They walk down the aisle, several feet apart. INT. DURRANCE's room/ vicarage/ glenalla - day. DURRANCE sits at a table, knotting his tie. There's a determination in his eyes, as if the smallest activity has become a battle to be won. Suddenly he hears the noise of Ethne's carriage outside. His face lights up. He feels his way towards the window. The carriage door takes a long time to open. DURRANCE stares curiously. Finally he hears footsteps on the gravel. They're heavier than he expected. They stop a moment. DURRANCE knows whoever it is, is staring up at him in the window. He looks thoughtful now, as if he knows who it is. He turns away from the window and finds a chair. He sits, facing the door, checking to make sure the carafe of Scotch and the crystal glasses are within easy reach. The footsteps climb the stairs. There's a knock on the door. DURRANCE Come in. HARRY enters. He stops as he sees his friend. DURRANCE's face has softened from inactivity. His skin seems pale compared to Harry's coarse, sunburnt features. DURRANCE It's good to see you, Harry. hARRY (Quietly impressed) How did you know? DURRANCE A calculated guess. (He grins) Scotch alright? hARRY Perfect. DURRANCE I've got to cut down on the stuff. I'm putting on weight. hARRY You look good. DURRANCE Not as good as you, I'm sure. HARRY watches his friend, taking the carafe, pouring two perfect glasses. Everything Durrance does, is designed to show him he's alright, that there's nothing to pity. DURRANCE (Handing him the drink) I heard Ethne's carriage outside? hARRY She's giving me a ride to the station. DURRANCE Why didn't she come up? hARRY (He knows the question isn't as casual as it sounds) I think she wanted to give us a few minutes alone. DURRANCE Do we need a few minutes alone? Even though he's smiling, the air is thick with tension. hARRY I came to thank you, Jack. DURRANCE For what? hARRY For standing by me. DURRANCE If you're talking about the feathers, I wasn't there. hARRY Willoughby told me you were. He said you'd tried to talk them out of it. DURRANCE hesitates. DURRANCE You don't owe me anything Harry. The wedding isn't for another month. Ethne's free to make up her own mind. hARRY You don't owe me anything either, Jack. And she's made up her mind. You should trust her judgement. A long silence. DURRANCE is too proud to respond. HARRY stares at his friend, regretting the wall between them. hARRY I'd better go. I'll miss my train. I'll come and see you soon. He finishes his drink and gets up. DURRANCE Have another one. hARRY I can't Jack. DURRANCE Please. His voice is softer now, more conciliatory. DURRANCE The friendship was the best thing about that place. It's the one thing I haven't been able to hang onto. It's his way of asking Harry to stay. HARRY sits again. DURRANCE I've become like one of those old soldiers we used to laugh at. Forcing my stories on everyone. Enough medals on my uniform to light up a Christmas tree. (Filling their glasses) Have they given you back your commission? hARRY They haven't acknowledged me in any way. DURRANCE I suppose it wouldn't be the British Army if they admitted their mistakes. hARRY I don't know if it was a mistake. I was never a real soldier like you. DURRANCE A real soldier doesn't come back in a hospital ship. (Raising his glass) To Castelton and all the others we left behind. HARRY watches his friend down his whisky, sensing the guilt and pain inside. hARRY (Reassuring him gently) You did everything you could. DURRANCE You saw it happen? hARRY From a distance. I remember the entire British Square retreating in perfect order, and then these two lunatics, charging out to save their friend. (He smiles affectionately) I remember thinking there wasn't a bullet in the world that could stop you that day. DURRANCE (Ironically) Except my own. hARRY You obviously weren't meant to die. You certainly tried your best. DURRANCE chuckles, close to tears, holding them back. DURRANCE It's hard to talk like this with anyone else. They all want to know how many people you've killed, but the moment you mention the friends you've lost, their eyes glaze over. hARRY They weren't there. DURRANCE No. (A beat) Do you ever miss the desert Harry? hARRY I'm glad I'm home. DURRANCE It was the best time of my life. Whenever anyone had a problem they came to me. I never felt so needed. __ (He smiles) Maybe we should change places. HARRY isn't sure what he means. DURRANCE tops up their glasses. DURRANCE You remember the first time we led a cavalry charge in public? hARRY You wiped the floor with me. Most of my horses ended up in the bandstand. DURRANCE Ethne was watching. hARRY (Hesitating) That's right. DURRANCE We'd met her the previous night, at the regimental ball. hARRY I remember. DURRANCE You should. You were the only one she danced with. HARRY smiles but doesn't say anything. DURRANCE I've never been so jealous. I stayed up all night brooding. The next day I was determined to show you up -- prove to her I was the better soldier. hARRY (Affectionately) You were always the better soldier. DURRANCE And it still didn't make a difference. (He smiles wistfully) She was the first person I looked for in the crowd, and she was staring at you. Everyone else was applauding me, and she was staring at you. (A beat) I'm not sure if anything's changed. HARRY can't speak. He knows what DURRANCE is saying. DURRANCE (Raising his glass) To us Harry. He leans over, grinning, and touches Harry's glass. DURRANCE To you. EXT. churchyard/ glenalla - day. Church bells chime, drowned out by the excited GUESTS. The Wedding party has gathered outside the chapel, waiting for the bride. There's a flurry of activity as Ethne's carriage finally draws up. FRIENDS and FAMILY run over to greet her. HARRY's PARTY stays behind at the Church door, preparing him for her imminent arrival. GENERAL FEVERSHAM and COLONEL SUTCH make last minute adjustments to HARRY's suit and tie. WILLOUGHBY reminds TRENCH to make sure he's still got the ring. ETHNE finally emerges from the carriage, looking radiant in a white dress. HARRY tries to catch a glimpse of her, but TRENCH covers his eyes, as if it's still bad luck to see his bride. ETHNE laughs as she walks past them into the church, accompanied by her FATHER. TRENCH waits until she's safely inside, before he removes his hands from Harry's eyes. HARRY looks around, hoping to see Durrance amongst the crowd. His friend is nowhere to be seen. HARRY smiles at the other GUESTS, but he seems distracted, as if he knows in his heart Durrance won't show. Slowly the CROWD outside thins until only HARRY, TRENCH, and WILLOUGHBY remain. trENCH Ready? HARRY has one last look for Durrance, still hoping against hope, then he nods and follows his friends inside. The noise of the choir fades as the doors close behind them. For a moment we're left in the balmly stillness of the churchyard, and then, in it's place, we hear the unmistakeable whisper of the desert wind. FADE OUT. CUT TO: INT. BACK ROOM - CHURCH AT GLENALLA - DAY (CHURCH ORGAN OVER) 155 In full dress uniforms, Colonel Sutch and General Feversham work Harry over -- adjusting his collar: GENERAL FEVERSHAM All set... looking good. HARRY (mock nautical) Aye, sir. GENERAL FEVERSHAM That's enough out of you... As they shove him through the door -- turning back to Sutch: HARRY By the way, I must remember to thank you... (pause) For telling everyone I was dead. SUTCH I've never been so happy to be wrong in all my life. But I did what I thought was right.. HARRY A terrible habit. (beat) Raises all kinds of hell... As he heads out through the door, with the ORGAN PLAYING: "THE WEDDING MARCH..." SERIES OF SHOTS (MUSIC OVER): 156 - THE CHAPEL: is filled with MILITARY MEN; Feversham family and friends; Mrs. Adair; and a church full of locals. - HARRY'S POV - ON ETHNE: walking down the aisle -- as beautiful as a bride can be. DISSOLVE TO: - HARRY AND ETHNE: kissing at the altar -- joined together as man and wife, as... GENERAL FEVERSHAM (v.o.) (bellows) Officers... CUT TO: EXT. CHURCH - AFTER CEREMONY 157 ANGLE ON: the assembled military men -- in two lines, leading from the church door: GENERAL FEVERSHAM (CONT'D) (bellows) Draw... CLOSEUP: hands on hilts, as: GENERAL FEVERSHAM (bellows) Swooooords!!! TWO ROWS OF SWORDS ARE PULLED AND FLOURISHED -- INTO THE AIR! Sunlight glinting off the blades, the Officers and former Officers of the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards form a canopy, beneath which... HARRY AND ETHNE: exit the church, arm-in-arm, to the CHEERS of their families and friends... and the bitter-sweet tears of Mrs. Adair. As they move down the steps, beneath the ceremonial swords... WITH AN ARMY BAND PLAYING A ROUSING MARCH... TRACK DOWN THE LINE TO REVEAL: the joyous faces of General Feversham, Colonel Sutch, Colonel Willoughby, and Captain Trench. As their heads turn to follow the lovers... CONTINUE TRACKING TO REVEAL: an EMPTY SPACE -- amidst the row of Officers, in honor of the missing Durrance. TRACK IN TOWARD THAT EMPTY SPACE, AND RACK BEYOND IT TO REVEAL: Harry and Ethne, kissing for real... at last. FREEZE FRAME. As the MILITARY MARCH PLAYS ON; CREDITS ROLL TO... THE END.

          EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY
                         
                         LONG SHOT
          The quadrangle of Army buildings is quiet and deserted. A
          broken-down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its
          way around the quadrangle. SUPERIMPOSED over shot is the
                         LEGEND:
                         
           HAWAII, 1941
           SIX MONTHS BEFORE
                          PEARL HARBOR
                         
          The taxi pulls up across the street from camera. A soldier
          gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him.
          He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward
          camera. The taxi drives away slowly. The soldier walks toward
          steps leading to a low building. He is PREWITT (called "PREW"
          for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking. He wears
          an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where
          chevrons have been removed. He pauses, looks up over the
          door. CAMERA PANS UP to sign which reads: ORDERLY ROOM - G
          COMPANY, 219TH REGIMENT.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs
          out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed
          broom. This is PRIVATE ANGELO MAGGIO. He is violent and funny
          and sour and friendly. He sees Prewitt's legs but not his
          face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch.
                         
                          MAGGID
           Fine way to pass the time. Good for
           the mind.
                         
                          PREW
           Hello, Maggio.
                         
          Maggio turns and stares at Prew, astonished.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Prew...?
                         
                          PREW
                          (NODS)
           I transferred out of Fort Shatter.
                         
          Maggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes
          have been removed. Prew follows his glance.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           You quit the Bugle Corps...?
           2.
                         
                         
                         
          Prew nods. Maggio jerks his head toward the sign.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           To here...?
                         
                          PREW
                          (SHRUGS)
           That's what the orders say.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           You made a bad mistake. This outfit
           they can give back to Custer.
                         
          Prew smiles slightly, starts toward door.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           The Captain ain't in yet.
                         
          Prew puts down his barracks bags.
                         
                          PREY
           I'll look around.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           (smiles for first time)
           Maybe we borrow some money from a
           twenty per cent man and take a real
           trip to town some night.
                         
                          PHEW
           Maybe.
                         
          TRUCKING SHOT ALONG COMPANY STREET
          Prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street.
          He takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles
          it idly, a habit of his. He comes to the Dayroom, glances
          through the screen door, goes in.
                         
          INT. DAYROOM - DAY
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc.
          Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is
          empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool
          table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle
          mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the
          wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
          The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew
          addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly.
          He watches the balls hurry around the table.
           3.
                         
                         
                         
           WARDEN'S VOICE (O. S.)
           What're you think you're doing!?
           Why ain't you out in the field with
           the Compny? What's your name?
                         
          The voice is brawling, brash, vigorous. Prew turns slowly.
          CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE FIRST SERGEANT MILTON WARDEN,
          almost at Prew's elbow. He is thirty-four, big and powerful,
          has a neatly-trimmed moustache.
                         
                          PREW
           Prewitt. Transfer from Shafter.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yeah. I heard about you.
                         
                          PREW
           I heard about you, too, Warden.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Well, put up that cue and come
           along. This here's a rifle outfit,
           Prewitt. You ain't suppose to enjoy
           yourself before sundown. The Man's
           very particlar about little things
           like that.
                         
          Warden goes out of the Dayroom. Prew puts up the cue and
          follows him.
                         
          EXT. COMPANY STREET
                         
                         TRUCKING SHOT
          as Prew and Warden walk along the porch, Warden a few paces
          ahead. They go into the Orderly Room.
                         
          INT. ORDERLY ROOM - DAY
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          as Prew and Warden enter. Maggio is sweeping the room.
          MAZZIOLI, a bespectacled, intellectual-looking Private First
          Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers,
          etc. Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Mazzioli! Grant went to the
           hospital yesterday. Did you make up
           his sick record? Did you make a
           note for the morning report?!
           You're the Compny Clerk. The lousy
           Sickbook is your job!
           4.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           Those medics didn't get the
           Sickbook back till late yesterday --
           I'll tend to it right now --
                         
                          WARDEN
           Thanks. I already done it for you.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Maggio has swept his way over to Prew. He stops sweeping now,
          stares at the other man as if still incredulous.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           But you the beat bugler they got
           over at Shatter. You probly the
           best on this whole Rock.
                         
          In b.g., Warden has turned from Mazzioli and is looking at
          Prew. Prew looks back coolly, answers Maggio thoughtfully.
                         
                          PREW
           That's true.
                         
          Maggio wags his head, bends over to pick up wastepaper
          basket.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Well, friend, I feel for you. But
           from my position I can't quite
           reach you.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Ten-sh-HUT!
                         
          Prewitt, Mazzioli and Maggio spring to attention. The screen
          door bangs and CAPTAIN DANA HOLMES enters shot. He wears
          cavalry boots and spurs. He is about forty, unsure of
          himself, therefore always too certain with his men. He nods
          pleasantly.
                         
                          HOLMES
           At ease. Good morning, men.
           Anything special this morning,
           Sergeant Warden? I've only a few
           minutes.
                         
                          WARDEN
           New man here, sir.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Oh, yes. Bring him in.
           5.
                         
                         
                         
          Holmes goes into his office. Warden jerks his thumb toward
          the door. Prewitt goes into the office. Warden follows him.
                         
          INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Holmes is seated at his desk as Prewitt and Warden enter. A
          placard on it reads: CAPTAIN HOLMES. A smaller desk nearby
          has a placard' reading: 1ST SERGEANT WARDEN. Warden seats
          himself at this desk. On the walls are framed photographs of
          prizefighters as well as one of a large golden trophy. On
          Holmes' desk is a small framed photograph of a very
          attractive blonde woman. Prewitt comes to attention in front
          of Holmes' desk.
                         
                          PREWITT
           Sir, Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt
           reporting to the Compny Commander
           as ordered.
                         
                          HOLMES
           At ease.
           (takes papers out of
           drawer, glances through
                          THEM)
           They sent your service record
           over... Twenty-two years of age...
           born in Kentucky... enlisted first
           at Fort Myer, Virginia... Bugle
           Corps... re-enlisted for overseas
           duty... Fort Shafter... First
           Bugler...
                          (BENIGNLY)
           Prewitt, I always make it a policy
           to talk to my new men. It's
           important for an officer and his
           men to understand each other. Now I
           have a fine smooth-running outfit.
                         
          ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN
          Holmes cannot see Warden who is grinning at Prewitt with
          unholy glee.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Plenty of room for advancement for
           a man who knows how to soldier. But
           he's got to show me he's got it on
           the ball. I don't know what you've
           been used to in the Bugle Corps,
           but in my outfit we run it by the
           book. What kind of trouble were you
           in over there?
           6.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
           No trouble, sir.
                         
                          HOLMES
           What made you transfer out, then?
                         
                          PREW
           It's a personal matter, air.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Oh. I see...
                         
          He studies Prew for a moment, sees Warden on the edge of his
          chair, watching hawk-like.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Something you wanted to ask,
           Sergeant?
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (EXPLODES SUDDENLY)
           Who? Me? Whv, yes, air. You had
           Corpral's stripes in the Bugle
           Corps, Prewitt. You took a bust to
           buck Private to transfer to an
           Infantry Compny. Why? Because you
           like to hike?
                         
                          PREW
           I dint have no trouble if that's
           what you mean.
                         
                          WARDED
                          (GRINS SUDDENLY)
           Or was it just because you couldn't
           stand to bugle?
                         
                          PREW
           It was a personal matter.
                         
                          WARDEN
           That's up to the Compny Commander's
           discretion to decide.
                         
                          PREW
           (looks straight at Warden)
           All right. I was First Bugler at
           Shafter for two years. The topkick
           had a friend who transferred in
           from the states. Next day he made
           him First Bugler over me.
           7.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           And you asked out on account of
           that!?
                         
                          PREY
           Maybe I just ain't sensible... But
           that's the reason.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (SNORTS)
           His feelings were hurt! Kids they
           send us now!
                         
          Warden swings his chair around, absorbs himself in work at
          his desk as if the Prew situation is too absurd to concern
          himself with. Holmes speaks blandly, winningly.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I've got a mighty sour Company
           Bugler here... but I suppose you
           wouldn't want that job.
                         
                          PREY
           No, air.
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (SMILES)
           Well, we'll get your stripes back
           for you, maybe an extra one for
           good measure. You know why you were
           sent over here when you requested
           transfer?
                         
                          PREW
           No, sir.
                         
                          HOLDS
           I pulled a few strings. I'm the
           Regimental Boxing Coach, Prewitt. I
           saw your fight with Connors in the
           Bowl year before last. With any
           luck you should have won it. I
           thought for a while, in the second
           round, you were going to knock him
           out.
                         
                          PREW
                          (TENSE)
           Thank you, sir.

                          HOLMES
                          (BITTERLY)
           My Regiment got beaten last year in
           the finals, as you know.
                          (SAVAGE INSISTENCE)
           But I mean to win this year. And I
           will. All I've needed was a top
           middleweight.
           (waves at pictures)
           Next year I'll hang your picture up
           there with the others, my boy.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING PREW
                         
                          PREW
           I'm sorry, air. But I quit
           fighting.
                         
           HOLMES.
           Quit fighting? When? What for?
                         
                          PREW
           I just stopped, sir... After --
           Maybe you heard about what
           happened...
                         
                          HOLMEB
           You mean that fallow you hurt --
           the one that went blind?
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          Prew's lips are drawn tight. He nods almost imperceptibly.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          During this shot Maggio can be seen in b.g. through door to
          Orderly Room. He pretends to be sweeping, but stops now and
          then to listen.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Yes, it's too bad about that. I can
           understand how you feel. But those
           things happen in this game. A man
           has got to accept that possibility
           when he fights.
                         
                          PREW
           That's why I decided I would quit,
           sir.
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (LESS WARMLY)

                          HOLMES(CONT'D)
           it this way. What if all fighters
           felt like that?
                         
                          PREW
           They don't.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Would you have us disband our
           fighting program because one man
           got hurt?
                         
                          PREW
           No, sir. I dint say --
                         
                          HOLMES
           You might as well say stop war
           because one man got killed. Our
           fighting program is the best morale
           builder we have off here away from
           home.
                         
                          PREW
           I don't want it disbanded, sir.
                          (DOGGEDLY)
           But I don't see why any man should
           fight unless he wants to.
                         
                          HOLMES
           It looks to me like you're trying
           to acquire a reputation as a lone
           wolf, Prewitt. You should know that
           in the Army it's not the individual
           that counts. If a man wants to get
           ahead he has certain
           responsibilities to fulfill that go
           beyond the regulations. It might
           look as though I were a free agent,
           but I'm not. Nobody is.
                         
          Holmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes Prew is
          not going to respond further. He stands. Prew snaps to
          attention.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Maybe you'll change your mind. In
           the meantime just don't make any
           mistakes in my outfit.
                          (TO WARDEN)
           I've got to go into town. Is there
           anything else for me today,
           Sergeant?
           10.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           (holds up papers)
           Yea, sir! The Compny Pond Report's
           got to be made out. It's due
                          TOMORROW --
                         
                          HOLMES
           You make it out. Is that all?
                         
                          WARDEN
           (holds up more papers)
           No, sir!
                         
                          HOLMES
           Well, whatever it is, you fix it.
           If there's anything that has to go
           in this afternoon, sign my name. I
           won't be back.
                         
          He goes out, crossing Warden's desk and knocking a wire
          basket filled with papers on the floor. In a moment, the
          sound of the screen door slamming is heard. Warden picks up
          the papers.
                         
                          WARDEN
           He'd strangle on his own spit if I
           weren't here to swab out his throat
           for him.
                          (TO PREW)
           Come on. I'll show you the Supply
           Room.
                         
          Warden goes out to Orderly Room, Prew following.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          as Prew and Warden enter and walk through. Maggio bobs his
          head approvingly at Prew.

           When you turned down Dynanite
           Holmes' boxing squad? You put your
           head in a noose. Things are soft
           for a boxer in his Compny.
           Otherwise, you better know how to
           soljer.

           I'll take my chances.
                         
          A convertible, top down, drives by and pulls up outside the
          Orderly Room. KAREN HOLMES, a tall, lean blonde woman, gets
          out. Her skirt hikes up a little as she goes up the stairs to
          the Orderly Room. Warden and Prew stop walking and watch her.
          Karen stops, glances at Warden momentarily, then goes into
          the Orderly Room.

          They resume walking.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You'll fight, Prewitt. You'll fight
           because Captain Holmes got a bee in
           his hat he needs a winnin team to
           make Mayor. And if you don't do it
           for him you'll do it for me. I only
           been in this outfit eight months
           myself but I learned one thing. My
           job is to keep him happy. The more
           he's happy the less he bothers me
           and the better I run his Compny. So
           we know where we stand, don't we,
           kid?
                         
                          PREW
           I know where I stand. I don't
           believe that's the only way a man
           can get along.

           A man's got to make up his own mind
           and go his own way. It he don't,
           he's nothin...
                         
                          WARDEN
           Maybe back in the days of the
           pioneers a man could go his own
           way. But not in our time, kid.
           Today you got to play ball. You got
           to divide it all by two.
                         
          They have reached a Dutch door, top half open. A sign over it
          reads: SUPPLY ROOM.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT SHOOTING INTO SUPPLY ROOM
          SUPPLY SERGEANT LEVA is eating a candy bar with one hand and
          leisurely typing up a form with the other. He is a foolish-
          looking man, about thirty-five.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Lava! Can't I once walk by this
           Supply Room and find you workin
           with both hands!
                         
                          LEVA
           (comes up to door)
           I can't do no better on what you
           people pay me.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Draw some supplies for this man.
                          (TO PREW)
           That's G Compny barracks over
           there. Get rid of your bags and
           come back here, and Leva'll find
           you a cart to lug your stuff over
           in. Save you makin four five trips.
                         
                          PREW
           (surprised, pleased)
           Okay.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I just hate to see energy wasted.
           Any kind. Besides, you'll be needin
           yours.
                         
          Prew walks off, toting the barracks bags. The bang of the
          Orderly Room door is heard and Lava and Warden look in that
          direction.
                         
          LONG SHOT KAREN HOLMES FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S ANGLE
          as she walks along porch toward them. She is at a
          considerable distance. Karen is about thirty. She wears a
           13.
                         
                         
          sweater and skirt. She is aware the men are studying her.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN AND LEVA
          watching Karen. Leva leans over the counter.
                         
                          LEVA
           Her and them sweaters.
                         
          LONG SHOT KAREN FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S POV
          as she continues toward them. As much as a man can make out,
          she is probably not wearing a brassiere. Warden's and Lava's
          voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer Karen
          gets to camera. At end of the shot, as she is only a few
          yards away, they are practically whispering.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           Army women... They're cold,
           they got no more warmth than a
           diamond. There's no pleasure in
           them...
                         
                          LEVA'S VOICE
           Yeah, but this one knows the
           score... Like I been tellin you.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
                          (SARCASTIC)
           Is that right?
                         
                          LEVA'S VOICE
           Okay, not around here. But I was
           back at Fort Bliss with Holmes.
           When they was married only a year
           or two. I heard plenty about the
           lady then. Plenty.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           You heard.
                         
                          LEVA'S VOICE
           Okay, never me. But a lot of them.
           I know some of the Use she played
           'around with, don't tell me.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           I ain't tellin you. You're tellin
           me.
                         
          Karen stops, a few paces from camera.
                         
                          KAREN
           Good morning, Sergeant.

          Lava watches, listens avidly but discreetly in b.g. During
          the dialogue, Karen seems irritated by Warden, who looks at
          her coolly, appraisingly, physically.
                         
                          KAREN
           I'm looking for my husband.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Captain Holmes just went in town,
           ma'am.
                         
                          KAREN
           Oh. Of course, He was to have left
           some things for me.
                          (STUMBLES SLIGHTLY)
           That he was to have purchased. Do
           you know anything about them?
                         
                          WARDEN
           No, ma'am, I don't. Is there
           anythin I can do for you?
                         
           KAREN.
           No, thanks, Sergeant.
                         
          She makes slight move to go, pauses.
                         
                          KAREN
           He's been telling me quite a bit
           about you lately. My husband. He
           says you're very efficient.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, ma'am.
                         
                          KAREN
           What is it that makes you so
           efficient, Sergeant?
                         
                          WARDEN
           I couldn't help it if I was born
           smart, ma'am.
                         
          Karen laughs suddenly, loudly.
                         
                          KAREN
           I love that. Well, good-bye,
           Sergeant.
                         
          Karen turns and walks back up the porch toward her car.
          Warden and Leva watch her. When she is out of earshot Leva
          speaks.

           One what?
                         
                          LEVA
           One woman.

          MEDIUM SHOT 22 Karen, in a negligee, is seated at a dressing
          table, brushing her hair -- steadily, gracefully, enjoying
          the sensual pleasure of it. Karen is a woman of moods and
          tempers, spontaneous, quick to impulse. A car is heard
          pulling up in the driveway, the motor stopping. Karen's brush
          strokes become faster, rougher. The front door is heard
          opening and Holmes' voice calling, "Karen." She does not
          answer. Holmes enters. He seems to have had a few drinks.
          Through the following, Karen continues brushing her hair.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I'm sorry I'm so late. And about

                          KAREN

                          HOLMES
           Success, he said. Success in war,
           success in peacetime... And not a
           word about my promotion... There
           are times I think the Old Man's

           If you'd spend less time buttering
           Generals and more time with your
           Company, maybe you'd get that
           promotion.
                         
                          HOLDS
           The Company takes care of itself.

                          (UNEMOTIONALLY)
           From the way you look I gather your
           business wasn't too successful.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Now what does that mean?

          CLOSE SHOT KAREN SHOOTING INTO MIRROR ON DRESSING TABLE
          Karen laughs sharply, loudly, then stops suddenly as she
          looks at herself in the mirror, sees the repugnance in her
          face. She puts down the hairbrush, picks up a long comb.
                         
                          HOLMES VOICE
           If it were so, don't you think I'd
           admit it? The way things are
           between us now? What right have you
           to always be accusing me?

          They are both tense now. Holmes is out of the chair and
          pacing. Karen combs her hair spasmodically.
                         
                          HOLMES
           That again. How long will it be, I
           wonder, before I'm allowed to live
           that down? After eight years, how
           many times do I have to tell you It
           Was An Accident?
                         
                          KAREN
           That makes it all right, I suppose!
                         
                          HOLMES
           I didn't say that. I know what it's
           done to you, but --
                         
                          KAREN
           You know I hate to talk about it!
                         
          He moves over to her.
                         
                          HOLM ES
           How many times do I have to tell
           you I'm sorry, about that? How many
           times that I had no way of knowing -
                         
          He puts his hands on her shoulders. Karen shakes away, rises,
          faces him.
                         
                          KAREN
           You had a way of knowing, Dana. I
           want to go to bed. Please get out
           of my bedroom.
                         
          Holmes looks at her sullenly, then exits to adjoining room,
          closing the door behind him. There is a moment of silence,
          then a sharp snap as Karen breaks the comb in two.

          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN
          The room is fairly well filled with soldiers. The click of
          pool balls is heard over shot. Warden is reading a
          newspaper.. A column heading, conspicuous in shot, reads:
          JAPS ADVANCE IN CHINA. Warden drops the paper on his lap,
          looks toward pool table, squinting thoughtfully.

          Choate is a full Choctaw Indian, a man of great bulk and
          tolerance. He speaks in a tremendously deep bass voice. The
           18.
                         
                         
          table on one side is surrounded by the prizefighters of G
          Company. They are IRE GALOVITCH, an ape-like, bent-kneed man
          weighing about two twenty, with a widow's peak almost to his
          eyebrows; BALDY DHOM, chunky and tough, his head as bald as
          an orange; TURP THORNHILL, a stringy, chinless Mississipian;
          HENDERSON, a tall, hard Texan; CHAMP WILSON, wiry and good-
          looking. They are all Sergeants except Wilson, who is a
          Corporal. The men have been heckling Prew and are watching
          with cold belligerence. Choate, bending over his cue, shoots
          and misses.
                         
                          CHOATE
           I'm coldern a Idaho winter tonight.
                         
          Prew shoots, makes a brilliant shot.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Man, what I would not give to have
           this character in the corner
           poolroom in my home town: I'd dress
           him up on overhalls and a straw hat
           and put a grass in his teeth, and I
           would make a whole mint of ghelt
           off him!
                         
          Choate laughs deeply. Prew sizes up a new shot.
                         
                          WILSON
           We'd of won last year if we had a
           good middleweight. You box as good
           as you used to over at Shatter
           we're a cinch this year.
                         
          Prew doesn't respond. He bends over his cue again.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           You ain't forget the Division
           champs get ten day furloughs, did
           you, son? Ey?
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           You no talk now, Prewitt. But out
           in field with us you sing different
           song. An don't think you are tough
           guy. Quickest way to stockade is
                          BEING TOUGH
           guy.
                         
                          HENDERSON
           You heard him. Better think it
           over.

                          MAGGIO
           Lissen, it's his right not to fight
           if he don't want. Without bein
           kicked around. Now, we playin pool.
           Whyn't you take off?
                         
                          DHOM
           You want a busted head, Maggio?
                         
                          MAGGIO
                          (SERIOUSLY)
           No.
                         
                          DHOM
           Then keep your big nose out
           altogether.
           (turns back to Prew)
           Trainin season starts next week --
                         
          Prew has been growing more and more agitated, as much by an
          inner turmoil as by the men. His control snaps suddenly.
                         
                          PREW
           I told you I quit fightin! I'm
           through! An that's all she wrote:
           You guys want to put the screws on,
           go ahead. I can take anything you
           hand out!
                         
                          DHOM
           Okay, Prewitt. No halts barred.
                         
          The five men move off, file out of the Dayroom.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          His paper still on his lap. He has been watching. He wears a
          faint smile of respect.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PHEW, MAGGIO, CHOATE
          Prew chalks his cue, hands trembling, turns to Maggio.
                         
                          PREW
           Thanks.
                         
                          MAGGIO

           kid. You probly be seein it often
           before you die.

          INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND CHOATE
          In b.g. a few of the men are moving to and from the latrine
          but most of them are in their bunks. Over shot the sound of a
          bugle blowing Tattoo is heard. Lights are being extinguished
          in various parts of the room. Prew and Choate are lying on
          adjoining bunks, smoking. Choate's voice is almost linked to
          his last speech of preceding scene.
                         
                          CHO ATE
           ... oh, sure, we got a few bad non-
           coms and we got Dynamite Holmes for
           a Captain. But I been around twenty
           years in this Army. They even up.
                         
          In b. g. Warden and SERGEANT PETE (POP) KARELSEN come through
          from the latrine. The latter is a grizzled, crumbled dog-
          face, about fifty.
                         
                          CHOATE
           Take A Compny. They got the best
           Compny Commander I ever saw. But
           their Topkick -- he ain't no
           Warden.
                         
          Warden stops beside Prew and Karelsen moves on, going in to a
          small room off the main squadroom. Warden's big, powerful
          body is covered only by a towel around his loins. He smiles
          at Prew.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Hello, kid. Everythin nice and
           comfy?
                         
                          PREW
           Never better.
                         
                          WARDEN
           'at's the lull before the storm,
           kid. Set yourself.
                         
          He moves off, goes into the room he shares with Karelsen.
           21.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
           What's the deal with him, anyway? I
           can't figure him.
                         
          The lights are almost all off and activity in the room has
          ended.
                         
                          CHOATE
           The Warden? He's a wild man. He was
           in the 15th when they seen their
           action in the Settlement in
           Shanghai. I heard about it down in
           the Philippes even. He got himself
           a DSC and a Purple Heart out of it
           but you'd never know it if I dint
           tell you. This next war comes,
           Warden'll be right in there,
           standin up on the skyline, trio to
           get himself killed, but nothing
           will ever touch him. He'll come
           through maddern, wildern, craziern
           ever. All I know is he's the best
           soljer I ever saw...
                         
          The lights are all out now and the room is in darkness.

          TRUCKING SHOT PLATOON OF MEN
          carrying rifles, marching at attention. Prew is FEATURED in
          shot; a light smile of pleasure as he moves along. Choate,
          bringing up the rear, is singing the Regimental Marching Song
          in a wonderful basso. Dhom marches on one side of the
          platoon, Galovitch on the other. Dhom calls out the "huts."
                         
          CLOSE SHOT FEET OF MEN MARCHING
          They are in perfect unison.

           Prewitt! Get in step, Prewitt!
                         
          Prew frowns slightly. He hops once, changing stride, realizes
          he is now out of step.
                         
                          GALOVITCH'S VOICE
           Prewitt! Dis a drill, not picnic!
           Get in step!

          Prew hops again, changing step. He marches along. Dhom's
          voice commands "Platoon -- Halt!" Prew and men around him
          come to halt.

          Prew steps to the front, still smiling faintly.

          MEDIUM SHOT THE PLATOON
          kneeling over their rifles, laid out on shelter halves. Prew
          is FEATURED in shot. His shirt is wet and he is sweating
          heavily, as if he has just come from the run around the
          track. Henderson stands in front of the group, instructing.
                         
                          HENDERSON
           -- rifle's your beat friend. In
           case them weapons jams in combat
           could mean life or death. You got
           to know 'em inside out. Now I want
           you to strip them weapons and put
           it together again.

           Go!
                         
          The men start taking their rifles apart as fast as they can.
          Henderson walks around watching them.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND MAGGIO
          stripping rifles. Prew is efficient and brilliantly fast,
          Maggio fumbling and slow. Maggio keeps looking over at Prew,
          admiring his speed.

          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          as he strips the rifle. (This mechanical operation should be
          interesting to audiences; a good man can field strip the
          weapon in thirty or forty seconds.) Prew finishes the job and
          CAMERA MOVES to CLOSE on shelter half where all the parts are
          laid out.

           put it together.
                         
          Prew's hands start to work over rifle parts, putting them
          together.

          in Prew's hands, assembled, CAMERA PULLS BACK as Prew stands
          up, holding the weapon. The rest of the men are still working
          over their rifles, Maggio is staring up at Prew in awe.
          Henderson grabs the rifle from Prew, turns his back to him,
          pretending to squint along barrel.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT HENDERSON
          looking along barrel. SHOT FEATURES his thumb as he flips the
          rear sight to one side. Henderson turns around and ANGLE
          WIDENS to include Prew. He throws the rifle at Prew, who
          catches it, staggering back.
                         
                          HENDERSON
           Your rear sight's way off! You'd be

           That's what comes when a soljer

                          (TO PREW)
           You better get down to the track
           and carry it around a few times.
           Maybe that'll teach you...

          GROUP SHOT BAYONET PRACTICE
          The platoon is divided into teams of two. Thornhill is the
          instructor. This is actual hand-to-hand training. Prew wields
          his rifle, bayonet fixed, in expert thrusts. Maggio is
          fighting in next lane. Thornhill walks behind Prew, trips him
          quickly as he passes. Prew falls off balance. His opponent
          smashes his rifle against Prew's, knocks it to the ground.
          Prew whirls on Thornhill in protest.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           Wide open, ey, Prewitt? Maybe seven
           laps'll teach you to watch

          Maggio, wielding his rifle madly, yells over.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Hey, I saw that -- I saw what you

          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND MAGGIO
          toiling around track together, holding rifles.

          TRUCKING SHOT OUTSIDE SUPPLY ROOM
          Maggio and Prew trudge wearily along the porch, rifles on
          shoulders. Their sweaty uniforms are plastered to their
          bodies.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           I use to think a shipping clerk was
           a dog's life.
           (sighs, shakes head)
           What I would not give to be back in
           Gimbel's basement!
                         
          As they come up to the Supply Room, Warden, neat and cool, is
          leaning on the counter. He steps aside to let them pass,
          beams at Prew.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Chow's almost over, men. Better
           hurry up and wash. `less of course
           you'd rather go in the way you are.

          Maggio gives Warden a dirty look. Prew's expression is
          noncommittal. They carry their rifles into the Supply Room.
          Leva comes up to the door as Warden turns to go back to the
          Orderly Room. As he does, Karen's convertible comes down the
          street. Warden stops, watches it.
                         
          LONG SHOT FROM WARDEN'S POV
          as Karen drives by, turning her head slightly toward Warden.
          There is the vaguest trace of i smile.

          as he turns to watch the departing car.
                         
                          LEVA
           I'm tellin you, Top, she's trouble.
           You better keep your mind off what
           you're thinkin.
                         
          CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT
          of Warden, still looking after the car, thinking.

          INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES
          It is a gloomy, rainy day and the lights are on in the
          office. Warden is at his desk, working. Holmes is buckling on
          his trench coat. He wears a happy smile.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I won't be back in time to take
           Retreat.
           (winks at Warden)
           Or Reveille either, probably.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, sir.
                         
                          HOLMES
           (strides back and forth;
                          JOVIALLY)
           All work and no play, Sergeant. All
           you do is sit around sweating over
           this paper and that. There are
           other things in this world beside
           work.
                         
          Warden carries some official papers to Holmes' desk.
                         
                          HOLMES

           26.
                          HOLMES(CONT'D)
           You ought to get out more yourself,
           Warden.
                         
          Warden is looking directly at the picture of Karen on Holmes'
          desk.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I've been considering it.
                         
          He turns aside as Holmes straightens up.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Well, I'm going.
                         
          He claps Warden on the back fraternally.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I'm leaving it in your care,
           Sergeant.
                         
                          WARDEN
           It'll be here when you get back.
                         
          Holmes goes out. Warden turns back to Holmes' desk. He is
          still holding the papers in one hand. He looks at Karen's
          picture, picks it up with his other hand, squints at it,
          considering the chances very, very carefully.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          standing on the open porch, in the rain. He wears a GI
          raincoat. He is squinting at the door with the same
          expression he used looking at Karen's picture. He takes a
          deep breath as if he were going off a high diving board, then
          knocks briskly. A shadow moves across the room behind the
          curtains. Then Karen opens the door. She is in shorts and a
          blouse.
                         
                          KAREN
           Oh. If it isn't Sergeant Warden.
           You better step inside or you'll
           get wet.
                         
          Warden opens the screen door and jumps in past the water
          running off the eaves.

          as Warden jumps in. He takes off his rain hat.
           27.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
          I am wet.
                         
                          KAREN
          If you're looking for my husband,
          he isn't here.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (taking the long chance)
          And if I'm not looking for him?
                         
                          KAREN
                          (UNSMILING)
          He still isn't here. If that does
          you any good.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (QUICKLY)
          Well, I'm looking for him. Do you
          know where he is?
                         
                          KAREN
          I haven't the slightest idea.
          Perhaps he's in town. I guess it
          was `in town' the way you put it,
          wasn't it? Or perhaps he's at the
          Club. Having a drink.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (fishes in his pocket,
           brings out papers)
          I got some papers it's important
          for him to sign. Today.
                         
                          KAREN
                          (TURNS)
          I'll try phoning him at the Club
          for you.
                         
                          WARDEN
          I never like to disturb a man
          drinking.
                         
                          KAREN
                          (TURNS BACK)
          What is it you want, Sergeant?
                         
                          WARDEN
          I could use a drink myself right
          now. Bad. Anyway, I got a faint
          suspicion the Captain's `in town.'
          Ain't you going to ask me in?
           28.
                         
                         
                         
          Karen finally smiles, faintly. She goes into the kitchen,
          leaving the door open. Warden follows her.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN HOLMES HOUSE - DAY
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The kitchen is small and undistinguished. Karen takes a
          whisky bottle from a cabinet, pours a straight, stiff drink,
          puts it on the sink. Warden puts the papers down and drinks.
          Karen sits on a high kitchen stool.
                         
                          KAREN
           You're taking an awful chance, you
           know. My maid is liable to be home
           any time.
                         
                          WARDEN
           No she won't. Thursday's her day
           off.
                         
          He takes off his raincoat, drops it on a chair.
                         
                          KAREN
           You think of everything, don't you,
           Sergeant?
                         
                          WARDEN
           I try. In my position you have to.
                         
                          KAREN
           (goes to sink, picks up
                          THE PAPERS)
           Are these really important?
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes. But not important they get
           signed today. Tomorrow's okay.
                         
          Karen suddenly, deliberately, rips the papers in half. Then
          she tears them into bits and throws them into the
          wastebasket. Warden appreciates the gesture, relaxes for the
          first time. He grins widely.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I got carbons of those back at the
           office. So it won't be much work to
           fix them up.
                         
          Warden's control has begun to affect Karen's now. She is
          losing her poise.
           29.
                         
                         
                         
                          KAREN
           That's what I like about you,
           Sergeant. You have confidence. It's
           also what I dislike about you.
                         
                          WARDEN
           It's not confidence. It's honesty.
                         
                          KAREN
           Honesty? How did you acquire such
           an old-fashioned virtue?
                         
                          WARDEN
           I figgered out one day it was the
           shortest distance between two
           points.
                         
                          KAREN
           Well, he's clever as well as
           virile.
                         
                          WARDEN
           No -- it's just that I hate to see
           a beautiful woman goin all to
           waste.
                         
          He moves close to Karen, is on the verge of embracing her.
          Greatly tempted but greatly disturbed, she turns away. During
          next she pours herself a drink, the bottle shaking in her
          hand. Her tone is no longer brittle. It is bitter.
                         
                          KAREN
           Waste, did you say? Now that's a
           subject I might tell you something
           about. There's we. And then there's
           waste. Positive and negative. The
           negative is sometimes more
           interesting... more evil. For
           example -- what about the house
           without a child? Tell me your
           thoughts, Sergeant.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You're going to cry.
                         
                          KAREN
           Not if I can help it.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Please don't cry... I can't stand
           to see somebody cry.
           30.
                         
                         
                         
          Karen turns to face him as he picks up his raincoat, is about
          to put it on.
                         
                          KAREN
           What are you doing?
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'm leaving. Isn't that what you
           want?
                         
                          KAREN
                          (SLOWLY)
           I don't know, Sergeant. To be
           honest, I don't know.
                         
          They stare squarely at each other, both puzzled and a little
          afraid of their emotions. This is something neither had
          counted on.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I know a beach near Diamond Head.
           Nobody ever goes there. The cars on
           the highway pass above and they
           never know it's there. You feel
           like you used to feel when you were
           a kid, hiding by yourself in a
           cave, watching the others hunting
           you.
                         
          Karen turns, goes to the sink, puts the whisky bottle back in

           How about Payday?
                         
          Karen is trying hard to regain her glassy composure. She is
          unsmiling again.
                         
                          KAREN
           You don't have to spend money on
           me, Sergeant.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I just like to have some on me when
           I take out a woman. Can you get
           away?
                         
                          KAREN
           Maybe.

          Warden grins as he puts on his raincoat. He goes to the door
          to the pantry, pauses there.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'll be in Kuhio Park. Say, nine
           o'clock. Payday.
                         
          Karen leans back against the sink, watches him go out to the
          pantry. A moment later the sound of the door is heard as he
          leaves the house. She turns on the faucet, starts to rinse,
          the glasses they have used. Suddenly she turns the faucet on
          full force, watches it pound into the sink.
                         
           FADE OUT.

          MEDIUM SHOT HOLMES GALOVITCH THORNHILL WILSON DHOM HENDERSON
          The men are grouped around Holmes. He is pressing hard to
          pretend equanimity. The Sergeants appear somewhat baffled but
          determined.
                         
                          HOLMES
           -- this man Prewitt's been here
           over a month now. I expected you
           mend have him around before this.
                         
                          HENDERSON
           We've been runnin him pretty hard.
           But he don't faze.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Maybe he needs a good dose of The
           Treatment.
                         
          The men react to the phrase; The Treatment is obviously
          reserved for very special, intractable cases. They consider
          it silently for a moment or two.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           A double dose needs him to be
           given.

           You understand. I don't want
           any rough stuff.

           good leaders. And good leaders --
                         
          The music of the forthcoming MONTAGE drowns Holmes' words as
          he continues.

          The MONTAGE consists of a continuous stream of SUPERIMPOSURES
          depicting Prew's growing humiliation and exhaustion at the
          hands of the non-corns. Mingling with the background shots
          are VARIOUS ANGLES of CLOSEUPS of Prew. As the speed of the
          sequence increases, the stubborn smile on his face gives way
          to hurt, bitterness, anger... Over shots we occasionally hear
          stray shouts of the non-corns as they belabor Prew, but for
          the most part these and other dialogue are obliterated by
          MUSIC. The MONTAGE can be selected and created from the
                         FOLLOWING:

          Joy in baiting Prew.

          with the platoon going through, crouched low, live ammunition
          spattering around them. Prew, nearest camera, is lower than
          any man in the line. Over shot we hear a snatch of Wilson's
          Voice yelling at Prew to get lower.
                         
          CLOSE FLASH WILSON AND PREW
          Wilson bawling Prew out, thumbing him to one side of obstacle

          the obstacle course. Snatch of mingled voices of non-coms
          yelling "Keep it downs", "Get that nose in the mud!", etc.
          Prew is utterly spent. His face drops into the mud, which
          splatters up, obscuring the screen.

          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          bent over the sink, scraping, washing and rinsing cooking
          pans and mixing basins. He hangs the soap bucket on the hot
          faucet and turns it on full force. As he does, PRIVATE
          WILLARD, a fat, whining cook, dumps an additional huge pile
          of pans before him. Prew looks at them ruefully. Willard says
          something to him with a "hustle up" gesture. The faucet
          drowns the words.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT ANOTHER PART OF KITCHEN PREW AT SINK IN B.G.
          Men are working in the steady, helpless motion of the KP.
          Waiters swing in and out of the entrances leading to the mess
          halls, carrying large trays.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT STARK
          The Mesa Sergeant, a tall, gaunt man, surveys the scene
          possessively. Maggio, Dining Room Orderly today, wearing a
          soiled white coat, flashes by to the mess hall, almost
          dropping his loaded tray in his haste.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PRIVATE TREADWELL
          A slow, lazy, heavy man, peeling potatoes. There is a large
          kettle filled with dirty water in front of him in which the
          potatoes are floating. Treadwell stabs at one with a long
          fork, misses it. He stabs again, almost in slow motion,
          misses again. He sees Stark glowering over him.
                         
                          TREADWELL
           Ah+m suppose to be a automatic
           rifle man, not a spud-cutter.

                          (DISGUSTEDLY)

           to do would be holler war at you
           and it'd be over the hill and far
           away.
                         
          Stark walks off.

          He is surprised and pleased as he spears a potato this time.
          He raises it triumphantly like a caught fish.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND WILLARD
          The faucet is still on and we cannot hear what Willard says
          as he dumps more pans before Prew. However, he is obviously
          complaining that Prew is slow. Prew, sweating and angry,
          barks something back at him and turns the faucet off.
                         
                          PREW

           couple more arms?!
                         
          Stark, always alert to trouble, comes into shot. Willard sees
          him and speaks with whining dignity, for Stark's benefit.
                         
                          WILLARD
           All I ask is that you keep the pans
           washed up so they're clean when I
           need them. In order that I am
           allowed to cook the kind of food
           required for men who work hard all
           day and who need good nourishing
           food to get their nourishment.
                         
                          STARK
           Hole up 'at noise. This man's hot
           as a forty-five shootin downhill.
                         
                          WILLARD
                          (TERRIBLY INJURED)
           How you think I can do my job if
           the Mess Sergeant takes sides with
           a goldbricking KP? What do you
           think I am?

           cook.
                         
          As Willard retires, Maggio pours through from the mass hall.
          Screaming joyously, he shoves two empty platters in front of
          him.

          Nobody pays any attention but Prew, who smiles at him. Maggio
          winks back.

          Maggio passes camera, leaving the shot and disclosing Warden,
          who has entered from the mess hall in his wake. He carries a
          dish of eggs and sausage and is leaning against a pastry
          table. He is grinning lovingly toward Prew. He strolls over
          to Prew. He eats through following. The smile never leaves
          his face, broadens as the scene progresses.
                         
                          WARDEN

                          WARDEN
           I didn't say you minded it, kid. I
           just said you looked tard. Drawn to

           you and Dynamite and The Treatment.
           I'm twice the man you are. If you
           dint have them stripes I'd take you
           out on the green and beat you to a
           pulp.

          Warden looking at Prew's hand. Warden's grin broadens with
          something more than sarcasm. He is 'impressed and pleased by
          Prew's honest anger.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Don't throw it, Prewitt. It might
           break on my head. And that would
           cost you one thin dime next Payday.
                         
          Warden deliberately turns his back and walks off. Prew looks
          after him. CAMERA MOVES IN to FEATURE his hand on the mug. He
          grasps it tighter, then lets it fall back into the soapy
          water,

          The bugle is heard over shot. A line of spruced-up men
          stretches through the mess hall. A blanket is spread over a
          table and behind it sits Holmes, flanked by Warden and
          Mazzioli. In front of Holmes is a pile of greenbacks and a
          cigar box filled with silver. He is paying out the man at the
          head of the line.

          Holmes looks them over, then up at the perfect knot in his
          tie. He stares at Prew as if trying to fathom him.
                         
                          HOLMES

          Holmes' hands clench. He seems about to fly into a rage when
          he senses a motion at his side. He turns to see Warden
          looking straight at him. Warden's face has the same
          meaningfully expressionless look as Prew's. Holmes wilts
          before it, turns to Mazzioli.

          Payday night. A gay, noisy jamboree. Soldiers, mostly in
          civilian clothes, and uniformed sailors swarm down the
          street. Taxi drivers arguing with their fares as they pull up
          at bars. Filipinos padding in twos and threes.

          MEDIUM SHOT AT ENTRANCE
          Maggio and Prew, dressed in slacks and Aloha shirts, stand in
          front of what looks like a renovated residence. They give
          evidence of having already accomplished a little substantial
          drinking. The sound of loud piano playing is heard from
          within. A sign over the door reads: NEW CONGRESS CLUB - SOFT
          DRINKS - DANCING - RECREATION - MEMBERS ONLY. The door opens
           39.
                         
                         
          and MRS. KIPFER stands at the threshold. She is a
          sophisticated-looking woman with upswept hair, wears an
          evening gown with a corsage of orchids. The piano music,
          louder with the opening of the door, continues through all of
          the following. The pianist is hammering out "I Don't Want To
          Set The World On Fire" (or a similar hit of 1941).
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Greetings, Mrs. Kipfer.
                         
           MRS. KIPPER
                          (CORDIALLY)
           Why, it's Angelo Maggio.
                         
          He barges past her through the door. Mrs. Kipfer frowns and
          follows him. Prew shrugs and goes in after her.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          as Prew enters behind Mrs. Kipfer. The vestibule has an old
          South feeling of mustiness and respectability. Maggio is
          handing some bills to ANNETTE, a young, brash-looking girl,
          who sits behind a reception desk.

           MRS. KIPPER
           Angelo, I don't believe I've met
           your friend. And you know how I
           hate to find you boys in this
           condition...
                         
                          MAGGIO
           There. You see. Any time women see
           a soldier, think he's drunk. Why?
           You know why?
                         
                          PREW
           Because he is.
                         
           MRS. KIPPER
           Heavy drinking simply doesn't mix
           with the entertainment business.
           Every respectable place must
           consider its future.
                         
                          PREW
           Mrs. Kipfer, ma'am, I give you my
           solemn word your future will be
           safe with us.
           40.
                         
                         
                         
          Maggio nods vigorously in agreement, then pushes through the
          heavy curtains which separate the vestibule from the room
          beyond. Mrs. Kipfer looks after him a little unhappily.
                         
           MRS. KIPPER
           Angelo is one of my favorites.
           Annette, dear, take care of this
           gentleman, will you, please?
                         
          Mrs. Kipfer exits through the curtains. Annette takes a card
          from file, picks up pen.

          Prew grins, digs in his pocket for money.

                         FULL SHOT
          Several rooms branch off from this main one. There are about
          a dozen soldiers in civilian clothes -- and about a dozen
          hostesses. Several couples are dancing. The man at the piano
          is banging away, his music clashing cacophonically with a
          jukebox record from an adjoining room. CAMERA PANS as Mrs.
          Kipfer moves to and fro encouraging the men to enjoy
          themselves. The New Congress is a sort of primitive U.S.O., a
          place of well-worn merriment. It is not a house of
          prostitution but the girls look available for goosing... all
          but one we see at the end of the PAN. She sits alone on a
          couch. This is LORENE. There is an innocent, child-like look
          about her. Her hair is done demurely in a circular roll low
          on her neck. She is about twenty-four. She is reading a
           41.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT "FATSO" JUDSON
          pounding the piano as if he is trying to knock the keys out.
          He has an enormous head and a hogshead chest. He resembles
          Porky Pig. His dead eyes look like two beads of caviar spaced
          far apart on a great white plate.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR CURTAINS TO VESTIBULE
          Maggio is attempting some serious dancing with SANDRA, a very
          tall girl. Fatso's furious tempo and tune keep drowning the
          langorous tango coming from the jukebox. Maggio keeps
          switching his style as he tries to get out of the range of
          the piano but cannot. He is very annoyed. He and Sandra dance
          out of shot, as Prew and Annette enter from the vestibule.
          CAMERA PANS them to a trio of girls on a couch.
                         
                          ANNETTE
           ... Girls, here's some new poison.
           This is Billy and Jean and Nancy.
                         
          The girls smile, ad-lib hellos. Prew is looking over the
          girls' heads at someone in rear of room out of shot.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT LORENE FROM PREW'S POV
          As if she senses someone is staring at her, she looks up from
          the magazine, smiles serenely across the room.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING PREW AND ANNETTE
          as she reacts sourly to Prew's reaction to Lorene. He seems
          transfixed.
                         
                          ANNETTE
           Don't tell me the Princess is your
           style.
                         
          Annette takes his arm, moves him toward two quite good-
          looking girls talking to a soldier.
                         
                          ANNETTE
           Meet Suzanne and Roxanne.
                         
          The girls greet him heartily but Prew is looking back over
          his shoulder at Lorene. Annette plucks his sleeve with
          haughty disdain.
                         
                          ANNETTE
           Much as I adore your company, you
           must allow me to tear myself away.
           I see a few friends at the door.
                          (SNAPS)
           Also I can see I will be of no use

          She walks off. The other girls resume talking to the soldier.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT LORENE
          smiling back. Her head tilts up slowly as if someone is
          coming toward her. Prew comes into shot and stands before
          her, tongue-tied. She pats the couch. Her voice is low-
          pitched, poised.
                         
                          LORENE
           Would you like to sit down?

           I haven't seen you in here before.
                         
          Prew gestures with the membership card.
                         
                          PREW
           I dint know about this place till

           We're stationed at Schofield.
                         
                          LORENE
           Oh. Somehow I didn't think you were
           a soldier.
                         
                          PREW
           (bridles a bit)
           Well, I am. And I'm in for the
           whole ride. I'm a thirty-year man.
                         
                          LORENE
           I suppose it's different when a
           fellow is going to make a career of
           it.
                         
                          PREW
           There ain't anythin wrong with a
           soljer that ain't wrong with
           everyone else.
                         
          Lorene smiles her fatal smile at Prew's seriousness.

                          LORENE
           I like you just the same. I liked
           you the minute I saw Annette
           bringing you in.
                         
                          PREW
                          (MELTS)
           Me, too. I mean when I came in. I
           saw you over here --
                         
          There is a commotion across the room. A group of man and
          girls are surrounding the piano. Fatso has stopped playing
          and a shouting argument is going on between him and Maggio.
          Prew looks over, concerned.
                         
                          FATSO'S VOICE
           I'll play loud as I want, ya little
           Wop!
                         
          A babble of voices drowns out Maggio's reply.
                         
                          PREW
           Friend of mine.
                          (RISES)
           You wait right here for me, will
           ya?
                         
                          LORENE
                          (SMILES SWEETLY)
           Surely.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT AT PIANO
          where two men are holding Fatso and three girls are
          restraining Maggio. The others are amused by the quarrel, but
          Fatso and Maggio are deadly serious.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Mess with me, Fatstuff, I'll pull
           you apart!
                         
                          FATSO
           You're the kind of character I eat
           for breakfast, ya little --
                         
          Maggio breaks away from the girls and rushes toward Patso but
          Prew, stepping through the group, grabs him. Mrs. Kipfer
          bustles into the melee.
                         
           MRS. KIPFER
           Now, you gentlemen know I will not
           have any of this sort of thing.

                          MAGGIO
           Shut up, you Wop, he says to me!
                         
                          FATSO
           Little Mussolini here tryin to tell
           me what way to play the piano.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Yeah, my ear drums fit to bust
           already with that noise!
                         
           MRS. KIPFER
           You man can simply leave if you're
           not going to behave yourselves.
                         
                          PREW
           Come on, Angelo, come on --
                         
                          MAGGIO
           -- Ony my friends can call me Wop --
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT AT SIDE OF ROOM
          where Prew hauls Maggio away from the piano.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           (has been watching)
           You know who that guy is, buddy?
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Sure, I know who he is. Whadda I
           care?
                         
                          PREW
           Who is he?
                         
                          SOLDIER
           Fatso Judson. Sergeant of the Guard
           at the Post Stockade.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FATSO JUDSON
          settling down at the piano again. He glances over in
          direction of Maggio with a mean smile. Then he starts to
          hammer the keys viciously.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO PEW SOLDIER
          as the music starts, Maggio stiffens, turns as if to go back.
          Prew holds tight, to his arm.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           -- I'm tellin you, leave him be.
           Nets danger. I seen him nearly
           murder a guy once. He likes it.
           45.
                         
                         
                         
          Sandra comes over, disengages Prew's arm from Maggio's, puts
          her own around him.
                         
                          SANDRA
           All right, bully boy, now you won
           the war, let's dance.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           (beginning to quiet down)
           First I got to calm my nerves. Come
           on with me to a phone booth or some
           thin.
           (slaps himself on belly)
           Where I will unveil this fifth of
           whisky I got under this loose
           flowing sports shirt.
                         
          He and Sandra start off toward an adjoining room. Prew
          smiles, turns back toward Lorene. The smile fades.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT FROM PREW'S POV
          Lorene is looking at another soldier, on the couch beside
          her, with her rapt, innocent expression.

          as he crosses room to Lorene, hurt and disappointed. CAMERA
          HOLDS on MEDIUM SHOT as he comes up to her and the soldier, a
          talkative man named BILL.
                         
                          BILL
           -- you go along as fast as forty
           miles per through that surf and
           your balance has got to be letter
           perfect.
                         
                          PREW
           Hey, I thought you were gonna wait.
                         
                          LORENE
           (looks up, smiles)
           Bill here was telling me about
           surfboarding.
                         
                          BILL
           Hello, friend.
                         
                          LORENE
                          (PATS COUCH)
           Sit down and just listen. He
           describes it thrillingly.
                         
          Prew sits down, disgruntled. Bill notes his expression.
           46.
                         
                         
                         
                          BILL
           You know anything about
           surfboarding?
                         
                          PREW
           No. Nothing. Not a thing.
                         
                          BILL
           You must be stationed inland then.
           I'm at DeRussey so I get lots of
           chances.
                         
                          PREW
           Yeah? But then we got mountains.
           You know anything about mountain
           climbing?
                         
                          BILL
           A little bit. Are you a mountain
           climber?
                         
                          PREW
           No. You know anything about flying
           an airplane?
                         
          Lorene is frowning now.
                         
                          BILL
           I've had a few lessons.
                         
                          PREW
           Well, I can't fly either. What
           do you know about deep sea diving?
                         
                          LORENE
           Do you want to move into another
           room, Bill?
                         
                          BILL
           Sure. The air in here seems to have
           gotten very smelly, hasn't it?
                         
                          PREW
           Yeah, I noticed that, too --
                         
                          BILL
           Listen, fellow --
                         
                          LORENE
           Shall we go, then?
           47.
                         
                         
                         
          She and Bill rise. She smiles tremulously at him as she takes
          his arm and they start off. She throws a severe glance over
          her shoulder at Prew.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
          He settles lower in the couch, the picture of frustration and
          hopelessness. He pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights
          it.
                         
          EXT. KUHIO PARK - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PARK BENCH
          Karen sits on the bench, her ankles crosses primly, very ill
          at ease. There is Payday activity here also; amorous
          strolling couples; men in ones and twos looking for pickups.
          Several unattached men pass Karen, ogle her. She is about to
          get up and leave when Warden comes into shot, stands over
          her. His civilian suit is neat and well-cut. Both are
          strained, awkward, antagonistic. Now that the step has been
          taken they are not at all sure it was a clever one.
                         
                          KAREN
           Why, hello. I didn't think you were
           coming.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Why not? I'm not late.
                         
                          KAREN
           No, I guess you're not. But then I
           came a little early. I must have
           been overanxious. You weren't
           overanxious though, were you? You
           got here right on the dot.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Maybe I'd of been early too only I
           stopped to get a drink.
                         
                          KAREN
           You certainly chose a savory spot
           for our meeting.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Would you rather it'd been the
           cocktail lounge of the Royal?
                         
                          KAREN
           No, but I've had five chances to be
           picked up in the last few minutes.
           48.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           (sits beside her on the
                          BENCH)
           That's par for the course around
           here.
                         
                          KAREN
           Well, I don't care for it. I never
           went in much for back-alley loving.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Didn't you?
                         
                          KAREN
           You probably think I'm a tramp,
           don't you?
                         
                          WARDEN
           What makes you think I'd think
           that?
                         
                          KAREN
           Don't try to be gallant, Sergeant.
           If you think this is a mistake,
           come right out and say so.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (OUTRAGE)
           Listen, what started all this,
           anyway? Why'm I shakin inside like
           a school kid out with teacher!
           Where'd I come up with a yen for of
           all things the Compny Commander's
           wife! And her actin like Lady
           Astor's horse all because I only
           got here on time!
                         
          Warden's burst shatters the tension. Karen breaks into
          laughter. After a moment, Warden joins in.
                         
                          KAREN
           On the other hand, I've got a
           bathing suit under my dress.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Funny. I got one in a U-Drive-It
           parked around the corner.
                         
          He takes her hand. They rise and walk away, backs to camera.
          They merge with the other couples in the little park.

          MEDIUM SHOT COUCH
          Fatso's piano music o.s. Prew is slumped on the couch. He
          stubs out the cigarette, which is almost burnt down. He sees
          someone coming toward him, slowly raises his eyes. Lorene
          comes into shot, looks down at him.
                         
                          PREW
           How's the surfboard rider?
                         
                          LORENE
           That was a terrible way to have
           acted. What you did.
                         
                          PREW
           I was jealous.

           You're a funny one.
                         
                          PREW
           What do you dames want? To take
           the heart out of a man and tie it
           up in barbed wire?
                         
                          LORENE
           (angry because she really
                          LIKES PREW)
           Now, look here, what do you think
           Mrs. Kipfer pays us for? We're
           hired to be nice to all the boys.
           They're all alike. Is it so
           important?
                         
                          PREW
                          (STANDS; URGENTLY)
           Yes, it's important. Maybe we seem
           all alike but none of us is ever
           all alike.
                          (PAUSE)
           All right, I'm sorry about before.
                         
                          LORENE
           (touched by his outburst)
           That piano is about to drive me out
           of my mind. Let's go up to Mrs.
           Kipfer's suite and sit there. She
           lets us use it sometimes... for
           somebody special.
                         
                          PREW
           Are you mad?
           50.
                         
                         
                         
                         
                          LORENE
           No, I'm not mad.
                         
                          PREW
           Because if you're still mad I'd
           just rather we called the whole
           thing off.
                         
                          LORENE
           (takes his arm)
           You certainly are a funny one.
                         
          They walk away from camera, merging with the others in-the
          room.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          EXT. OCEAN AND BEACH - NIGHT
                         
          FULL SHOT WAVE
          sweeping over camera, spray flying.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT ON BEACH
          A tiny beach set among rocks. The pale sand glows in the
          moonlight. Warden, in a bathing suit, is lighting a fire
          about ten yards from the water's edge. Karen is just stepping
          out of her dress; her bathing suit is underneath. A couple of
          GI blankets near the fire. Her teeth are beginning to chatter
          in the chill of the night air; she raises her arms to the sky
          longingly, happily.
                         
                          KAREN
           I hope the ocean's ice cold. I hope
           I freeze in a solid chunk.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (sudden, intense laugh)
           Just so long's you melt afterwards.
                         
                          KAREN
           I love the way you laugh.
                         
          He stands, moves to her. She laughs, turns and runs into the
          water. He runs after her.
                         
          FULL SHOT WAVE
          near shore, as Karen dives into it. Warden follows her. The
          wave washes over them.
                         
          INT. NEW CONGRESS CLUB - MRS. KIPFER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
           51.
                         
                         
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT DIVAN
          CAMERA ANGLED so we see only back of the divan. We hear soft
          chuckles from Prew and Lorene o.s., then silence for several
          moments. CAMERA MOVES as we hear a few more low, intimate
          laughs, then Prew and Lorene are disclosed on the couch,
          their heads close together as if they have just kissed
          pleasantly but not passionately. Mrs. Kipfer's living room is
          on the order of the vestibule; it, too, has a faded lavender
          feeling. A door leading to another room is half open in b.g.
          A door leading to a hall is closed. Prew's arm is around
          Lorene's shoulder; he is very relaxed, regards her with
          something like wonder. Lorene is mellower, too, making no
          effort now to be "the Princess." She speaks as if resuming a
          conversation.
                         
                          LORENE
           ... I enlisted, too. I came out
           here on my own. To get away from my
           home town. In Oregon.
                         
                          PREW
           How come?
                         
                          LORENE
           I had a boy friend. I was a
           waitress. He was from the richest
           family in town. He just married the
           girl suitable for his position.
           After three years of going around
           with me.
                          (PAUSE)
           It's a pretty story, isn't it?
           Maybe they could make a movie of
           it.
                         
                          PREW
           They did. Ten thousand of them.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Lorene smiles.
                         
                          LORENE
           So I left and went to Seattle, as a
           waitress. And I met a girl just
           back from Hawaii. She said she'd
           made a lot of money working for
           Mrs. Kipfer. I caught the first
           boat. I've been here a year and two
           months.
                         
                          PREW
           You like it much?
           52.
                         
                         
                         
                          LORENE
           Oh, I don't like it. But I don't
           mind it. Anyway, I won't be here
           forever.
                         
                          PREW
           No. Sure not. I mean, why should
           you?
                         
                          LORENE
           I have it all figured out. In
           another year I'll be back home,
           with a pile of bills big enough to
           choke a steer. And then I will be
           all set for life --
                         
          There is a sound at the door and they turn towards it.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT DOOR TO HALL
          as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through, its
          hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle. After a moment,
          Maggio's head follows the arm through the door. He is
          grinning like an amateur conspirator.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           I dint hear no sounds of combat. So
           I figgered maybe you'd like a
           drink.
                         
                         THREE SHOT
          as Maggio comes into the room.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Or otherwise old Sandra would of
           drank it all by herself. She's a
           fine girl. But she drinks like a
           fish.
                         
          There are glasses on a cupboard near the divan. Maggio sets
          three of them up, starts to pour whisky into them.
                         
                          LORENE
           No, thanks. I never drink much.
                         
          Maggio stops short of the third glass. He takes a big gulp
          from the first.
                         
                          LORENE
           I think it' a a weakness.
                         
                          MAGGIO
                          (ANOTHER GULP)
           I grant you that.
           53.
                         
                         
                         
                          LORENE
           And I don't like weakness.
                          (TO PREW) )
           Do you?
                         
                          PREW
           No. I don't like weakness.
           (rises, takes a drink)
           But I like to drink.
                         
          He comes back to the divan.
                         
                          LORENE
           With you it's not a weakness. With
           you it's more like a virtue.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           That sounds like a very profound
           remark. Maybe that's why I don't
           get it.
                         
                          LORENE
           (snuggles to Prew)
           Well, it's so.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Hey! What you gonna do, marry this
           guy? Way you grinnin at him you
           look like his wife!
                         
                          PREW
           Get outa here!
                         
                          MAGGIO
           (picks up bottle)
           Okay. Back to old long-legged
           Sandra. I love 'em tall. Acres and
           acres.
                         
          He goes out, closing door behind him. Suddenly the door opens
          again and Maggio pops back in. He puts the whisky bottle on a
          table next to the door.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Enjoy yourself, pizon. You need it
           more than me. You be back with The
           Treatment tomorrow.
                         
          He pops out again, the door closing after him. Prew's gaiety
          dims with the reference to The Treatment. Lorene sees this.
          Prew rises, goes to whisky bottle.
           54.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
           That was nice before. The way you
           snuggled up. In front of him.
                         
                          LORENE
           What's he mean, The Treatment?
                         
          Prew doesn't answer. He pours a drink, gulps it.
                         
                          LORENE
           What did he mean?
                         
                          PREW
           Some of the guys puttin me over the
           jumps because I won't fight.
                         
                          LORENE
           Fight?
                         
                          PREW
           On the boxing team. I don't want to
           fight! I don't want to talk about
           it! I don't want to think about it.
           And they make me think about it.
           Every day.
                         
          He drops down on the divan beside her.
                         
                          PREW
           It's a personal thing...
                         
          His dread of telling the tale crumbles before his
          overwhelming need to tell it, to have someone understand.
                         
                          PREW
           Over at Port Shafter... I used to
           fight... Middleweight. I was pretty
           good. I used to work out with Dixie
           Wells. He was a light-heavy, but he
           was fast... And good. He loved
           boxing. He was gonna come out of
           the Army and go right into the
           upper brackets... People on the
           Outside had their eye on him.
           (rises, paces)
           Dixie didn't want, to use the six
           ounce gloves this time. And we
           neither of us wore headgear,
           anyway. I was set flat on my feet
           when I caught Dixie wide with this
           no more than ordinary solid cross.
           Dixie just happened to be standing
           solid, too.
                          (MORE)

                          PREW(CONT'D)
           (sits on chair)
           From the way he fell I knew. Dead
           weight, square on his face. He dint
           roll over. He was in a coma a week.
           Then he finally came out of it. The
           only thing was that he was blind...
           (rises, paces)
           I went up to the hospital to see
           him. Twice. Then I couldn't go
           back. We got to talking about
           fighting the second time. And Dixie
           cried... Seein tears comin out of
           those eyes that couldn't see...
                         
          There are tears on Prew's face. He turns away from Lorene.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING FROM BEHIND PREW
          Lorene, very moved, goes to him, stands behind him, puts her
          hand on his shoulder. Prew does not turn but his hand grasps
          hers. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT of the hands.
                         
          EXT. OCEAN AND BEACH - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR SHORE
          A wave sweeps by camera, Karen and Warden riding it into
          shore. CAMERA PANS with them as they walk out of the water,
          hand in hand. They stop at edge, as if by a mutual impulse.
          He swings her to him and kisses her.
                         
                         CLOSEUP
          as they kiss. The embrace is impassioned. When their lips
          separate, their arms remain around each other, holding tight
          to something they find is more than sex alone.
                         
                         EXTREME CLOSEUP
          as Karen and Warden kiss again, a tenderness in him not seen
          before and which he normally takes great pains to hide.

          as their lips separate again.
                         
                          KAREN
           Nobody ever kissed me that way...
           not really...
                         
          They are both disquieted by the quality of their reactions to
          the kisses. The jump to banter is a quick defense.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Nobody?
                         
          CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they walk to the fire. Karen smiles
          at him.

                          KAREN
           No. Nobody.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Not even one? Out of all the many
           men you've been kissed by?
                         
                          KAREN
           Well, that will take some figuring.
           How many men do you think there've
           been?
                         
          CAMERA HOLDS as they sit, beside the fire. Karen wraps one of
          the blankets around her.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I wouldn't know. Can't you even
           make me a rough estimate?
                         
                          KAREN
           Not without an adding machine. Do
           you have your adding machine with
           you?
                         
                          WARDEN
           No, I forgot to bring it.
                         
                          KAREN
           Then I guess you won't find out,
           will you?
                         
                          WARDEN
           Maybe I already know.
                         
          The defense has given way and there is no mirth in the
          questions and answers now.
                         
                          KAREN
           What's the matter? What are you
           hinting at?
                         
                          WARDEN
           Why? Is there something to hint at?
                         
                          KAREN
           I don't know. Maybe a lot. Or maybe
           you just think there's a lot.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Maybe I do. Maybe there's been a
           long line of beach parties --
           57.
                         
                         
                         
                          KAREN
           You must be crazy -- !
                         
                          WARDEN
           Am I? Listen, baby, maybe not here.
           But what about when you and Holmes
           were at Fort Bliss?
                         
          Karen flings off the blankets, snatches her dress, stands up,
          raging. She speaks as she pulls the dress over her head,
          wriggles into it.
                         
                          KAREN
           I had to go and forget you were a
           man -- with the same rotten filthy
           mind the rest of them have. For a
           minute I had to convince myself you
           were different --
                         
                          WARDEN
           Only it's true, ain't it?
                         
                          KAREN
           Yes, it's true! A part of it, some
           small part of whatever sewage
           you've been listening to. Some day
           perhaps you'll get all the story.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (YAPS UP)
           All what story?
                         
                          KAREN
           You're getting to sound so much
           like a typical male. So you just
           sweat it out like a typical male.
                         
          She starts toward the rocks at the end of the beach, walking
          fast, then almost running. Warden runs after her.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT BEACH NEAR PATH UP ROCKS
          as Warden catches up with Karen. He grasps her arm roughly,
          hauls her down onto the sand. He stares at her bitterly,
          waiting f or her to speak.
                         
                          KAREN
           All right. I've never told it to
           anyone before. But I think now is
           the time. I'll tell you the whole
           bloody messy thing. You can take it
           back to the barracks with you.
           58.
                         
                         
                         
          She speaks rapidly, pouring it out in bursts. For much of the
          story her face is in shadow, as if a cloud is passing across
          the moon.
                         
                          KAREN
           I'd been married to Captain Dana E.
           Holmes two years. Only he was a
           First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort
           Bliss. We lived right on a little
           lake where we could fish and swim
           and be alone, our 'dream
           cottage'... I'm sure you must be
           able to picture it. It was off on a
           back road, four miles from the
           highway. Two miles from a neighbor
           and a telephone....
           (pauses, then rushes on)
           I hadn't been married long when
           I knew my husband was stepping
           out on me. But -- you get used
           to that. Your mother tells you
           that it's life, that i t happens
           to a lot of women. Of course,
           she doesn't tell you until after
           it happens.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN
          reacting with fury toward Holmes, compassion for Karen.
                         
                          KAREN
           Then, by that time, you're
           pregnant. And at least you've
           something else to hope for. I think
           I was almost happy that night the
           pains began. Even though they were
           weeks too early, a whole month too
           early. I remember Dana was putting
           on that dapper silk gabardine
           uniform he used to wear. He was
           going to an officer's 'seminar.' He
           was kidding me about false labor. I
           didn't think it was humorous. I
           told him to get home early, to
           bring the doctor with him. He
           smiled tenderly and told me about
           the psychic reactions of women to
           pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be
           back early. And maybe he would
           have... if the 'seminar' hadn't
           been with the hat-check girl in one
           of the night clubs.
           59.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           Listen.
                         
                         TWO SHOT
                         
                          KAREN
           He was only a little drunk when he
           came in... at five a.m. He looked
           alarmed when he saw me. I guess it
           was because of my screams. I was
           lying there on the floor, you see --
           No, don't say anything. I'm not
           finished yet. Of course, the baby
           was dead. It was a boy. But they
           worked over me at the hospital and
           fixed me up fine. They even took my
           appendix out, too. They threw that
           in free. It was all fine.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Listen. Listen. Please.
                         
                          KAREN
           And, of course, one more thing no
           more children. Do you know what
           that means? You're not a woman.
           You're not anything. You're a
           gutted shell... Sure, I went out
           with some of the men after that. A
           few months of it. I'd been made
           dirty and I wanted to be clean. You
           can see that, can't you?... Anyway,
           I got my revenge on Dana. I kept on
           living with him.
                         
                          WARDEN
           The hateful, miserable --
                         
                          KAREN
           You hunt so hungrily for love...
           love, if you can find it, you
           think, might give things meaning
           again.
                         
                          WARDEN

                          KAREN
           All right. I'm listening.
                         
          Warden shakes his head, inarticulate with his rage and love.
          Karen moves closer to him.

          Over shot soft strumming guitars and two voices singing a
          quiet blues. There are scattered groups,about fifteen men in
          all -- playing pool, ping-pong, reading, writing letters,
          talking. CAMERA REACHES PRIVATE SAL ANDERSON and Friday
          Clark, playing the guitars and singing. Clark plays only
          passably, but Anderson is highly accomplished, effortlessly
          sounding off chord progressions in diminished minors. Friday,
          the bugler, is about twenty-four, with shy, trusting eyes.
          Anderson is the same age, also quiet, non-aggressive. CAMERA

          he's been through another recent dose of The Treatment.
          Maggio perches in the frame of the window like an aggressive

          possessing something quite rare and truly their own. Prew
          flips his cigarette into a can.
                         
                          PREW
           I got it. We call it the `Re-
           enlistment Blues'!
                         
          There is a chorus of approval.
                         
                          PREW
           Lookit, w e could start it with the
           guy getting discharged.
           (reaches over to desk)
           Hey, fella, can I use this?
                         
          The soldier at the desk nods, and Prew takes his pencil and
          paper. He writes down the words of the song as they are
          composed during following.
                         
                          PREW
           How's this? 'Got paid out on
           Monday... Not a dog soljer no
           more... They gimme all that
           money....'
                         
          He stops, stuck. Anderson plays the melody and Prew sings the
          words to this point. Friday Clark chimes in suddenly.
                         
                          CLARK
           'They gimme all that money... So
           much my pockets is sore...'
                         
          They laugh. Anderson sings. Prew writes furiously.
                         
                          ANDERSON

          Anderson plays a series of chords, then repeats the last two
          lines as the whole group joins in.

                         FULL SHOT
          Raucous, hammering music sweeps away the melancholy blues. On
          the floor of the gym Dhom is punching the bag. In a corner of
          the raised ring Ike Galovitch is skipping rope. In the center
          of the ring Thornhill and Henderson are sparring. Holmes
          hovers beside them, issuing instructions in a strident voice.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          He is in fatigue clothes, on his knees, scrubbing the floor.
          There is an expression of stubborn hate on his face. Above
          his head in the shot are Galovitch's feet jumping the rope.
          In b.g. of shot is Wilson, seated near ring.
                         
                          GALOVITCH'S VOICE
           Some day you get sense in your dumb
           head, Prewitt, you be up here
           instead down there!
                         
          A fine spray of spit accompanies the words and showers over
          Prew but he keeps about his work.
                         
                          WILSON
           Still makin out you like it, huh?
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT IN RING
          There are two water buckets near Galovitch. He skips near one
          of them, kicks it. The bucket falls on its side and dirty
          water spills over the ring and down onto Prew.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Clean up dis mess, Prewitt!
                         
          Prew gets to his feet. Galovitch resumes skipping rope.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           And look a life, hurry it up. You
           on fatigue detail, not vacation.
                         
          Prew climbs into the ring, gets on his knees, starts to swab
          up the canvas. He is nearly finished when Galovitch
          "accidentally" kicks over the second bucket.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Clean up, Prewitt!
                         
          Prew suddenly stands, no longer able to contain his rage. He
          throws his sponge and scrubbing brush on the ring floor.
                         
                          PREW
           Clean it up yourself!

                          GALOVITCH
           How? What!
                         
                          PREW
           You heard me -- rub your own nose
           in it a while!
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           What!
                         
          Prew starts out of the ring. Holmes intercepts him.
                         
                          HOLMES
           What's the matter with you,
           Prewitt? You know better than to
           talk back to a non-commissioned
           officer.
                         
                          PREW
           Yes, sir. But I have never liked
           being spit at, sir. Even by a non-
           commissioned officer.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I think you owe Sergeant Galovitch
           an apology.
                         
                          PREW
                          (RECKLESSLY)
           I don't think I owe him no apology.
           In fact, I think one's owed to me.
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (FURIOUS)
           Sergeant Galovitch, take this man
           to the barracks and have him roll a
           full field pack, extra shoes,
           helmet and all, and then take a
           bicycle and hike him up to Kole-
           Kole Pass and back. And see that he
           hikes all the way. And when he gets
           back, bring him to me.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Yes, Sirr.
                         
          Prew climbs out of the ring, Galovitch following him.

          Par below in the shot are Prew, hiking, and Galovitch, riding
          behind him on the bicycle. The dirt road is steep and the sun
          pours down, steaming hot.
                         
          MOVING SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          Prew is hunched under the seventy-pound pack as he plods
          along. He is sweat-soaked, puffing, dog-weary. Galovitch's
          bicycle is just behind him; he runs the wheels up on Prew's
          heels.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Move along. You not half way yet.
           Three more miles to top.
                         
          A jeep rounds a curve a couple of hundred yards above and
          moves down the road. It slows its speed and pulls up when it
          nears Prew and Galovitch.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The jeep is driven by an enlisted man. Sitting next to him is
          MAJOR GENERAL SLATER. Galovitch hops off the bike and he and
          Prew snap to attention. General Slater leans out of the
          vehicle. He seems puzzled and interested by the odd sight of
          the two men.
                         
                          GENERAL SLATER
           At ease. Where're you men headed?
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Top of pass, Sir. This man
           insubordinate. The Captain is
           teaching him lesson.
                         
                          GENERAL SLATER
                          (FROWNS)
           What's your outfit, Sergeant?
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           Company G, 219th, Sir.
                         
          The General, still frowning slightly, nods. He signals his
          driver to move on. The jeep starts down the road. Galovitch
          gets on his bicycle. Prew starts hiking again.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Prew and Galovitch are standing in front of the Captain's
          desk. Prew is at attention, the heavy pack on his back; his
          face is drawn and tired; his clothes are plastered to him. He
          has regained his old expressionless look. Warden has swung
          his chair around and is surveying the scene. Holmes looks
           66.
                         
                         
          Prew up and down, half-smiles.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I take it you're ready to apologize
           to Sergeant Galovitch now.
                         
                          PREW
           No, sir, I'm not.
                         
          Holmes' face sets; he jerks his head toward the window.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Take him back up there again,
           Galovitch. He hasn't had enough
           yet.

                          BICYCLING)
           Yes, air.
                         
          Prew about-faces and goes out. Galovitch follows.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN HOLMES IN B.G.
          Warden watches Prew go out, then looks toward Holmes whose
          back is to him. Disgust is reflected on his face.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES
          Holmes slams his fist on his desk.
                         
                          HOLMES
           1 know that kind of man! He's an
           againster. A bitter-ender. You
           can't be decent to a man like that.
           You have to tame him, like an
           animal!
                          (TO WARDEN)
           Warden, I want you to prepare court
           martial papers. Insubordination and
           insolence to an officer.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, sir.
                         
          Warden swings around to his own desk. He thinks for several
          moments, tries to sound quite casual.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Too bad you got to lose a
           middleweight like that...
                         
                          HOLMES
           Why? Do you see any other way of
           breaking him?

                          WARDEN
           I don't know... But even if he only
           gets three months, he'll still be
           in the Stockade when the boxing
           finals come up.
                         
          He looks over at Holmes, sees him scowling, weakening.
                         
                          WARDEN
           How about just giving him a good
           stiff Compny punishment for now?
                         
          Holmes ponders the situation unhappily, rubs his hand over
          his face,. shakes his head as if the whole thing is too much
          for him.
                         
                          HOLMES
           All right, all right. But throw the
           book at him.

          He is trimming his moustache.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'm sick of it! They ain't got no
           right to keep breakin it off in
           that kid! Sooner later Holmes is
           going to hound him right into the
           Stockade!
                         
          CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALING Karelsen across the room,
          undressing tiredly, achingly. Warden is sharp and blustering,
          using Karelsen as an escape valve. During following he goes
          to his footlocker, opens it, takes out whisky bottle, drinks.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'm through! I'm turnin in my

           leaving all my old buddies.
                         
          Karelsen is naked now except for a bath towel knotted around
          his middle. He slips his feet into Japanese-style, wooden
          clogs, starts slowly for the door.

           To take my stinkin shower, if the
           First Sergeant's got no objections.
           Where'd you think? To the movies in
           this towel?

                          (GRINS)
           Hurry up. Let's go over to Choy's
           for some beer and tear up all the
           tables and chairs.

           Okay, Okay.
                         
                         DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          INT. CHOY'S - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT OLD CHOY
          An aged Chinese, at least seventy-five, OLD CHOY has a long
          white beard and wears a black skull cap and an embroidered
          robe. He is motionless, surveying the pandemonium which we
          hear over shot: the sounds of men laughing, talking and
          shouting blend with jukebox music blasting Chattanooga, Choo
          Choo. YOUNG CHOP, Old Choy's son, passes; he is thirty, white-
          aproned, bustling, Americanized. CAMERA PANS WITH him,
          DISCLOSING the small beer-house; it has unpainted cement
          walls and a cement floor; the only thing that might be called
          decorative is the jukebox. The place is crowded with men from
          Schofield, a raucous assemblage; everyone is drinking beer
          and the smoke hangs in thick layers. At a table near the door
          sit Prew, Maggio, Clark, Anderson, Treadwell and Mazzioli. At
          a corner table behind a forest of beer bottles and cans are
          Warden, Stark, Karelsen and Chief Choate.

           ... China's the place. Your money's
           worth ten, twelves times as much.
           I'm gunna ship over soon as my
           time's up in this pineapple Army.

           The Canal Zone for me. This girl
           down there. She was a planter's
           daughter, see. She lived a very
           sheltered life. A very moral young
           lady, Milt. I took her out to a
           high class dinner and then dancing.
           It was a great shock to her to
           learn about life. But she took it
           well. She got to like me very much
           after that.
                         
                          WARDEN
           The last time I heard it you told
           it different.
                         
                          KARELSEN
           Well, what did you expect? I was in
           a different mood, then.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE
          Maggio, Anderson and Treadwell are comparing snapshots from
          home, spreading them out on the table. Mazzioli is talking to
          Prew with great earnestness.
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           ... it's in regulations. You've got
           a right to complain. You've got a
           right to take your case to the
           Inspector General. Any soldier has,
           even a plain dogface.
                         
                          PREW
           I know it. I'm not complainin to
           nobody. They ain't goin to get the
           satisfaction of seein me squirm.
                         
          Clark begins to play the bugle softly along with the jukebox
          music, noodling an uninspired obligato.

           See that old man with the
           handlebars?
                          (PROUDLY)
           Mr. Maggio is my father.
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           Listen, Prew. I guess I ought not
           to tell you but --. Warden hasn't
           had you on KP much lately, has he?
                         
                          PREW
           Only my reglar turn.
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           Well -- I was working in the
           Orderly Room this afternoon and I
           heard the Captain telling Warden
           you're to pull KP every weekend
           from now on. You know what that
           means -- you can' t even go into
                          TOWN --
                         
                          PREW
           Whadda they want? They done
           everything, now they look me in
           a box! What else they gonna try?
                         
          Clark hits a sour note an the bugle.
                         
                          PREW
                          (SAVAGELY)
           When you gonna learn to play a
           bugle!?
                         
          In overwhelming, uncontrollable protest, Prew slaps the bugle
          away from Clark's mouth. In one motion he wipes the
          mouthpiece on his sleeve, raises it to his lips and blows his
          own wild, violent obligato to the jukebox music.
                         
          FULL SHOT CHOY'S
          as Prew plays on, the bugle's pure tone pealing through the
          room. Everyone puts down his beer, stops talking and turns
          toward Prew.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          reacting. He frowns, moved by the cry behind the music.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW'S TABLE FEATURING MAGGIO
          as he watches and listens, an exultation for his friend
          nakedly revealed on his face.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE PREW'S TABLE FEATURING PREW
          Hitting an almost impossibly high note, he stops as suddenly
          as he has begun. He has played perhaps fifteen seconds in
           71.
                         
                         
          all. He puts the bugle down on the table, embarrassed now,
          the violence gone, some of the wrath unloaded.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT AT DOOR
          The room is quiet for several moments, except for the
          continuing jukebox music, which sounds pale and thin now.
          Fatso Judson strolls in, stands at the door. Some of the men
          see him, but no one greets him. Fatso threads his way between
          tables as the room slowly begins to return to normal and the
          men turn back to their beer.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE
          as Fatso passes. He stops, leans over Anderson's shoulder to
          look at the snapshots on the table. He points to one picture,
          a pretty young girl of about fifteen, posing Hollywoodishly
          in a bathing suit, cracks his knuckles loudly.
                         
                          FATSO
           Who's that? Who's that dame?
                         
                          MAGGIO
                          (IMPASSIVELY)
           My sister.
                         
          Fatso whistles. He picks up the photograph, stares at it,
          whistles again.
                         
                          FATSO
           Whoever! Say, she's a real good
           piece of whistle bait! I'd sure
           like to get my mitts around her.
                         
          He laughs complacently at his own wit, tosses the picture on
          the table, starts to move on, Maggio rises, picks up the
          heavy wooden stool he's been sitting on and smashes it down
          on Fatso's head with all his strength,
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          as again the laughing and shouting in the room stops
          abruptly. Fatso reels a little with the terrible blow but
          does not go down.
                         
                          FATSO
           Why, holy -- I You hit met You hit
           me!
                         
                          MAGGIO
                          (CALMLY)
           You bet your life.
                          (RAISES STOOL)
           And about to do it again.
           72.
                         
                         
                         
                          FATSO
           (still blinking from the
                          BLOW)
           What?! But what for? That's no way
           to fight!
           (reaches hand to head,
           brings away blood)
           Why, you dirty yellow sneaking --
           Wop! You yellow little Wop! If
           that's the way you want to play!
                         
          With his last sentence, Fatso whips out a knife and snaps
          open the blade. The blade is at least five inches long. It
          glints evilly as he raises it. There is a concerted whisking
          intake of breath from the room. Murder is clear on Fat sots
          face.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR PREW'S TABLE (EXCLUDING WARDEN)
          Maggio, holding the stool high, backs up a few feet as Fatso
          advances toward him. Men sprawl away from them.
                         
                          SOLDIER'S VOICE
           Hey, it you want to fight, fight
           with fists. Take it outsides
                         
          There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd. A couple of
          men are about to rise. Fatso whirls toward them.
                         
                          FATSO
           I'm gonna cut this little Wop's
           heart out. Anybody steps in here, I
           give it to him first.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT OLD CHOY AND YOUNG CHOY
          side by side. Old Choy watches, immobile, his slit eyes
          almost closed. Young Choy is shaking with fright.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT FATSO AND MAGGIO
          Fatso turns toward Maggio, who circles back around the table
          as the other stalks him.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           (scared but brave; shouts)
           I'm gunna de-brain ya, Fatso!
           One step closer an I'm gunna kill
           ya!
                         
          Fatso has his knife poised at his shoulder, ready to strike.
          Warden comes into shot suddenly. He brandishes a beer bottle
          wildly, looks like an avenging spirit of authority.
           73.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           Nobody's gunna do nothin! Anybody's
           killin anybody around here, it'll
           be me!
                         
          Warden snatches another beer bottle from a table, now has one
          in each hand. He steps between Fatso and Maggio.
                         
                          FATSO
           Look outs here, Warden. This a
           private affair.
                         
                          WARDEN
           No it ain't! This man's in my
           Compny an I'm responsible for him.
           And you ain't makin two weeks extra
           paper work for me by killin him.
           Nor him you. Put that knife down!
                         
          He smashes the neck off one of the beer bottles, points the
          wagged edge at Fatso, roars:
                         
                          WARDEN
           Put it down!
                         
          Fatso slowly lowers the knife to his waist, but keeps it
          pointed towards Maggio and Warden. Warden deliberately turns
          his back to Fatso, spits his words at Maggio.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Killer! You unweaned punk& Come on,
           you want some killing, come on!
           (whirls on Fatso)
           Come on, barrelbelly. Ain't you
           comin?
                         
          Neither Fatso nor Maggio moves.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (with mammoth contempt)
           Killers! You'll get plenty of
           killing, all right. More than you
           got the stomach for. You'll be in a
           war one of these days. When you
           feel that lead from a sniper's
           rifle hit you between the eyes,
           come and tell me how you like it.
           Killers!
           (turns to Maggio)
           Now put down that chair.
                         
          Maggio puts down the stool. Warden turns to Fatso.
           74.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           Throw that knife on the floor.
                         
          Fatso drops the knife. It clatters on the floor. There is
          another audible whoosh of breath from the room.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Almost scared there wasn't anybody
           going to stop you for a minute,
           weren't you?
           (finally lowers his voice)
           Is there any other little things
           you punks'd like me to take care of
           for you?
                         
          He drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his
          own table. The room settles back, still hushed. Warden has
          broken the mood of certain death, but Fatso, still facing
          Maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom.
                         
                          FATSO
           Tough monkey. Hard sister. Guys
           like you get to the Stockade sooner
           later. One day you walk in there
           I'll be waitin. I'll show you a
           coupla things.
                         
          He walks away, drops into a stool at the counter.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE
          Warden stands beside the table, watching. He seems satisfied
          as Fatso moves away from Maggio. Still standing, he raises
          his half-filled bottle of beer, drinks.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE
          Maggio drops onto the stool, sidles it over to the table. He
          half-whispers to Prew.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           I made a mistake I guess, but I
           don't see how I could of done
           anything else, after that big stoop
           said a thing like that.
                         
          Prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor.
                         
                          PHEW
           I'll tell you your mistake. You
           didn't hit him hard enough to put
           him out.
           75.
                         
                         
                         
                          MAGGIO
           I hit him hard as I could. His head
           must be solid ivory.
                         
          In b.g. Warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards
          the door. Maggio and Prew turn to watch him pass.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Anyway, I'm glad he stopped it.
           He's a good man, you know it?
                         
          As if on impulse, Prew rises and follows Warden out.
                         
          EXT. CHOY'S - NIGHT
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          as Prew carves out. Choy's is on a wide road across from the
          entrance to the Post. Prew looks around for Warden, sees him
          off to one side. CAMERA MOVES WITH Prew as he goes over to
          him.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          leaning against the building, undergoing a delayed reaction
          to the fierce moment in Choy's. He is white-faced, sweating
          heavily. He looks as if he's going to be sick.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          astonished yet appreciative that under Warden's confidence
          and control in Choy's there has been a human frailty.
                         
                          PREW
           ... That was a near thing.
                         
                          WARDEN
           ... Yeah.
                         
          Prew holds out Fatso's knife. Warden is beginning to get
          control of himself; he manages a weak smile.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You keep it, kid. Keep it for a
           souvenir.
                         
          Prew puts the knife in his pocket. They stare at one another
          a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express
          some deep emotion of respect.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You ain't enjoying life much, are
           you, kid?
           76.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
                          (THIN SMILE)
           They can kill you but they can't
           eat you, Top.
                         
          Warden studies Prew thoughtfully. Prew turns to go back into
          Choy's.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Prewitt.
                         
          Prew stops, turns back.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Could you stand a weekend pass?
                         
          Prew stares at him for a second, incredulously, unable to
          find his voice.
                         
                          PREW
           I thought --
                         
                          WARDEN
           You thought what, kid?
                         
                          PREW
           How about Dynamite?
                         
                          WARDEN
           Leave Dynamite to me. He signs most
           anything I put in front of him
           `thout readies it.
                         
          Though Prew is overjoyed he is somehow unable to say
          "thanks"; Warden grins broadly at him.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I hear you gone dippy over some
           dame you met at the New Congress
           Club.
                         
          He slaps Prew on the shoulder roughly.
                         
                          WARDEN
           What'd you say her name was?

           Pretty name.

          Warden walks off across the street. Prew stares after him.

          EXT. WAIKIKI BEACH - DAY
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW AND LORENE
          Lorene is covering Prew with sand and has him almost
          completely buried. Only his face remains uncovered. He is
          griming up at her. She seems thoughtful.
                         
                          PREW
           ... Lorene...
                         
          She throws a towel over his face. He chuckles under it.
                         
                          LORENE
           My name's Alma.
                         
          The chuckle from under the towel dies.
                         
                          LORENE
           Alma Schmidt...
                         
          There is a sound as of strangling from under the towel.
                         
                          LORENE
           Mrs. Kipfer picked Lorene out of a
           perfume ad. She thought it sounded
           French...
                         
          Lorene whisks the towel away. Prew's face is comic in its
          surprise and chagrin.

          MEDIUM SHOT AT BAR ALMA AND PREW
          (NOTE: From this point on "ALMA" will be used instead of
          "LORENE.")
          A fashionable Waikiki night spot. An orchestra in b.g, is
          playing "Someone's Rocking My Dream Boat." Alma and Prew are
          seated at the bar. She is dressed modestly and becomingly,
          might well be taken as a society girl. Prew is wearing a
          civilian suit; he looks bound and choked in it.
                         
                          PREW
           Alma...
                         
          She smiles ruefully, realizes her real name has rubbed off
          some of the enchantment.

                          PREW
          No, honest, I like it. Alma's a --
          swell name. It was great you gettin
          away today.
                         
                          ALMA
          I told Mrs. Kipfer I was sick. But
          I bet she doesn't believe it,
                         
                          PREW
          There's no tellin when I'll get
          into town next. The Warden gave me
          a break this time. But Holmes and
          those others, they got me on the
          edge. I just about went off the
          deep end the other day.
                         
                          ALMA
          You must hate the Army.
                         
                          PREW
          Hate the Army...?
                         
                          ALMA
          Sure. Look what it's doing to you.
                         
                          PREW
          It's not the Army that's doing it.
          It's Man. I love the Army.
                         
                          ALMA
          Love it? Well, it sure doesn't love
          you in return.
                         
                          PREW
          When you love something it doesn't
          mean they got to love you in
          return.
                         
                          ALMA
          Yes, but a person can stand just so
          much from something --
                         
                          PREW
          No! A man loves a thing, he's gotta
          be grateful.
           (pauses, gropes for
                          THOUGHTS)
          I left home when I was seventeen.
          Both my folks was dead, then. I
          bummed around. I got all sorts of
          jobs. I rode the rods.

          She frowns, not understanding the last word.
                         
                          PREW
           The Army. I enlisted at Fort Myer
           and I learned how to box and I
           learned how to play a bugle. I
           never had much call for the boxing -
           - but if it weren't for the Army
           I'd never of learned how to play a
           bugle.
                         
                          ALMA
           A bugle?
                         
          Prew nods. He takes the mouthpiece out of his pocket, shows
          it to her.
                         
                          PREW
           This is the mouthpiece I used to
           play a Taps at Arlington.
                         
          Alma takes the mouthpiece, looks it over, seems unimpressed.
                         
                          PREW
           (as if saying "I was
                          ELECTED PRESIDENT")
           They picked me to play a Taps -- at
           Arlington Cemetery.
                         
          She still looks dubious, hands the mouthpiece back. He tries
          desperately to communicate.
                         
                          PREW
           Look. Think. You ever think how
           strange a tree would look to one
           who had never lived upon the earth?
           Well, somehow that's how I feel
           when I play a bugle...
                         
          There is a boisterous shouting nearby.

          They turn and ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE Maggio, who has just
          come up to the bar. He is in uniform. Prew is pleased to see
          him but also alarmed; there is something near-desperate under
          Maggio's drunkenness.

           I dint get no pass. I just took
           off. I meant to bring a girl with
           me but --
                         
                          PREW
           You better get your tail back to
           the Post. Right away.
                         
          Maggio shakes his head violently in the negative.

           nail. I'm thirsty for a nail.
                         
          Prew gives him a cigarette. Maggio hops on an empty bar stool
          a few places removed from Prew and Alma.
                         
                          MAGGIO

          A tray on the bar contains olives, nuts and pretzels. Maggio

          which worries him.
                         
          LONG SHOT FROM PREW'S POV
          The two MPs cross toward direction Maggio has taken. They are
          obviously going after him.

          picks up Maggio's tie and shoes and hurries out after him.

          Tall pale royal palms contrast with thick dark plants and
          bushes. An ornamental lamppost alongside a walking path a
          little distance away. Prew comes into shot cautiously,
          carrying Maggio's tie and shoes. He moves quickly, bends
          over. CAMERA PANS AND MOVES IN and we see it is Maggio's
          shirt and trousers which Prew has discovered on the ground.
          He looks at them wryly, picks them up, moves on.
                         
          ANGLE PREW IN F.G. AND LAMPPOST WITH BENCH NEAR IT IN B.G.
          Prew, carrying Maggio's clothes, stops as he sees what looks
          like a shadow lying across the bench.
                         
                          PREW

          The shadow does not move. Prew approaches the bench.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND PREW
          Maggio is stretched out on the bench, seems to be sleeping
          blissfully. He is clothed only in his shorts. Despite
          himself, Prew smiles. He shakes the reclining figure.
                         
                          PREW

          Maggio mumbles without opening his eyes or moving.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           I'm sorry, sir. I won't do it

           Here's your clothes.
                         
          He throws the clothes on Maggio.
                         
                          MAGGIO

           us in her private swimming pool --
                         
          Prew pulls Maggio off the bench and starts to drag him across
          the path away from the light.
                         
                          MAGGIO

                          PREW
           You'll get worse than that scraped -
           - Listen!
                         
          The ominous sound of leggins brushing each other is heard,
          not far away. Prew looks off.
                         
          LONG SHOT THROUGH BUSHES
          The two MPs are on the street just outside the grounds. They
          are still looking for Maggio, somewhat aimlessly now.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND PREW
          Prew whispers to Maggio as he pulls him to his feet.

          MEDIUM SHOT END OF PATH NEAR STREET
          The two MPs came running onto the path, spot Maggio and Prew
          about thirty yards away.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PEW AND MAGGIO
          Maggio picks up his shoes, suddenly whips away from Prew and
          runs toward the MPs.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE NEAR MPs
          as they stop, surprised. Maggio is shouting, "Can't a man do
          nothin?!" as he hurls first one shoe, then the other,
          directly at the MPs. One MP is hit in the shoulder, staggers
          back. Maggio dashes between him and the second MP, but the
          latter reaches out and grabs him. Maggio wrenches loose but
          instead of running, suddenly wades in, arms swinging wildly.
          In a moment, he is hanging crab-like on the man's back. The
          first MP charges Maggio. Maggio grabs the second MP's club
          and hits the first MP over the head.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
          Horrified, he starts toward the fracas.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND MPs IN F.G. PREW IN B.G.
          The second MP has managed to get out from under Maggio. He
          smashes his fist into Maggio's face as the latter continues
          to wield the club. Maggio sees Prew coming toward them.
           85.

           off!
                         
          The first MP starts to intercept Prew. Maggio tackles him
          around the knees and brings him to the ground.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SECOND MP
          Club gone, his partner on the ground, the second UP fishes
          for his pistol, tugs to get it from the holster.

          MEDIUM SHOT PREW IN F.G. MPs AND MAGGIO IN B.G.
          Prew sees the second MP raise his pistol, point it toward
          him. CAMERA PANS WITH him as he turns quickly and dives
          headlong into bushes nearby.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          CAMERA MOVES WITH him close to ground as he knees and elbows
          his way along deep into the bushes. He stops, breathing hard.
          The sound of the MPs fighting with Maggio can be heard, the
          ugly sound of fists and the uglier sound of clubs smashing
          bone and flesh.
                         
                          MAGGIO'S VOICE

           Come on. Is that the best you can
           do? I bet you eat Wheaties, don't

           knock me out -- no matter --
                         
          Maggio's voice stops suddenly. CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSEUP of
          Prew on the ground, his face contorted. The voices of the MPs
          are heard now, panting.
                         
           FIRST MP'S VOICE
           I wonder what was wrong with this

          A convulsive sob escapes Prew as his head drops in the dirt.

          MEDIUM SHOT PEEN WARDEN MAZZIOLI
          Warden is pinning some notices on a bulletin board. Prew sits
          on the bench against the wall, miserable, elbows on knees,
          chin in hand. There is a quiet tenseness in the room. Warden
          looks over at Prew, turns back to the bulletin board.
          Mazzioli gets up from his desk, wanders aimlessly to a
          window. The screen door slams and Leva enters, eating a candy
          bar.
                         
                          LEVA
           Any word on Maggio's Court Martial?
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           It's on right now. At Headquarters.
                         
          Lava sits on the bench beside Prew, shakes his head.
                         
                          LEVA
           He'll get the Stockade sure.
                         
          The others tense at the word "Stockade," glare at Leva as if
          he had no right to mention it. Their fear of the place, now
          that it is imminent even for another soldier, is shown on
          their faces. There is a long pause.
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           Maybe he won't get it. All he did
           was get drunk and run wild. That's
           a soldier's nature. It's almost his
           sacred duty once in a while.
                         
          There is another pause. Warden barks suddenly, fiercely, at
          Leva.
                         
                          WARDEN
           What you hangin around here for?
                         
                          LEVA
           Can't a man rest himself for a min--
                         
                          WARDEN
           What man? I can't stand to see
           people restin themselves. I'm
           eccentric. If you ain't got no work
           maybe I can scare you up some.
                         
          Mumbling, Leva rises and goes out. Warden goes over to Prew.
                         
                          WARDEN

          Prew looks up, nods, rises. He is half-way to the door when
          the phone at the Clerk's desk rings. Prew turns. Mazzioli
          stares at the phone as if afraid to touch it. Warden goes
          over, answers.

          Warden puts down phone. He looks at the waiting men.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Prew and a group of G Company men, including Sergeants Dhom,
          Thornhill and Henderson, are on the steps and porch as a
          Reconnaissance car pulls up and halts.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT RECONNAISSANCE CAR
          Maggio sits between the driver and another MP, both armed.
          (NOTE: These are not the same MPs with whom he fought.) The G
          Company men cluster around the car, ad-libbing greetings,
          kidding Maggio, bucking him up. Even the Sergeants join in
          this; nobody likes to see a man on his way to the Stockade.
                         
                          MAGGIO

           Okay, Brownie. Whatever you say.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          as the Driver gets out of the car and goes to pick up
          Maggio's stacked barracks bag on the porch. Prew moves up
          close to Maggio.
                         
                          PREW
           I'm sorry, Angelo. It's my fault. I

                          PREW
           I shoulda stopped you somehow --
                         
                          MAGGIO
           It was all my party. Don't worry
           about it.
           (pronounces "e" as in
                          "THE")
           Anyhow, I'm gunna e-scape. If
           Gimbel's basement couldn't hold me,
           neither can no lousy Stockade.
                         
                          SECOND MP
           You heard him say SHUT UP!
                         
                          MAGGIO
           (smiles at the men)
           I'm a prisoner. And prisoners ain't
           allowed to talk. They allowed to
           breathe though. If they good, that
           is.
                         
          During last speech the Driver returns, dumps the barracks bag
          in the car, and gets in. The motor starts. The men shout good-
          byes.

          back.

          as the Reconnaissance car drives through the chain-mesh gate.
          In the distance is the Stockade, a building that looks
          something like a country schoolhouse. Music sweeps up as the
          gate clangs shut.

          Maggio walking across the yard flanked by the tall MPs. He

          rises.

          CAMERA SHOOTS from behind a man seated at a desk. Prominent
          in shot is a wicked-looking chopped-off hoe handle lying on
          the desk. Maggio enters, recognizes the man. He walks, up to
          the desk, his face set in defiance. Music is rising in a
          fearful crescendo. CAMERA PANS just enough to REVEAL desk
          sign reading: "SERGEANT OF THE GUARD." The man stands up and
          the music stops abruptly.

          Shot covers the continuation of all the above activity. This
          is a native luau - definitely not for tourists. Shot includes
          long ditches, heated by red-hot stones and lined with layers
          of banana leaves, containing pig, chicken, rock crabs,
          fish... Pots of native stew... Bowls of exotic fruit... Peels
          of raw cane... Working over the food are the natives, many of
          the men stripped to the waist, the women arrayed in colorful
          Hawaiian costumes.
                         
          LONG SHOT THROUGH BONFIRE HULA DANCERS
          A group of male dancers swaying with the insistent beat of a
          group of old Hawaiian instruments. This is far removed from
          the night club Hula. This is a thing of swift, agile
          angularity, primitive and powerful.

          MEDIUM SHOT SPECTATORS
          They shout and laugh and squeal with delight as they watch.
          It is Warden the dancers are teasing. Several of the dancers
          break out of the group, dance over to Warden, continue to
          prod him, apparently urging him to join them.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          protesting, joining in the laughter. Suddenly he kicks off
          his shoes, rolls his slacks up to his knees. He snatches a
          gardenia from the hair of a pretty Hawaiian girl next to him,
          sticks it over his ear, jumps into the firelight and dances
          with the others. The music comes up louder and faster as the
          spectators and dancers roar.

          His laughter now also diminished to a happy grin as he
          dances. In all he dances about thirty seconds. Then he breaks
          out of the group and runs over to Karen.

          glowing, tingling.
                         
                          KAREN

          She flings her arms around him passionately. The onlookers
          howl with approval and merriment. Between Karen and Warden
          and camera, an enormously fat Hawaiian woman pours water on
          the stones in one of the trench-ovens. A cloud of steam
          rises, hiding them.

          Prew stops on the threshold, stares at the room in happy
          amazement. It is large, smartly furnished. In the rear, glass
          doors lead to a porch. One of the panelled walls is filled
          with bookshelves, floor to ceiling. The bookshelves are
          filled with books. A hearty feminine voice calls "Hi!" from
          the kitchen, and as Prew and Alma come into the room,
          GORGETTE enters from the kitchen. She is a very tall, very
          gay, good-looking girl.
                         
                          ALMA

          Prew grins, can't keep his eyes off the astonishing books.
          Gorgette follows his glance.

           what's to cook for dinner.
                         
          She starts oft to kitchen.

           Hey.

           This is just like bein married,

                         FULL SHOT
          SHOOTING through smoke rising from one of the trench-ovens.
          As it clears we see the enormous Hawaiian woman and one or
          two others cleaning up and putting out the remnants of the
          fires. The merrymakers and dancers have gone; the luau is
          over. In b.g., quite alone, are Warden and Karen, sitting on
           94.
                         
                         
          the trunk of a fallen palm tree.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT KAREN AND WARDEN
          The abandoned gaiety of the earlier scene gone. They survey
          the emptiness. The fat Hawaiian woman comes near, rakes ashes
          over one of the dying fires. She speaks to Warden in
          Hawaiian. He answers her in the native tongue. The fat woman
          stares, shrugs, goes off.
                         
                          KAREN
           What did she say?
                         
                          WARDEN
           She said it's over -- time to go
                          HOME --
                         
                          KAREN
           Home... A beach, a car, a park...
                         
          Warden puts his arm around her tenderly.
                         
                          WARDEN
           It'll work out...
                         
                          KAREN
           It can't go on like this much
           longer, Milt.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I know.
                         
          He rises, paces a moment.
                         
                          WARDEN
           If there were only a way! Your
           lovin husband'd probly give you the
           divorce. But even if he didn't know
           what for, he'd never let me
           transfer.
                         
                          KAREN
           (bucking up courage;
                          QUIETLY)
           There is a way. I've been thinking
           about it.
                         
          Warden looks at her apprehensively.
                         
                          KAREN
           You've got to become an officer.
                         
                          WARDEN
           What!

                          KAREN
           You're eligible for the extension
           course that came in with the draft.
           When you get your commission they'd
           ship you back to the States -- new
           officers aren't kept at posts where
           they've been enlisted men. Then --
                         
                          WARDEN
           You sure made a thorough study of
           it.
                         
                          KAREN
           Then I could divorce Dana and
           follow you and marry you.
                         
                          WARDEN
           An officer! I've always hated
           officers.
                         
                          KAREN
           That's a fine, intelligent point
           of view. Suppose I said I've always
           hated Sergeants. That would make a
           lot of sense, wouldn't it?
                         
          CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          He sits, thinks it over unhappily.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Okay, suppose I did it. -- And
           don't think it's a cinch -- the
           exams are tough. Then you'd be
           getting your divorce here while I'm
           in the States. We'd be apart maybe
           six months! We'll probly be in the
           war by then --

           Put it down on your calendar. On
           October twenty-third, 1941, Milt
           Warden told you we'd be in the war
           in less than a year.

           You just don't want the
           responsibility. You're probably not
           even in love with me --
                         
                          WARDEN
           You're crazy! I wish I wasn't in
           love with you. Maybe could enjoy
           life again.
                         
                          KAREN
           I don't know what's happened to you
           -- you were honest at first --
                         
                          WARDEN
           At first! You were tough and solid
           as a rock -- and now you're a
           whining crybaby --

                          KAREN
           And so they were married and lived
           unhappily ever after.
                         
          They are silent for several moments.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I've never been so miserable in my
           life as I have since I met you.
                         
                          KAREN
           Neither have I.

           Neither would I.
                         
          Warden rises and paces again. Suddenly he stops, turns, looks
          down at Karen, speaks in the same gloomy tone.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'll probably make the lousiest
           officer they ever saw in this Army.
                         
          A happy smile creeps over Karen's face. Despite himself, he
          begins to smile also.

          The porch is at the rear of the house, leading off from the
          living room. It is on the very edge of the cliff. Prew and
          Alma are dancing to the music of a portable victrola. It is
          playing "Why Don't We Do This More Often?" A table still
          contains the dinner plates. Prew's expression holds the
          wonder of a child at a magic show. He misses a step,
          stumbles.
                         
                          PREW
           I never caught on to dancing much.

           You're a very good dancer.
                         
          The record ends and Alma goes to change it. CAMERA FOLLOWS

          A magnificent panorama -- strings of lights in the valley and
          across on St. Louis Heights -- in the far distance the neon
          of Waikiki.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
          working with his thoughts, afraid to broach them. He lights a
          cigarette, his fingers trembling.
                         
                          PREW
           I been wanting to tell you a long

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ALMA
          looking through records for a new choice. She speaks quite
          conversationally, as if offered a pleasant compliment.
                         
                          ALMA
           That's nice. Because I love you,
           too.
                         
          She puts on a record -- "It All Comes Back To Me Now." It
          plays throughout the sequence.

           had any business to think of gettin
           married.
                         
          She stares at him, amazed, a touch angry.

                          ALMA
           Because I'm a girl you met at the

           Okay -- I'm a private no class
           dogface soljer. And the way most
           civilians look at it, that's two
           steps up from no thin.
                         
          There is a silence. Alma is honestly distraught.
                         
                          ALMA
           Oh, Prew, Prew, I thought we were

           Lissen, I ain't think in of now.
           But I got a plan cookin in my head.
           You want to go back to the States
           in a year. Well, you could stretch
           it some, make it two years. And I
           could swing a Sergeant's stripes --
           If I were a non-com the Army'd let
           me pick my duty when I re-enlist.
           (lost in the picture of
                          IT)
           And there's some posts back in the
           States -- like Jefferson Barracks --
           The married noncoms rate solid
           brick houses... with lawns with new-
           cut grass and walks with big old
           oak trees...
                         
                          ALMA
           Now I know you've lost your mind!
           How do you expect to become a
           Sergeant under this Captain Holmes
           of yours? It's all you can do to
           keep out of the Stockade!

           pretty good I could do it.
                         
          Alma is deeply moved. She speaks gravely, sincerely, not at
          all immodestly.
                         
                          ALMA
           No. I don't think you should give
           in to The Treatment... even to
           marry me.
                         
                          PREW
           This'd be worth it.
           100.
                         
                         
                         
                          ALMA
                          (ALMOST DESPERATELY)
          Prew -- it's true we love each
          other now. But back in America, it
          might be different... We might not
          even want each other...
                         
                          PREW
          Okay. But that ain't the real
          reason.
                         
                          ALMA
          All right. It's not.
                         
                          PREW
          What's the real reason you won't
          marry me?
                         
                          ALMA
          I won't marry you because I don't
          want to be the wife of a soldier.
                         
                          PREW
          Well, that's the top I could ever
          do for you --
                         
                          ALMA
          Because nobody's going to stop
          me from my plan. Nobody. Nothing.
          Because want to be proper.
                         
                          PREW
          Proper?
                         
                          ALMA
                          (IMPASSIONED)
          Yes, proper. Respectable. Secure.
          In a year I'll have enough money
          saved. I'm going back to my home
          town in Oregon and I'm going to
          build a new home for my mother and
          myself and join the country club
          and take up golf. And then I'll
          meet the proper, man with the
          proper position. And I'll be a
          proper wife who can keep a proper
          home and raise proper children. And
          I will be happy because when you
          are proper you are safe.

           You got guts, Alma. I hope you pull
           it off.
                         
          The victrola record ends. Alma turns away from Prew and goes
          to the victrola. Now that shots had her say with such
          certainty, she deflates. Except for the fact that she looks
          like a girl who never cries, she looks as if she might cry.
          She lifts the record off the turntable.
                         
                          ALMA
           But I do mean it when I say I need
           you. Because I'm lonely. Sometimes
           I'm dreadfully lonely... You think
           I'm lying, don't you?
                         
                          PREW
           No. Nobody ever lies about being
           lonely...
                         
          Alma puts the same record on again. Prew looks out over the
          beautiful view.

           -- I've known about it for a long
           time! I've sensed it. And I'm not
           going to ignore it any longer! I
           want to know where you met him and

          MEDIUM SHOT HOLMES AND KAREN
          at breakfast in a nook off the kitchen. Holmes is a mixture
          of petulance, anger and frustration. He doesn't touch his
          food, but occasionally takes a sip of coffee.
                         
                          KAREN
           I'm afraid I'm not going to tell

                          HOLMES

          She applies herself to her food, anxious to drop the matter.
                         
                          HOLMES
           One thing I know. I know it's a
           civilian. You'd be too discreet to
           pick an Army man.
                         
                          KAREN
           I don't think it's any of your
           business who he is.
                         
                          HOLMES
           It is my business! I'm your
           husband! What do you think a
           scandal would do to my chances for
           a promotion? So if you're thinking
           of a divorce, you can forget it!
                         
          Karen stiffens. She struggles to maintain her self-
          possession. She manages it, keeps outwardly calm through the
          scene.
                         
                          HOLMES
           Now -- how does it feel to know
           you'll have to live with a horror
           like me the rest of your life?
                         
                          KAREN
           Not very nice. But then there's the
           compensation of knowing you'll have
           to live with me the rest of your
           life.
                         
          Her attitude makes Holmes progressively sorrier for himself.
          CAMERA MOVES with him as during following he rises, goes to
          stove, pours himself another cup of coffee. He spills a
          little and the liquid sizzles on the burner.
                         
                          HOLMES
           You don't know how a man feels
           about a thing like this. It breaks
           a man all up -- inside.

                          (DRYLY)

           differently about it than women.
                         
                          HOLMES
           It's -- it's just not the same.
                         
          CAMERA MOVES with him as he returns to the table, decides to
          try another tack.

                          HOLMES
           Tried to be a Company Commander
           when I hate it, worked my fool head
           off with this miserable boxing
           squad, tagged after the General
           whenever I could.

           Why, for you and for me. For our
           home, that's why.

          She finishes the last of her food, stands.

           go for a walk.
                         
          Holmes catches her wrist, stops her.
                         
                          HOLDS
           I'm willing to forgive you. Tell me
           who he is. Make a clean breast of
           it. And I'll forgive you.
                         
                          KAREN
           I wonder which is hurt more -- your

          She disengages her wrist.

          She goes to door to pantry, pauses there.

          She goes out to pantry. We hear the sound of the door to rear

          Prew, on hands and knees, is on a weeding detail with three
          other men, one of them Sal Anderson. Another is PRIVATE NAIR,
          a tousle-headed, sentimental man we have not seen before.
          Sergeant Thornhill, in charge of the detail, lolls on the
          ground, his head propped against a tree, reading a comic
          book. Prew works his way over to Nair.
                         
                          PREW
           You just get out of the Stockade?

                          (NODS)
           It was rugged, sam. But I kept my
           mouth shut and watched my step and
           I wasn't in no trouble.
                         
                          PREW
           You see Maggio?
                         
          Nair nods, tells his tale in half-humorous, half-reverent
          fashion.
                         
                          NAIR
           Fatso's workin him over with a hoe
           handle. Places where it won't show
           mostly. You know, the back and the
           chest. The kidneys. Once in a while
           in the face. Know what Maggio does
           when that happens? Spits in Fatso's
           eye.
                          (CHUCKLES)
           Oh, he's a hot one. Ain't he a hot

                          NAIR
           Course, he throws up a little blood
           now and then. And he passes out a
           lot. But Fatso sure ain't reportin
           none of that. So there's no way
           they goin to find out.
                         
                          PREW
           Why don't he go to the C.O.?
                         
                          NAIR
           We tried to get him to. But he
           won't peep. He says he got a lot
           more scalp to lose first. That boy
           is about the hardest artery in the
           hospital.
           (with great sentiment)
           But he's got a heart just like a
           great big baby.
                         
          Prew's face has been growing in fury. He pulls up a clump of
          sod, throws it down with all his might.
                         
                          PREW
           You think he's gonna be all right?
                         
                          NAIR
           Your guess is worth mine, sam.
           Maybe he's crackin a little at that
           -- cause after Fatso put him in the
           Hole -- that's what they call
           solitary -- a couple times he began
           talkin about how he's gonna e-
           scape. He said to tell you he'll
           look you up one of these nights.
                         
          A shadow falls across the grass in front of Prew.

           106.
                         
                         
          Prew is at the breaking point. Controlling himself, he weeds
          around Galovitch's shadow. It moves in front of Prew again.
                         
                          GALOVITCH'S VOICE
           Are proud dis Compny to be or not?
           Bites de hand dat feeds it der
           shoot dogs for. Infortunately, ony
           dogs day are allowed to shoot, not
           men.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT GROUP
          The other men have stopped weeding, are looking over at Prew
          and Galovitch. Thornhill, in b.g., puts down the comic book
          and comes over to them during following.
                         
                          PREW
           Get outa my way, Ike. I ain't gonna
           move around you again.
                         
                          GALOVITCH
           You need better lesson than up to
           now. Maybe I give to you myself.
           Maybe right now.
                         
          He steps on Prew's hand. As Prew jerks away from the heavy
          shoe Galovitch hauls him up by his fatigue shirt. Thornhill
          steps between them.
                         
                          THORNHILL
                          (TO GALOVITCH)
           Ey, leave him alone. `e's in my
                          DETAIL --
                         
          Prew shoves Thornhill aside, cold decision in his eyes. He
          starts unbuttoning his shirt.
                         
                          PREW
                          (TO GALOVITCH)
           All right. It's gonna be your way.
                         
          Galovitch rips off his shirt, bursting some of the buttons as
          he does. Stripped to the waist, his whole appearance seems to
          change; he looks as he did in the ring, a hard-muscled prize
          fighter.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           Ey, wait a minute, you guys -- !
                         
          Prew is barely able to get out of his shirt before Galovitch
          charges him.
                         
          VARIOUS ANGLES PREW AND GALOVITCH AND SPECTATORS
          During following men run from across the quadrangle and from
          out of the barracks to watch the affair, form a circle around
           107.
                         
                         
          the fighters. Prew is a skillful boxer, moving around
          Galovitch quickly and cleverly. Galovitch is more lumbering
          but not awkward. His heavy blows stagger Prew several times.
          Prew drives his attack at his opponent's body. He never
          throws a punch at the other's head.
                         
                          NAIR
           The head, Prew! Hit him in the
           head!
                         
          The other men around shout similar advice.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT GALOVITCH
          puzzled by Prew's concentration on his body and by the shouts
          of the men. He seems to be wondering if Prew is pulling a
          trick.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          A fear, not born of cowardice, is reflected on Prew's face as
          he sets himself, stares at Galovitch. He seems haunted by the
          memory of Dixie Wells.
                         
          CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES
                         
                         CLOSEUP PREW
          flinching without being hit. He seems mesmerized by the
          other's eyes.
                         
          CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          fighting. Galovitch draws blood from a cut over Prew's eye.
          He is getting the better of the battle. In b.g. Thornhill
          breaks out of the crowd and runs across the quadrangle.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT BALDY DHOM AND SPECTATOR
                         
                          SPECTATOR
           I don't get it -- Why don't Prew go
           for the head?
                         
                          DHOM
           He blinded a guy once. Must be
           scairt of the same thing.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          as Galovitch batters Prew back against the crowd. A right to
          the temple sends him to his knees. He shakes his head a
          moment, gets up and goes into a clinch.
                         
          LONG SHOT BARRACKS WINDOWS ON UPPER FLOORS
          The windows are crowded with men watching the fight.

          LONG SHOT OUT WINDOW To FRONT OF BARRACKS
          SHOOTING OVER heads of men watching, out to Prew and
          Galovitch on the ground. Dispassionate, professional ad-libs
          from the men: why does Prew continue his attack to the body
          only, a good little man and a good big man, etc.
                         
          INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES FEATURING WARDEN
          Warden is at his desk filling out an application blank.
          Holmes is glancing over his shoulder..
                         
          INSERT: OFFICER EXTENSION COURSE APPLICATION BLANK
          Warden's hand in shot filling out answers to sex, age, race,
          etc.
                         
                          HOLMES' VOICE
           I'll be glad to recommend you,
           Warden. You've got service,
           experience, grade. You'll make an
           excellent officer.
                         
          BACK TO SCENE:
                         
          Holmes waits for thanks.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (AFTER HESITATING)
           Thank you, sir.
                         
          The screen door in the Orderly Room bangs. Thornhill runs
          into the office, breathless. He comes to a shaking attention
          as he sees Holmes.
                         
                          HOLMES
           At ease, Sergeant. What's the
           matter?
                         
                          THORNHILL
           They fightin on the green, sir!
           Galovitch and Prewitt.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           Ike looks like `e goin to murder
           him, sir.
                         
          A pleased look crosses Holmes' face. Warden jumps up, starts
          for door. Holmes catches his arm.
           109.
                         
                         
                         
                          HOLMES
           There's no rush. I'll take care of
           it.
                         
          Holmes goes out. Thornhill follows, turns at the door.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           Ain't you want to see it, First?
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (SHOUTS SUDDENLY)
           No! I ain't want to see it! Nor you
           either! Get out of here!
                         
          Thornhill goes. The screen door in the Orderly Room bangs.
          Warden walks to his desk, stares down at the application
          form, picks it up. He carries it over to Holmes' desk. He
          looks at the picture of Karen on the desk.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PHOTOGRAPH OF KAREN
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          He stares at the picture, then looks at the application
          blank. Then he looks down at the chevrons on his arm. He rubs
          his hand over the chevrons gently, fondly. He looks at the
          application blank again very thoughtfully.
                         
          EXT. BARRACKS - DAY
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH ON LAWN
          A continuation of the fight. Prew is tiring, his face is cut
          and bleeding and there is a welt under one eye. Galovitch is
          unmarked but grunting now from Prew's constant jabs at his
          stomach. He seems perplexed, as before, by his opponent+s
          tactics.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT SPECTATORS
          FEATURING the non-"ath-a-leets" of G Company, including
          Anderson, Clark and Treadwell. Ad-libbed shouts of "In the
          face, Prew! In the face!"
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          FEATURING the "ath-a-loots," including Dhom, Wilson and
          Henderson. They are watching quietly, nodding with approval
          as Prew feints, then darts several punches into Galovitch's
          ribs, It almost seems as if they are admiring Prew's courage,
          inwardly rooting for him. Holmes enters the group, Thornhill
          tagging after him. Holmes stops and watches the fight. There
          is a look of satisfaction on his face.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          The fight continuing.
           110.
                         
                         
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          near rear of crowd. An officer, walking across the lawn, is
          attracted by the noise. He steps into the crowd. This is
          COLONEL WILLIAMS. He wears the insignia of the Inspector
          General's Department. He watches the fight, is about to step
          through to break it up when he sees Holmes. He stops, watches
          Holmes' reactions.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          Prew, backed up against the crowd, trips over somebody's
          feet. He falls without being hit. Galovitch kicks at him and
          Prew rolls away. The crowd murmurs angrily. Sergeant Stark
          steps out into the open circle, faces Galovitch.
                         
                          STARK
           This ain't no rassle, Ike. You got
           to fight this man fair.
                         
          Approving shouts from the crowd. Stark steps back. Ike waits
          for Prew to get up.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
          looking up at Galovitch.

                         CLOSEUP PREW
          His eyes narrow, harden as if his inner struggle has been
          resolved.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          Prew gets to his feet. As Galovitch comes to him, Prew feints
          for the stomach, then throws a hard right to Galovitch's
          face. It hits him flush on the nose. Blood spurts. The crowd
          roars.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Galovitch, surprised and hurt, throws up his hands. Prew
          drives both fists to his solar plexus. Galovitch drops his
          guard. Prew smashes him in the face and Adam's apple.
          Galovitch falls to his knees, hawking and choking.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH
          The whole nature of the fight has changed. Galovitch, hurt
          and reeling, rushes Prew, bull-like, head down, defense wide
          open. Prew dodges easily, slamming hard with rights and lefts
          to the head.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Holmes, seeing Prew is now clearly in command, steps out of
          the crowd and up to the two fighters.
           111.
                         
                         
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (SEVERELY)
           All right. Let's cut it.
                         
          There is a look of relief on the faces of both Galovitch and
          Prew as they stop fighting.
                         
                          HOLMES
           What started this?
                         
                          GALOVITCH
                          (PUFFING)
           Prewitt talk back to non-com.
           Refuse order I give him, start
           fight. I teach him lesson.
                         
          A laugh from the crowd.
                         
                          HOLMES
           You won't disobey any more orders
           in my Company, Prewitt. Warden
           saved you from a court martial once
           but he won't this time --
                         
          Anderson steps into the circle.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Sir -- I'm sorry, sir but Private
           Prewitt's not to blame for this.
           Sergeant Galovitch started it.
                         
          Holmes reacts, momentarily at a loss. He turns to Thornhill.
                         
                          HOLMES
                          (MEANINGFULLY)
           Thornhill, you're in charge of this
           detail. How about it?
                         
          Thornhill steps into the circle, nods toward Anderson.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           `e's right, sir.
           (points to Galovitch)
           `e begun it. Prewitt done nothin.
                         
          From the crowd step Sergeants Dhom, Wilson and Henderson.
          They face Holmes and Galovitch implacably.
                         
                          HENDERSON
           No, sir, this wasn't Prewitt's
           fault.
           112.
                         
                         
                         
                          DHOM
           That's right, sir. Everybody knows
           Galovitch started it.
                         
          Wilson nods. There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd.
          Holmes looks at his fighters, rocked by this betrayal. They
          stare back at him.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT COLONEL WILLIAMS
          Still near the rear of the crowd, he watches the scene with
          much interest.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Holmes pulls himself together, turns to the crowd.
                         
                          HOLMES
           That's all. Break it off. Let's get
           back to our jobs.
           (to Prew and Galovitch;
                          WEAKLY)
           I'm giving you two a break. I'll
           ignore this.
                         
          He walks off. He does not see Colonel Williams. Galovitch
          moves off toward the barracks. Wilson, Henderson and
          Thornhill remain grouped around Prew.
                         
                          PREW
           You guys figure this means I'm
           steppin into a ring, you're wrong.
                         
                          EMERSON
           It's your show, kid. Run it the way
           you want.
                         
                          WILSON
           You better put same iodine on them
           cuts.

           Yeah. An come over to Choy's
           tonight. We buy you a beer.
                         
          The non-coms walk off, Prew stares after them.

          LONG SHOT ACROSS ROAD PREW CLARK ANDERSON
          Sounds of gaiety from the beerhouse mingle with the mournful
          twang of guitars being played by Clark and Anderson. CAMERA
          MOVES SLOWLY toward the trio until the beerhouse noises are
           113.
                         
                         
          low. The men are surrounded by many empty beer bottles.
                         
           PREW, CLARK AND ANDERSON
                          (SINGING SOFTLY)
           Woke up sick on Thursday
           Feelin like my head took a dare
           Looked down at my trousers
           All my pockets was bare
           That girl sure was bad news
           Re-enlistment Blues...
                         
          The guitars finish the stanza with a flourish as CAMERA HOLDS
          on MEDIUM SHOT. The men chuckle.
                         
                          CLARK
           Some day I'm goin back to Scranton
           and play it for my folks. And tell
           em it wan composed in the Hawaiian
           Islands! Clear across the Pacific
           Ocean!
                         
                          PREW
           (finishes long swig of
                          BEER)
           Hey, Friday.
                         
                          CLARK
           Yeah?
                         
                          PREW
           Why you called Friday?
                         
                          CLARK
           Don't know. I was borned on
           Wednesday.
           (plucks guitar, sings)
           Went back around on Friday
           Asked for a free glass of beer...
                         
          The three laugh, sing in unison.
                         
           PREW, CLARK AND ANDERSON
           My friends had disappeared
           Barman said, `Take off, no credit
           here'...
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR ENTRANCE TO CHOY'S
          The music from across the road almost lost in the laughter
          and shouts from the beerhouse. Warden comes out, wobbles a
          bit. He has One On. He cups his hand over his ear, straining
          to hear the singing. He stumbles into Choate, coming along
          the sidewalk.
           114.
                         
                         
                         
                          CHOATE
           Top, you sure plastered.
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (MUSTERING DIGNITY)
           I am off duty. Off duty if I want
           to get plastered --
                         
          But Choate has gone into Choy's. CAMERA RETREATS with Warden
          as he wanders to the road, still trying to locate the
          singing. Half-way across the road he unceremoniously sits
          down, crosses his knees Buddha-wise. Here the singing is more
          audible. He listens contentedly.

           Ain't no time to lose Re-enlistment
           Blues...
                         
          Anderson, as usual, finishes the stanza with a brilliant
          display on the guitar. Prew stands up. In the glow of a
          streetlight his face shows the marks of his battle with
          Galovitch. He wobbles and we realize he, too, really Has One
          On.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Where you go in?
                         
                          PREW
           Back to Choy's. Get nother drink.
                         
          The guitars and singing continues in b.g. through following.
          CAMERA PANS with Prew as he weaves to the road.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT MIDDLE OF ROAD
          as Prew crosses. He can see the seated figure but the light
          from the street is too dim to identify it.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
                          (BOOMS)
           Halt!
                         
          Prew stops automatically.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           Who goes there?
                         
                          PREW
           A friend.

           Advance, friend, and be reconized.
                         
          Prew moves closer, CAMERA WITH him, until he recognizes
          Warden.
                         
                          WARDEN

                          PREW
           I'm goin to get a drink.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Siddown. I got a bottle.
                         
          He pulls a bottle of whisky from his field jacket, holds it
          up to Prew. Prew takes the bottle and drinks. Then he sits
          down in the road as matter-of-factly as did Warden. He gives
          the bottle back to Warden.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I hand it to you, kid. They called
           off The Treatment this afternoon.
           When you beat up Ike. I never heard
           of no soljer before ever lickin The
           Treatment...
           (drinks; then holds out
                          BOTTLE)
           Here, old buddy. Have a lil drink.
                         
          Prew drinks.
                         
                          WARDEN
           This is a terrible crummy life, you
           know it?
                         
                          PREW
           Miserble. Perfeckly miserble.
                         
                          WARDEN
           What if a truck or somethin was to
           come along and run over us?
                         
                          PREW
           Awful. Awful. We'd be dead,
           wouldn't we?
           116.

                          (NODS VEHEMENTLY)
           An nobody to even mourn. You better
           not sit here any more. You better
           get up and move over to the side of
           the road.
                         
                          PREW
           What about you? You got more to
           live for than me. You got to take
           care of your Compny.
                         
                          WARDEN
           I'm old. Don't matter if I die. But
           your life's ahead of you. You get
           up.
                         
                          PREW
           No, sir. Never deserted a friend in
           need. I'll stay to the bitter end.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (shakes head stubbornly)
           We'll stay together.
                         
          They square their shoulders heroically.
                         
                          WARDEN
           (as if to an invisible
                          FIRING SQUAD)
           No blindfold. Save it to wipe your
           nose on, you skunk.
                         
                          PREW
           Amen.
                         
          Each takes a drink.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Prew, I got the biggest troubles in
           the whole world.
                         
                          PREW
           The whole world?
                         
                          WARDEN
                          (NODS)
           Take love. Did you personally ever
           see any of this love?
                         
          Prew nods gravely.
           117.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           You'll unerstan, then... This girl,
           see, she wants me to become.
                         
                          PREW
           Become what?
                         
                          WARDEN
           (after long hesitation)
           An officer. Can you see me as an
           officer?
                         
                          PREW
           Sure I can see it. You'd make a
           good officer.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You both can see more'n I can. You
           know what, Prew? I'm scared become
           an officer.
                         
                          PREW
           You ain't scared of nothin, Warden.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, I am. I tell myself diffrnt
           but it's a fack. Where'd I be
           as an officer? How could I handle
           him? That's the one thing I'm
           scared of... be an officer in the
           U.S. Army.
                          (HASTILY)
           Army of the U.S.
                         
                          PREW
           A man should be what he can do.
                         
          Warden nods solemnly as if Prew has uttered a great truth.
          They pass the bottle once more.
                         
                          WARDEN
           How's your girl? Wha'st that name
           again?
                         
                          PREW
                          (HESITATES)
           Lorene.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Oh, yeah, I remember. Lorene.
           Beautiful name.
           118.
                         
                         
                         
          Warden claps Prew on the shoulder as if he is a lifelong
          friend. They smile. They look as if they are sharing a great
          secret, a secret known to them alone in the world. The
          mournful guitars and singing comes over a little louder.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The headlights of a jeep descend upon Warden and Prew. Then
          the vehicle skids into the shot with a screeching of brakes,
          comes to a halt directly in front of the men. Warden and Prew
          look at the car calmly, don't move. The headlights are
          blazing on them. Stark hops out from the driver's seat,
          furious.
                         
                          STARK
           Whatsa matter with you, you crazy,
           dumb screwballs?! You tryin to get
           killed?!
                         
                          WARDEN
           What you doin with that jeep,
           Sergeant Stark?

           I borrowed it. I'm goin to town.
           What you doin in the middle of the
           road?
                         
          The music of the guitars has stopped. There is a strange
          whine now, far in the distance, not identifiable. It grows
          during following.
                         
                          WARDEN
           My friend Prew and I sittin here
           discussin the weather.
                         
                          STARK
           Your friend, huh?
                         
                          PREW
           You beard me. I said my buddy
           Warden. My good friend Warden that
           you better not run over is what I
           said.

                          WARDEN
                          (ASSUMING ANGER)
           Don't you know you got to look out
           for this man. Get him off the road
           before you run him over. He's the
           best stinkin soljer in the Compny.
           119.
                         
                         
                         
                          STARK
           You both must be plumb nuts.
                         
                          PREW
           You heard me. Get this man to some
           safety. Why, he's the best stinkin
           soljer in the Compny.
                         
                          STARK
           I guess I'm the one who's nuts.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT MAGGIO
          as he stumbles around the side of the jeep directly into the
          blaze of the headlights. There are scars, new and healing on
          Maggio's face. One of his ears is cauliflowered, enough to
          give him the lopsided ribald look of a punchy. A couple of
          teeth are missing. Weirdly outlined in the glare, he is a
          nightmare figure, an apparition. The whine in the distance is
          identifiable now. It is the siren of the Stockade.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           ... figgered you might be at

                         GROUP SHOT
          The men gape at Maggio, unable to accept the shock of his
          appearance. Then Prew and Warden jump up and catch him as he
          is about to fall. The drunkenness drains out of them. Stark
          watches in bewilderment.
                         
                          MAGGIO

          Warden steps back as Prew holds Maggio. During following
          Anderson and Clark come over, watch pop-eyed.
           120.

           Come on, let's get him to the
           hospital.
                         
          Maggio grasps him tighter. He is crying now.
                         
                          MAGGIO
           Prew... they gonna send you to the
           Stockade...?

           Should they do, watch out for
           Fatso! You gotta make like it's a
           game... He'll try to crack you but

          He goes limp in Prew's arms, slides to the road.
                         
                         GROUP SHOT
          Warden bends over Maggio. The others watch, scared.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          staring down at Maggio.
                         
                         GROUP SHOT
          Warden looks up.
           121.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           He's dead.
                         
                          CLARK
           Dead? But he was here just a minute
           ago.
                         
          Prew bends over, picks up Maggio, holds him in his arms
          gently, unbelieving.
                         
                          STARK
           Fatso's lucky. They'll figure he
           got killed fallin out of that
           truck.
                         
                          PREW
           He ain't dead.
                         
          CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of Prew as he carries Maggio to the jeep,
          the others following. He lifts Maggio into the rear of,the
          jeep. Warden puts his hand on Prew's arm.
                         
                          WARDEN
           He's dead, Prew.
                         
          Prew stares at Maggio, lying in the jeep. Stark gets into the
          front of the jeep.
                         
                          STARK
           I'll take him, Prew.
                         
          He starts the motor. Prew leans over, moves Maggio's body a
          little.
                         
                          PREW
                          (TO STARK)
           See his head don't bump.
                         
          The jeep drives off.

          EXT. BARRACKS AREA - NIGHT
                         
                         LONG SHOT
          Framed beautifully in the moonlight, the Quadrangle and
          Barracks area look like a college campus. Silence. No
          movement.
                         
          LONG SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE
          A figure can be seen far in b.g, at the Bugler's post beside
          the megaphone. Another figure stands near him. The silence
          continues, then is broken by the sound of the bugle beginning
           122.
                         
                         
          Taps. The first note is incredibly clear and loud and
          certain. It is held longer than most Buglers hold it. The
          second note is daringly short, abrupt. The last note of the
          first phrase rises, peals out, heartfelt. Two men come into
          the shot, smoking. They stop, turn toward the Bugler, listen
          attentively. One of them flips away his cigarette. The Taps
          continues through the following.
                         
          INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT
                         
                         FULL SHOT
          Most of the men turn in their beds toward the sound of the
          bugle. Some prop up on their elbows.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT CHOATE
          as he listens. A look of mingled longing and satisfaction.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT LEVA
          listening. A strange look of pride.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT MAZZIOLI
          listening, his face also betraying emotions normally
          concealed.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT TREADWELL AND ANDERSON
          listening. Their bunks are next to each other.
                         
                          TREADWELL

          EXT. PORCH ON BARRACKS - NIGHT
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Three men come out of the barracks, lean over the porch rail,
          listening. Their faces are thoughtful, sad.
                         
          INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN
          The office lit only by a light over his desk. He is working
          late, a sheaf of papers spread out before him. He listens to
          the bugle call, moved, sorrowful. He snaps off the light,
          listens in the darkness.
                         
          EXT. QUADRANGLE - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
          at the Bugler's post. He is finishing the last phrases, full
          and wonderful. Behind him stands Friday Clark, motionless.
          The final note quivers to silence. Prew swings the megaphone
          for the repeat. Then the repeat begins, the clear proud notes
          reverberating across the silent quadrangle.
           123.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT KARELSEN
          lying on his back in his bunk, arms clasped behind his head.
          He listens, his gnarled face the picture of the old soldier.
          He breathes heavily as if he is hearing his own requiem and
          epitaph.
                         
          EXT. PORCH ON BARRACKS - NIGHT
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          There are eight or nine men here now, listening.
                         
          CLOSE SHOTS DHOM HENDERSON THORNHILL
          There is a choked kinship on all the faces.

                         FULL SHOT
          More men are propped on their elbows, their heads turned
          toward the Bugler. The dim figure of Treadwell can be seen,
          at a window now.
                         
                          TREADWELL
           (almost inaudible whisper)
           ... I told you it was Prewitt...
                         
          EXT. QUADRANGLE - NIGHT
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          continuing the Taps. There are tears in his eyes now.
                         
          EXT. BARRACKS STEPS - NIGHT
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          A half dozen men are sitting on the steps, listening, among
          them Stark and Wilson. Stark shakes his head sadly.

                         LONG SHOT
          Several groups of two and three scattered about. They are
          standing in no particular places, as if they have been
          walking and stopped suddenly. They are all looking toward the
          Bugler.
           124.

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ANDERSON
          as the Taps repeat is drawing to a close. He is lying on his
          side, turned toward the Bugler, a look of serenity, of peace
          on his face. His eyes close as he falls asleep.
                         
          EXT. QUADRANGLE - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          coming to the end of the Taps. CAMERA MOVES IN to a CLOSEUP.
          Prew's face is wet with tears. His lips are pinched and red.
          He blows the final notes.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW AND CLARK
          Prew lowers the bugle slowly and lets the megaphone rest in
          its swivel. He withdraws the mouthpiece, puts it in his
          pocket. He hands the bugle to Clark. Clark looks at the
          instrument as if it has become hallowed. Prew walks off into
          the darkness.

                         TRACKING SHOT
          CAMERA MOVES along street, passing a lone pedestrian. It
          MOVES TOWARD the sign NEW CONGRESS CLUB, HOLDS beside an open
          window through which is heard the sound of harsh piano
          playing; the pounding style and lack of shading are clearly
          Fatso Judson's. CAMERA PANS AND INCLUDES Prew, leaning
          against the building. He is watching the entrance to the Club
          patiently. There is relentless hatred on his face. The music
          stops. Prew does not move.

          Hearty male laughter from within. The door opens and Fatso
          and a couple of sailors cane out. They are about to start
          down the street.
                         
                          PREW'S VOICE
           Hello, Fatso.
                         
          Fatso looks around in direction of voice. CAMERA PANS,
          DISCLOSES Prew, still leaning against the building. Fatso
          squints, not recognizing him.
           125.
                         
                         
                         
                          FATSO
           You want me?
                         
                          PREW
           Yeah, Fatso.
                         
          Fatso takes a couple of steps toward Prew, squints again.
                         
                          FATSO
           I don't like that nickname. You
           want to see me about somethin?
                         
                          PREW
           Yeah. Let's step around the corner
           here where we can talk.
                         
          Prew's voice is so toneless as to be ominous.
                         
                          FATSO
                          (GRINS)
           Okay. Good night, gents.
                         
          The sailors go off. Fatso walks into the darkness of an alley
          next to the building. Prew follows.
                         
          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND FATSO
          Just enough light from the street lamp to illuminate about
          ten feet into the alley.
                         
                          FATSO
           Okay. You sore about somethin?
                         
                          PREW
           No. I just don't like the way you
           play the piano.
                         
          Fatso throws back his head and laughs loudly.
                         
                          PREW
           You know Maggio?
                         
                          FATSO
           The little Wop? The one who bust
           out of the Stockade? Sure. He was a
           real tough monkey. But crazy, see?
                         
                          PREW
           You killed him.
                         
                          FATSO
           Did I? If I did, he ask for it.
           126.
                         
                         
                         
                          PREW
           I hear they're gonna court martial
           you, Fatso. But before the Army
           gets you, I want a piece of you
           myself.
                         
          There is the snick of a blade snapping open as Fatso pulls a
          knife. He moves toward Prew, who steps swiftly to one side.
                         
                          PREW
           I kinds thought you'd try that.
                         
          There is the same sound as Prew pulls a knife from his
          pocket, snaps it open, holds it out flat in his hand, showing
          it to Fatso.
                         
                          PREW
           This here's the one you pulled on
           Maggio once. Reconize it?
                         
          Fatso darts at Prew, knife raised. Prew moves back, but Fatso
          is on him and they both roll to one side along the building.
          The movement throws them deep into the shadows.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING INTO THE SHADOWS
          The two figures feint and dart. There is the occasional
          silver flash of the knives as light hits them. The men go
          deeper into the shadows, are all but lost to view. There is a
          startled, pained cry. Then one of the figures falls to his
          knees and starts to crawl toward camera.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT SHOOTING NEAR GROUND
          as the figure comes directly to camera, REVEALING the
          anguished face of Fatso. It slowly turns, is upside down in
          the frame.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Fatso is on his back, his stomach gushing bloods his eyes
          already glazing. Prew staggers into the light now. His left
          side has two vicious cuts; he is bleeding badly. He stares
          down at Fatso, who manages a small, reproving voice.
                         
                          FATSO
           You've killed me. Why'd you want to
           kill me?
                         
          Prew backs away from Fatso, turns, staggers down the alley
          away from camera.

                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Prew comes toward camera, laboriously struggling up the road.
          His side is hemorrhaging steadily, his shirt and trousers
          blood-soaked. He stops close to camera. He wads his
          handkerchief, sticks it inside his shirt near the knife
          wound. He smiles wearily, crookedly.
                         
                          PREW
           (mumbles to himself)
           Gonna have an awful bad scar
           there...
                         
          He lights a cigarette, his fingers shaking. The flame from
          the match illuminates his left wrist. There is a deep scar on
          it. It seems to fascinate Prew as he stares at it, rubs his
          fingers across it.
                         
                          PREW

          track.

          door. The doorknob moves slowly, the door opens. Prew falls
          into the room and pitches to the floor.

          The American flag, the General's flag and the Division flag
          are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office.
          Colonel Williams is reading from a typed report.
                         
                          COLONEL WILLIAMS
           --- In addition to inefficiency
           in administering his command and
           neglect of duty, Captain Holmes has
           been guilty of indefensible cruelty
           to the aforesaid Private Prewitt.
           This extended to instigating and
           encouraging wholly unauthorized and
           discreditable tactics to force the
           soldier to join the inter-regiment
           boxing team. These findings are the
           result of personal investigation by
           the Inspector General and are
           corroborated by numerous members of
           G Company.
                         
          Colonel Williams puts his report on the General's desk.
          Holmes' face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he
          has really expected something like this for a long time. He
          makes no move to speak. The General is angry clear through.
                         
                          GENERAL SLATER
           I'm waiting for your reply to this.
                         
                          HOLMES
           I haven't any, sir... The charges --

                          GENERAL SLATER
           Holmes, the first thing I ever
           learned in the Army was that an
           officer takes care of his men. It
           seems to be the first thing you
           forgot. It's monstrous to think of
           anybody like you in command of
           troops. And believe me, you won't
           be for long. My only regret is that
           we have to keep you in uniform
           until a court martial is concluded.

           duties.
                         
          He indicates the meeting is over. Holmes rises, is about to
          leave, pauses.
                         
                          HOLMES

           court martial, sir. Any way...
                         
          The General frowns, is unresponsive. Holmes looks to Colonel
          Williams helplessly.
                         
                          COLONEL WILLIAMS
           There is one alternative,
           General... if you're so disposed. A
           resignation for the good of the
           service under AR 600-275.

           (thinks a moment)
           I'll give you a chance you don't
           deserve, Holmes. Write a letter of
           resignation and have it on my desk
           this afternoon. I'll consider
           accepting it. Only because as far
           as I'm concerned, the quicker
           you're out of the Army the better
           for everybody. Especially the Army.

           already been relieved! So you can

          She shakes her head, not wanting to believe; she takes the
          letter out of his hand, starts to read it. She stops after a
          sentence or two. Her hand falls to her side. Holmes sits on
          the bed heavily. The bluster bleeds out of him. He shakes his
          head, emotionally bewildered. For perhaps the first time in
          his life he is nakedly honest.

          reacting; she is surprised, a little afraid of her own
          emotion. The outcry, so lost, so despairing, moves her. She
          is sorry for him.

          Abruptly, she runs out of the room.

          CLOSE SHOT DESK
          FEATURING placard reading LIEUTENANT ROSS. We hear Ross'
          first few words over this, then CAMERA PULLS BACK to MEDIUM
          SHOT. Ross is forceful, clean-cut, gives the impression of
          toughness but fairness. As he talks he takes down the
          photographs of prize fighters and prize fighting from the
          wall. Watching and listening are Sergeants Dhom, Thornhill,
          Henderson, Leva, Stark and Karelsen and Corporal Wilson. Ross
          is such a complete switch from Holmes that the men are almost
          unnerved by him. But a definite respect is reflected in their
          expressions. Warden, beside his desk, shares this.

           Dismissed.
                         
          The men troop out, passing camera. As last man leaves, CAMERA
          IS ON Warden. He is looking at Ross with considerable
          approval, even admiration. He resumes a more normal
          expression as Ross turns toward him.
                         
                          WARDEN

           I think the Company Commander made
           a wise decision, sir.
                         
          The phone rings. Warden goes to his desk, answers.

          Karen's voice is heard on the phone; we cannot understand
          what she is saying, but a flood of words pours through. With
          Ross looking on, Warden is embarrassed.

          Ross perceives Warden's distress. He starts toward the door.
          Warden nods gratefully. Ross smiles, leaves the room.

          He puts down the receiver. He stares at the desk. Then he
          slowly pulls out the top drawer. The Officers Application
          Blank is lying on top of a pile of other papers. He takes it
          out, looks at it somberly. CAMERA MOVES IN to an INSERT of
          the Application. We see Warden's answers to sex, age, race,
          etc. CAMERA MOVES DOWN the page to the place for the
          signature of the applicant. It is unsigned.

          pedestrians and HOLDS on a MEDIUM SHOT. There is a defeated,
          tired look about them, as if they have been talking for a
          long time to no avail.

           he was a fresh punk at first...
           until I got to know him a little.
           He's AWOL right now -- probly in
           some kind of real trouble -- he
           ain't the kind to go AWOL
           otherwise. Anyway, I keep
           remembering somethin he said to me
           the first day he came in. He said a
           man has got to go his own way... if
           he don't, he's nothin... I'm an

           No, Milt. I don't want to kiss you

          Alma is reading a newspaper in b.g. Prew is disheveled and
          slovenly, needs a shave badly. His face is lined with pain.
          He is drunk from several days of steady drinking, stone
          drunk, as if in a trance. He wears crumpled civilian clothes.
          He is at a table laboriously writing out the Re-enlistment
          Blues. He finishes writing a stanza and sings softly.

          toward Alma. But his eyes are fixed on a whisky bottle on a
          table beside her. He moves stiffly, favoring his side, his

                          PREW

           Oh, Prew! Prew! Why did you have to
           do it? Why did you have to kill
           that man?
                         
          Prew shakes his head sadly as if he doesn't know the answer.
          He picks up the paper he has been writing on, sings softly,
          testing the last couple of lines affectionately.

          INT. MESS HALL - DAY
                         
                         FULL SHOT
          CAMERA FEATURES clock on wall reading 7:52. About half the
          Company is at breakfast. There is considerable laughter and
          horseplay. Near the kitchen a dozen men are in the chow line.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          FEATURING Warden at the NCO table. He rises, carries his
          plate with him towards the chow line. A sudden, deep-toned,
          earthquake-like blast shudders through the room. The cups on
          the tables rattle. Warden stops, cocks his head. The men stop
          eating, look at each other.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           (to the room)
           Must be dynamitin down to Wheeler
           Field.

           Them engineers mighty ambitious
           Sunday mornin before eight o'clock.
                         
          The men resume eating. Warden moves a couple of steps toward
          the chow line when the second blast hits. It is much heavier
          and fuller.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          He has a hunch about this now. He reaches out to put his
          plate down, holding it very carefully in both hands. However,
          he doesn't bother to see if there is anything under it. The
          plate falls and crashes on the floor a fraction of a second
          before the third groundswell of blast shakes the room.
                         
          EXT. COMPANY STREET - DAY
                         
          FULL SHOT NEAR MESS HALL
          A man sprints toward the mess hall, yelling to right and left
          at the top of his lungs. As he approaches camera we see it is
          Mazzioli.
                         
                          MAZZIOLI
           The Japs're bombing Wheeler Field!
           It's the Japs! They're bombing
           Wheeler Field! The Japs! It's the
           Japs! I saw the red circles on the
           wings!
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING UP CIRCLES ON UNDERSIDE OF MOVING PLANE
          The roar of the plane over shot.
                         
          MOVING SHOT SHOOTING DOWN FROM JAP PLANE PAST PILOT
          The figure of Mazzioli gets closer and closer as the plane
           139.
                         
                         
          dives toward him, machine guns spitting.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT MAZZIOLI
          as the Jap plane flashes by close above him. The stones in
          the pavement pop up. Mazzioli flops on the street. The plane
          zooms.
                         
          FULL SHOT MESS HALL
          as the men rush out. In the front ranks are Warden, Karelsen,
          Stark and Choate, Choate carries his half-filled plate in one
          hand, a mug of coffee in the other. The men stretch their
          necks, following the plane. Then they look back up the
          street, CAMERA PANNING. Far in b.g, a column of black
          mushrooming to the sky. Warden dashes to Mazzioli. CAMERA
          MOVES IN to a CLOSE SHOT as Warden bends over him, hoists him
          to a sitting position. He is extremely gentle. Mazzioli's
          knee is laid open and is bleeding freely. Warden whips out a
          handkerchief and starts to apply a tourniquet.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Some of the men continue to crane at the sky. A few pick up
          metal links from the Jap bullets.
                         
                          NAIR
           Say! This'll make me a good
           souvenir! A bullet from a Jap
           plane!
                         
                          WARDEN
           This ain't jawbone! This is for
           record. Theme real bullets that guy
           was usin. Get inside -- all of ya!
                         
          Warden gets Mazzioli to his feet, turns to first man in group
          surrounding them. It is Anderson.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Help him over to the hospital.
                         
          Anderson starts Mazzioli down the street.
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING UP TO SKY
          A pair of planes are diving toward the street.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           GET INSIDE!
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The men rush for cover, all except Choate who is left alone
          in shot. He takes a big bite of his sausage and eggs, hastily
          downs a swig of coffee. Then he throws the plate and cup into
          the street and dives for cover as the terrifyingly loud noise
          of the Jap planes indicates they are directly overhead.
           140.
                         
                         
                         
          INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
                         
                         FULL SHOT
          The men are pouring in from the Company street, all shouting
          at once. Warden pushes his way through them and jumps up on
          the pool table. His big voice booms.
                         
                          WARDEN
           All right, all right, you men!
           Quiet down! Quiet down! It's only a
           war. Ain't you ever been in a war
           before?
                         
          The men begin to quiet down, look to Warden respectfully.
          Through the scene the heavy earth shudders are felt and heard
          as bombs hit in the far distance. Also the sound of the
          strafing planes.
                         
                          WARDEN
           We're gonna organize a fire
           umbrella defense. I want the non-
           coms to get BARs and ammunition
           from the Supply Room and get up on
           the roof. Henderson, you're in
           charge of the loading detail. Get
           movin!
                         
          The non-coms push out the door.
                         
                          TREADWELL
           Hey, what about me? I been waitin
           all my life to git to shoot a BAR
           at somethin!
                         
                          WARDEN
           Okay. It's your life.
                         
          Treadwell hurries after the non-coms.
                         
                          WARDEN
           The rest of you guys - the CQ will
           unlock the rifle racks. Every man
           get his rifle and go to his bunk
           and stay there. And I mean stay
           there! I'm making each squad leader
           responsible to keep his men inside.
           If you have to use a rifle butt to
           do it, that's okay, too.
                         
          There are shouts of protest. The men are over the first shock
          now and beginning to get angry, anxious for action.
           141.
                         
                         
                         
                          WARDEN
           You heard me! This ain't no
           maneuvers. You go runnin around
           outside you'll get your ears shot
           off. You want to be heroes, you'll
           get plenty chances later. You'll
           probly have Japs in your laps
           before night.
                         
                          SOLDIER
           What if they bomb us?
                         
                          WARDEN
           You hear a bomb comin, you're free
           to take off for the brush. But
           don't worry -- the Japs'll probly
           drop all their bombs on Pearl
           Harbor and Hickam. They ain't gonna
           waste `em on us. So let's can the
           chatter. We're wastin time. Squad
           leaders, get `em upstairs!
                         
          Squad leaders begin to herd their men out. Warden jumps off
          the pool table. Stark and Karelsen come up to him.
                         
                          STARK
           What you want me to do, First? I
           got a hangover, but I can still --
                         
                          WARDEN
           You stick in the kitchen and make a
           big pot of coffee. No -- make a
           barrel of coffee.
                         
                          KARELSEN
           I think I could get one of them
           Japs with a machine gun, Milt.
           We'll put the tripod over a
           chimney. And hold her down by the
           legs.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Whatever you say, Pete.
                         
          They smile at each other affectionately, then push into the
          crowd leaving the Day Room.
                         
          EXT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The non-coma are arguing violently with Leva at the door to
          the Supply Room. Jap planes are loud overhead.
           142.
                         
                         
                         
                          LEVA
           I don't care. I can't issue any
           live ammunition without a signed
           order from an officer.
                         
                          HENDERSON
           But there ain't no officers yet,
           you jerk! Lieutenant Ross lives off
           the post.
                         
                          LEVA
                          (FOLDS ARMS)
           I'm sorry fellows. Lieutenant Ross
           give me them orders himself. No
           signed order, no ammo. And that's
           all they are to it.
                         
          Warden hurries up to the group.
                         
                          DHOM
           He won't let us have no ammo, Top!
                         
                          CHOATE
           Hats got it locked up. An the keys
           in his pocket.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Gimme them keys!
                         
                          LEVA
           I can't, Top. I got to obey my
           orders. No live ammo without a
                          SIGNED --
                         
          They flatten against the wall as a Jap plane roars building-
          high down the street, machine guns flaring. After it passes,
          they rush back to Lava,
                         
                          WARDEN
           What's the matter? You blind? You
           see them planes --?!
                         
          Lava puts his hand in his pocket protectively, shakes his
          head.
                         
                          LEVA
           I ain't gonna do it, Top. I --
                         
                          WARDEN
           Okay. Chief, bust the door down.
                          (TO LEVA)
           Get the hell out of the way!
           143.
                         
                         
                         
          Choate, Henderson and Dhom back up for a run at the door.
          Leva moves in front of the door.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Go ahead. Bust it down. He'll get
           out of the way.
                         
                          LEVA
           Remember I warned you. I did my
           best.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Okay. I'll see you get a medal.
                         
          Warden dashes up the porch steps as Choate, Henderson and
          Dhom launch themselves at the door. Leva steps aside. The
          door rattles ponderously, then flies open. The three
          battering rams careen into the Supply Room. The men standing
          by cheer and rush in after them. Leva shakes his head grimly.

                         FULL SHOT
          The men are sitting on their bunks, unhappily, holding their
          rifles. Others who have slept through breakfast are dressing
          hastily. Warden rushes into the room. The men immediately
          bark ad-libbed questions at him:
                         
                          SOLDIERS
                          (AD LIB)
           What's the deal, First?
           Why can't we go up on the roof?
           Where's the ammo, Top?
           Are we soljers -- or Boy Scouts?
                         
                          WARN

          In b.g. Henderson and others are going up the porch stairs to
          the roof. They tote BARs and loading clips. Karelsen and two
          helpers follow with a heavy machine gun and belt boxes.
          Warden starts for the porch stairs. He is attracted by
          something, stops, looks out of scene.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT THORNHILL FROM WARDEN'S POV
          lying under an empty bunk with three mattresses piled on it.
          He is in his underwear and a helmet, hugs his rifle.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT THORNHILL AND WARDEN

                          WARDEN
           You'll catch a cold, Turp.
                         
                          THORNHILL
           Don't go out there, First Sergeant!
           You'll be killed! They're shootin
           it up! You'll be dead! You'll not
           be alive any more. Don't go out
           there!
                         
                          WARDEN
           You better put your pants on.
                         
          Warden hits the floor as a plane is heard so loud and low it
          sounds as if it's coming right into the room. A dotted line
          of bullets crosses the floor and moves into Warden's and
          Karelsen's room. Warden jumps up and rushes into the room.
                         
          INT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROOM - DAY
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          as Warden runs in. Broken glass lies all over the floor.
          Bullet holes are stitched across the top of Warden's
          footlocker. He throws back the lid fiercely. His linen is
          polka-dotted with holes. He tosses out shirts, shorts, etc.,
          digs underneath them. He pulls out a quart bottle of whisky;
          it is untouched. Warden smiles with relief. He lifts the
          bottle to his lips, drinks long and heartily.
                         
          EXT. ROOF OF BARRACKS - DAY
                         
          FULL SHOT ROOF
          About twenty of Company GIs men, including almost all the non-
          cams, are on the roof, They are crouched behind the chimneys
          or down on their knees in the corners. The BARs are propped
          on the low walls or chimney tops, their muzzles pointed to
          the sky.
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF TO SKY
          Three Jap planes, forming a V, are heading straight for
          camera.
                         
          FULL SHOT MEN ON ROOF
                         
                          DHOM
                          (SHOUTING)
           Come on, you dirty sons --
                         
          The scream of the planes drowns Dhom's voice. There is a
          tremendous clatter as the men fire. The Jap planes pass,
          untouched.
           145.
                         
                         
          From this moment on there is no letup of the noise -- there
          is a wild cacophony of Jap planes, BARs, Karelsen's machine
          gun, the deep sound of bombs hitting in the far distance. And
          Chief Choate, singing the Regimental marching song, loudly
          and lustily.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          as Warden comes up on the roof through the skylight. He
          shouts incoherently at the men. They shout back in a wild
          cheer. They are like a pack of hungry men enjoying their
          first big meal in years. In b.g. the Jap V has swung about
          and heads back. Warden grabs a BAR from the roof.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT FLASH JAP PILOT IN LEAD PLANE
          grinning as his plane dives, its guns roaring. His silk scarf
          ripples out behind him.
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN
          firing the BAR, standing, as the Jap planes roar over. He
          staggers back from the recoil.
                         
          FULL SHOT ROOF
          The men fire in unison. They rise after the planes pass,
          shake their fists. Henderson and others of the loading detail
          appear on the roof, bringing up more ammunition.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN
          He lets out a hoarse yell of glee and pride. "These are my
          boys. This is my Company," it seems to say. The men answer
          back with a great answering shout.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Warden makes a tour of the roof, laughing, exhorting,
          slapping the men on their buttocks like a quarterback. They
          respond with tremendous spirit; they are having one hell of a
          time. We get only a snatch of what Warden is yelling.
                         
                          WARDEN
           -- Don't worry about wasting ammo!
           Throw your empty clips down into
           the yard. The loading detail will
           pick 'em up --
                         
          The sound of a bugle blowing insistently is now heard,
          blending into the rest of the noise. Treadwell runs to the
          edge of the roof, looks over.
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF TO QUADRANGLE
          At the Bugler's post, Friday Clark is sounding a call.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT ON ROOF
          Treadwell turns, yells at the men.

                          TREADWELL
           Friday's gone crazy! He's blowing
           the Cavalry Charge!

          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT CLARK
          His cheeks puffed, blowing the bugle madly.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM OF ALMA'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW
          He is lying on a couch in pajamas. He has not shaven, his
          hair is unkempt. A Radio Announcer is heard over shot. Prew
          wakens, groggy with hangover and near-delirium, wrestles with
          the blanket over him. CAMERA PULLS BACK to MEDIUM SHOT,
          DISCLOSING Alma and Gorgette. They have negligees over their
          nightgowns, are listening to the radio. The Announcer's voice
          tries hard to be calm and official but he cannot keep the
          tremor out of it. (NOTE: Transcripts of the actual broadcast
          have been requested.)
                         
           RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
           ... This is a real attack, not a
           maneuver. The Japanese are bombing
           Pearl Harbor. Please keep in your
           homes. Do not go on the streets. I
           repeat, this is a real attack.
           Japanese planes are bombing our
           naval and army installations.
           Civilians will remain in their
           homes. This is a real attack -
                         
          The Announcer's voice goes on as above.
                         
                          PREW
                          (MUTTERS)

          Alma shakes Prew, hard. He falls back on the couch, passes
          out.
                         
          EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY
                         
                         FULL SHOT
          The Jap strafing attack is continuing. Their planes are
          making a figure 8 in the sky. Silhouettes of men on the roof
          can b e seen. Friday Clark is blowing his Cavalry Charge. In
          b.g. men of the loading detail are scurrying around.
          Lieutenant Ross runs into shot. CAMERA PANS him across the
          quadrangle toward the barracks.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR BARRACKS
          Lieutenant Ross is hailed by the loading detail -- about ten
          men. He grabs a BAR and ammunition from them and runs into
          the barracks. The loading detail is working feverishly, same
          carrying ammunition into the barracks, others picking up
          empty clips as they are thrown from the roof and hustling
          them toward the Supply Room.
                         
          EXT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING LEVA
          He is working hard, passing out ammunition to members of the
          loading detail. But he shakes his head dourly as if the whole
          thing is still very unofficial.
                         
          EXT. ROOF OF BARRACKS - DAY
                         
                         FULL SHOT
          As before, pandemonium -- but controlled and efficient. The
          men are hoarse from shouting, red-eyed, puffing from
          excitement and exertion. Two Jap planes swoop past and the
          full-throated umbrella of fire lets loose. Lieutenant Ross
          clambers onto the roof, stooping under the burden of the BAR
          and loading clips. The men greet him with a concerted cheer.
                         
          TWO SHOT LIEUTENANT ROSS AND WARDEN
          Ross looks around the roof, nods with evident approval, claps
          Warden on the shoulder.
                         
                          DHOM'S VOICE
           HERE THEY COME, MEN!
           148.
                         
                         
                         
          Sound of Jap planes comes up ear-splitting loud. Ross drops
          down behind a chimney, swings his BAR, fires. CAMERA MOVES TO
          INCLUDE Karelsen at the other side of the chimney, firing the
          machine gun. Two soldiers hang onto the bucking legs of the
          tripod. Two Jap planes pass in b.g. of shot, zoom off into
          the sky.
                         
                          KARELSEN
                          (DISGUSTEDLY)
           Nuts! Led him too tar.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          as the men on the roof reload. In the distance the Jap planes
          have turned and are heading back for the roof.
                         
          CLOSE SHOTS FLASHES JAP PILOTS IN PLANES
          Their lips curled bitterly as their planes head for the roof.

          CLOSE SHOT KARELSEN
          firing the machine gun. He yanks the tripod away from his
          helpers, picks up the gun, stands and swings it after the
          plane. The recoil staggers him half way across the roof and
          deposits him on his rear.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT JAP PILOT
          He jumps in his seat like a man tied to a hot stove, throws
          up his arms helplessly.
                         
          LONG SHOT OPEN FIELD SHOOTING FROM ROOF
          The Jap plane bursts into flame and crashes.
                         
          FULL SHOT ON ROOF
          The men rise as one with an uproarious cheer. They rush to
          Karelsen, pick him up. Warden lets go with another of his
          rebel yells.
                         
                          WARDEN
           You got him, Pete! You got him!

           Ah, nobody'll ever know which of us
           got that guy.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          as the men return to their positions. Two planes head for
          them, pass over as Company G lets go again with everything it
          has.

           That was an American plane!
                         
                          WARDEN

          MEDIUM SHOT NEAR BUGLER'S POST
          Friday Clark, blowing the Cavalry Charge madly, abandons the
          megaphone as he sees the plane coming. He drops on his chest,
          hugging the bugle. The plane passes. Clark jumps up
          instantly, resumes blowing the Charge.
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM ROOF JAP PLANE
          The same plane has gained altitude so that it is a few feet
          above the barracks as it heads straight for the roof.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          The men flatten, all but Warden. He stands, swings his BAR
          toward the plane. CAMERA IS ANGLED so that Warden is
          silhouetted against the sky as he fires at the Jap plane.
                         
          LONG SHOT JAP PLANE
          It misses the roof by a foot or two, zooms up at a weird
          angle. A thick cloud of smoke pours out of the engine. The
          plane falls off on one wing and crashes into trees at the end
          of the quadrangle.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT JAP PLANE
          crashing. The gas-tank explodes. A cloud of fire and black

          INT. LIVING ROOM OF ALMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          There are improvised blackout curtains over windows and the
          glass doors. The radio is on, volume low, and an announcer
          (not the one of the morning) is droning out an account of
          Pearl Harbor. Prew, still on the couch in his pajamas, looks
          as if he has just struggled to wakefulness. He listens to the
          radio for a few moments in confused disbelief. He shakes his
          head vigorously as if to throw off his grogginess. He shakes
          his head again, slowly, more knowingly now, nodding as if he
          remembers something from the broadcast of the morning. Then
          as if all of it hits him suddenly and fully and terribly he
          wrenches himself off the couch. He looks around at the dimly
          lit room.
                         
                          PREW
           Alma! Alma!
                         
          He goes to the blackout curtains, peeps out. Then he turns
          back to listen to the radio. Abruptly, he runs into the
          bedroom.
                         
                          PREW'S VOICE
           Alma!
                         
          The room remains empty for a few moments as the radio
          announcer goes on, continuing previous remarks.
                         
           RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
           -- ready to fight and die for us,
           our Regular Army and Navy have this
           day upheld the faith and confidence
           we have always placed in them. They
           have proved their right to the
           esteem we have always had for
           them...
                         
          Prew comes back into the room. He has his shoes on, holds
          civilian shirt and pants in his hand. He starts to put them
          on hurriedly, his attention still focused on the broadcast.
          The front door opens and Alma and Gorgette enter. They are
          surprised to see Prew up. He nods at them, turns back quickly
          to listen to the radio as he continues dressing.
                         
           RADIO ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
           ... the attack caused serious

           You said it! Who they think they're
           fight in?
           (incoherent with rage; to
                          GIRLS)
           They're pickin trouble with the
           best Army in -- the best riflemen --
           you know we the ony country on the
           face of the earth that uses the
           shooting gunsling, not the carrying
           gunsling. You know that?
                         
          The radio continues on under the scene. Alma and Gorgette
          speak breathlessly, in a rush.
                         
                          ALMA
           We've been at Queens Hospital --

                          GORGETTE
           And the drugstore on McKully and
           King is smashed flat. And
           the man and his wife were killed --
                         
          Prew gestures to radio as if he's heard all about it. He
          sticks his shirttails into his trousers.
                         
                          PREW

           The Post? Tonight?
                         
          Prew nods vehemently, moves across room to a table.
                         
                          ALMA
           But why?

                          ALMA
           But you can't! You're not fit yet --
           you're weak as a kitten -- you're
           AWOL -- they'll throw you in the

                          PREP
                          (LAUGHS WILDLY)
           They'll be throwin `em out of the
           Stockade. They need every man they
           can get.
                         
          He picks up the sheet of paper with the "Re-enlistment Blues"
          written out on it, starts to fold it. Desperation is
          reflected on Alma's face; she turns to Gorgette, as if
          pleading for aid,
                         
                          GORGETTE
           Your side'll open up --
                         
                          ALMA
           And they'll find out it was you who
           killed that soldier!
                         
          Prew shakes his head, as if obsessed by only one thought.
                         
                          PREW
           Once I report in to the Compny I'll
           be all right. Once I get there. I
           gotta get back --
                         
                          ALMA
           But you'll never make it! There's
           MPs all over --
                         
                          PREW
           I'll make it. I'll go along the
           back roads. They'll let me in the
           West gate -- they'll know I'm a
                          SOLJER --
                         
          He puts the folded piece of paper in his pocket and starts
          for the door.
                         
                          ALMA
           Stay till morning!
                         
          Prew glances at Alma incredulously. She sobs suddenly,
          violently.
           153.
                         
                         
                         
                          ALMA
           Maybe if you stayed till morning
           you'd change your mind...
                         
          She throws her arms around him, clings to him.
                         
                          ALMA
           Don't go, Prew! I'll do whatever
           you want... We'll figure out a way
           to get to the States
           together... We can even get
           married... If you go I won't see
           you any more... I know it...
                         
          Prew holds her closely for a moment, then moves her away from
          him. He turns toward the door.
                         
                          ALMA
           (tears turning to
                          HYSTERIA)
           What do you want to go back to the
           Army for?! What did the Army ever
           do for you? Besides treat you like
           scum and give you one awful going
           over and get your friend killed?
           What do you want to go back to that
           for?
                         
          Prew frowns as if he's not sure he heard correctly.
                         
                          PREW
           What do I want to go back for? I'm

          EXT. HIGHWAY ADJOINING GOLF COURSE - NIGHT
                         
          MOVING SHOT JEEP WITH THREE MPs
          The night is inky black except for a little moonlight and the
           154.
                         
                         
          dimmed headlights of the jeep. CAMERA SHOOTS PAST driver onto
          the highway as the jeep moves slowly along. The two other MPs
          clutch Thompson guns, try to scan the dark countryside.
                         
                          FIRST MP
           They say they seen parachutists
           land up in the mountains.
                         
                          SECOND MP
           I ain't worried about them.
           Sabatoors is what worries me.
                         
                          DRIVER
           Yeah. Theys the creepy ones. Walkin
           around just like ordinary
           civilians. I betcha they operatin
           all over these islands.
                         
          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM SIDE OF HIGHWAY
          The headlights pass along the road as the jeep moves on out
          of sight. As its sound fades we hear Prew's heavy breathing,
          are barely able to distinguish his figure in the darkness. He
          is crouched, watching the car go down the highway. We hear
          his thoughts. The voice is labored and agonized.
                         
           PREW'S VOICE (O.S.)
           ... almost home... ony across the
           golf course... now... now... no...
           wait... gotta be care?... gotta
           sweat it out...
                         
          He groans, puts his hand to his side. In the feeble light
          from the moon we see blood on his shirt and hand. He looks up
          and down the road.
                         
           PREW'S VOICE (O.S.)
           ... it's clear now... gotta get
           home...
                         
          Still crouched, Prew starts across the road.
                         
          LONG SHOT OPPOSITE SIDE OF ROAD
          We see nothing but the strip of road, then Prew+s figure is
          visible, bent low, weaving a little. As he approaches the
          camera, he is taught square in the twin beams of dimmed
          headlights which flash on from the side of the road. Now we
          see that a jeep is parked near camera, heading in the
          opposite direction from the jeep which passed before. It is
          also manned by three MPs. There is a startled cry from Prew.
                         
                          MP'S VOICE
           Halt!

          Prew starts to run back across the road. A white spotlight
          flashes on, its harsh brilliant light following him. Prew
          slips to one knee.
                         
          CLOSE SHOT PREW
          looking toward the jeep, blinded by the blazing light. He has
          the appearance of a terrified animal. There is a wildness, a
          senselessness about him. The blotch of blood oozes and
          spreads over his shirt. He picks up a rock from the road.
                         
                         MEDIUM SHOT
          Prew rises, staggers away from the jeep.
                         
                          MP'S VOICE
           HALT!
                         
          Prew flings the rock desperately toward the lights. There is
          a crash of glass and one headlight winks off. Prew runs
          across the road and onto the golf course.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT JEEP
          The motor starts, The jeep moves out from its hiding place
          and starts across the golf course.
                         
          MOVING SHOT SHOOTING FROM JEEP
          Prew, in a skirmisher's zigzag, is trying to elude the
          spotlight. He is about twenty yards in front of the jeep. He
          heads for a high sandtrap. The spot is full on him as he
          reaches the lip of the trap. He turns, yells something back
          at the jeep. It is barely heard over the sound of the jeep.
                         
                          PREW
           -- I'm a soljer! --
                         
                          MP
           That guy ain't no soljer -- he dint

          MEDIUM SHOT PREW
          standing on the lip of the trap, the jeep bearing down on
          him. He turns, starts to dive into the trap. A blast of
          gunfire from the jeep hits him. He falls sideways into the
          trap, rolls over on his back, The jeep moves into the shot,
          crawls half-way over the trap, stops, its spotlight pouring
          down on Prew. His eyes are open, looking up to the sky.
                         
                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          CAMERA SHOOTS DOWN to Prew from top of trap. A portion of the
          jeep is in shot, but we are not able to see the MPs.

           Shut up.
                         
          The voices are lost as CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY DOWN toward Prew's
          open eyes. We hear his thoughts on the sound track, clear and
          fast at first and slow and almost inaudible as the CAMERA
          REACHES A FULL HEAD CLOSEUP.

           has... got to have some place...
                         
          Prew's eyes close. THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
                         
           FADE OUT.
                         
                         BLACK LEADER
          There is no sound as the screen remains black for several
          beats.
                         
                         FADE IN:
                         
          EXT. GOLF COURSE - NIGHT
                         
          TWO SHOT WARDEN AND A LIEUTENANT COLONEL
          They are looking down to camera, which SHOOTS UP as if from
          point of view of Prew's body in the sand trap. The dimmed
          headlights of two jeeps illuminates them. Warden is fighting
          to control his emotion, to remain the professional soldier.
          The Lieutenant Colonel is disturbed, but kindly.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           Where's your Company Commander?
                         
                          WARDEN
           He's at Headquarters, sir. I'm the
           First Sergeant.
           157.
                         
                         
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           Did you know this man personally?
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, sir.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
          They are standing on the lip of the sandtrap. The hoods of
          the jeeps that chased Prew and the second jeep are just
          behind them in shot.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           He didn't have any regular
           identification. But they found a
           card on him with his name --
           (holds card close to
                          HEADLIGHT)
           -- seems to be a membership in a
           club. The -- New Congress Club.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Yes, sir.
                         
          The Lieutenant Colonel hands the card to Warden.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           I'll turn this over to you. And
           these other things that were on
           him. This --
                         
          He unfolds a sheet of paper, holds it to the headlight. He
          and Warden squint at it.
                         
          INSERT: CRUMPLED SHEET OF PAPER WITH PENCILED WRITING:
          "Re-enlistment Blues" is written at the top. The stanzas of
          the song are beneath the heading.
                         
           LIEUTENANT COLONEL'S VOICE
           Seems to be acme sort of poem.
                         
                          WARDEN'S VOICE
           Yes, air.
                         
          Very softly, so distant that we can only distinguish a word
          or two now and then, we hear the voices of Clark, Anderson
          and Prew singing the "Re-enlistment Blues." The plaintive
          melody continues under the rest of the scene.
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND LIEUTENANT COLONEL
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           And this. Whatever it is.
           158.
                         
                         
                         
          He holds Prew' s bugle mouthpiece up to the light, gives it
          to Warden. Warden holds it in his hand, stares at it. Under
          the "Re-enlistment Blues," even softer, farther away, we now
          hear Prew's bugle blowing Taps. It continues, with the song,
          to the end of the scene.
                         
                          WARDEN
           It's the mouthpiece of a bugle.
                         
          The Lieutenant Colonel looks at Warden closely.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           Are you all right, Sergeant? Was
           this man a friend of yours?
                         
          Warden speaks very formally.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Sir, this man was a good soldier.
           He loved the Army moren any soljer
           I ever knew. I would like to make a
           formal request that this body be
           buried in the Army's permanent
           cemetery at Schofield Barracks.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           I believe I can attend to that for
           you.
                         
                          WARDEN
           Thank you, sir.
                         
                          LIEUTENANT COLONEL
           I'm sorry, Sergeant.
                         
          The Lieutenant Colonel walks off.
                         
          ANOTHER ANGLE WARDEN
          INCLUDING Prew's body in the shot as Warden looks down at it.
          He looks at it for several moments. The Taps is just coming
          to an end. Warden speaks very quietly.
                         
                          WARDEN
           No, sir. I hardly knew the guy...

          LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM DOCK TO SHIP LEAVING HARBOR
          Taps and the Re-enlistment Blues are swept away by the lush
          strains of Aloha Oe. The Hawaiian music continues through the
          scene.

           It's very beautiful, isn't it?
                         
          MEDIUM SHOT KAREN
          She turns and CAMERA PANS to INCLUDE Alma in shot, standing
          beside Karen. She is dressed in black, quite severely.
                         
                          KAREN
                          (SOCIABLY)
           I think It's the most beautiful
           place I ever saw in my lire.
                         
                          ALMA
           No one would know there was a war,
           from out here.
                         
          Karen takes off her leis, begins tossing them over the rail.
                         
                          KAREN
           There's a legend. If they float in
           toward shore, you'll come back some
           day. If they float out to sea, you
           won't.
                         
                          ALMA
           I won't come back. I had to get
           away from here. You see, my fiance
           was killed on December seventh.
                         
                          KAREN
           Oh, I am sorry.
                         
                          ALMA
           (quickly, as if rehearsed)
           He was a bomber pilot. He tried to
           taxi his plane off the apron and
           the Japs made a direct hit on it.
           Maybe you read about it in the
           papers. They awarded him a Silver
           Star. They sent it to his mother.
           She wrote me she wanted me to have
           it.

           (tossing the last of leis
                          OVER)
           That's very fine of her.
                         
                          ALMA
           They're very fine people. Southern
           people. He was named after a
           General. Robert E. Lee -- Prewitt.
                         
          Karen looks at Alma numbly. Alma is looking out across the
          water.
                         
                          KAREN
           Who?
                         
                          ALMA
           Robert E. Lee Prewitt.
           (on verge of tears)
           Isn't that a silly old name?
                         
          LONG SHOT LEIS IN WATER
          They are floating on the water behind the ship. They are

          EXT. KIGALI AIRPORT. DAY
          
          A burning white sun high in a clear blue sky,
          
                                                                     PAN DOWN TO:
          
          A rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat.
          
          A mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint
          where a RWANDAN POLICEMAN blows his whistle, waves some and stops
          others as bored Rwandan soldiers look on.
          
          CLOSE ON: A white van pulls out of traffic, a balls-out case of line
          jumping. HORNS, OBSCENITIES.
          
          A HAND: Extends from the passenger side of the van, Rwandan francs
          pressed neatly between thumb and palm.
          
          The van stops next to the policeman.
          
                                     POLICEMAN
          Mr. Rusesabagina, good morning.
          
          In the passenger seat PAUL RUSESABAGINA, late 30's, flashes a smile. He
          is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie,
          it is a matter of pride).
          
          A quick shake of hands. Money passes from one to the other.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI AIRPORT TARMAC. DAY
          
          The van parked by the runway tarmac. African music plays on the radio.
          Paul drums his fingers, checks his watch.
          
          ZOZO, porter/driver, early thirties, sits nervously.
          
          An airport baggage handler approaches the van.
          
                                     HANDLER
                         Sir, the flight is delayed one more hour.

                      What's wrong?
          
                                  ZOZO                                               
                      Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You
                      are safe there.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.                            
          Zozo throws the van into gear and speeds off.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY
          
          The white van, marked "THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES," whips its way through
          Kigali's packed streets and open-air markets.

          Zozo works THE HORN, weaves in and out of traffic.

                      What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
          
                                  PAUL
                      It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach
                      it is like the bus to Giterama.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      That is why they call it coach?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Maybe. But in business class there are
                      fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
          
                                  ZOZO

                      You have taken business class?

                      Many times.
          
          Suddenly, Zozo slows.
          
          Paul looks up, SEES: a gathering on the side of the road -- a large
          crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts.
          They're members of the INTERAHAMWE - the Hutu Militia.
          
          
          
                                                                             3.
          (Interahamwe - the Hutu Militia will de distinguished by these wildly
          colored shirts) They chant, drink beer, dance onto the road,
          obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. Several of them perform a
          rhythmic dance - the INTERAHAMWE war dance to thumping drumbeat music
          from a boombox.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Turn off.
          
          Zozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      There is nowhere to turn, sir.                                
          As the van approaches,
          
                                   PAUL
                      Slow down.
          
          The van pulls up beside the Militia.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Boys, do you know the way to Mr.                              
                      Rutagunda's warehouse?
          
          Some Militia approach. They are suddenly friendly, helpful.
          
                                  MILITIA MAN #1
                      It is one more mile on this road.
          
          Paul reaches into his pocket, takes out some Rwandan dollars.
          
                                  PAUL
                      This is thirsty work, let me treat you to
                      some beers.
          
          As the van pulls away Zozo looks to Paul, relieved.
          
          
          INT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY
          
          At his desk in front of a fan. GEORGE RUTAGUNDA, late 30's, huge, gold
          chains, Rolex watch, (like an African Mafia boss) but the same
          Interahamwe shirt. He squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso.
          
          Behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded
          with cases of beer.
          
          George holds out his massive shirt.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      You will join us at the rally today?
          
          Paul sits opposite, sipping coffee.
          
                                                                            4.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will try my best George but these days
                      I have no time for rallies or politics.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      Politics is power, Paul. And money.
          
          Paul studies his watch.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Time is money, George. We need extra beer
                      today.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      Business is good at the hotel?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Very good.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      I am always glad to see you Paul.
          
          George leads Paul out into the warehouse.                                 
          As a forklift lifts A WOODEN CRATE, George angers.
          
                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      Hell man, that is not beer, put it back!
          
                                  DRIVER
                      But, sir, the Carlsberg is behind...                          
                                  GEORGE
                      Forget the Carlsberg, give him Grolsch.
                           (to Paul)                                                
                      I won't charge extra.                                         
                                    PAUL
                      Thank you.
          
          The driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the
          crate but it slides off and CRASHES onto the floor: MACHETES, hundreds
          of them, spill out.
          
          An awkward moment then George picks one of the crude blades.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents
                      each, I'll get a dollar.
          
                                    PAUL
                      At least.
          
          Off Zozo terrified.
          
                                                                              5.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI AIRPORT TARMAC. DAY
          
          A Sabena airliner lands. Passengers disembark via a roll-up staircase.
          
          Paul's van pulls up by the luggage belt.
          
          A large polystyrene box comes down the conveyor belt. It has Brussels -
          Kigali destination stickers all over it.
          
          As Zozo picks it up, water sloshes from the lid.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The ice has melted!
          
          Zozo goes to open it.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Don't. Let's go.
          
          Paul slips money to two customs officials.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY
          
          The van speeds through traffic. More traffic jams, Zozo edges up on the
          sidewalk. Then at an intersection they see.
          
          THE INTERAHAMWE PARADE - a mass of young men and women, most in the
          same colorful uniform. Line after line, waves all performing the
          INTERAHAMWE war dance, in wild hypnotic sync, many wave sticks, spears,
          wooden imitation guns. A large banner reads, "Hutu Power."
          
          A flatbed truck, speakers blare drumbeat music. On it GEORGE RUTAGUNDA
          dances the DANCE and waves a machete to the crowd.
          
          Zozo sinks down behind the wheel.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract
                      attention to yourself.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Boss, some of those men are my neighbors,
                      they know I'm Tutsi.
          
          The parade passes. As they wait Paul takes out the wad of notes George
          gave him, peels off a few dollars.
                                  P
          
                                  PAUL
                      Here, Zozo, for your trouble.
          
          Zozo takes it.
          
                                                                               6.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE. DAY
          
          The van turns off the street into The Milles Collines Hotel driveway
          and HONKS twice as it pulls down a short drive lined with tall shrubs.
          An ARMED GUARD rushes from his booth and lifts the gate. Perfectly
          timed. The van doesn't even have to slow as it passes. A sign on the
          guard house reads "WELCOME TO THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES".
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Lush tropical gardens, peacocks wander the well-manicured lawns,an
          exotic African paradise. The van heads to a magnificent colonial
          building.
          
                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                      Pull up at the front door.
          
          A valet opens the front door of the hotel and looks shocked. It's
          unheard of for a service van to stop out front.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (urgent, to the valet)
                      Help Zozo.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul leads Zozo and the valet into a magnificent lobby, a tasteful
          blend of Africa and Europe. Guests stare as water sloshes and spills
          from the crate.
          
          GREGOIRE, early thirties the receptionist behind the desk throws a look
          of disapproval. Paul, imperial, snaps his finger toward him.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (re: spilled water)                                       
                      Gregoire. Take care of this.
          
          Gregoire engages a guest in chit-chat, ignores Paul.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Gregoire!   See to this right away.
          
          The elevator door opens and reveals BIK the Belgian hotel manager, mid-
          40's, reading some reports. He looks up, sees Paul and Zozo carrying
          the box as they step in. Bik looks puzzled.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It's an emergency, sir.                                        
          Now Bik sees the wet floor.
          
          
          
                                                                              7.
          
                                    BIK
                      Paul!
          
                                  PAUL
                      Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
          
          The elevator doors shut. Bik's left standing in disbelief.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL KITCHEN. DAY
          
          The crate is hefted onto a counter. The top pried off. A crowd of
          cooks gathers around Paul and Zozo as they peer in.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Any of them make it?
          
                                  HEAD CHEF
                      Into the sink!
          
          They hoist up one end of the crate and LOBSTERS spill out. Many make
          it into the sink, but some miss and slide across the counter and fall
          onto the floor.
          
          The cooks sort the living from the dead.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Twelve are dead.
          
                                    PAUL
                      How dead?
          
          The cooks smells a dead lobster, shakes his head no.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Dump the bad meat, save the shells, fill
                      them will ah, a stuffing, something
                      local.
          
                                  COOK
                      Cassava, and Tipali.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes. Call it 'fresh Scottish Lobster in a
                      cassava and Tipali crush'.
          
          Paul fixes his tie, very pleased, another crisis solved.
          
          
          INT. BANQUET ROOM/HOTEL MILLE COLLINES. DAY
          
          Paul inspects the tables' fresh flowers, sparkling crystal glasses. He
          looks to the bar - Grolsch on ice.
          
                   
          
          
                                                                            8.
          
          The sound of African drums fills the air.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul emerges, as a troupe of African male dancers in ceremonial costume
          - Leopard skin dress, ostrich feather head dress, spears and shields
          perform a greeting dance for a the American Ambassador and a crowd of
          European dignitaries.
          
          The male dancers are joined by a troupe of young female dancers in
          similar ceremonial dress. The ceremony comes to a foot stomping finale.
          The guests break into LOUD APPLAUSE. Paul flings open double doors to a
          reception room and the crowd moves in.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Mr. Ambassador, please come in.    
                                      
                                  US AMBASSADOR
                      Thank you, Paul.    
                                                     
          A UN Colonel, OLIVER, middle aged, Canadian,follows the US Ambassador.     
          The Colonel wear the blue berets and armbands of UN Peacekeepers. (all     
          UN troops will be distinguished by their bright blue berets, white
          helmets and arm bands)
          
                                  PAUL
                      Colonel Oliver, you are very welcome.                          
          The Ambassador shakes the Colonel's hand.
                                            
                                  US AMBASSADOR

                      Please, serve the hors d'ouvres now.
          
          A waiter whispers to him.

          A luxurious lounge/club called the Kigali Club - an African
          Casablanca, complete with animal heads, a statue of a mountain gorilla,
          grand piano in the corner. Rwandan Hutu army officers, (distinguished
          by their crisp khaki uniforms, in the style of the French army), arms
          dealers, government dignitaries, businessmen and reporters mingle
          freely. The few tourists stand out.
          
          PAUL heads to a table. The center of attention and conversation is
          General BIZIMUNGU, 40's, dressed in a crisp, heavily decorated
          uniform, a strong figure, relaxed, in control. 
                                      
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
          
                                  PAUL
                      It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I
                      thought you'd like it. Anything you need,
                      gentlemen, let me know.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
          
          Paul heads for the lobby. He's intercepted by an zealous young Tutsi
          reporter BENEDICT who covers the political scene for the local
          independent newspaper.
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      Paul, Paul, a moment please.   
                                          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, Benedict, what can I do?  
                                          
                                  BENEDICT
                      Can you get me into the Ambassador's
                      reception?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm sorry, it's a private function.
          
          Benedict takes out his reporters notebook.
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      At least tell me who is attending. The
                      newspaper will be grateful.
          
          Paul laughs.

                                  PAUL
                      I will be grateful if you keep my name
                      out of your newspaper. Wait here and you
                      will see who has attended as they leave.

          Paul fixes a floral arrangement as he passes then arrives at the clock
          room hatch.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to the coat check)
                      Did General Bizimungu bring a briefcase?

                      Take it to the bar storeroom. Put three
                      bottles of Glenmorangie...

          Paul moves off as the coat check scurries away.
          
                                   ONNIE DENVER (O.S.)
                      Oh, Paul, Paul
          
          An American woman, CONNIE DENVER, rich, blonde, surgically enhanced,

          INT. HOTEL TOURISM OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul walks into the tourism office. It is decorated with posters and
          photos of Rwanda's single most important economic asset - the rare
          silver back mountain Gorillas. There's a picture of the real-life Diane
          Fossey next to the movie poster for "Gorillas in the Mist". Numerous
          books and video cassettes. CONNIE DENVER's older husband, BOB, and four
          American friends wait.
          
                                  CONNIE DENVER
                      Paul, Paul. Our trip has been cancelled.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, I'm sorry Madame Denver, it is
                      because of the rebels.
          
                                  CONNIE DENVER
                      Rebels? What rebels?

                                  BOB
                      Don't be stupid for Christ sake. The
                      Watusis are invading the country. I told
                      you not to come here.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Tutsi rebels are far away on the
                      border. And soon there will be peace.
          
                                  BOB
                      Tutsis, Watutsis they'll still shoot you.
          
                                  CONNIE DENVER
                      But I came here to see the gorillas?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will try to arrange something.

                      Things will calm down when the president

                      Our intelligence, Mr. Ambassador, is that                  
                      the Hutu government has been stockpiling
                      weapons and are preparing a massacre.
          
                                   US AMBASSADOR
                      That's not what I hear. Excuse me. Paul.
                            Paul comes over)

                      General what a genius this man is. You
                      want anything, this man can get it?
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                 
                      How about a battalion of U.S. Marines.

                         Now, General, don't ask for the
                         impossible.
          
          Paul smiles.
          
                                     PAUL
                         I have heard, Mr. Ambassador, that they
                         have discovered oil here, under Lake                        
                         Kivu.
          
          Oliver bursts out laughing. 
                                                         
                                     COLONEL OLIVER                                  
                         You're right, Mr. Ambassador, Paul knows
                         how to get anything, even U.S. troops. 
                               
          The ambassador takes Paul's hand, shakes it warmly.
          
                                     US AMBASSADOR
                         Thank you for a wonderful meal, Paul.
          
          Paul moves away graciously, and in one smooth move checks out, then
          pockets, the hundred dollar bill the ambassador palmed him.

          Paul notices the General.
          
          The General raises his briefcase and waves.
          
          Paul waves back. Another favor rendered.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS. NIGHT
          
          It is night now. Floodlights bathe the hotel in a warm glow. Tiki oil
          lamps illuminate the walkways and spread scented citronella smoke among
          the trees. Wild birds CALL OUT.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL REAR CAR PARK. NIGHT
          
          Paul walks to the employee car park at the rear.
          
          He sees Gregoire and another male reception clerk tossing Zozo's
          pillbox porter's hat between them with Zozo trapped in the middle
          trying to jump and catch it. Gregoire thinks this tease is great fun.
          
                         
          
          
                                                                              13.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      Come on, Zozo, cockroaches can jump, some                      
                      of them can fly.
          
           he clerk sees Paul just as he's about to throw, miscalculates, the hat
          sails over Gregoire's head and lands at Paul's feet. Zozo scampers to
          pick it up.
          
                                    PAUL
                      No.
                            (points to Gregoire)                                      
                      You pick it up.
          
          Gregoire doesn't move.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      How are your dish-washing skills,                              
                      Gregoire?
          
          Gregoire bends, picks up the hat, hands it to Zozo, who walks away
          quickly. Gregoire and his friend turn to head back into the hotel.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in
                      this hotel, do you understand?

                      Cockroaches?
          
          Bik has walked out of the rear door and overheard.
          
                                  BIK (CONT'D)
                      Don't tell me we have cockroaches, Paul?                       
          A sly smile breaks on Gregoire's face as he uses Bik's arrival to
          disappear inside.
          
                                  PAUL
                      No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.

                      say they would be here on the sixth for
                      the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the
                      banquet room for that day, a reception to
                      broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you
                      organize monitors and check the satellite
                      dish?
          
                                                                               14.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Leave it to me.
          
          Bik leans slightly closer.
          
                                  BIK
                      Also, could you remember to use the
                      service entrance at all times?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Of course.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. NIGHT
          
          Paul hops in his car and tosses a box of Belgium chocolates on the seat
          next to him.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREETS. NIGHT
          
          Paul speeds through the streets of Kigali HUMMING along to music on the
          radio and eating chocolates from the box. He passes bicycles laden
          with produce. The song on the radio ends and local news comes on.
          
                                  RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                      Good Hutus of Rwanda, beware. The
                      dictatorship of the Tutsi cockroach is
                      near. Watch your neighbor. Identify these
                      cockroaches. Then rise up and stamp out
                      this murderous infestation...
          
          Paul turns the station.    Finds another with music.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT
          
          Lights burn in windows. Kids play soccer in dusty lots. Paul's van
          turns onto a residential street and slows. He HONKS twice. The metal
          gate to a walled compound swings open. A GUARD(old, peaked hat, bare
          feet, pathetic) stands just inside. Paul waves to him and pullsinto
          the courtyard, two cars are already parked there.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          A neat bungalow and gardens behind the high wall. Paul parks and gets
          out. A DOG runs and greets him, BARKING.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Down, Pealiss.

          His wife, TATIANA, a woman of great natural beauty, emerges from the
          house, beside her an even taller, very elegant woman, she has a
          doctor's bag and a stethoscope in her hand. This is ODETTE, their
          family doctor and close friend.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Good evening, Odette, who is sick this                      
                      time?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I asked Odette to take a look at little
                      Anais. She has a rash.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Your brother's here?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Yes, with Fedens and the children.
                       e wants some advice.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Good to see you, Paul.     
                                           
          Paul embraces Odette warmly, kisses Tatiana.
          
                                  ODETTE (CONT'D)
                      I must go, Paul.            
                                          
                                  TATIANA
                      You will not stay for dinner.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      No thank you, Tatiana.   
                                             
                                  PAUL
                      My best to Jean Baptiste.
          
          
          EXT: PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          The old guard opens the gate, Odette drives off.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
                                  PAUL
                           (a sigh)
                      Thomas wants advice?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      He wants your wisdom.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let's have dinner first.
          
                                   
          
          
                                                                              16.
          
                                      TATIANA
                        Of course.
          
          His brother-in-law THOMAS and sister-in-law FEDENS come out to greet
          Paul the Patriarch. They hug. Kids run everywhere. Paul spots his twin
          nieces Anais (in blue) and Carine (in yellow), four years old. He
          scoops them up, one in each arm.
          
                                      PAUL
                        Hello, Anais.                                                 
          She laughs.
          
                                      CARINE
                        I am Carine.
          
                                    PAUL
                        You are not Anais?  
                                                    
                                      ANAIS
                        I am Anais.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Oh, Carine, that is a shame. I have a                         
                        present for Anais.
          
          Anais reaches out her hand. Paul sets them on the ground, takes a
          chocolate from his chocolate box, deliberately hands it to Carine.
          Anais jumps up and down.
          
                                    ANAIS
                        It is for me.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Goodness, I cannot tell. I guess I must
                        find another present.
          
          He takes a chocolate gives it to Carine, then hands out the   chocolates
          to his children who are gathered around.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. DAY
          
          A crowded family table. Tatiana, Paul's four children, Thomas and
          Fedens, and the twins Anais and Carine.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Roger, your turn.
          
          Paul's eldest, ROGER, 12, bows his head.
          
                                    ROGER
                        For food and clothes, and all that grows,
                        etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           17.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Thank you, Roger.
          
          Food is passed around. Roger gobbles his down.
          
                                     PAUL (CONT'D)
                         Why the hurry, Roger?
          
                                     ROGER
                         Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
          
                                     PAUL
                         No, I don't want you going on the street.
          
                                      OGER
                         Please, papa, I have a secret path.  
                                 
                                     PAUL
                         Who is this Simon?
          
                                     TATIANA
                         Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
          
                                      PAUL
                         Homework?
          
                                      ROGER
                         It's done.
          
                                     TATIANA
                         And he did extra chores.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Wash your things, and be back soon. 
                                  
          Roger takes off at a run.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
          Roger runs to a wooden fence, gets down, moves two boards and squeezes
          through into a path, almost a tunnel in dense reeds.
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S (SIMON'S) YARD. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls along his path. There's a gap a little way down, and Roger
          shoots through it into the wide open of the neighbors yard. He runs to
          a back window of the house and taps on it. Soon SIMON, 12, appears. He
          slides it open.
          
                                     ROGER
                         Let's feed it.
          
          
          
                                                                           18.
          
          Simon lets Roger in.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S (SIMON'S) HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          Roger holds a WILDLY COLORED SNAKE in a jar. Simon has a bag of bugs.
          Waves the bag in front of the snake. It's forked tongue goes wild.
          
                                  ROGER
                      Let me.
          
          Simon hands him the bugs. Roger lifts the lid, drops one bug in, and
          the snake strikes. The boys jump back, laugh.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          After dinner coffee for the adults. Tatiana, Thomas and Fedens at the
          table. Paul, in his usual position, at the head, listening, like
          Solomon.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      I've heard bad things, Paul. My assistant
                      says we should get out of Rwanda.
          
                                  FEDENS
                      Why should we leave? I have a new job,
                      things have never been better for us.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      What good is it if we are murdered in our
                      bed?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Your assistant, he is Hutu?
          
                                  THOMAS
                      Yes, and he is in the Hutu Power Militia.
          
                                  CARINE
                      He wants your job.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      No, he is a friend, but he tells me to
                      listen to the radio. All day they talk
                      about the great slaughter.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      That station is filth.
          
          PAUL has listened, now he decides to speak.
          
          
          
                                                                             19.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Today I talked to my friend the American
                      Ambassador and Colonel Oliver of the                           
                      United Nations. They are preparing a
                      banquet for the peace signing. The BBC
                      are flying in their best reporters. The
                      world is watching. There will be peace.
                      Don't listen to this man.
          
          Solomon has spoken. Fedens smiles, Tatiana rubs Paul's arm.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S (SIMON'S) YARD. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls along his grass tunnel. Then he hears something. He looks
          through the reeds toward the street.
          
          HE SEES: Military boots, a cluster of Hutu soldiers in their crisp
          Khaki uniforms.
          
          He hears whispering.
          
                                     OLDIER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                      That house.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          Paul, Tatiana, are by Thomas's car. They say good night to their
          guests. Anais and Carine sleep in the car.
          
          Paul nods to the old guard to go open the gate. Just then Roger emerges
          from the thicket, wide-eyed, afraid.
          
                                  ROGER
                      There are soldiers.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Where?
          
                                  ROGER
                      On the street.
          
          Paul nods to Tatiana to take Roger inside. Thomas and Fedens grab the
          sleeping twins from their car.
          
          Paul goes to his big metal gates and peers through the two inch gap
          E
          between the gate hinge and the gate post.
          
          
          EXT. VICTOR'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
          
          HE SEES: (two houses down) the group of Hutu soldiers, clustered around
          jeeps, they whisper and point. It's a raid.
          
                                   
          
          
                                                                           20.
          
          Now they move rushing out of view.
          
          The sounds of SPLINTERING WOOD, GLASS BREAKING, CHILDREN'S CRIES, WOMEN
          SCREAMING.
          
          Suddenly there's a face, beside Paul's. It's Tatiana.
          
                                    TATIANA
                      What is it?
          
          She looks, sees the soldiers, as they drag a middle-aged man onto the
          street.
          
          He is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Oh, my God, it's Victor. Why do they want                      
                      Victor?
          
          They watch as Victor is beaten to the jeep. At this point Victor looses
          it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging,
          screaming like a terrified child - like a man who knows he is going to
          die. It's a horror.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Do something.
          
                                    PAUL
                      What?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Call your friends in the army. Call
                      someone. Victor is harmless. This is a
                      mistake.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Please, be quiet.
          
          Tatiana, moves toward the gate handle.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I'm going to talk to them.
          
          Paul grabs her.
          
                                    PAUL
                      No.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      We must do something.
          
          Paul takes her by the arm, leads her to the house.
          
                                                                         21.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What would you have us do? Argue with                     
                      these madmen? We cannot interfere.                        
          
          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Thomas and Fedens wait, anxious, as Paul appears.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You better stay the night, it is too
                      dangerous to be on the streets.
          
          Tatiana hides her anger.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I'll fix a bed.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul lies in bed unable to sleep.   The clock reads 3:00 am.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Why didn't you call your contacts in the
                      army?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I couldn't help.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      You could have asked for a favor.
          
                                  PAUL
                      No, I could not. What do you know about
                      favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
                      All day long I work to please this
                      officer, that diplomat, this tourist. To
                      store up favors so that if there is a
                      time when my family need help I have
                      powerful people I can call upon. Now you
                      would have me waste a precious favor on a
                      stranger.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Victor was not a stranger, he was our
                      neighbor.
          
                                  PAUL
                      He was not family. Family is all that
                      matters. Do you think if you or I were
                      being dragged from here, any one of them
                      would lift a finger to help us?
          
          
          
                                                                            22.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      They do not have your connections.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Connections? I have no connections, only
                      favors. If I call to help Victor, a
                      General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is
                      a fool. He thinks my favors are so
                      numerous and so insignificant as to waste
                      them on everybody." Then my hard work is
                      doubly squandered. I insult the General
                      and I do not get to use my favor at all.
                      Please leave these things to my good
                      judgment.
          
          His turn away indicates the discussion is over.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. MORNING
          
          Paul's car rolls up to the hotel's guard house.
          
          SUPER THE TITLE: APRIL 6th, 1994.
          
          An army jeep is parked just inside. General Bizimungu is in the
          passenger seat, talking into a walkie-talkie.
          
          The General gives an I'll see you soon wave.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          The hotel entrance is a mini-jam of airport buses, white UN jeeps,
          foreign news crew Land Rovers, and a TV repair van unloading monitors.
          Paul marches in, past Zozo the bell hop, who helps the TV men unload.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Welcome, gentlemen.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          The lobby buzzes with activity. At the reception, Gregoire is
          surrounded by a BBC news crew: GLORIA, young, chic female
          reporter/producer, and JOCK, tough, experienced Scottish cameraman, and
          his local sound guy Peter. Gloria is upset.
          
                                  GLORIA
                      We reserved five rooms not two
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      I'm sorry, ma'am, but I see only two here
                      in the computer.
          
                        
          
          
                                                                            23.
          
          Jock sees Paul.
          
                                  JOCK
                      Paul, how the hell are ya'?    
                                        
                                  PAUL
                      I am delighted to see you, Mr. Daglish.
          
                                  JOCK
                      They moved you from the Diplomat?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Promoted. House Manager.
          
                                  JOCK
                      Good for you.
          
                            (moves closer)                                          
                      We're having a little trouble, Paul. We
                      booked five rooms, but...
          
          Paul moves behind the desk.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let me check.
          
          He punches into the computer.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Ah, I see the mistake. You were reading
                      CBC - the Canadian broadcasting people
                      instead of BBC Gregoire.
          
          Close on the computer: It clearly states BBC - two rooms.   Gregoire
          looks to Paul with a mix of puzzlement and anger.
          
          
                      Of course, the BBC, five rooms.
                            (lies)                                                  
                      They are being prepared as we speak. I
                      have ordered fresh flowers and
                      complimentary champagne.
          
          Gloria picks up her bag.
          
                                  GLORIA
                      Great, I really need a shower.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Just give me a moment to get your keys.
          
          Paul better come up with three rooms fast. Then he spots the reporter
          Benedict hovering at the door.
          
          
          
                                                                           24.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (to Gloria)
                      Excuse me for one second.
          
          Paul hurries over to Benedict.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Benedict, you should meet the BBC people.                     
                      They could use your expertise.                                
          
          Benedict is delighted. They head back across the lobby.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                            (whisper)                                                
                      Benedict, General Bizimungu will be here
                      any moment. The BBC should talk to him.
          
          They join the BBC team.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Madame, this is Benedict Nangori, one of
                      our best journalists. He covers all the
                      big stories. I thought you should meet.
          
          Gloria, a consummate news producer, turns on the charm.
          
                                  GLORIA
                      Benedict, beautiful name. I'm Gloria
                      Fleming. BBC.
          
          Paul moves off to the desk, Gregoire can barely disguise his pleasure.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      There are no more rooms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Give me the phone.
          
          Gregoire hands it over. Paul dials.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Madame Denver. I have very good news. I
                      have a present for you, in return for the
                      cancellation of your gorilla expedition I
                      have arranged a safari at Lake Kivu
                      lodge. A wonderful experience. No, no
                      extra charge. A luxury coach will leave
                      in one hour. I'll send maids up to help
                      you all pack. You're welcome.
          
          Paul hangs up, turns to Gregoire.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           25.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Call Kivu Lodge, ask for George, tell him
                      I need three rooms. And send a team of
                      maids up to the Americans. I want those
                      rooms turned around in twenty minutes.

          General Bizimungu, briefcase in hand, gives the tv interview, He's

                      There are rumors, General, that your
                      army, the Hutu army, consider these peace
                      accords a sellout to the Tutsi rebels.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                           (laughs)                                                  
                      Nonsense. At this moment we are making
                      plans to rehabilitate the dissidents into
                      our armed forces.

                      Then the army fully supports the
                      president as he signs the peace
                      agreement.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Of course, the president is a clever man,
                      he knows what he is doing. Thank you for
                      coming to Rwanda. (on the move). You will
                      see what a beautiful country this is.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul turns, walks past porters ferrying the BBC luggage. He puts his
          hand out. Gregoire hands him keys.
          
          Paul does his rounds. He double checks the banquet room where
          technicians install several TV monitors and test the signal.
          
          He looks in the kitchen, frenzied activity.
          
          He wanders behind the bar. Everything is 'under control'.
          
          He returns to the lobby, greets Connie, her flustered husband and their
          friends, followed by a team of porters and luggage.

                                  PAUL
                      Forgive the hurry but I do not want you
                      to miss the lunch buffet on the paddle
                      steamer across the lake. It is the most
                      spectacular sight in all Africa.

                      was famine in Africa. 
                                                   
                                  PAUL
                      Exactly, we can't have our guests                              
                      starving. What would they think of the                         
                      Mille Collines back in the United States?      
                          
          Gen. Bizimungu, takes Paul's arm, pulls him aside, hands him his empty
          briefcase.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Keep that cockroach Benedict away from
                      me.
          
          As the General disappears into the bar, Paul waves over the coat check,
          hands her the briefcase.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Same as last time.
          
          She nods, hurries off just as the BBC crew appears. Paul hands out
          keys, greets each.

          Jock, the Scottish cameraman, hangs behind as the others leave, takes

          INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY
          
          Reporters watch rows of TVs. All broadcast the signing of the Arusha
          Accords. (Reporters have political chatter.)
          
          CLOSE ON: the TVs as President Habyarimana signs.

                      As president Habyarimana signs a peace
                      accord between the Tutsi rebels and his
                      Hutu army there remains strong doubts
                      that the extremist Hutu Power will abide
                      by the accords. But for now hope has
                      returned to Rwanda for the first time in
                      many years.
          
          All the African reporters in the room CHEER.
          
          Fireworks go off outside the hotel.
          
          Colonel Oliver raises a glass of champagne and leads the room in a        
          toast.

          stage. Then, African drummers hammer out a fast uplifting beat as the
          full troupe of ceremonial dancers skip into the room in celebration.

                      Paul, join us.
          
          It's General Bizimungu, he is sitting with George Rutagunda now in a
          shiny blue suit. A bottle of whiskey on the table is almost gone.          
          Bizimungu and Rutagunda watch the peace celebration across the lobby.   
             
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Have a drink.
          
          He pours. George points his glass toward the Europeans.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      Look at them, they want to see the tribes
                      dance to their tune. Here is our dance.
          
          Rutagunda staggers to his feet, launches into a drunken version of the
          Hutu Militia War Dance.
          
                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      Come on, Paul. Show them our dance.
          
          Paul takes George's arm, does two steps of the dance, then   appears to
          stumble and shoulder bumps the big man.
          
          George falls into his chair.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Forgive me, George, my step was off.
          
          Rutagunda bursts out laughing, toasts:
          
                                  GEORGE
                      To our president. May he find peace.
          
          As Paul is forced to join in the toast, Rutagunda laughs, Bizimungu        
          smiles at some insider joke.                                               
          
          INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM. EVENING
          
          Reporters and crews pack up their equipment. Paul shakes hands, orders
          porters to pick up cases. Then a porter whispers a message to Paul.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Excuse me, gentlemen.

          Paul emerges, discovers Fedens and Thomas - they look embarrassed to be
          in such exulted surroundings.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      Forgive us, Paul. We must talk.

          Drinks are served at a table as Paul listens to Thomas.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      My assistant, the Hutu Power man, says we                      
                      should get out now, that soon it will be
                      very bad.
          
          Paul stifles his anger.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Give me this man's name.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      His name is Naramaranga, but please,                           
                      Paul, even though he is Hutu Power, he is                      
                      a friend, he likes me. He told me there
                      is a signal. It is "Cut the tall trees."                       
                      When they hear the signal, the militia                         
                      are to go to war.

                      are Hutu, you will be safe.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Thomas, Fedens, I am a man who looks
                      after his family. If there were danger I
                      would be the first to leave?
          
          BANG - a distant explosion, a flash of light on the far side of the
          city. Fedens jumps.

                                   FEDENS
                       What was that?

                       celebrate the peace.

                       Please, Paul, tomorrow I will bring you
                       my car. You will sell it for me and get a
                       fair price. We will go to Tanzania until
                       there is real peace.

          Zozo hands Paul a cordless phone.

                       Already the press are packing their bags.
                       The BBC man told me there's no story
                       here. We are boring now. I'll be home
                       soon.
          
          He hangs up.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                       Let us all go home and sleep.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. EVENING
          
          Paul escorts Fedens and Thomas to their car.
          
                                   PAUL
                       Call when you get home.   And don't worry,
                       Thomas. Good night.
          
          
          INT.   PAUL'S CAR. NIGHT
          
          Paul's at the wheel, driving. A thick mist. Barely a car on the road.
          Shadows dart past faint house lights. The windscreen clouds. Paul
          switches on his wipers. A Toyota truck, loaded with Militia, appears
          from the mist, speeds past. Paul switches the preset buttons on the
          radio as he drives. He can only find fevered drum-based MUSIC.
          
          
          
                                                                             31.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S STREET. NIGHT
          
          Paul turns onto his street. The houses are dark: windows shuttered;
          gates closed; not a soul about. Paul stops before his gate. HONKS
          twice. The gate doesn't open. He hops out and opens it with a key.
          Gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car. He hears the
          far off sound of gunfire. Distant explosions light the night sky.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          Paul drives in. His compound is curiously dark.     His headlights sweep
          across his pitch-black house.
          
                                                                         UT TO:
          
          The gates swing shut. We PULL BACK as Paul turns and faces his house.
          Paul whistles for the dog, nothing. He goes back to the car, gets a
          flashlight, heads for the front door.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          The door slowly opens. Paul steps in quietly, tries the light switch,
          nothing. He listens. The only sounds are distant explosions and
          gunfire. The beam of his flashlight cuts the blackness, illuminating:
          magazines arranged on a coffee table; an empty chair; children's toys
          in a basket.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Paul continues his search. Scans the counter. There's food on the
          stove. The table is set. He hears a GROWL, quickly cut short, from one
          of the bedrooms.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S HALL. NIGHT
          
          Paul shines the light into a room. Looks for a second, then closes the
          door, and walks to the next. He stops and listens with his ear to the
          door. Nothing. He pushes it in.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul's light sweeps across the room and illuminates:
          
          Eyes - terrified eyes, a room full of faces, staring back.
          
          THEIR POV: A dark figure behind a blinding light.
          
          The dog breaks free, runs to Paul.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           32.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Pealiss!
          
          From among the faces, Tatiana's voice heavy with relief.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Paul!
          
          Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded
          into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband
          Jean Baptiste.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Jean Baptiste!
          
                                  JEAN BAPTISTE
                      Our house has been burned.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is going on?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      The president has been murdered.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Murdered! By whom?
          
                                  ODETTE
                      The radio says Tutsi rebels.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill the
                      president when he agreed to peace?
          
          Tatiana pulls Paul aside.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Where are Thomas and Fedens?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I sent them home. Go and call them.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I tried already. The phones do not work.
          
          Jean Baptiste turns on his tiny radio.
          
                                  RADIO ANNOUNCER
                      Our great president is murdered, by the
                      Tutsi cockroaches. They tricked him, then
                      they killed him. We must cleanse this
                      country, Good Hutus of Rwanda. We must
                      clear the brush. Clear the brush of all
                      cockroaches. Clear the brush!!!
          
          
          
          
                                                                           33.
          
          The words are cut short as a grenade blast rattles the window. Everyone
          jumps, children whimper. Paul is shocked but tries to pull things
          together.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Come on, everyone out of this room, find
                      a seat in the living room.
          
          He holds the door open, they file out, frightened. Tatiana is last, he
          stops her, steps back in, closes the door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (in hushed anger)                                         
                      Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      They came through the bushes, over the
                      wall. What could I do?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Send them home. We are not the police.
                      What do we have to protect them?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The
                      militia will not come here, they know you                      
                      are a Hutu with influence.
          
                                  PAUL
                      They know you are Tutsi!
          
          The door knocks.   Paul gets up, angry.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please, Paul, 'til first light.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Dawn. Then they go.
          
          Paul opens the door, it's Odette, holding the hand of Paul's eldest
          daughter.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Forgive me, Paul. Danielle says that
                      Roger has gone.
          
          Tatiana comes over instantly, worried.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Gone where? Tell me, Danielle.                                 
          Their daughter Danielle answers.
          
                                                                                    
          
          
          
          
                                                                           34.
          
                                     DANIELLE
                         Next door, mama. He was afraid for his                     
                         friend Simon. He went to fetch him.
          
          
          EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls between the shrubs.      He hears ANGRY VOICES.
          
          He peers through the long grass.
          
          Sees: Hutu soldiers boots, feet in sneakers, bare women's feet. And
          among them the glint of machetes, hoes, a club spiked with nails, a
          length of chain CLANGING on the ground.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
          Tatiana rushes out the front door, Paul after her.
          
          Paul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Shhhhh.
          
          SHOUTS next door. Paul pulls Tatiana behind the car. A beat. More
          SHOUTS. Paul takes his hand from her mouth. She's sobbing.
          E
          
          
             EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls to the gap in the shrubs. Feet, a crowd, leaving, through
          a gate. Engines rev.
          
          Roger crawls from the bushes.
          
          Crawls across, the driveway, crawls through a puddle.
          
          Then stops, SEES SOMETHING, AN (UNSEEN) HORROR!
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
          Paul and Tatiana exit the back of the house with flashlight in hand
          headed towards the rear gate.
          
          Paul searches along the chain link fence, finds a section loose, he
          pulls it back, clambers underneath it.                                    
          Tatiana clasps her mouth, afraid to utter a cry.                          
          
          EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT                                                   
          Paul crawls through this scrub tunnel.                                    
          
                                 
          
          
          
                                                                            35.
          
          Then he hears BRANCHES SNAPPING.                                           
          He moves toward the sound.                                                 
          Discovers Roger, terrified, thrashing in a tangle of bushes.               
          He grabs Rogers shirt, pulls him as the little boy startles.               
                                    PAUL                                             
                      Ssshh!                                                         
          Paul drags his son through the chainlink fence, whisks him up in his       
          arms and rushes him to the house.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Paul bursts through the back door and sets Roger down.   Tatiana is
          beside them.
          
                                    TATIANA
                      Roger!
          
          Paul turns the flashlight on Roger. Tatiana pulls back in horror:
          Roger is covered in blood. Her SCREAMS, stifled by fear.
          
                                    TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Oh, my God!                                                    
                                  PAUL
                      Where are you hurt, son?
          
           oger stares blankly. Odette is beside them now.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Get his clothes off.
          
          Hands pull and tear his clothes off. Towels wipe him down. Odette
          looks all over his body with the flashlight. Despite the blood Roger
          has no injuries.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What happened, son? Where did you get
                      this blood?
          
          But Roger, trembling, just stares, totally traumatized. Children cry.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      He's not injured.
          
          His paralysis freaks the women in the room. Paul turns angrily to them.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Leave us, give us some space.
          
                                                                           36.
          
          He ushers the neighbors out of the room, closes the door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (to Tatiana)                                              
                      The neighbors must go at dawn.
          
          Tatiana hugs her son.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI. DAWN
          
          The faintest grey of dawn over the city. Then a flock of birds rises as
          one in the distance. A millisecond later, the cause of their flight, a
          grenade explosion, echoes.
          
          The birds dart, in another direction as the STACCATO of a machine gun
          rips the air.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. DAWN
          
          PAUL sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window.
          
          Behind him Tatiana has Roger cradled in her arms, he still trembles
          wide eyed as she tries to get him to talk.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Will you take a little milk?
          
          Nothing.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let him sleep.
          
          The door knocks. The old guard calls in frightened.
          
                                    OLD GUARD (O.S.)
                      Mr. Paul.                                                      
                                  PAUL
                           (to Tatiana)
                      It is time for the neighbors to leave.
          
          He heads for the door.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. DAWN
          
          Paul steps out, closes the door behind him. A small delegation of the
          men wait nervously.
          
                                    JEAN BAPTISTE
                      It is true.
          
          
          
                                                                              37.
          
          He holds up the tiny radio, tuned to the BBC World service, a crackly
          Brit voice. (It's Gloria the reporter.)
          
                                  GLORIA THE REPORTER (O.S.)
                      The Hutu president's plane was struck by
                      a ground-to-air missile as he returned
                      from signing the peace accord with the
                      Tutsi rebels. There were no survivors.
                      The Hutu government has already blamed                         
                      the Tutsi rebels. The rebels have denied                       
                      the accusation. Already there are reports                      
                      of reprisal killings on the streets.  
                                   
          As they listen, a young woman lets out a SQUEAL, and flees the window
          where she's been sitting.
          
                                  WOMEN (O.S.)
                      They are here.
          
          Hysteria in the room, women and children push toward the bedroom. Paul
          manages to make it to the window, nervously steals a glance and sees:
          
          A HUTU ARMY SOLDIER sits on the high wall by the gate. He pulls another
          up beside him.
          
           anic in the room now. Paul turns.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Shut up!
          
          PAUL'S POV: The soldiers drop into his garden. They draw pistols.
          
                                  TATIANA (O.S.)
                      What is it, Paul.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Stay with the children.
          
          PAUL'S POV: The soldiers go to the gate, slide the bolt, swing it open.
          
          Two jeeps, jammed with heavily armed SOLDIERS, sit in the drive like
          many-limbed beasts of war. Paul watches as the jeeps rumble into his
          garden. The soldiers jump out.
          
          INSIDE THE ROOM:
          
          Nothing can stop the women and children from fleeing into the bedrooms.
          Paul is frozen at the CRASH of rifles on the door.
          
          The door gives, SOLDIERS flood in.
          
          They are startled by the crowd in the living room, rifles raised,
          SHOUTS.
          
                                                                           38.
          
                                  SOLDIERS
                      Out, get out now!
          
          Paul pulls himself together, marches over to the soldier.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Who is in charge?
          
          A Captain is at the door.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      Who are you?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of
                      General Bizimungu.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      We are looking for you.
          
          He takes Paul by the arm, leads him outside.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. DAWN
          
          The Captain stops by his jeep, studies his clipboard.
          
          Tatiana with Roger in her arms, her kids and all the neighbors herded
          together.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is this about?
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Let me see your identity card.
          
          Paul pulls it from his pocket, hands it to the Captain.
          
          CLOSE ON: Paul's ID - it reads Ethnicity: HUTU.
          
          The Captain studies him, waves for the soldiers to back off.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered
                      our president.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. I work at the Mille Collines.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           39.
          
          The Captain looks confused. Paul quickly:
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I used to work at the Diplomat.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Do you know how to open the safe there?
                           (Paul nods)
                      Our government needs to use the hotel and
                      the room keys are in the safe. You must
                      open it.
          
                                   PAUL
                      Of course.
          
          Paul sees out into the street behind the jeeps: a group of Militia in
          their colored shirts armed with machetes, have gathered, trying to see
          what is going on.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Captain, I must take my family.
                      It is not safe here.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Where is your family?
          
          Tatiana is beside him now.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (interrupts)                                              
                      This is them.
          
          Tatiana points to the huddled neighbors. Paul is stunned.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      All of them! I cannot take them.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No, no, good Captain, you do not have to.
                      We have the car and our van.
          
          She points to the Mille Collines van.
          
           he Captain looks doubtful, then his two-way radio barks - an urgent
          message. He listens.
          
          Tatiana drags the kids and ushers everyone toward the van. In a second,
          they are all clambering in.
          
                                   CAPTAIN
                      Let's go.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           40.
          
          Paul jumps behind the wheel of the van. Neighbors are jammed in like
          sardines, 15, more, inside. Tatiana and their kids are squashed
          together on the front bench.
          
          The convoy (jeep - van, car - jeep) starts up and turns out into the
          street.
          
          The Militia men wave sticks, machetes.
          
          
          INT. VAN TRAVELING - DAY
          
          Paul looks back as they speed off down the street.
          
          Sees: The Militia looters pour into his gateway.
          
          As they pass the Caringa home, Militia looters carry off a TV and push
          a stove on a child's skateboard.
          
          TATIANA has Roger on her lap, she cradles his head.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREET. DAY
          
          The convoy speeds through the deserted streets. Slowing only to
          maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where Militia wave machetes,
          nailed clubs and spears as they dance.
          
          FURTHER ALONG THE ROAD: a group of Militia swarm over a car, smashing
          the windshield, the windows. Inside a family huddles together in
          terror, waiting for the windows to give way.
          
          In the gutter by the side of the road, three dead bodies.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to Tatiana)                                             
                      Don't look.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT. DAY
          
          The convoy pulls up at this older, shabbier hotel. There are other
          jeeps, and several staff in a panic. The janitor, ROBERT, sees Paul,
          bursts into waves of joy.
          
                                  ROBERT
                      Mr. Paul, sir. Oh, Mr. Paul. We must open                     
                      every door right now for the government.
          
          Paul jumps out of the van, hurries to the lead jeep.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to the Captain)                                         
                      The safe is in the manager's office.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           41.
          
          The Captain nods to two soldiers.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Go with him, get the keys.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul runs through the lobby. The staff look petrified.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul bursts into the room. The two soldiers follow.
          
          He goes to the hotel's big old combination safe, spins the combination
          a few times, tries the handle, clunk! It doesn't open. He's forgotten
          the number.
          
          The soldiers look at him impatiently. Paul improvises.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Gentlemen, you'll find some chocolate,
                      and maybe a few beers in the fridge.
                      Don't let them go to waste.
          
          The soldiers fall over each other to get to the fridge.
          
          Paul tries the safe numbers again, clunk! It opens.
          
          He sees: a big bunch of keys, a wad of dollars, Rwandan francs, a check
          book, and several bottles of the best cognac, whiskey, some Cristal.
          
          He looks round nervously but the two soldiers are busy fighting over
          the beer and chocolates in the fridge.
          
           s they do, Paul, hands trembling, stuffs the wads of notes, into his
          belt, pulls his shirt over and shuts the safe door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I've got them.
          
          He is about to leave.
          
                                  SOLDIER 1
                      Wait!
          
          Paul looks back at the soldier.
          
                                  SOLDIER 1 (CONT'D)
                      Sit down.
          
          Paul sits, as the two soldiers guzzle beers and stuff chocolate into
          their pockets.
          
                                                                           42.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul hurries through the lobby toward the entrance.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT ENTRANCE. DAY
          
          Paul emerges to see:
          
          All of the occupants of the van, Tatiana, his kids, Odette on their
          knees, with their hands on their heads.
          
          The Captain hovers over them, pistol in hand, turns, sees Paul. He
          marches toward him and SLAPS HIM HARD on the face.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      Traitor!
          
          Paul reels from the blow, but manages to stay on his feet.
          
          The Captain snatches a bunch of ID cards from a soldier, hurls the
          cards in Paul's face.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let me explain.
          
          He grabs Paul by the scruff of the neck, pushes him toward the kneeling
          captives. The Captain snatches a pistol from one of his soldiers,
          shoves it into Paul's hand.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      SHOOT THEM!
          
          Paul looks at him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Please, I don't use guns.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      There is nothing to it.
          
          The Captain raises his own pistol and FIRES it. Everyone jumps with
          fright.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      Shoot them now or you die first.
          
          The Captain aims his pistol at Paul's head. Cocks the hammer.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           43.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Captain, what could I pay you not to do
                      this?
          
          The Captain laughs.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You want to pay me?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Why not? These are not rebels, look at
                      them. Soon they will be worthless to you.
                      Why not take some money, for your work?
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      How much?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Name a price.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Ten thousand francs for each one.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't have that much.
          
          The Captain laughs, snatches the gun from Paul, marches toward them.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Wait! Wait!
          
          Paul reaches into his pocket, pulls out the bunch of dollars.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty
                      thousand francs for my family. To let us
                      drive off to the Mille Collines.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      How many in your family?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Six.
          
          The Captain looks at his soldiers, at the wad of notes.
          
                                   APTAIN
                      Pull your family out.
          
          Paul runs over, grabs Tatiana, Roger, the three girls. Odette kneels
          beside Tatiana. Paul whispers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Have you any money?
          
                                                                            44.
          
                                    ODETTE
                      Nothing.
          
          Paul pushes his family toward the van, looks back, sees the Captain
          pocket the dollars, move toward the line.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Paul, don't let them die.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (urgent)
                      Get in.
          
          Paul pushes them into the van, shuts the door, digs into his soul for
          all the courage he can muster, then turns back.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Captain, let these people give you some
                      money, whatever they have.
          
          The Captain hesitates. Paul sees this, runs over to the line of
          neighbors.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Give me everything, everything you have.
          
          A pathetic rain of Rwandan francs, useless coins, watches, jewelry
          falls onto the ground. Paul scoops it all up.
          T
          
          he Captain looks at it, takes it, then:
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      There is only enough for one cockroach.
          
          The Captain raises his pistol.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      Pick one to take with you.
          
          Now each terrified neighbor looks to Paul, begging.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Wait, wait.
          
          Paul counts the kneeling figures: ten adults, four kids.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Ten.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      And four children?
          
          
          
          
                                                                              45.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'll give you a hundred thousand francs
                      for all of them.
          
          The Captain points the gun.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      Give me it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't have it here. At the Mille
                      Collines. I can get it for you.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You will run into the hotel and hide
                      behind the U.N.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand
                      francs, enough for a house. I will get
                      the money, you keep them outside.
          
          The Captain smiles.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      I will keep your family outside. Let's
                      go.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          The convoy pulls up at the outer gates of the Mille Collines. It's
          manned by ARMED UN PEACEKEEPERS.
          
           he Captain walks to Paul in the van.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Go with my soldiers. And hurry back if
                      you want to keep these cockroaches.
          
          The Captain nods to Paul's children.
          
          Paul jumps into the Rwandan army jeep.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to UN Peacekeepers)                                      
                      I am the manager. Open the gate.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Chaos - UN jeeps, hotel vans, dismayed tourists, frightened Tutsi
          refugees.
          
          
          
                                                                              46.
          
          CLOSE ON: Bik, the Dutch manager, bag packed, anxious, sees Paul.
          YELLS.
          
                                  BIK
                      Paul, I have to talk to you ...
          
          But Paul ignores Bik, barrels his way through the din and crush of the
          parking lot.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul rushes in:   The lobby is filled with Tutsi refugees, and scared
          white tourists.
          
            solitary receptionist, besieged by anxious guests, is relieved to see
          Paul.
          
                                  RECEPTIONIST
                      Oh, sir, please can you...
          
          Paul rushes to the accounting room behind the reception desk, closes
          the door.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul pulls bundles of dollars from the hotel safe.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL. DAY
          
          Paul pushes through the mob at the door. Bik comes up.
          
                                  BIK
                      Paul...                                                        
                            grabs Paul)                                              
                      ...I have to talk to you.                                      
                                   PAUL
                      I'll be back.
          
          Paul breaks free and hurries over to the Army jeep.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (hops in)                                                 
                      Let's go.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          Paul jumps from the jeep. Waves to Tatiana in the van, then gives the
          money to the Captain.
          
          
          
                                                                           47.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Now let them go.
          
          No response. Money in hand, the Captain eyes Paul with malice.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Don't be foolish. There's more money to
                      be made here.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask
                      for Captain Naramunju.
          
          The Captain smiles, then jumps in his jeep and speeds off. Paul runs to
          the van and jumps in.
          
          INSIDE THE VAN
          
          Jubilation, in the rear of the van. Odette is in tears.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Thank you, thank you, Paul.
          
          Paul doesn't reply. Tatiana hugs him. He gives her a look - a mix of       
          relief and anger - the crowd in the back almost cost him his family.       
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul's van arrives. Bik hangs from a minibus.
          
                                  BIK
                           (shouts)                                                  
                      Paul, I have to go. The staff have fled
                      Kivu Lodge. I have to close it.                                
          
          He flings office keys to Paul.
          
                                  BIK (CONT'D)
                      While I'm away, you're in charge.                              
          
          Bik's van takes off. A group of tourists hears Bik's words.
          
                                  TOURISTS
                      Hey, hey, we need our passports, we want
                      to get a flight.
          
          Paul looks at them.
          
                                  TOURIST
                      They're in your safety boxes. We need
                      them right away.
          
                  
                                                                              48.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Come inside.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          At the desk, the same receptionist is overwhelmed.
          
                                  TOURIST (O.C.)
                      He's in charge, that's him.
          
          Paul goes behind the desk. Rumors fly among the crowd of tourists.
          
                                  TOURISTS
                      (staccato) to the airport...my embassy
                      ...tried to call... the airport is closed
                      ... refund... this is outrageous ...
          
          Behind the tourists, Tatiana and the neighbors look lost.
          
          Paul addresses the frightened Western tourists.  
                                    
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Please, I am the house manager. Return in                      
                      thirty minutes and we will deal with all                       
                      your requests, thank you.     
                                           
          Paul turns to the room key boxes, nearly all are empty.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)                                      
                      What happened to all the rooms?
          
          Finally he finds a key, pushes through to Tatiana, hands a key to
          Odette and Jean Baptiste.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Take this room. Tatiana, bring the
                      children.
          
          Paul starts to lead his family away.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      (re: neighbors) What about them?
          
          Paul looses it.                                                            
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Them. They almost got us all killed. I                         
                      have done enough for them! We cannot look                      
                      after them anymore.
          
                                                                           49.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What are you going to do? You cannot
                      drive them out onto the road. They can                      
                      stay with me.    
                                                     
                                  PAUL                                            
                      What!          
                                                       
                                  TATIANA
                      I will not have them on my conscience.                      
                      They will stay in my room.  
                                          
                                  PAUL
                           (to Zozo)
                      Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms.
                      Put these people in them.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Yes, sir.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          Paul hurries his family along the corridor. Rwandan refugees wander
          aimlessly pulling their meagre possessions.
          
                                  REFUGEE
                           (calls out)                                            
                      Moses, Moses Seradungu.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Can I help you?
          
                                  REFUGEE
                      I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is his room number?
          
                                  REFUGEE
                      I don't know.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go downstairs, I will help you.
          
          Paul finds his room and opens the door.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY
          
          PAUL leads his family into a one-bedroom suite. The kids drop to the
          beds exhausted. Tatiana picks up the phone and dials.
          
                                                                           50.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What are you doing?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Trying Thomas and Fedens. We've got to
                      get them here.
          
          Paul paces the room. The maids clearly haven't cleaned it since it's
          last occupants: the beds are unmade; towels are on the floor; and a
          newspaper is scattered across the desk.
          
                                  PAUL
                      (re: room) This won't do.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      It will do just fine.
          
          So Paul tidies the place. As he does,
          
                                  PAUL
                      Any luck?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No answer. Please send someone to get
                      them, please.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'll try.
          
          Paul leaves.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul waits, then a car pulls up, an Indian businessman, Mr. Garindi,
          gets out, shakes hands, he's shaken.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies                      
                      everywhere. I cannot stay here.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I need a great favor.
          
          He hands Mr. Garindi an address.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I need you to go to this address and
                      bring my brother-in-law and his family.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      No, no. This is a very dangerous part of
                      town. I cannot do this.
          
                                                                            51.
          
                                  PAUL
                      This would be an enormous favor to me. I                     
                      am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this                    
                      nonsense is over I will be most grateful.    
                          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      I will see what I can do.
          
          Mr. Garindi climbs back into his car.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul stops just shy of the lobby. Around the corner is a mob of angry
          guests. Paul takes a moment to gather himself: straightens his tie;
          button his jacket; flick a piece of lint from his shoulder. Then he
          takes a breath and steps around the corner.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Thank you for your patience, ladies and                      
                      gentlemen. Now, how can I help you.    
                                
          The mob rushes him.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          Paul works the front desk as angry guests surge all around him. Zozo
          emerges from the office with two tourists.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Where are the receptionists? Where's
                      Gregoire?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      He has taken the presidential suite.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What!
          
          Paul storms off.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY
          
          CLOSE ON: A door with a placard reading "Presidential Suite".   Paul
          knocks. The door opens. Gregoire answers, half-naked.
          
                                   GREGOIRE
                           (surprised)
                      Mr. Manager.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Gregoire, what are you doing here?
          
          
          
                                                                           52.
          
                                   A WOMAN'S VOICE INSIDE (O.S.)
                      Who is it?
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      What do you want?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Get out of this room and get back to
                      work.
          
                                  GREGOIRE                                           
                      I don't have to listen to you anymore. 
                                  
                                  PAUL                                                                           
                      I am in charge now. Get back to work or
                      I'll fire you. 
                                                          
                                  GREGOIRE                                           
                      Let me ask you Mr. Manager, do you notice                      
                      a smell of cockroaches? If I were to                           
                      leave this room, I'm sure I could find                         
                      this smell. I know people who could                            
                      cleanse it.(stares) But maybe it doesn't                       
                      bother you? Why is that? Are used to this                      
                      smell? Not me, I need a clean room to                          
                      escape it.         
                                                      
          Gregoire closes the door. Paul's eyes burn with anger, but this battle     
          will have to wait.                                                         
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul comes into the lobby and discovers Colonel Oliver, he is escorting    
          a tall, well-dressed man, the Tutsi Minister of Finance XAVIER and his
          family.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      Paul, you know who this is?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, Colonel Monsieur Xavier, the                              
                      Minister of Finance.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Get him a room, but tell no one he is
                      here.
                            (to Xavier)
                      Paul will look after you.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      I will need a suite.
          
                               
          
                                                                            53.
          
                                   PAUL
                      Of course.
          
          He moves over to Zozo.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Get the key to suite twelve, take these

          There's a commotion by the door. Paul goes over.
          
          A valet stops a group of Tutsi refugees from entering.

                      Sir, they have no reservations.
          
          Paul studies the group, - a ragged bunch, no way are they Mille

          shorts bursts out from among the trees and flees to the middle of the
          driveway. It's the journalist, BENEDICT, covered in blood. His ear has
          been chopped off.

                      What happened?
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      They're killing everyone. The Lady
                      Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the
                      gate.
          
          He points down the driveway. This sparks many of the women refugees,
          and white guests, to flee inside the hotel.
          
          Odette arrives with her bag, leads Benedict inside.
          
          Jock has been filming all of this.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DRIVEWAY. DAY
          
          Now Jock runs, camera still on his shoulder, toward the gate.
          
          Paul takes off after him.
          
          More Tutsi refugees running up the driveway in fear.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          As Jock films, Paul arrives by the gate house. UN soldiers watch the
          outside road. Engines roar, then.
          
          A convoy of Toyota trucks circle on the road outside the gate. Drunken
          Militia men on the back wave spears, machetes, one, in a woman's disco
          wig, waves a cordless power drill. The drill bit is red with blood.
          
          In the next truck, TWO Militia MEN triumphantly taunt the UN soldiers
          as they hold blue UN helmets high on sticks. The helmets are shot
          through with holes.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      We kill UN. We kill you next.
          
          ENRAGED UN SOLDIERS cock their weapons, aim.
          
          A UN armored car races past the Militia and turns into the driveway.
          The back door opens, UN Colonel Oliver jumps out.  
                                 
                                  COLONEL OLIVER
                      Hold the line here. Do not shoot!
          
          The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive     
          by. Paul approaches Oliver

          Oliver shakes his head. He helps Paul clamber into the armored car.

          surround them.

          There's a clank of metal. Paul looks and sees:                            
          A waiter struggling with a trolley of food by a door.                     
          He hurries to help the waiter as Jock opens, indicates quiet, waves
          Paul and the waiter in.

                      gruesome ambush of a ten man Belgian

                      looking for children. They shout, "Kill
                      the babies to clear the infestation."
                      Leave them be, they are safe. I have to
                      go now.
          
          Paul takes a small wad of notes from his pocket, presses it into the
          businessman's hand.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Thank you for your help.
          
          He leaves. Tatiana pulls Paul to her.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      My sister is dead, Paul. They would not
                      leave the children.
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. They are not dead. Stop this.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul and Tatiana push through the French tourists and AID workers
          running across the lobby.
          
                                                                            64.
          
                                   FRENCH TOURISTS
                       Mon Dieu, Merci.
          
          Cheers break out. Paul and Tatsi peer from the crowd and through the
          lobby window see:
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DRIVEWAY. DAY
          
          French and Italian special forces pull into the parking lot, standing
          tall in their jeeps, macho western super troops, triumphant. Salvation!
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Wild cheering, flowers draped around necks, kisses. Westerners,
          Rwandans, dance and sing in celebration.
          
          Paul SEES: Colonel Oliver off to the side, with the commanders of the      
          French special forces.
          
          
                      OLIVER
          CLOSE ON:                                                                  
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                       You have a battalion, you could stop this
                       now. The Hutu army is no match for you.
          
                                   FRENCH COMMANDER
                       Those are not our orders.
          
          Oliver pulls off his blue beret, throws it on the ground, points his       
          finger at the French and Italian officers.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                       You will remember this day for the rest
                       of your lives.
          
          He walks off, returns, picks up his beret.
          
          Paul watches as he storms into the lobby.
          
          Paul follows.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL BAR. DAY
          
          Paul follows the Colonel into the Kigali Club. The place is empty, the     
          bartender missing, gone to celebrate.
          
                                   PAUL
                       Colonel, what can I get you?                                  
          Paul gets behind the bar.
          
                                                                           65.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Anything. Strong.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Canadian Club?
          
          Oliver cracks a weary smile. Paul pours two drinks, slides one across.    
          He raises his glass.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved                      
                      us all.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                   
                            (raw cynicism)
                      Congratulations. You should spit in my
                      face.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Excuse me, Colonel.                                           
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      We think you are dirt, less than dirt,
                      worthless.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't understand.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the
                      smartest man here. You have them all
                      eating out of your hand. You'd own this
                      fucking hotel, except for one thing.
          
          Paul doesn't answer.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)                           
                      You're fucking black! You're not even a
                      nigger, you're African!
                           (downs his drink)
                      They're not staying to stop this thing.
                      They're gonna fly right out of here with
                      their people.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (shocked)
                      Their people?
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      They're only taking the whites.
          
                               
          
                                                                           66.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Paul opens the door. Tatiana and the kids pack bags, prepare to leave.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Children, go into the hallway.
          
          Tatiana and the children stop what they're doing, puzzled.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      (to the kids) Please, go.
          
          The kids leave.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What's wrong?
          
          Paul takes her hands in his.
          
                                  PAUL
                      All the whites are leaving.
          
          Tatiana's grip tightens.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      They are being evacuated.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What about us?
          
                                  PAUL
                      We have been abandoned.
          
          Tatiana clings to hope.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      The soldiers will stop the killers.
          
          Paul looses it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Listen to me woman. I said all the whites
                      are leaving. The French, the Italians,
                      even the Belgian UN soldiers.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      But who is left?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN                      
                      has three hundred soldiers for the whole
                      country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
          
          
          
          
                                                                              67.
          
          He looks up at her.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      The most the Colonel can spare for the                           
                      hotel are four men, and they're not
                      allowed to shoot.
          
          He takes her hand, makes her sit down.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                      If anything should happen, if the Militia
                      arrive, you must take the children and go
                      to the roof.
          
          Tatiana's eyes are wide with fear.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What for?
          
          Paul takes his anger out on Tatiana.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Do what I say, woman. You hear me? I will
                      meet you there.
          
          He storms out.
          
                                                                         CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          REVEAL: A chaos of luggage, white tourists, AID agency people, Italian
          and French soldiers, elite, slick.
          
          On the edges, clumps of Rwandans, watching, silent, fearful.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          A torrential African rain storm soaks everything. Porters with big
          umbrellas run the white evacuees to the buses.
          
          French and Italian commanders check off names on clipboards.
          
          Jock films the evacuees boarding buses.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          At the front desk, Paul, dripping wet from working the convoy,    listens
          to a French tourist who refuses to pay his bill.
          
                                   
          
          
                                                                           68.
          
                                     FRENCH TOURIST
                         Why should I pay to stay in a, in a
                         holocaust? Tell me.
          
          Paul, stone-faced, polite, destroys this asshole.
          
                                     PAUL
                         You are not staying sir, you are leaving.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul watches in the rain as the final agency people are being loaded
          onto buses.
          
          Several white aid workers weep uncontrollably as they are dragged away
          from frightened Rwandan coworkers.
          
             PAUL in the rain.
          
           cross the parking lot Colonel Oliver watches from his jeep.              
          Jock and his sound man embrace two beautiful young HOOKERS.
          
          One girl begs Jock to take her with him.
          
                                     HOOKER
                         Please, please, they will put me on the
                         street. They will chop me.
          
                                     JOCK
                         Darlin', believe me, if I could...
          
          He digs in his pockets, pulls out money, cigarettes. Everything he has
          he gives to her.
          
          Then he pulls her toward Paul, digs out his wallet.
          
                                       JOCK (CONT'D)
                         Here. Here.
          
          He pushes two Visa cards into Paul's hands.
          
                                     JOCK (CONT'D)
                         Give her what she wants, room, food,
                         anything. Charge it all. Don't you put
                         her out, Paul.
          
                                     PAUL
                         I would never do that.
          
                                     JOCK
                         I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.                              
                         Here take this.

          Jock pulls a Rolex off his wrist.  
                                                  
                                  PAUL
                      This is a Rolex, I can't take it.   
                                     
                                  JOCK                                               
                      Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a                       
                      fucking aeroplane.       
                                                
          Jock embraces Paul, tears in his eyes.
          
          Gloria watches from the doorway. Embarrassed by Jock, She becomes
          officious.

                      Let's go, Jock.
          
                                  JOCK
                           (turns on her)
                      Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are
                      we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are
                      you? Well, are ya'?
          
                                  GLORIA
                      You're drunk.
          
          Gloria marches onto the bus.
          
                                   LORIA
                           (to a French soldier)
                      What are we waiting for?
          
                                  FRENCH SOLDIER
                      We have to evacuate some nuns from a
                      convent. They are on their way.
          
          Jock kisses the hooker, heaves his camera onto the bus.
          
          Then there is a disturbance on the driveway.
          
          A group of French nuns, along with maybe a hundred Tutsi women and
          children come running up the driveway. They are all terrified. One nun
          leads them with a French flag.
          
          French soldiers run forward. A commander orders them to form   a line,
          blocking the refugees.
          
          French soldiers begin pulling nuns from the terrified crowd.
          
          Several nuns begin hysterically weeping, pulling Rwandan children with
          them. Panic breaks out among the crowd.
          
                                                                           70.

          Jock grabs his camera, pushes off the bus.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Nuns cling to young children. French soldiers wrench the nuns away,
          lift them off their feet, carry them to the bus.
          
          JOCK films, as A FRENCH OFFICER screams at him.
          
          The last nun is dragged onto a bus.
          
          Jock looks to Paul, then gets on the bus.
          
          The convoy - French jeeps, buses, Italian jeeps, UN jeeps takes off,
          through the refugees, turns a corner, gone.
          
          Paul, drenched, is left alone to fend for his new guests:                 
          Weeping women, frightened children.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          The convoy passes the gate house.
          
          Across the road, two jeeps of Rwandan Army soldiers watch the convoy
          leave. They get on the radio.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Where five minutes before the lobby was a frenzy of wealthy Europeans
          and aid workers, the groups of clustered black faces are silent except
          for the crying of babies and sobbing mothers. Paul picks his way among
          them. Zozo catches up.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      What do we do with all these people?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Open up the ballroom, we'll put them
                      there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make
                      rice and beans - a lot of it.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.
          
          Paul enters, drops to the bed. Tatiana curls up next to him.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      You could leave, Paul.
          
                
          
          
                                                                           71.
          
                                    PAUL
                        What are you saying, Tatsi?
          
                                    TATIANA
                        Your card says Hutu. Take our children,
                        go and get the twins, pay money at the
                        roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Enough of this. We stay together. Let me
                        rest, I will feel better then.
          
          Paul puts on his walkman earphones, presses play, the rich cowboy drawl
          of Don Williams singing ???
          
          Close on: Paul as his eyes droop and to the music.
          
          A kalidiscope of colors filter through drooping eyelids as
          
          Close on Paul's face, as the music plays.
          
          His eyes open wide, disturbed, music playing
          
          Paul's POV, an Army lieutenant stands over him, other soldiers around.
          
          The lieutenant reaches down, pulls the earphones from Paul's ears.
          
                                    LIEUTENANT
                        You are the manager?
          
                                    PAUL
                        Yes, sir. What is wrong?                                     
                                    LIEUTENANT
                        Everyone must leave the hotel now.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Why sir?
          
                                    LIEUTENANT
                        It's an order. Get everyone out now.
          
                                    PAUL
                        I...ah...need some time. Please give us
                        twenty, thirty minutes. People are
                        sleeping.
          
          The lieutenant is not impressed.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Please, have some cold drinks. I will be
                        as quick as I can.
          
          'Cold drinks' softens the soldiers' attitudes.
          
          
          
                                                                           72.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      We will be outside, ten minutes.
          
          The soldiers march off. Paul goes back inside. The kids, sensing the
          menace, sit still and wide-eyed on the floor. Suddenly Tatiana notices     
          Roger is missing.                                                          
                                  TATIANA                                            
                      Where's Roger?        
                                                   
          Danielle points to under the bed.    
                                                
          CLOSE ON:                                                                  
          Roger trembling under the bed, as Paul's face appears.   
                            
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Come on son, everything is all right.                          
          He slides him out, clutches him in his arms, then turns him over to
          Tatiana as he phones the front desk. 
                                                
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)                                      
                           (on phone)                                                
                      Who is this? Zozo. I know. Get them beer.                      
          
          He turns to Tatiana.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Go to the roof now.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (terrified)
                      What for Paul.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (forceful)
                      Do as I say. I will be there soon.
          
          He hurries out.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          Paul's door opens, his head appears round the corner.
          
          The corridor is empty of soldiers. Now, frightened Tutsis peer out from
          their rooms. A group of men, among them the politician Xavier, are
          gathered in the hallway. Paul spots one man holding a pistol. He runs
          up.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to the man with the pistol)
                      Are you mad? They will gun us all down.
          
                                                                           73.
          
                                  PISTOL MAN
                      Better to die by the bullet than the
                      machete.
          
          Paul pulls the gun off him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Wait here, please.
          
          Paul hands the gun to Xavier, hurries off.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul bursts in, sits by the phone and dials.
          
                                  PAUL (ON PHONE)
                      Good day, General Bizimungu please. Do
                      you know where he is? Please ask him to
                      call Paul Rusesabagina. It is urgent.
          
          Phone again.
          
          A SERIES OF FLASH CUTS: increasingly frantic calls.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Colonel Bagsora. Where? Can you find him?
          
          ANOTHER CALL:
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Who would order such a thing?
          
          ANOTHER CALL:
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Did you find the General?
          
          Paul hangs up the phone defeated. He looks at his watch. His head flops
          onto the desk, onto the Sabena logo. He sees it.
          
          
          INT. SABENA PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          The Sabena president and two VPs sit on couches.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      If British Airways abandons the route we
                      should bid for it.
          
          His intercom buzzes, he's annoyed then.
          
                            
          
                                                                             74.
          
                                  SECRETARY (ON PHONE)
                      I'm sorry, sir. I have a call from Paul
                      in Kigali. He says it's urgent.
          
          The president goes to the phone, hits the speaker button.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      Paul. Are you alright?
          
                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                      We have a big problem. The Hutu army have
                      come and ordered us all of us out of the
                      hotel.
          
          The president is baffled.
          
                                   RESIDENT
                      Out? Where are you going?
          
                                   PAUL
                      I do not know, sir. I think they will
                      kill us all.
          
          The president can barely form words to reply.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      All. What do you mean all?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The staff, the guests.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      The staff and guests! How many?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Now we have eight hundred guests and one
                      hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
                      I wish I could have done more, sir.
                      Please, thank all my friends at Sabena.
                      You have been good to me and my family.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      (panicked) Paul, wait, wait, I'm going to
                      put you on hold for one minute, stay on
                      the phone.
          
          He hits the hold button. Looks to the other executives. They are
          stunned to silence by Paul's profound farewell.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul listens to music on the phone.
          
          
                                                                           75.
          
          
          INT. SABENA EXTERIOR OFFICES. DAY
          
          Pandemonium - the president has everyone working the phones.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      Get the prime minister's office. Call
                      General Chareaux. Louis get the UN. Tell
                      them this is Belgian property.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          The music is suddenly interrupted.
          
                                  PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                      Paul, are you there?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, thank you Mr. President.
          
                                  PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                      Paul, if you have one call in all the
                      world to stop this, who would you call?
          
          Paul thinks.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
          
                                  PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                      Paul, do everything you can to buy time.
                      I will call you back.
          
          Paul hurries from the room.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Zozo at the computer, printing something. Paul walks up, sees: The
          Hotel's Registry printing. Paul grabs it, studies.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What are you doing?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      The lieutenant wants the register.
          
          He pushes Zozo toward the elevator.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go and get more beer.
          
          Now Paul is on the computer, typing.
          
                                                                           76.
          
          ON SCREEN: The register shows that day's date: April 13.
          
          Paul hits a few keys.
          
          ON SCREEN: The date above the register is April 4.
          
          Paul hits the print button. The printer clicks to life.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul with the printed registry and Zozo with beer walk to the jeeps.
          The soldiers don't wait for the Captain's order, they mob Zozo, grab
          beers. The lieutenant marches up to Paul.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      Where's the guest list?
          
          Paul hands him the printout. He studies it, reads.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                      Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The guest list. It hasn't been updated
                      since the murder of the president.
          
          The lieutenant grabs Paul by the shirt.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      Are you trying to make a fool of me?
                      There are no Europeans left in that
                      hotel. Get me the names of all the
                      cockroaches in there.
          
                                  PAUL
                      That will take time.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      You don't have time. If I do not have the
                      names, so that I can pick out the
                      traitors, then I will kill everyone here
                      in this car park. Get in there now.
          
          Paul turns to walk back in. The lieutenant hurries to his men, pulls
          beers from their hands, smashes them on the ground. One soldier comes
          running to him with a radio. Paul watches. The lieutenant listens, then
          calls to Paul.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                      Hey you, come here.
          
          Paul returns.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           77.
          
                                     LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                         Who did you call?
          
                                      PAUL
                         Call, sir?
          
                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Don't lie to me. What's your name?
          
                                     PAUL
                         Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
          
                                     LIEUTENANT
                         I will remember that name. (turns to his
                         soldiers) Let's go.
          
          The soldiers roar off down the driveway.
          
             ZOZO looks to Paul, a thank you Jesus look.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL ROOF. DAY
          
          Paul emerges onto the roof, sees Tatiana, his children, and many of the
          neighbors sitting huddled together. (They do not know the soldiers have
          left.)
          
          Tatiana is frozen to the spot.
          
                                     PAUL
                         They have gone.
          
          Tatiana grabs him. Tears of joy. Paul's neighbors swarm him, touch him,
          thank him like a messiah. This effects him. He seems genuinely moved as
          he shakes hands and hugs them.
          
                                     ZOZO
                         Sir. The president of Sabena is on the
                         phone for you.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul arrives behind the front desk.
          
          Paul hits the button.
          
                                     PAUL
                         They are gone. Thank you, sir. What did
                         you do?
          
                               
          
                                                                            78.

          Gotfroid is at his desk.
          
                                  SABENA PRESIDENT
                      I managed to get the President of France
                      on the phone.
          
                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                      Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
          
                                  SABENA PRESIDENT
                      Paul, I pleaded with the president to go
                      in and get you all. He told me it will
                      not happen.
          
                                     PAUL
                      Why?
          
                                  SABENA PRESIDENT
                      I can give you many political answers
                      Paul but the truth is that Africa is not
                      worth a single vote to all of them:
                      French, British, Americans.
          
          Silence.
          
                                  SABENA PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                      You have to get out of there, Paul. I
                      will do whatever I can.
          
                                                                 SMASH CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          The elite of the Tutsi refugees, those with contacts or friends abroad,
          are gathered in the office.
          
                                  PAUL
                      There will be no rescue, no intervention
                      force. We can only save ourselves. Call
                      any foreigner you know, tell them what
                      will happen to us. Say goodbye but when
                      you say goodbye, say it as though you're
                      reaching through and shaking their hand.
                      Let them know if they let go of that
                      hand, you will die. (silence) We must
                      shame them into sending help.
          
          The others look stunned.
          
                                                                           79.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Get on the phones while we still can. At
                      least we can say they heard our cries.
                      Zozo come with me.
          
          Paul leaves.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul looks around the lobby. It resembles a refugee center more than a
          five star hotel.
          
          He turns to a computer, calls up the register, then hits DELETE and
          erases the register.
          
          He picks up the phone, calls.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Send two of the housekeeping carpenters
                      to the lobby.
          
          Paul strides across the lobby, calls to Zozo.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Everyone gather together now. Zozo get
                      them all together.
          
          They herd together quickly.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      No one can remain in this lobby any
                      longer. I have rooms available. Who can
                      pay? The rental is six hundred francs per
                      day.
          
          About fifty percent of the hands go up.
          
                                  TUTSI WOMAN
                      I cannot pay?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go with Zozo to the ballroom. We will
                      find you bedding. This is a hotel. No one
                      will be allowed to stay in the lobby.
          
          The carpenters arrive beside Paul.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Good. I want you to go around and take
                      all the numbers off the doors.
          
                                 
          
                                                                            80.
          
                                  CARPENTER
                      What shall we put in their place.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Nothing. I want no numbers on the doors.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          Paul going door to door, knocking. The rooms are all packed with Tutsi
          refugees. A door opens.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Good day. Here is your bill for the last
                      week. If you cannot pay, or think you
                      will not be able to pay, go to the
                      ballroom. Zozo will take care of you.
          
                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY.
          
          Paul knocks on a door. The Tutsi politician Xavier opens the door, sees
          that it is Paul.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      Come in Paul.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LUXURY SUITE. DAY
          
          A beautiful two-bedroom suite. Xavier lives in comfort compared to the
          other refugees.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm afraid you will have to move room.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      Move? Where to?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm going to put you on the third floor.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      The third floor are low class rooms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes they are. However if the army return
                      they will expect important people such as
                      yourself to be in these grand rooms.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           81.
          
                                  XAVIER
                           (to his wife)
                      Pack the bags, we have to move.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Also, this is your bill for the last
                      week.
          
          Paul leaves, Xavier looks shocked.
          
                                                                     FADE TO:
          
          
          MONTAGE
          
          Paul and influential refugees, Odette, Benedict (with a bandage over
          his missing ear), Xavier and others call, plead, write and send faxes
          all around the world. We see this NIGHT and DAY; DAY and NIGHT --
          
           hen Odette on the phone.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Yes, that's right. I helped set up the
                      treatment center in Nairobi. I'm in the
                      Mille Collines Hotel right now with my
                      husband, Peter, and my two boys. If you
                      do not help us we will be murdered.
          
          Zozo arrives.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Sir, General Bizimungu is here.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL POOL TERRACE. DAY
          
          The pool patio is deserted except for General Bizimungu and three
          soldiers who lounge at a table. Gregoire and his girlfriend sun on
          reclining deck chairs like movie stars. Paul and a waiter with a tray
          of drinks join the General.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am glad you are well.
          
          Paul hands the scotch to Bizimungu.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      As long as it is scotch.
                            (drinks)
                      Your white friends have abandoned you,
                      Paul.
          
                                 
          
                                                                          82.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The United Nations are still here.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      (laughs) The United Nations. Madmen are
                      on the streets, Paul. But I will take
                      care of you. (chugs his drink) Your
                      cellar is well-stocked, right?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I
                      overheard something that I think you
                      should know about.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      What did you overhear?
          
                                  PAUL
                      A discussion between an American Embassy
                      official and a UN Colonel.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      What did they say?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The American assured the colonel that
                      they would watch everything.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Watch everything? How? They are gone.
          
          Paul points surreptitiously to the sky. The General looks up.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Satellites.
          
                                    GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Satellites?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on
                      your shoulder.
          
                                   ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      And what will they do with these
                      satellites?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The American said intervention is too
                      costly, better to get photographic
                      evidence and snatch up the high command.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      The high command? Our high command?
          
                         
          
                                                                           83.
          
                                  PAUL
                      'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes
                      trial. Lock them all away forever. No
                      political risk, and big publicity.'
                      That's what he said. (a beat) I thought
                      I'd better tell you.
          
          The General looks again to the sky then.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      The Americans! Who are they to put us on
                      trial. Let us imagine Paul when their
                      president Kennedy was shot, they said it
                      was a black man. Then their politicians,
                      their radio stations gave orders `we must
                      wipe out these black people before they
                      wipe out us.' What do you think would
                      have happened? No different.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CELLAR. DAY
          
          Paul fills Bizimungu's briefcase with scotch, hands two six-packs of
          beer to Zozo. Paul notes his once packed storeroom, now considerably
          dwindled in stock.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Where has all our beer gone?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      How much beer?
          
                                    ZOZO
                      Many beers.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL POOL TERRACE. AFTERNOON
          
          Paul arrives back at the pool, hands Bizimungu his briefcase. Zozo
          gives the beer to the soldiers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I am worried about thieves and criminals
                      coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could
                      arrange for some police to guard us.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      The police are very busy.
          
          
                                                                             84.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I understand General, but when I last                            
                      talked to the president of Sabena he                             
                      promised me that anyone who helped                               
                      protect Belgian property would be                                
                      rewarded.                                                        
          
          Bizimungu understands this is a financial proposition.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU                                    
                      He did.                                                          
                                  PAUL                                                 
                      "Well rewarded" Those were his words.   
                                   
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      If I were to spare a few policemen, where
                      would I station them?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The front gate would be best, General.
                      They could check all guests.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I will see what I can do.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I admire you, General. How do you keep
                      command of your men amidst such madness?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I wish I were like you. Look at my staff,
                      they won't work, they listen to no one.
          
          Paul nods over toward Gregoire.
          
                                     ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      He is staff?
          
           he General gets up.
          
          Gregoire, who is lying face down on the deck chair, doesn't see him
          approach. The General pulls the deck chair from underneath Gregoire and
          throws it into the pool. As Gregoire tries to scramble to his feet, the
          General propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
                      Get to work, you slug.
          
          Gregoire races from the pool, followed by his girlfriend.
          
                                                                           85.
          
          The General clicks his fingers and his soldiers follow.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
                      Make sure, Paul, your guests are
                      generous.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY. DAY
          
          Benedict greets Paul in the lobby.
          
                                   BENEDICT
                      Paul, we would like to speak to you in
                      your office.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We, who is we?
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      A delegation.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul walks in and discovers the office packed with the elite Tutsi
          refugees including Xavier, Odette and Jean Baptiste. Paul's puzzled,
          there's an air of tension in the room.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes.
          
          A brief silence, then a Tutsi bank manager speaks.
          
                                  BANKER
                      You have no right to charge us rent.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Why not?
          
                                  BANKER
                      This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison
                      and you are profiteering from our misery.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      That is not true.
          
          Another accuser speaks up.
          
                                  TUTSI ACCUSER
                      Yes it is. He charges for food, for
                      everything. Where is all this money
                      going? We hear he has a deal with
                      Bizimungu.
          
          
                                                                            86.
          
                                  TUTSI ACCUSER #2
                      It is said that you work for the murderer
                      George Rutagunda.
          
          Murmurs of agreement. Paul has heard enough.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I confess. ( a beat) It's true I have a
                      deal with General Bizimungu. He was just
                      here. I worked out another money making
                      scheme for him. New arrivals will be
                      taxed at the gate.
          
          Silence.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Do you know what my deal is with
                      Bizimungu. I pay him and he keeps you
                      alive. Anyone want to take their money
                      back?
          
          PAUL pulls money from his pocket, hands it around, offers it.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Here, here take it. And you don't have to
                      pay your bill. I will move you into the
                      ballroom or out into the gardens.
          
          He walks among them.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      And, yes, I work with George Rutagunda.
                      I buy rice and beans, beer and soap. I
                      will have to visit his warehouse soon
                      because we are running out of food. Who
                      wants to come with me?
          
          Paul holds the door open.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Anyone who wants to come with me stay
                      behind. If not, please leave.
          
          They hurry out, duly chastised. But Odette and her husband Jean
          Baptiste remain.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (laughs)
                      You are most certainly not coming with
                      me. You will get me killed.
          
                                  JEAN BAPTISTE
                      You can't go to that place, they know
                      what you are doing here.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           87.
          
                                  PAUL
                      George will not hurt me, I am too
                      profitable to him.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      What if he is not there?
          
          Paul hasn't got an answer for that one. He leads them out.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Roger is asleep, on a couch in the living room, several kids sleep on
          the floor.
          
          TO THE BED: Where Tatiana suppresses bursts of laughter as Paul relates
          the Gregoire story in whispers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      As soon as the General left he came
                      running back. (mimics Gregoire) Help me,
                      sir, I have been possessed by a witch.
                      (Paul's own voice now) A witch you say?
                      (mimics) Yes, yes, I did not know I was
                      in that room. The president's room, why
                      would I be in the president's room? (own
                      voice) Indeed, the General asked me the
                      same. (mimics) Asked you what? (own
                      voice) Does Gregoire think he is
                      president now?
          
          PAUL mimics Gregoire's whimpers of fear.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (laughing)
                      Stop, stop, we will waken the children.
          
          Paul lifts the bottle of fine bordeaux, pours more.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or
                      fine rare beef.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      So where is the lamb?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
          
          They both chuckle, then Paul remembers, a cloud of anxiety comes over
          him.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What's the matter?
          
              
          
                                                                          88.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We're running out of beer and other
                      supplies.
          
          She kisses him.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      The foreigners abandon us and you do
                      inventory. You are so conscientious.
          
          She kisses him again, tries to cheer him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to go out to get food.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Go out! Where?
          
                                  PAUL
                      To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No, no.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to, Tatiana, we are only as                         
                      valuable as the service we provide.                        
                                  TATIANA
                      You cannot go alone.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire
                      with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants
                      to impress me now.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          The lobby is deserted except for Gregoire now neatly dressed.
          
                      G           PAUL
                       regoire it is good to see you back to
                      work.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      Please, except my humblest apologies...
          
                                  PAUL
                      Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I
                      must go to visit my good friend George
                      Rutagunda. You know George?
          
          Gregoire nods, impressed.
          
                                                                           89.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Fetch the van.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAWN
          
          A thick mist blankets the grounds as Paul and Gregoire emerge.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      (fearful) Where are we going, sir?
          
                                  PAUL
                      For supplies, you drive.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      The fog is too heavy, sir.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Just drive, Gregoire.
          
          
          INT. VAN. DAWN
          
          They pass the gate, the policemen are asleep in the box.
          
          The van passes along the deserted main road, past a wrecked car, over
          broken glass, the fog swirls around them.
          
          Then Gregoire hits the brakes.
          
          In front of them, a makeshift barricade, long poles stretched across
          two oil drums.
          
          They wait for someone to appear from the fog: No one.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      We should go back, sir.
          
          Paul wants to agree, but can't. He opens his door.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD. DAY
          
          Paul gets out, tentative.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Hello?
          
          Nothing. He moves to the barrier, lifts the pole, places it on the
          ground, hurries back to the van.
          
          
          
                                                                           90.

                                    PAUL
                      Let's go.
          
          They drive past the barricade.
          
          The van weaves through the fog-enshrouded streets.
          
           hey slow to check road signs in the fog - on one a woman's dress,
          shredded and soaked in blood, is draped like a banner.
          
          
          EXT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAWN
          
          The fog still hangs like a cloud. As they pull up, a group of young
          Militia emerge from Toyota trucks.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      What do you want?
          
                                  PAUL
                      We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      The commander is not here.
          
                                  PAUL
                      He will be here.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      Show me your ID
          
          Paul and Gregoire hand over their ID cards. The Militia man studies
          them, then pockets the cards.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Excuse me.
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                      What?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Our cards, please.
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                      What cards?
          
                                  PAUL
                      You have our cards.
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                           91.
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                        No. But I make cards. Would you like me
                        to make you two cards?
          
                                      PAUL
                        How much?
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                        One thousand francs.
          
          Then from out of the fog, three Toyota trucks roar up. George
          Rutagunda, heavily armed, in cut-off shorts and an open shirt, his
          barrel chest laden with bandoliers, jumps out.
          
           he Militia man pulls out the ID cards, hands them back.

          Rutagunda strides over.
          
                                    GEORGE
                        Paul. My old friend.
          
          Paul climbs out, greets George, as a Militia man swings open the doors
          of the warehouse. They walk in.
          
          
          INT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY
          
          The warehouse is filled with looted televisions, artwork, cars. George
          points to the stacks of beer.
          
                                    GEORGE
                        Everything is double the price now, you
                        do understand that?
          
                                    PAUL
                        I need rice, beans, beer, and your best

                                    PAUL
                        You have no whiskey?
          
                                    GEORGE
                        No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich
                        cockroaches at the hotel, they will have
                        to do without their scotch. Anyway, I                       
                        have bled that cow enough Paul.

          Paul counts out the Rwandan francs.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What do you mean George?                                     
                                  GEORGE
                      Their money is no good to them. Soon all                     
                      the Ineysi will be dead.                                     
                                  PAUL
                           (incredulous) )                                         
                      You cannot kill them all.

                      Why not? We are half way there already.
          
          Paul's stomach heaves. He hides it, turns over the money, gets in the    
          van with Gregoire. George comes to the passenger window.                 
                                   EORGE (CONT'D)
                      Let me give you a tip my friend, our                         
                      generals in the army say 'do not go near                     
                      the Mille Collines or they will send the                     
                      Belgian soldiers back here'. But the                         
                      generals are about to leave, and we will                     
                      be in charge. It is time to butcher your                     
                      cow for the meat. (a beat)                                   
                      You can help us Paul. You have some very                     
                      important traitors at your hotel. The                        
                      politician Xavier. The liar Benedict. If                     
                      we were to get them, then maybe we could
                      let one or two cockroaches get away. You                     
                      understand, Paul.
          
          Paul says nothing, but Gregoire has been listening very carefully.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let's go.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      Take the river road back. It is clear.
          
          The van takes off.
          
          
          INT. VAN. DAWN
          
          The fog has gotten thicker. They can barely see a yard ahead.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Are you sure this is the river road?
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      I saw the sign.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           93.
          
          The van begins to bump erratically. Bump, bump, bump.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Stop. You've driven off the road.
                      You'll put us in the river.
          
          The van jerks to a halt.
          
          
          EXT. RIVER ROAD. DAWN
          
          Paul clambers out, stumbles, falls.
          
          And discovers he's looking at the face of a dead child, a young Tutsi
          girl, her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her
          own death - an African Munz's Scream.
          
          Paul clambers to his feet, sees that the van is on a road littered with
          dead bodies, men, women, children.
          
           he bumps were dead bodies, the van has driven over them.
          
          A breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet.
          
          REVEALING: a carpet of bodies, hundreds of them sprawled all along the
          road as far as Paul can see. Paul wanders stunned among misshapen
          corpses, made more ghostly by wisps of fog.
          
          Finally, Paul clambers shell-shocked back into the van.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go back! Go back!
          
          Gregoire throws the van into reverse.
          
           hey bump back over the carpet of bodies, each shake and crunch another
          horror.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL REAR DELIVERY AREA. DAY
          
          The van pulls up at the rear suppliers entrance. Paul hops out, turns
          to Gregoire.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Tell no one what you saw, do you
                      understand?
          
          Gregoire, Zozo and the porters begin unloading the van.
          
                   
          
                                                                              94.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY
          
          Paul wanders to a bench set back in a manicured grove of bushes. Beyond
          him a crowd of Rwandan refugee children play in the swimming pool,
          laughing, jumping, splashing like they were at a municipal pool in
          Central Park.
          P
          
          PAUL watches. Tears stream from his eyes, the stream grows into a
          flood, he buries his face in his hands.
          
          Then a voice.
          
                                    LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
                      Mr. Manager.
          
          Paul wipes his eyes, turns.
          
          A little boy stands behind him, holding out his arm.
          
                                  LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)
                      Mr. Manager, sir.
          
          Then Paul sees what is wrong. The boy Has a big thorn imbedded in the
          muscle of his arm. Paul studies it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      That's a big one. (pinches the thorn)
                      Here we go.
          
          Paul pulls on the thorn, the kid doesn't flinch.
          
          Paul picks him up, carries him to the pool, throws him in.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Tatiana feeds the children - rice and beans. Paul arrives.
          
                                  CHILDREN
                      Good evening, Papa.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Roger, you have no greeting for me.
          
          Roger tries to speak, struggles to mouth the words but nothing comes
          out, as though he has forgotten. Tears form in his eyes.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      There, do not worry, no tears.
          
          He hugs him, puts him back at his food, then takes Tatiana's hand,
          leads her to the door.
          
               
          
          
                                                                           95.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       (whispers) Where are we going?
          
          They slip out.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL ROOF DOOR. NIGHT
          
          Tatiana stops.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the
                       roof?
          
                                   PAUL
                       It's alright. This is the only place I
                       can find some peace.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL ROOF. NIGHT
          
          Paul slips out onto the roof. Tatiana follows. Artillery and mortar
          fire rumble in the distance. Flashes silhouette along the far hills
          above Kigali.
          
          He leads her to a blanket, a candle, two glasses and the bottle of
          wine. They sit. He opens the wine.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       (laughs) I hear we must pay for
                       everything. How much for this?
          
                                   PAUL
                       A kiss.
          
          They kiss.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       You are a very good man, Paul
                       Rusesabagina.
          
           he kisses him again.
          
                                   PAUL
                       I have a confession. When we met...
          
                                   TATIANA
                       In Ruhengeri?
          
                                   PAUL
                       Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Yes.
          
          
          
                                                                          96.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I had you transferred to Kigali.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I bribed the Minister of Health to have
                      you transferred to Kigali.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Why?
          
                                  PAUL
                      To be closer. So that I could marry you.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What was the bribe?
                           (silence)
                      What am I worth to you?
          
                                  PAUL
                      It was substantial.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Tell me what it was.
          
                                  PAUL
                      A car.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What sort of car?
          
                                  PAUL
                      What does it matter.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I want to know.
          
                                  PAUL
                      A Volkswagen.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      A Volkswagen!
          
           he slaps him playfully.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      I hope it was a new Volkswagen.
          
          She kisses him, they lie back on the roof, kiss passionately.
          
          
          
                                                                           97.

          Paul instructs the porters to clean around the entrance.
          
          The UN armored car comes up the driveway. Colonel Oliver gets out,       
          strides across the tarmac, he shakes Paul's hand.
          
                                     COLONEL OLIVER                                
                        Great news, Paul, we're going to get you
                        out of here.

          The sweetest words Paul has ever heard.

           Oliver is on the stage, all the refugee guests are crowded into the

              voice calls out.

                      Colonel, sir. Why not take us all to the                       
                      airport? We can wait there to obtain
                      visas.

                      I can't do that. Our camp at the airport
                      is overwhelmed already. We could not
                      defend you there. You are better to stay
                      here and work to get an exit visa.
          
           Oliver jumps from the stage, pushes through the crowd.                    
          Paul's POV: Odette and Jean Baptiste are silently devastated. He pushes
          through to the Colonel now surrounded by those who didn't make the         
          list.
          
                                   PAUL
                      Colonel, Odette Camundu ... she must be                        
                      on the list.
          
           Oliver shakes his head no.                                                
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      Paul, only those I called can get on the
                      trucks. I do not want to have to pull
                      people off, you understand?
          
          Paul nods yes. Tatiana arrives beside him, pulls him aside.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I will not leave without the twins.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We have to get out of here Tatiana.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please, please try one more time.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'll try but we have to leave, with or
                      without them. I want you to promise.
          
          She reluctantly nods yes.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Mr. Garindi waits nervously in the lobby.
          
          Paul arrives.
          
          
                                                                           99.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      It is dangerous to be here. The radio
                      says this is a nest of cockroaches.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I need one last favor. Go back and get
                      the twins.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      (emphatic) No, it is impossible. That
                      side of town has been destroyed in the
                      fighting. The children are dead.
          
                                  PAUL
                      How do you know?
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the
                      bodies in the street. I have to go.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will give you my house.
          
          The businessman turns back.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It's a fine house. Here is a paper.
          
          Paul spots an elegant woman carrying laundry toward the elevator. He
          runs to her.            P
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Madame Kawunda, please.
          
          Paul leads her over.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I need you to witness this signature.
                           (to the businessman)
                      Madame Kawunda is the Minister for
                      Agriculture. She is a very reliable
                      witness.
          
          Paul signs, then hands the pen to the puzzled woman.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Please witness this deed.
          
          She signs. Paul pushes the deed into the man's hand.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      There, now go and find them. They have no
                      papers. No one knows they are Tutsi. They
                      will be alive.
          
          
          
                                                                          100.
          
          The businessman heads for the door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      You must be back by 7:00a.m. tomorrow.
          
          Paul watches him go.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Seven, remember.
          
          The Mr. Garindi leaves.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. NIGHT
          
          Paul skirts the little groups of poor families bivouacked on the lawn.
          The smoke of cooking fires has replaced the Tiki lanterns. The grounds
          are a mini refugee camp.
          
          Paul joins Tatiana, Odette and Jean Baptiste who sit at a table by the
          pool.
          
                                   DETTE
                      Don't worry, Paul, we will make the next
                      list.
          
          ZOZO arrives, with beers, serves them, is about to leave. Tatiana grabs    
          him by the arm.                                                            
                                  TATIANA                                            
                      Sit with us Zozo.  
                                                      
                                  ZOZO                                               
                      No ma,am, I am too busy.   
                                              
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Zozo you are family, join us.                                  
          Zozo is shocked by this breach of protocol but sits.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      You are my dearest friends. I promise you
                      before God that I will not sleep until I
                      have you out of here. All of you.
          
          He embraces Jean Baptiste
          
                                  JEAN BAPTISTE
                      It is good that you are going, Paul,
                      because now we know we have one person
                      who will save us.
          
          Odette hugs and kisses him.
          
                                                                            101.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      We owe you our lives.
          
          Paul takes Zozo in his arms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You are my family now, Zozo, my brother.
                      I will get you out of here.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Thank you, sir.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let us remember this night and tell the
                      world that even in hell there are good
                      people.

          The lucky families are gathered: Tatiana and all her children; Xavier
          and his wife; Benedict; and others.
          
          Some of the unlucky ones peer around the door of the ballroom. A UN
          officer stands in their way.

          The UN convoy waits outside.   Tatiana waits nervously as Paul   checks
          his watch.

                                  PAUL
                      We wait until 7:00. If he is not here
                      with the twins he is not coming. We
                      leave. That was your promise. Go help the

          Paul is in a horrible mood. The refugees in the ballroom try to push by
          the UN officer. Paul joins him.

                         Zozo, tell those people to get back to
                         the ballroom. They can not be here.
          
          Zozo scampers off.

                         What are we waiting for? Come on.

          Through the doors we see the trucks being loaded.
          
          Zozo returns.

                         Sir, the others want to speak to you.
          
          Reluctant, Paul walks over to the ballroom dwellers.
          
                                     PAUL

          Paul reaches out for the letters, takes them, reads the addresses:
          President Nelson Mandela. Pope John Paul. President Clinton.

                         I have a letter, sir.
          
          Zozo hands Paul the letter. He studies the address. It reads "To the
          great man Muhammad Ali."
          
           thers crowd around.
          
                                     PAUL
                         I will get you all visas. I promise. I
                         will get you out of here.
          
          Paul's at a loss. He has to tear himself away.
          
              fraid to look back, he heads for the convoy.
          
             
          
                                                                           103.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          The last of the evacuees clamber onto the UN trucks. The children are
          on board but Tatiana waits.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Ask them to wait a little longer. For the
                      twins.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Get on the truck, Tatiana.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No.
          
          He checks his watch, then takes her in his arms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Look, our children are crying, please get
                      on the truck.
          
          Paul helps Tatiana on board. He looks toward the door.
          
          POV: The unlucky refugees are now crowded at the windows, lost souls
          watching out from their prison at the lucky ones.
          
          Paul whispers to Benedict as he boards.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK DAY
          
          Paul clambers on beside him.   He reaches Tatiana as Benedict sits
          beside her.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to stay.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No! Sit down now.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I cannot leave these people. I will wait
                      for the twins.
          
          Paul backs off. Tatiana tries to follow. Benedict grabs her.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Let go. Let me off this truck.
          
          A commotion as she tries to get up.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Let me go. Children get off.
          
          
                                                                          104.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will follow on the next plane. Go.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY.
          
          The truck starts up. Paul runs beside it, shouts to Tatiana.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I love you. Keep the children safe.
          
                                    TATIANA
                      Paul!
          
          Then another voice.
          
                                    ROGER
                      Papa! Papa!
          
          The convoy takes off down the driveway.
          
          Paul, Zozo and other refugees cluster by the door.
          
          ZOZO looks round,
          
          I
          Sees: Gregoire put a phone down.
          
          
          INT. UN JEEP. DAY
          
          UN Colonel Oliver sits next to a UN PAKISTANI DRIVER.                      
           he convoy passes looters and small groups of Militia on the road but
          proceeds unheeded.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY
          
          The room is still littered with clothes, kids drawings, the personal
          junk accumulated over four weeks.
          
          Paul tries to arrange things, then collapses on the bed, paralysed with
          doubt - Why did he do this?
          
          Then the door bangs.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Boss, sir, quick, please, come quick.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          The door springs open, Paul confronts Zozo.
          
             
          
          
                                                                           105.
          
                                  ZOZO
                           (breathless)
                      Sir, the radio, you must hear, it is on
                      the radio.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL KITCHEN. DAY
          
          Paul and Zozo burst into the kitchen. The cooks and others are
          clustered, listening to the radio.
          
                                  RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)

                                  ZOZO
                      I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
          
                                    PAUL
                      When?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      As the trucks go.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul bursts out of the kitchen - enraged.
          
          Gregoire is at the front desk. Sees Paul - understands instantly.
          
          Gregoire takes off, running for his life.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY
          
          Paul chases after him, through the door.
          
          Gregoire disappears into the thicket of trees.
          
          Paul after him.
          
          Through the trees.
          
          Gregoire, younger, faster, climbs the high wire fence.
          
          Finally, Paul reaches the fence.
          
          
          
          
                                                                            106.

          INT. JEEP TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          As the UN jeep turns a bend, Colonel Oliver SEES crowds of Interahamwe       
          swarming from beside houses, from gardens. They pull burning tires, old
          furniture, junk onto the road.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          The UN truck suddenly lurches, then slows.    The refugees from the Mille
          Collines grow alarmed.
          
                                    TATIANA
                        What's happening?
          
          
          INT. HOTEL OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul is on the fax phone, begging.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Please, General, I will give you money,
                        whiskey.

                        Please, I have money. They're driving
                        into an ambush, it's on the radio.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREET JUNCTION. DAY
          
          Swarms of crazed Militia fill the road. Gun fire breaks out.
          
          Colonel Oliver steps from the jeep, waving his pistol in the air.
          M                                                                            
           ilitia men swarm around him, push past to the truck.
          
          INSIDE THE TRUCK:
          
              MACHETE SLASHES through the canvas.
          
           hildren scream, HANDS GRAB at people.
          
          Benedict is hauled off the truck. Beaten.
          
          Tatiana protects her kids in a corner, kicking at the hands that grab
          for her.
          
          
          
                                                                          107.
          
          ON THE STREET: Xavier falls to the ground.
          
          Screams, shouts, MORE SHOTS.
          
          Oliver fights his way through to Xavier.                                   
          Oliver points his pistol.                                                  
          The crowd backs off slightly.
          
          Xavier gets to his feet.
          
          BANG - more gun fire. IMMACULATA falls, wounded in the foot.
          
          More are dragged from the trucks. Machetes flash in the sun.
          
          Then HORNS, GUNFIRE - RWANDAN SOLDIERS drive through the crowd in two
          jeeps. The crowd scatters, then re-forms as Rwandan soldiers push
          between the Militia and the refugees.
          
          As they do, another Militia gunman steps out, fires wildly at the
          refugees, but wounds A RWANDAN SOLDIER in the stomach.
          
          Suddenly fights erupt between the Militia and the soldiers.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul paces up and down, he can hear gunfire in the distance.
          
          MACHINE GUNFIRE - THEN SINGLE SHOTS.
          
          Paul jumps in the van, guns the engine, drives.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY.
          
          Paul's van speeds toward the gate.
          
          THEN - A LOUD METALLIC SCREECHING NOISE
          
          As a UN JEEP, its tires shot out, sparks cascading from wheel rims,
          screams up to the guard house.
          
          Paul slams on the brakes.
          
          The jeep is followed by the two trucks, their canvas slashed fluttering
          in the wind.
          
          Paul throws the van into reverse and clears the way.
          
          The convoy pulls up in front of the hotel.
          
          Bloody and battered, the terrified refugees fall from the trucks.
          
                      
          
          
                                                                             108.
          
          Paul and Odette run among the casualties. Then he sees them:
          
          Tatiana, clothes torn, scratches on her face.
          
          The kids screaming in terror.
          
             PAUL runs to them, grabs, kisses, weeps louder.
          
          Battered refugees everywhere, other hotel residents looking on -
          equally terrified because: They know they are doomed.
          
          Paul sees Roger, trembling, tears soak his face.
          
                                       ROGER
                         Papa! Papa!
          
          He grabs Roger up. Tatiana struggles to Paul, embraces.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Thank God you are safe.
          
          Tatiana breaks from the embrace.
          
                                     TATIANA
                         Did he bring the twins?
          
          Paul shakes his head no.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY
          
          Paul sits alone on his secluded bench in the garden.
          
              cloud of despair shrouds him.
          
          As he watches several women dip cooking pots into the pool.
          
              e hurries toward them.
          
                                     PAUL
                         What are you doing?

          P              There is no water from the pipes.
          
          PAUL heads for the front doors. He's intercepted by the two Rwandan
          policemen stationed at the gate by Bizimungu.
          
                                     GENDARME

                         I have temporarily run out of stock?

                      What is this about no water?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      It's true, sir, the water has been turned           
                      off.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul enters. Odette, Benedict watch CNN on the TV.
          
          PAUL shakes his head in disbelief.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We can still get CNN here in hell.
          
          A state department woman gives a press conference.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      The Americans are talking about us.
          
          
          ON TV:
          
                                  STATE DEPT. OFFICER
                      From the reports we have received from
                      Rwanda it appears that acts of genocide
                      have been committed.
          
                                  REPORTER
                      Excuse me, how many acts of genocide does
                      it take to declare this a genocide?
          
                                  STATE DEPT. OFFICER
                      I, ahh, there is, ahh we have
                      terminology, that has been.
          
                                                                          110.
          
                                  BRIT REPORTER
                      You haven't answered the question. How
                      many acts of genocide before your
                      government will declare this a genocide?
          
                                  STATE DEPT. OFFICER
                      I'm not prepared to, nor am I able.
          
          Everyone in the room is dumbfounded.
          
          Then Benedict begins laughing, a maniacal laugh, then he bangs on his
          chest, and hoots like a chimpanzee.
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      I've got it. I have the answer. Watch.
          
          They all stare as he begins beating his chest, and hopping about like
          an ape.
          
                                  BENEDICT (CONT'D)
                      We must become mountain gorillas. Then
                      they can put us on the endangered species
                      list. Come on, try it. They think we're
                      halfway there already.
          
          Benedict hops up onto a desk.
          
          The door flies open. It's General Bizimungu.
          
          He surveys the room, then points at Paul.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Come here.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY.
          
          Bizimungu looks terrible, an alcoholic suffering D.T.s.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Where are my supplies?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You have cockroaches dancing on tables
                      and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did
                      they drink my whiskey?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. We have no way of finding other stock
                      but I have money for you from the guests.
          
                                                                          111.
          
          Paul pulls a bundle of notes, hands them to the General.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Rwandan francs! They are only good now
                      for wiping your ass. There is nothing
                      more I can do for you people. No police.
                      No protection. You're on your own.
          
          The General storms off.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul walks through the lobby. He carries an ash tray to a trash can,
          the futile task of a dedicated hotel manager on auto-pilot. He sees a
          UN jeep pull up outside.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul meets the UN soldiers, (They are the four Ghanians who guard the
          gate). They look frightened.
          
                                  UN OBSERVER
                      The policemen have gone. What happened?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I ran out of whiskey. Please go down and
                      guard us.
          
          Then ROAR of an engine and the CRASH of splintering wood.
          
          As a battered Toyota pickup appears, it races up the driveway. The
          truck drags the wooden gatehouse on a rope behind.
          
          Crazed Militia pack the bed of the pickup.
          
          BANG, BANG, BANG. A Militia man fires a pistol into the air.
          
          The Tutsi refugees camped on the lawn flee in panic as the Militia
          truck speeds around the driveway.
          
          The Militia taunt and yell at the Tutsi refugees.
          
          The truck does a screeching turn and heads back down the driveway,
          leaving a trail of splintered wood.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Get down there and stop them, please.
          
          Now the Ghanians are really frightened.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Get down and stop them.
          
                                                                          112.
          
                                  UN SOLDIER
                      You know we cannot shoot.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What do you mean you cannot shoot?
          
                                  UN SOLDIER
                      We are peacekeepers, it is not in our
                      mandate to shoot.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Then go and pretend you are soldiers.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. NIGHT
          
          Paul and Tatiana pass the clusters of families around their cooking
          fires. They pass the pool, now just a third full. He sits her on the
          bench in the grove.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      We are almost out of water.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We are almost out of everything.
          
          He takes her hand.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      We had a good life, you and I. I want to
                      make our peace. To thank God for the time
                      we had.
          
          He kisses her, total love.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      We have to have a plan.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What sort of plan?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Our children cannot see us die first. If
                      the Militia comes, you must hurry up to
                      the roof. I will meet you there.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please do not talk like this.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We have to. If I do not come, you must
                      take them all by the hands and jump.
          
          She puts her hands to her ears. He pulls them down.
          
          
                                                                          113.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      The machete is no way to die. Promise me
                      you will do it.
          
          She cries harder and squeezes his hand in fear.
          
           uddenly, A BANG, from behind them and then above their heads a trail
          of fire - an RPG rocket - zigzags toward the hotel.
          
          A HUGE EXPLOSION on the wall, one-story beneath the roof.
          
          Paul throws Tatiana to the ground, covers her.
          S
          
           moke and concrete dust fall around them.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL STORE ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul, Zozo stand amongst the debris: a gaping hole in a wall. The room
          is covered in burned note papers, menus brochures for Sabena's two
          hotels, the Mille Collines and the Diplomat.
          
          Odette appears carrying her medical bag.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Was anyone hurt?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. It was only a storeroom.                                   
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. NIGHT
          
          Colonel Oliver arrives in his armored truck. Paul, Odette, Benedict and    
          others gather around him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      They fired a rocket at us.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Yes.   Where are the Rwandan police?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them
                      away.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you
                      this but we've heard rumors the Militia
                      are getting ready to storm the hotel.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Will you protect us.
          
          
          
          
                                                                       114.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       I can't, I don't have the men.
          
                                   VARIOUS VOICES
                       We have no one...We will be killed.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       There's one option.
          
                                     PAUL
                       What is it?
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       The rebels have fought their way into the
                       city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
                       They're willing to exchange them for you
                       all.
          
                                   ODETTE
                       Will the Hutu army agree?
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       I think so. They are in disarray now. The
                       rebels are winning, and the Hutu high
                       command are anxious to get some of their
                       men back.
          
                                   TUTSI WOMAN
                       How would we escape?
          
                                     COLONEL OLIVER                            
                       By convoy.
          
                                   XAVIER
                       This time the Militia will kill us.
          
                                   PAUL
                       They will surely kill us here. It's over
                       here. We have to take the chance.
          
                                   TUTSI WOMAN
                       No, we'll be chopped on the street.
          
                                   PAUL
                       We'll be chopped here.
          
          The crowd disperses. Colonel Oliver takes Paul aside.  
                   
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       A man came to my headquarters, asked that
                       I give you this.
          
          Colonel   Oliver hands a letter.                                     
          
                                                                          115.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)                            
                      Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two.
                      I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I
                      will have to scrounge it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I can't. I have nothing left to bribe
                      with. Can your men at the gate hold out
                      for another day?
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      No, Paul, they're afraid. They've
                      demanded to be moved back to headquarters
                      now.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Give me their uniforms. I will put people
                      at the gate, in disguise.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
                      One more day.
          
          Colonel Oliver leaves. Their is nothing more Paul can do.                  
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Tatiana is beside him. He opens the envelope, finds his makeshift house
          deed and a note.
          
                                   PAUL
                      It's from Garandi.                                             
                           (reads)
                      I am sorry. There is no hope for the
                      twins. The old lady's house has been                           
                      destroyed.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul sleeps fitfully. It is almost dawn, then he sits up.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Diplomat!
          
          Tatiana wakens, startled.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What's wrong?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to go to the Diplomat.
          
                                                                          116.
          
          
          INT. OFFICE. DAWN
          
          Paul is on the one working phone.
          
                                  PAUL
                      General, sir. I am glad to find you. I
                      have found you some supplies.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU   (O.S.)
                      Whiskey?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come
                      and I will get them for you.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU   (O.S.)
                      I'll be over.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Bring back your policemen...
          
          ...But the line is already dead.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Bizimungu's jeeps arrives at the hotel. Paul greets him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We must go to the Diplomat.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Get in.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Your police are at the gate?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      After the Diplomat!
          
          Paul clambers in the back.
          
          
          INT. JEEP TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          The jeep turns away from the Mille Collines front gate.
          
          They travel at high speed along the road. Then the driver sounds his
          horn, because...
          
          Paul sees: A large crowd of Militia marching along the road toward the
          hotel, waving machetes and sticks.
          
          
          
                                                                          117.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Where are they going?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      They can go where they want. They are in
                      charge now.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What do you mean, General?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      We have decided to move the government to
                      Gitarama.
          
                                  PAUL
                      When?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Today.
          
          
          EXT./INT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL. DAY
          
          Paul arrives into the lobby of the Diplomat. Looters have stripped the
          place bare. The convoy pulls up. General Bizimungu stands with his
          pistol out. The looters see him and disperse.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Maggots!
          
          
          INT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul enters the manager's office, followed by the General. It has been
          stripped clean, except for the safe, which is pock-marked with bullet
          strikes.
          
          
          
           LOSE ON: Paul: he sees a big problem. The dial is damaged.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Do your work.
          
          Paul goes to the safe and turns the dials, tries the handle - nothing.
          It is incredibly hot, and Paul is soaked with nervous perspiration, he
          takes off his jacket.
          
                                  PAUL
                      It might be damaged, General.
          
          Bizimungu's look says: it better not be for your sake.
          
          
          
                                                                            118.
          
          Paul starts again, turns the dials more carefully, tries and opens the
          safe door. CLICK.
          
          He pulls it open, sees six bottles of Glenfiddich, four bottles of VSOP
          brandy.
          
          Bizimungu is joyous as Paul hands him a bottle
          
          Bizimungu sits on a window ledge, takes a swig.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Here. (offers) To celebrate.
          
          PAUL takes a swig.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
                      You know what the Scottish call it?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on
                      a tour once of the finest single malt
                      distillery in the world. Have you ever
                      been to Scotland?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No, sir.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I
                      wonder - will I ever go back? What do you
                      think?
          
          
          
                                  PAUL
                      I hope we all get to do many things. Can
                      we go now?
          
          The soldier arrives with a box. He whispers to Bizimungu.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      (to the soldier) Pack those carefully,
                      put them in my jeep, and guard them.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (looses his cool)
                      Please, General, call and put your
                      policemen back at the gate.
          
          The soldier packs the bottles. Bizimungu pours into Paul's cup.
          
                                                                  119.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am going to do you a great favor.
                      (studies glass) I am going to take you
                      with us to Gitarama.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You cannot go back to the hotel. The
                      crazy men are going there now. Better to
                      come with me.
          
          Paul is now terrified.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Militia are at the hotel?! We must go
                      back now, General, please, for my family.
          
          Bizimungu, now tipsy, drinks more.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      We are better here.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (desperate, forceful)
                      Listen, you need me.
          
          Bizimungu laughs.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      You are a marked man.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      How so.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Americans, and the UN they have you
                      as a war criminal. You are on a list.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am on a list! What list?
          
                                  PAUL
                      When the Europeans left, their soldiers
                      gathered lists.
          
          Bizimungu grabs Paul.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You lie.
          
          
                                                                  120.
          
                                  PAUL
                      If you do not help me, you will stay on
                      that list.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I committed no war crimes.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Who will tell them? You need me to tell
                      how you helped the hotel. The others who
                      have gone, they blame you for all their
                      misfortune. They say you led the
                      massacres.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      (nervous now) I led no massacres.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You think they will believe you?
          
                                   ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You will tell them the truth.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (defiant)
                      I will do nothing unless you help me now.
          
          Bizimungu reaches for his pistol.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      What are you going to do, shoot me? It
                      will be a blessing. Go ahead shoot. I
                      will pay you to shoot my family. You can
                      do nothing to me!
          
          Bizimungu jumps up, grabs Paul, pulls him.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You will tell them I did nothing.
          
          
          EXT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL. DAY
          
          Paul and Bizimungu rush out to the jeeps.
          
          
          INT. JEEP TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          Paul almost overcome with anxiety. Bizimungu worried.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Militia swarm around the front of the hotel.
          
          
          
                                                                             121.
          
          The jeeps race through, scattering them. They screech to a halt.
          Several refugees sit, huddled and battered. Bizimungu jumps out,
          snatches an A.K. from a soldier, fires in the air.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Get back! (to his soldiers) Get them out
                      of here.
          
          PAUL does not wait.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul races into the hotel, past frightened refugees who flee.
          
          Then Paul sees a face he recognizes.
          
          It's Gregoire with the Militia! Paul ducks into the stairway.
          
          IN THE STAIRWELL
          
          He leaps the stairs four at a time.
          
          He makes it to the third floor, pushing past frightened refugees who
          race down the stairs.
          
          ON THE THIRD FLOOR
          
          He runs straight into a bunch of young Militia.
          
                                  MILITIAMEN
                      Rusesabagina. Show us Rusesabagina.
          
          They shove Paul along the corridor.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
          
                                  PAUL
                      They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
          
          The killers race off.    Paul gets to his feet and runs.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Paul bursts in.    The place is a mess. And it's empty!
          
                                  PAUL
                      Oh God, please Lord.
          
          IN THE CORRIDOR
          
          He careens out of the room.
          
          
                                                                           122.
          
          And sees Gregoire coming with a group of Militia.
          
                                   GREGOIRE
                       That's him. That's Rusesabagina!
          
          They charge toward Paul.
          
          Then a roar of gunfire. The ceiling and walls around Gregoire explode.
          General Bizimungu's men run up with weapons drawn.
          
                                   HUTU SOLDIER
                       Get out, or I'll shoot you.
          
          Paul rushes to the stairs.
          
          More gunfire echoes (soldiers clearing the Militia).
          
          AT THE STAIRS - Paul races upward, falls, pushes past others struggling
          to get down.
          
          AT THE ROOF - now, there are clumps of refugees who have fled up there,
          including Xavier who huddles in a corner.
          
                                   PAUL
                       Tatiana! Oh God. Have you seen Tatiana?
          
          Paul runs to the edge of the roof, looks over.
          
          SEES: bodies -   women, and children, still, on the ground beneath, by a
          row of hedge.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      (screams in agony)
                   TATIANA!
          
          The bodies move, look up, it's not them. It's refugees hiding. Paul,
          delirious with fear, runs along the parapet.
          
          BELOW he sees soldiers herding the Militia.
          
          He runs back to the stairs.
          
          INSIDE THE STAIRCASE: He jumps four stairs at a time.
          
          INSIDE THE CORRIDOR: Soldiers are chasing off the Militia.
          
          TO HIS ROOM: Paul staggers in, crazed with fear. He looks under the
          bed.
          
          INTO THE BATHROOM - empty.
          
          He's about to run out again, sees the connecting door to the adjoining
          hotel room is slightly open.
          
          
          
                                                                             123.
          
          INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM: It's empty, then A WHIMPER.
          
          FROM THE BATHROOM, he moves in, cautious.
          
          IN THE BATHROOM: Nothing. He moves over, pulls back the shower curtain.
          
          Reveals: A cluster of women and children, the older ones holding hands
          over the mouths of the younger ones. And there at the back: Tatiana and
          his kids.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It's alright, they're gone.
          
          Tears, hugs, women tremble.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAWN
          
          The grey of dawn, before the sunrise.
          
          Colonel Oliver in his jeep leads a convoy of UN trucks past the guard      
          house and Bizimungu's police and up the drive.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          THE UN TRUCKS
          
          Parked in front of the hotel. Tutsi refugees file up and are helped on
          board by UN soldiers.
          
          Paul helps Tatiana and the children onto a truck.
          
          An ARGUMENT breaks out towards the back of the convoy. Paul rushes
          toward Xavier and Benedict who argue.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      They should go one truck at a time. When
                      the first truck gets through to the
                      airport, then the others will follow.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We can't wait. We all go together or not
                      at all.
          
          Paul takes matters into his own hands. He locks the doors of the hotel.
          There is no going back.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It is time to leave. The Mille Collines
                      is closed.
          
          Paul climbs onto the truck. The others follow, some reluctantly.
          
          Colonel Oliver gives the signal.

          The trucks take off down the driveway.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          Paul now at the front of the truck
          
          WATCHES out through a slice in the canvas.
          
          SEES, the convoy pull out of the Mille Collines.
          
          They travel along the road.
          
          Turn a corner, and the truck slows ...
          
          PAUL SEES: a great mass of Hutus fill the road:
          
          Militia, kids, soldiers discarding uniforms.
          
          No longer a mob, but a crush of Hutu refugees now fleeing toward them,
          fleeing the advancing of the rebel army.
          
          A crowd of Militia men wave their arms, shout at the trucks.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Don't stop. Push through.
          
          The driver reluctantly speeds up.
          
          A break in the mass of Hutu refugees.
          
          Then GUN FIRE ahead.
          
          Children begin crying, it becomes infectious, spreading to Paul's
          children, some of the women.
          
          Then ahead, a gang of Militia men break from the bushes beside the
          road.
          
          They're running fast toward the truck, some carry rifles.
          
          There's more gunfire behind.
          
          The Militia are almost upon them now.
          
          Colonel Oliver has his pistol drawn.                                      
                                    COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)                         
                      Keep going.
          
          The Militia are at the truck.
          
          But they run STRAIGHT PAST!
          
            
          
                                                                          125.
          
          As a platoon of Tutsi rebel soldiers (in bush camouflage and   red and
          blue headbands) burst from the brush.
          
          Pursuing, careful, professional.
          
                                   PAUL
                       It's the rebels.
          
          The crying stops. Silent disbelief.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                       We've made it!
          
          Cheering breaks out. Children frightened again by the sudden euphoria
          break into cries of joy.
          
          A rebel soldier waves his AK 47 in the air.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI SOCCER STADIUM. DAY
          
          The trucks crawl into the chaos of the stadium, a mass of refugees, the
          wounded, lost children, abandoned old people, hundreds crammed
          together.
          
          Paul, Tatiana, and the others clamber off the trucks. They hug, cry, an
          outpouring of relief. Then Tatiana spots someone among the crowds.
          
          She rushes over.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Have you seen my sister Fedens?
          
          Heads shak `no'. Tatiana moves on, more frantic, pushing through the
          crowds.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Two little girls, twins, an old woman had
                       them.
          
          More `nos'
          
          Now she's desperate, pushing, tripping through the crowds, and around
          her we see others doing the same, then
          
                                      OGER (O.C.)
                       Mama, mama.
          
          He reaches her, pulls at her dress.
          
                                     ROGER
                       Mama, wait.
          
          She takes his hand.
          
          
                                                                             126.
          
                                  ROGER
                      No, mama, look.
          
          Tatiana turns .... and sees Paul carrying the twins in his arms.
          
          She squeals with joy, runs to him, snatches one from his arms.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Oh, my babies.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Anais, it is so good to see you.
          
                                    CARINE

                      And I'm Anais!
          
          Their laughter mix with tears of joy among the crushing mass of            
          survivors.

          EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAY
          The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the
          French call cow country).
          We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house;

          CHAPTER ONE

          "ONCE UPON A TIME IN...

          NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE"
          This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one;

          "1941
          One year into the German
          occupation of France".
          The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread
          about.
          The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe
          up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by
          sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last
          year, or just started today.

          JULIE
          One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on
          the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a
          noise, moving the sheet aside she see's;

          JULIE'S POV:
          A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to
          the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the
          back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up
          over the hill on the country road leading to their farm.

          JULIE
          Pappa.
          The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder,
          and see's the Germans approaching.
          The FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home,
          followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans
          approaching.
          The Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

          FARMER
          Go back inside and shut the door.

          

          

          

          

          IL

          FARMER
          (to Julie)
          Julie, get me some water from the pump
          to wash up with, then get inside with
          your mother.
          The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a
          basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out
          splashing into the basin.
          The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping
          away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off
          his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for
          a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may
          very well be the end.
          Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window
          sill.

          JULIE
          Ready Pappa.

          FARMER
          Thank you darling, now go inside and
          take care of your mother. Don't run.
          Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her.
          As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window
          sill with the water basin...
          .The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER.
          The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his
          front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from
          his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one
          automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist
          Party come to a halt on his property.
          We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like
          the Farmer.
          The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at
          attention next to them.
          The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door
          for his superior.
          The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN;

          NAZI OFFICER
          This is the property of Perrier LaPadite?

          

          

          

          

          3

          NAZI DRIVER
          Yes heer Colonel.
          The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying
          in his left hand
           n d

          OFFICER
          Herman, until I summon you, I am to be
          left alone.

          NAZI DRIVER
          As you wish Heer Col.
          The S.S. COLONEL yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH;

          NAZI OFFICER
          Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite?

          FARMER
          I am Perrier LaPadite.
          The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides,
          and says in French with a smile on his face;

          NAZI OFFICER
          It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur
          LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of
          the S.S.
          COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand.
          The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it.

          PERRIER
          How may I help you?

          COL LANDA
          I was hoping you could invite me inside
          your home and we may have a discussion.

          INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY
          The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor
          the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap,
          inside the Frenchman's home.
          Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife,
          and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling
          in his direction.
          The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door.

          

          

          

          

          VA

          PERRIER
          Colonel Landa, this is my family.
          The S.S. COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the
          French Farmers Wife...

          COL LANDA
          Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame,
          at your service.
          He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess
          hand...

          COL LANDA
          please excuse my rude intrusion on your
          routine.

          FARMERS WIFE
          Don't be ridiculous, heer Col.
          While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her
          eyes, The S.S. Colonel says;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have
          heard in the village about your family
          are all true. Your wife is a beautiful
          woman.
          His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters.

          COL.LANDA

          (CON' T )
          And each of your daughters is more lovely
          then the last.

          PERRIER
          Merci. Please have a seat.
          The Farmer offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden
          dinner table. The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer,
          and lowers himself into the chair. Placing his grey S.S. cap on
          the table, and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his
          feet.
          The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says;

           PERRIER
          Charlotte, would you be so good as to get
          The Colonel some wine?

          

          

          

          

          COL LANDA
          Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no
          wine. This being a dairy farm one would
          be safe in assuming you have milk?

          CHARLOTTE
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          Then milk is what I prefer.

          CHARLOTTE
          Very Well.
          The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box,
          and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel.
          The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down
          LOUDLY on the wooden table.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur, to both your family, and your
          cows, I say; Bravo.

          PERRIER
          Merci.

          COL LANDA
          Please, join me at your
          table.

          PERRIER
          Very well.
          The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from
          The Nazi.
          The Women remain standing.
          Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of

          CONFIDENTIALLY;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to
          discuss,' would be better discussed in
          private. You'll notice, I left my men
          outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them,
          could you ask your lovely ladies to step
          outside.

          PERRIER
          You are right.

          

          

          

          

          G.

          PERRIER
          (to his women)
          Charlotte, would you take the girls
          outside. The Colonel and I need to have
          a few words.
          The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her
          daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them.
          The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers
          humble home.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform
          you I've exhausted the extent of my
          French. To continue to speak it so
          inadequately, would only serve to
          embarrass me. However, I've been lead
          to believe you speak English quite well?

          PERRIER
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          Well, it just so happens, I do as well.
          This being your house, I ask your
          permission to switch to English, for the
          remainder of the conversation?

          PERRIER
          By all means.
          They now speak ENGLISH;

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very
          familiar with you, and your family.
          I have no way of knowing if you are
          familiar with who I am. Are you aware
          of my existence?
          The Farmer answers;

          PERRIER
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          This is good. Are you aware of the job
          I've been ordered to carry out in France?

          

          

          

          

          I

          PERRIER
          Yes.
          The Colonel drinks more milk.

          COL LANDA
          Please tell me what you've heard?

          PERRIER
          I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in
          charge of rounding up the Jews left in
          France who are ether hiding, or passing
          for Gentile.
          The S.S.Colonel smiles.

          COL LANDA
          The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better
          himself.

          PERRIER
          But the meaning of your visit, pleasant
          though it is, is mysterious to me.
          The Germans looked through my house nine
          months ago for hiding Jews, and found
          nothing.

          COL LANDA
          I'm aware of that, I read the report on
          this area. But like any enterprise,
          when under new management, there's
          always a slight duplication of efforts.
          Most of it being a complete waste of time,
          but needs to be done nevertheless.
          I just have A few questions Monsieur
          LaPadite, if you can assist me with
          answers, my department can close the
          file on your family.
          Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he
          takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black
          fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and
          referring to it;

          COL LANDA
          Now before the occupation there were
          four Jewish families in this area, all
          dairy farmers like yourself.
          The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins,
          and The Dreyfus's, is that correct?

          

          

          

          

          8,

          PERRIER
          To my knowledge those were the Jewish
          families among the dairy farmers.
          - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if
          I smoked my pipe?
          Looking up from his papers.

          COL LANDA
          Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your
          house, make yourself comfortable.
          The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the
          fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the
          fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi
          guest.
          As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match
          to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel
          studies the papers in front of him.

          COL LANDA
          Now according to these papers, all
          the Jewish families in this area have
          been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis.
          Somewhere in the last year it would appear
          they have vanished.
          Which leads me to the conclusion that
          they've ether made good their escape,
          or someone is very successfully hiding
          them.
          (looking up from
          his papers, across
          the table at The

          FARMER)
          What have you heard about The Dreyfusis
          Monsieur LaPadite?

          PERRIER
          Only rumors -

          COL LANDA
          - I love rumors! Facts can be so
          misleading, where rumors, true or false
          are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite,
          what rumors have you heard regarding
          The Dreyfusis?
          The Farmerlooks at Landa.

          

          

          

          

          I.

          COL LANDA
          Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want
          to hear what the rumors are, not who told
          them to you.
          The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe.

          PERRIER
          Again, this is just a rumor - but we
          heard the Dreyfusis had made there way
          into Spain.

          COL LANDA
          So the rumors you've heard have been of
          escape?

          PERRIER
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis
          friendly?
          As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his
          chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the
          floorboards revealing;

          FIVE HUMAN BEINGS
          lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human
          beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the
          dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The
          Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the
          only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to
          exterminate them.

          PERRIER
          We were families in the same community,
          in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say
          we were friends, but members of the same
          community, we had common interest.
          The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves
          to the next question.

          COL LANDA
          Having never met the Dreyfusis, would
          you confirm for me the exact members of
          the household and their names?

          

          

          

          

          10.

          PERRIER
          There were five of them.
          The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram...
          her brother, Bob ...

          COL LANDA
          - How old is Bob?

          PERRIER
          Thirty - thirty one?

          COL LANDA
          Continue.

          PERRIER
          And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna.

          COL LANDA
          Ages of the children?

          PERRIER
          Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna,
          was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really
          sure.

          CUT TO

          UXT - DAIRY FARM - DAY
          The Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry off the
          clothes line.
          They can't hear anything going on inside.
          e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters.

          SACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER

          COL LANDA
          Well I guess that should do it.
          Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his
           ttache case.
          the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe.

          COL LANDA
          However, before I go, could I have another
          glass of your delicious milk?

          

          

          

          
          it.

          PERRIER
          But of course.
          Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the
          aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass,
          German Officer talks.

          COL LANDA
          Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the
          nickname the people of France have given
          me?

          PERRIER
          I have no interest in such things.

          COL LANDA
          But you are aware of what they call me?

          PERRIER
          I'm aware.

          COL LANDA
          What are you aware of?

          PERRIER
          That they call you, "The Jew Hunter".

          Precisely! Now I understand your
          trepidation in repeating it.
          Before he was assassinated, Heydrich
          apparently hated the moniker the good
          people of Prague bestowed on him.
          Actually why he would hate the name,
          "The Hangman", is baffling to me
          It would appear he did everything in
          his power to earn it. But I, on the
          other hand, love my unofficial title,
          precisely because I've earned it.
          As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize
          with the french farmer.

          COL LANDA
          The feature that makes me such a effective
          hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most
          German soldiers, I can think like a jew.
          where they can only think like a German,
          or more precisely, a German soldier.
          Now if one were to determine what attribute
          the German people share with a beast, it
          would be the cunning and predatory instinct
          of a hawk.

          Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips -
          smell - physical strength - penis size.
          But, if one were to determine what attributes
          the jews share with a beast, it would be
          that of the rat.
          Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda
          have said pretty much the same thing.
          Where our conclusions differ, is I don't
          consider the comparison a insult.
          Consider for a moment, the world a rat
          lives in. It's a hostile world indeed.
          If a rat were to scamper through your
          front door right now, would you greet it
          with hostility?

          PERRIER
          I suppose I would.

          COL LANDA
          Has a rat ever done anything to you to
          create this animosity you feel toward
          them?

          PERRIER
          Rat's spread disease, they bite people -

          COL LANDA
          - Unless some fool is stupid enough to
          try and handle a live one, rats don't
          make it a practise of biting human beings.
          Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague,
          but that was some time ago. In all your
          born days, has a rat ever caused you to
          be sick a day in your life? I purpose to
          you, any disease a rat could spread,
          a squirrel could equally carry.
          Yet I assume you don't share the same
          animosity with squirrels that you do with
          rats, do you?

          PERRIER
          No.

          COL LANDA
          Yet, they are both rodent's, are they
          not? And except for the fact that one
          has a big bushy tail, while the other
          has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin,
          they even rather look alike, don't they?

          It is a interesting thought,
          beer Colonel.

          COL LANDA
          However, interesting as the thought may
          be, it makes not one bit of difference
          to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper
          through your door, this very minute,
          would you offer it a saucer of your
          delicious milk?

          PERRIER
          Probably not.

          COL LANDA
          I didn't think so. You don't like them.
          You don't really know why you don't like
          them. All you know is, you find them
          repulsive.
          (let's the

          METAPHOR
          sink in)
          What a tremendously hostile world a rat
          must endure. Yet, not only does he
          survive, he thrives. And the reason for
          this, is because our little foe has a
          instinct for survival and presavation
          second to none. And that Monsieur, is
          what a jew shares with a rat.
          Consequently, a German soldier, conducts
          a search of a house suspected of hiding
          jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks
          in the barn, he looks in the attic,
          he looks in the cellar - he looks
          everywhere, he would hide. But there are
          many places it would never occur to a
          hawk to hide. However the reason the
          Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria,
          and placed me in French cow country today,
          is because it does occur to me. Because
          I'm aware what tremendous feats human
          beings are capable of once they abandon
          dignity.

          The Jew Hunter, removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings.

          The other mistake the German soldier
          make is their severe handling of the
          citizens who give shelter and aid to
          the Jews. These citizens are not enemies
          of the state. They are simply confused
          people, trying to make some sense out of
          the madness war creates.
          These citizens do not need punishing.
          They simply need to be reminded of their
          duty in war time.
          Let's use you as a example Monsieur
          LaPadite. In this war, you have found
          yourself in the middle of a conflict
          that has nothing to do with yourself,
          your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet,
          here you are.
          So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose
          a question. In this time of war, what is
          your number one duty? Is it to fight the
          Germans in the name of France to your
          last breath? Or, is it to harass the
          occupying army to the best of your
          ability? Or, is it to protect the poor
          unfortunate victims of warfare who can
          not protect themselfs?
          Or, is your number one duty in this time
          of bloodshed, to protect those very
          beautiful women who constitute your
          family?
          The Colonel lets the last statement stand.

          COL LANDA
          That was a question Monsieur LaPadite.
          In this time of war, What do you consider
          your number one duty?

          PERRIER
          To protect my family.

          COL LANDA
          Now, my job dictates, that I must have
          my men enter your home, and conduct a
          thorough search, before I can officially
          cross your families name off my list.

          And if there are any irregularities to be
          found, rest assured, they will be.
          That is unless, you have something to tell
          me that will make the conducting of a
          search unnecessary.

          (PAUSE)
          I might add also, that any information
          that makes the preforming of My duty
          easier, will not be met with punishment.
          Actually quite the contrary, it will be
          met with reward.
          And that reward will be, your family
          will cease to be harassed in anyway,
          by the German military during the rest
          of our occupation of your country.

          opponent.

          no shelter, no shoes, who's just witnessed

          She may not survive the night. And after
          word spreads about what happened today,
          it's highly unlikely she will find any
          willing farmers to extend her aid.
          If I had to guess her fate, I'd say she'll
          probably be turned in by some neighbour.
          Or, she'll be spotted by some German
          soldier. Or, we'll find her body in the

          They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          HITLER
          How much more of these jew swine
          must I endure? They butcher my men
          like they were fish bait! This pack
          of filthy degenerates, are doing what
          the Russian army didn't, and Patton's
          army couldn't. Turning soldiers of
          The Third Reich, into superstitious
          old women!

          GERMAN GENERAL
          Just the cowards among them mine
          Fuhrer.
          Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist.

          HITLER
          No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard
          the rumors myself! Solders of The Third
          Reich, who have brought the world to
          there knee`s, now pecking and clucking
          like chickens. Do you know the latest
          rumor they've conjured up, in their fear
          induced delirium? The one that beats
          my boys with a bat. The one they call
          "The Bear Jew"...is a Golem.
          A avenging jew angel, conjured up by
          a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans!

          GENERAL
          Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers
          gossip, no one really believes The
          Bear Jew is a golem.

          HITLER
          Why not? They seem to be able to elude
          capture like a aberration.
          They seem to be able to appear and
          disappear at will.

          

          

          

          

          Z}.

          HITLER

          (CON'T)
          You want to prove their flesh and
          blood? Then BRING THEM TO ME!
          I will hang them naked, by their
          heels, from the eiffel tower!
          And then throw their bodies in
          the sewers, for the rats of Paris
          to feast!
          The Fuhrer sits down at the table to compose himself, and
          wipe his greasy black hair out of his face.

          HITLER

          (DISGUSTED)
          The Bear Jew.
          He hits the button on the intercom on his desk.

          HITLER

          KLIEST1
          KLIEST VOICE comes out of the intercom;

          KLIEST'S VOICE(OS)
          Year mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          I have a order I want relayed to all
          German soldiers stationed in France.
          The Jew degenerate known as The Bear
          Jew, hence forth, is never to be
          referred to as The Bear Jew again.
          We will cease to aid the Americans
          any longer in there attempt to
          undermine the German soldier psyche.
          Did you get that Kliest?

          KLIEST'S VOICE(OS)
          Yes mine Fubrer. Do you still wish
          to see Private Butz?

          HITLER
          Who and what is a private Butz?

          KELIST'S VOICE(OS)
          He's the soldier you wanted to see
          personally. His squad was ambushed
          by Lt.Raines Jews. He was it's only
          survivor.

          HITLER
          Indeed I do want to see him, thank
          you for reminding me. Send him in.

          EXT - FRENCH WOODS -- DAY

          CU FACE OF DEAD GERMAN SOLDIER
          His head lies on the ground horizontal. A HAND reaches into
          FRAME, KNOCKS aside the dead German patriots helmet, and
          grabs a handful of the cadavers blonde hair. A LARGE KNIFE
          ENTERS FRAME, and begins SLICING ALONG THE HAIRLINE.
          This process is called SCALPING.
          After SLICING is complete, the SCALP easily peels off like a
          banana.

          GERMAN PRISONERS PVT.BUTZ AND SGT.RACHTMAN
          on their knees, hands behind there heads.
          Private Butz NARRATES the scene in GERMAN SUBTITLED into

          ENGLISH;

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          Werner and I were the only ones left
          alive after the ambush. While one man
          guarded us, the rest removed the hair.
          All The Basterds wore German scalps
          tied to their belts.

          CU SCALPS
          hanging from belts.

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          They not only took valuables...

          WE SEE QUICK CUTS OF
          Rings, Weapons, Iron Cross, and somebody digging out a Gold
          Tooth with a knife, being removed from Dead Germans.

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          ..They also took their identification
          papers.

          CU IDENTIFICATION PAPERS
          taken from the inside pocket of a dead German uniform.

          BASTERD PFC.UTIVICH
          flips through the I.D. papers till he gets to the page that
          contains the German soldiers, name, statistics, and photo.

          PFC.UTIVICH
          Sigfried Muller.

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          .and tore out the identification page.
          Utivich RIPS the page out, and sticks it in his pocket.
          Tossing the torn book on the dead, scalpless body.

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          ...They then removed their boots...

          CU GERMAN COMBAT BOOTS
          laces untied.. .boot pulled off...

          SOCKS
          removed, reveling dead bare feet...

          BASTERDS
          tossing the boots off a hill.

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          Throwing them away from the bodies...

          DEAD GERMANS
          scalps removed from their heads, pink bare feet...

          PVT.BUTZ(VO)
          The Basterds, took their lives, their
          hair, their valuables, their identity,
          and finally their dignity in death.
          True that. The sight of the dead soldiers with bare feet
          does rob the tableaux of a certain dignity, that is normally
          felt in battlefield shots.

          Continue.

          BACK TO THE BASTERDS
          Aldo screams to The Basterd who's guarding the two German
          prisoners.

          LT.ALDO
          Hey Hirschberg, send that kraut
          sarge over.

          BASTERD PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          KICKS Sgt.Rachtman in the back.

          

          

          

          
          zw.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          You! Go!
          Sgt.Rachtman is a little slow to respond. So Hirschberg
          grabs him by the hair, YANKS him to his feet, and KICKS him
          in the ass, sending him on his way.
          Most of The Bastreds sit in a circle, Indian style, with
          Aldo in the middle.
          As Sgt.Rachtman walks towards this circle of Basterds,
          A OFF SCREEN LITERARY NARRATOR (not Pvt.Butz) speaks over
          the SOUNDTRACK in ENGLISH;

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Sgt.Werner Rachtman has seen many
          interrogations since Germany decided
          it should rule Europe. But this is
          the first time he's ever been on the
          wrong end of the exchange.
          It's always been his belief, only a
          weakling, in mind, body, and spirt
          complies with the enemy under threat
          of consequence.
          As Werner watched men cry like women,
          pleadingly offer their knowledge, in
          exchange for their worthless lives,
          he made a vow to himself.
          If his role is to die in this conflict.
          When they put him under the earth, his
          dignity would be buried with him.
          For in the other world, the gods only
          respect the ones they test first.
          Well Sgt, this is your test.
          And the gods are watching.
          The captured German Sgt, enters the circle of Basterds,
          stands straight before the sitting southern Lieutenant, and
          salutes his captor.

          SGT.RACHTMAN

          (ENGLISH)
          Sgt.Werner Rachtman.
          Aldo returns the salute, looking up at him.

          LT.ALDO
          Lt.Aldo Raine, pleased to meet cha.
          You know what sit down means Werner?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Yes.

          LT.ALDO
          Then sit down.

          

          

          

          

          2.5.
          The German Sgt does.

          LT.ALDO
          Hows your English Werner? Cause if
          need be, we gotta a couple fellas
          can translate.
          Aldo points at one of The Basterds in the circle,

          CPL.WILHELM WICKI.

          LT.ALDO
          Wicki there, a Austrian Jew, got the
          fuck outta Saltzberg, while the
          gettin was good. Became American,
          got drafted, and came back to give
          y'all what for.
          Then Aldo points to another Basterd. A big scary looking
          Basterd, in a German Sgt's uniform, named, SGT.HUGO STIGLITZ

          LT.ALDO
          And another one over there, you
          might be familiar with, Sgt.Hugo
          Stiglitz. Heard of 'em.
          The two German Sgt's look at each other.

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Everybody in the German army's heard
          of Hugo Stiglitz.
          The Basterds laugh, a couple pat Hugo on the back.
          The NARRATOR comes back on the SOUNDTRACK.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's
          celebrity among German soldiers
          is simple.
          WE SEE A PHOTO OF HUGO on the front page of the Nazi version
          of Stars and Stripes (the military newspaper).

          NARRATOR(VO)
          As a German enlisted man, he killed
          thirteen Gestapo officers, mostly
          Majors.

          WE SEE THE MILITARY PHOTOS OF ALL THIRTEEN GESTAPO OFFICERS.

          

          

          

          

          ZC.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Instead of putting him up against a
          wall, the High Command decided to
          send him back to Berlin, to be made
          a example of.
          Hugo in chains, being put in a lone troop truck, part of a
          prison convoy, enroute to Berlin.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          Needless to say, once The Basterds
          heard about him, he never got there.

          EXT- FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
          The Basterds AMBUSH the prison convoy, killing everybody.
          They walk to the back of the troop truck, inside Hugo in
          chains, stares back at them.

          LT.ALDO
          Sgt.Hugo Stiglitz?
          Hugo nods.

          LT. ALDO
          I'm Lt.Aldo Raine, and these are
          The Basterds. Ever heard of us?
          Hugo nods his head, yes.

          LT.ALDO
          We just wanna say, we're a big fan
          of your work. When it comes to killin
          Nazi's, I think you show great talent,
          and I pride myself on havin a eye for
          that kind of talent. But your status
          as a Nazi killer, is still amateur.
          We all came here to see, if you wanna go pro?

          BACK TO THEBASTERD CIRCLE.

          LT.ALDO
          Now Werner, I'm gonna assume you know
          who we are?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          Aldo the Apache.
          The circle of Basterds giggle.

          

          

          

          

          Z7.

          LT.ALDO
          Well Werner, if you heard of us, you
          probably heard, we ain't in the
          prisoner takin business. We in the
          killin Nazi business. And cousin,
          business is boomin.
          The Basterds laugh.

          LT. ALDO
          Now that leaves two ways we can play
          this out. Either kill ya, or let ya
          go. Now weather or not you gonna
          leave this circle alive, depends
          entirely on you.
          Aldo takes out a map of the area, and lays it out in front
          of his prisoner.

          LT.ALDO
          Up the road a piece, there's a
          orchard. 'sides you, we know there's
          another kraut patrol fuckin around
          here somewhere. Now if that patrol
          were to have any crackshots, that
          orchard, would be a goddamn snipers
          delight. Now if you ever wanna eat
          a sauerkraut sandwich again, you
          gotta show me on this map, where
          they are, you gotta tell me how many
          they are, and you gotta tell me,
          what kinda artillery they carrying
          with 'em?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          You can't expect me to divulge
          information that would put German
          lives in danger?

          LT.ALDO
          well, Werner that's where your wrong.
          Because that's exactly what I expect.
          I need to know about Germans hidin
          in trees? And you need to tell me?
          And you need to tell me, right now?
          Now take your finger, and point out
          on this map, where this partys bein
          held, how manys comin, and what they
          brought to play with?
          Werner site, head held high, back straight, chin up, every
          inch the German hero facing death.

          

          

          

          

          2S.

          SGT.WERNER
          F I respectfully refuse, sir.
          Aldo jerks his thumb behind him.

          LT.ALDO
          You see that ole boy battin rocks?
          WE RACK FOCUS to a one of The Basterds not in the circle.
          He's wearing a wife beater, and power hitting stones
          with a baseball bat.
          Werners eyes go to the ballplayer.

          LT.ALDO
          That's Sgt.Donny Donowitz. But you
          might know him better by his nickname,
          The Bear Jew. Now if you heard of
          Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about
          The Bear Jew?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          I heard.

          LT.ALDO
          What did you hear?

          SGT.RACHTMAN
          He beats German soldiers with a club.

          LT.ALDO
          He bashes their brains in with a
          baseball bat, what he does.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          back to us, still haven't seen his face. He Babe Ruths a
          rock soaring into the atmosphere.

          LT. ALDO
          Now Werner, I'm gonna ask you one
          last-goddamn-time, and if you still,
          "respectfully refuse", I'm callin The
          Bear Jew over here, and he's gonna take
          that big bat of his, and he's gonna
          beat your ass to death with it.
          Now take your wennersitnitzel lickin
          finger, and point out on this map
          what I want to know.

          SGT.RACHTMAN

           Instead of getting mad, The Basterds burst out LAUGHING.

          Aldo says to Werner, with a giggle in his voice;

          LT.ALDO
          Actually Werner, we're all tickled
          ya said that. Frankly, watchin Donny
          beat Nazi's,to death, is the closest

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          Good for you son. Kill one of those
          Nazi basterds for me, will ya?

          DONNY
          That's the idea, Mr.Goorowitz.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          What can I do you for, Donny?

          DONNY
          I need a baseball bat.
          The store owner leads him to a basket with eight bats init.
          Donny starts going through them without saying anything.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          You gettin your little brother a
          present before you ship out?
          Donny, concentrating on the bats, not looking up;

          DONNY
          No.
          Donny's "no", silences the gabby Goorowitz. He seems to
          settle on one, feeling it's weight in his hands.

          DONNY
          Can I try this one on for size, outside?

          

          

          

          

          31.
          Extending his arm;

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          Be my guest.
          The phone rings.

          MR.GOOROWITZ
          I'll get that, you go right ahead.
          The proprietor answers the phone, and gets into a
          conversation with his OFF SCREEN Mother.
          Donny walks outside, WE STAY IN STORE, but can see him
          clearly through the stores big picture window.
          However, Mr.Goorowitz instinctively, turns his back to Donny
          to speak with his mother.
          Donny starts swinging the bat. It's pretty obvious he's
          pantomiming beating somebody to death with it. Then the
          he starts yelling;

          DONNY
          Take that ya Nazi basterd! You like fuckin
          with the Jews? Wanna Fuck with the Jews?
          The American jews are gonna FUCK with
          you... ..!
          Mr.Goorowitz, see's none of this, as he speaks to his
          mother. He hangs up the phone, just as Donny walks back into
          the store. Store owner turns to store customer.

          DONNY
          Is this the heaviest ya got?

          CUT TO

          INT - HALLWAY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
          Donny, dressed nice, in a apartment building in his Jewish
          Bastin neighbourhood. He knocks on a door.
          A VERY OLD JEWISH WOMAN opens the door, only a little,
          peering out at the young man.

          OLD WOMAN
          How can I help you?

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          State your business young man.

          

          

          

          

          3Z..

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein, I'm Donny Donowitz,
          my father Sy Donowitz, owns the barber
          shop on Greeny Ave, "Sy's Barber Shop".

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          I've seen it. Do you live in the
          neighbourhood?

          DONNY
          All my life.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Again, state your business?

          DONNY
          May I have a word with you?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          What about?

          DONNY
          Our people in Europe.
          She thinks for a beat, then holds the door open for the
          young man.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Come in. Would you like some tea?

          INT - MRS.HIMMELSTEIN'S APARTMENT - DAY
          Donny sits on a overstuffed sofa, holding a tea cup and
          saucer in his hand. Mrs.Himmelstein sits on a overstuffed
          chair, holding her tea, looking across at her visitor.

          DONNY
          (Sipping tea)
          Very good.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          If you like tea.
          Donny chuckles at her little joke. The old woman remains
          stone. She wasn't joking. He places his saucer on the coffee
          table and begins;

          DONNY
          Mrs.Himmelstein, do you have any love
          ones over in Europe who your concerned
          for?

          

          

          

          

          33.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          What compels you young man, to ask a
          stranger such a personal question?

          DONNY
          Because I'm going to Europe. And I'm
          gonna make it right.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And just how do intend to do that, Joshua?

          DONNY

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And what exactly do you intend to do
          with that toy?

          DONNY
          I'm gonna beat every Nazi I find to
          death with it.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          I thought we were having tea together?

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          And in this pursuit, how is it that I
          can be of service?

          DONNY
          I'm going through the neighbourhood.
          If you have any love ones in Europe,
          who's safety you fear for, I'd like
          you to write their name on my bat.

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          Donny takes a long walk to Werner...
          As WE CUT BACK and FORTH BETWEEN DONNY WALKING and WERNER
          WAITING, WE ALSO CUT BACK and FORTE BETWEEN DONNY and

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN...

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          You must be a real BASTERD, Donny?

          

          

          

          

          DONNY
          You bet your sweet ass I am.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Good. A Basterds work is never done.
          Specially in Germany.
          Donny steps up to the plate, looking down at the Nazi;

          DONNY
          Gimmie your papers.
          Werner hands Donny up his papers.
          Donny RIPS the identity page out, and sticks it in his
          pocket.

          MRS.HIMMELSTEIN
          Hand me your sword Gideon. I do believe
          I will join you on this journey.

          INSERT
          she signs the BAT, "MADELEINE"

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          Donny BEATS Werner TO DEATH WITH THE BAT, to the cheers of
          The Basterds.

          PVT.BUTZ
          watches. Hirschberg says to him;

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          About now, I'd be shittin my pants, if
          I was you.
          Aldo points a finger at Butzsr and crooks it toward him.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          That means you, cup cake.
          A crying, visibly shaken, Butz site down in front of Aldo.

          LT.ALDO
          You wanna live?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes, sir.

          LT.ALDO
          Point out on this map, the German
          position.
          His arm shoots out like a rocket, and points out the
          positions.

          

          

          

          
          3 s.

          PVT.BUTZ
          This area here.

          LT.ALDO
          How many?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Maybe twelve.

          LT.ALDO
          What kinda of artillery?

          PVT.BUTZ
          They have a machine gunn dug in here
          pointing north.

          HITLER
          How did you survived this ordel?
          WE SEE Pvt.Butz in The Fuhrer's room for the first time.
          He wears a Nazi cap, which is unusual in the presence of The
          Fuhrer, but he seems okay with it.

          PRVT.BUTZ
          They let me go.

          FROM HERE ON WE GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN ALDO AND HITLER.

          LT.ALDO
          Now when you report what happened here,
          you can't tell 'em, you told us, what you
          told us. They'll shoot ya. But there gonna
          wanna know, why you so special, we let you
          live? So tell 'em, we let ya live, so you
          could spread the word through the ranks,
          what's gonna happen to every Nazi we find.

          HITLER
          You are not to tell anybody anything!
          Not one word of detail! Your outfit
          was ambushed, and you got a away.
          Not one word more.

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          Did they mark you like they did the
          other survivors?

          

          

          

          

          36Ã¢Â¬Â¢

          PVT.BUTZ
          Yes mine Fuhrer.

          HITLER
          Remove your hat and show me.

          LT.ALDO
          Now say we let ya go, and say you
          survive the'war? When you get back
          home, what'eha gonna do?

          PVT.BUTZ
          I will hug my mother like I've never
          hugged her before.

          LT.ALDO
          Well, ain't that's a real nice boy. Are you
          going to take off your uniform?

          PVT.BUTZ
          Not only shall I remove it, but I intend
          to burn it!
          The young German is telling Aldo, what he thinks, Aldo wants
          to hear. But the last answer didn't go down as well as he
          thought it would, evident by the frown on Aldo's face.

          LT. ALDO
          Yeah, that's what we thought. We don't
          like that. You see, we like our Nazi's
          in uniforms. That way, you can spot 'em,
          just like that.
          (Snaps his fingers)
          But you take off that uniform, ain't
          nobody gonna know you was a Nazi.
          And that don't sit well with us.
          Aldo removes a LARGE KNIFE from a sheath on his belt.

          LT.ALDO
          So I'm gonna give ya a little somethin,
          you can't take off.

          BACK TO HITLER
          Pvt.Butz removes his combat helmet, hair hangs in his face,
          his moves it aside, and WE SEE a SWASTIKA has been HAND

          CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD.

          BACK TO BASTERDS

          BUTZ'S POV:
          on ground, looking up at them. Aldo has just carved the
          swastika, and he's holding the bloody knife. All The
          Basterds crowd around to admire his handy work.

          

          

          

          

          37.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          You know Lieutenant, your getting pretty
          good at that.

          LT. ALDO
          You know how you get to Carnegie Hall,
          don't 'ch? Practice.

          CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS:

          CHAPTER THREE

          "GERMAN NIGHT IN PARIS"
          NOTE: This whole Chapter will be filmed in French New Wave
          Black and White.

          INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          We're in the auditorium of a cinema in Paris. However the
          CAMERA is pointed in the direction of the audience, not the
          screen. We start CLOSE on the projector beam, emanating from
          the little glass window in the back of the theatre
          The CAMERA continues to DOLLY back, making the Shot Wider and
          Wider, bringing in more and more the German occupied citizens
          of Paris, who stare at the OFF SCREEN silver screen in the dark
          We can hear the OFF SCREEN SOUNDTRACK of a Goebbels produced
          German omm paw paw musical movie being projected.
          The Shot continues to pull further and further back, and the
          German dialogue continues to fill the auditorium...

          TILL...
          .The DOLLY SHOT LANDS on a CLOSE UP of Shosanna,. watching the
          movie.

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS:

          "1941

          PARIS

          TWO WEEKS AFTER THE MASSACRE

          OF SHOSANNA'S FAMILY"
          We hear the sound of the German musicals climax.
          The lights go up in the auditorium.
          Shosanna, dressed in a NURSES UNIFORM she swiped from
          somewhere, remains seated, as the rest of the PATRONS, gather
          their coats, and file out.

          

          

          

          

          3P.

          EXT - LITTLE CINEMA (PARIS)- NIGHT
          Patrons exit under the cinema marquee, as someone from inside
          SHUTS OFF the marquees lights.
          The MARQUEE READS in French:
          "GERMAN NIGHT BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK in MADCAP IN MEXICO".

          EXT - PROJECTION BOOTH (LITTLE CINEMA)
          A French Black Man, who we will learn later is named MARCEL,
          is the cinema's projectionist. We see him for a moment, taking
          the film reels off the projector, and placing them on rewinds.

          INT - AUDITORIUM

          CU SHOSANNA
          still sitting in her seat. Except for her, the auditorium is
          empty.
          The owner of the Cinema, a attractive looking French woman,
          who we will later know as MADAME MIMIEUX, appears in
          one of the cinema's opera box balconies.
          Looking down from her perch at the young girl, sitting in
          the empty cinema.
          The DIALOGUE will be spoken in FRENCH, and SUBTITLED into

          ENGLISH.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So young woman, since it's beyond obvious
          we're closed for the evening. I must assume
          you want something. What can I do for you?

          SHOSANNA
          May I sleep here tonight?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So I gather your not a nurse?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          But your a bright little thing, that's
          clever disguise. Where is your family?

          SHOSANNA
          Murdered.

          

          

          

          

          3 1.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So your a war orphan?

          SHOSANNA
          We were from Nancy. The Bosch found us

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Is this a sad story?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Sad stories bore me. These days everyone
          in Paris has one. I haven't bore you
          with mine, don't bore me with yours.

          SHOSANNA
          You can run the machines?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          What machines?
          Using her hands to pantomime the rotating film reels on a
          projector, she says;

          SHOSANNA
          The machines that show the film?

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          The projectors? Yes, I own a cinema,
          of course I can operate them.

          SHOSANNA
          I know, I saw you.

          FLASH ON:

          CU SHOSANNA
          eyes creeping up the stairway in the projection booth,
          watching...

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          expertly working the projectors...

          BACK TO SHOSANNA

          SHOSANNA
          Teach me. Teach me to run the machines,
          that show the film. It's only you and
          the negro. I know you could use some help.

          

          

          

          

          40.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I know at least six people who've been
          put up against a wall, and machine
          gunned for sheltering enemies of the
          state. I have no intention of being
          unlucky number seven. How long have
          you been in Paris?

          SHOSANNA
          A week, and a few days.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          How have you survived the curfew
          without capture?

          SHOSANNA
          I sleep on rooftops.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Again, I'm forced to admit, clever
          girl. How is it?

          SHOSANNA
          Cold.

          MADAME MIMIEUX

          (LAUGHS)
          I can imagine.

          SHOSANNA
          Respectfully, no you can't.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Fair enough.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          So you can't operate a 35mm film projector,
          you want me teach you, in order to work
          here, in order to use my cinema, as a hole
          to hide in, is that correct?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Whats your name?

          SHOSANNA
          Shosanna.

          

          

          

          

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I'm Madame Mimieux. You may call
          me Madame. This is a cinema. Not a
          home for wayward war orphans.
          Having said that, what you say is true.
          If you were truly exceptional, I could
          find use for you. So Shosanna, are you
          truly exceptional?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          I will be the judge of that.

          DISSOLVE TO

          TITLE CARD:
          Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS,
          complete with Eiffel Tower.

          ABOVE IT READS:

          "1944

          PARIS"

          THEN...
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we're not looking at a TITLE
          CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the Little
          Cinema's Projection Booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the
          Month is JUNE.
          ..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working
          as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear, that Shosanna passed
          Madame Mimieux's exceptional test.
          A lyrical Morriconie-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK, this
          will be "Shosanna's Theme".
          A Little Bell, begins RINGING, on one of the projectors,
          alerting Shosanna it's time for a REEL CHANGE.
          Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film
          she's projecting, waiting for the1st REEL CHANGE MARK...

          SILVER SCREEN
          of the little cinema. On Screen LENI REFENSHTAL lies
          horizontal as a ice sickle drips on her head in the old
          German film, "The White Hell Of Piza Palu",
          The 1st REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper right
          hand corner of the FRAME...(That tells the projectionist
          to get ready).

          

          

          

          
          As the FILM REEL on the lst PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna
          stands ready, waiting by the 2nd PROJECTOR...

          WHEN...

          SILVER SCREEN
          the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place(That's the
          one).

          SHOSANNA
          THROWS the lever on the 2nd PROJECTOR, switching the film from
          projector 1# to projector 2#, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE.
          As Shosanna's Theme plays on the Soundtrack, we watch viva
          MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores. Carry heavy film cans
          up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect...

          EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
          The MARQUEE READS in French:
          "GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU"
          Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of
          LETTERS (for the marquee), and a tall ladder. Her chore here,
          obviously, is to change the show on the marquee.
          The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the Soundtrack in ENGLISH;

          NARRATOR(VO)
          To operate a cinema in Paris during
          the occupation, one had two choices.
          Ether you could show new German propaganda
          films, produced under the watchful
          eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or... .you
          could have a German night in your
          weekly schedule, and show allowed
          German classic films.
          Their German night was Thursday.
          Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing
          the letters on the marquee.
          A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER(about the same age as Shosanna), walks
          out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French
          girl on top, and walks over.
          They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          What starts tomorrow?
          Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German Solder smiling up
          at her from below.

          

          

          

          

          LC 3.

          SHOSANNA
          A Max Linder festival.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to
          Chaplin. Except Linder never made a
          film as good as "The Rid". The chase
          climax of "The Kid", superb.
          Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          I suppose now you could use a "M"
          a "A" and a "X"?

          SHOSANNA
          No need, I can manage.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Don't be ridiculous, it's my pleasure.
          He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          I adore your cinema very much.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci.
          She busies herself with the marquee letters...

          GERMAN SOLDIER

          SHOSANNA

          GERMAN SOLDIER

          SHOSANNA

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          How does a young girl, such as yourself,
          own a cinema?
          Do to his uniform, and Shosanna's situation, all his efforts
          at trying to make small talk, strikes the young Jewess in
          hiding as a Gestapo interrogation.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          My aunt left it to me.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Lucky girl.
          Shosanna makes no reply back.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Merci for hoisting a German night.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't have a choice, but your welcome.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Do you chose the German films yourself?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Then my merci stands. I love the
          Refensthal mountain films, especially,
          "Pizu Palu". It's nice to see a French
          girl who's a admirer of Refensthal.

          SHOSANNA
          "Admire", would not be the adjective
          I would use to describe my feelings
          towards Fraulein Refensthal.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          But you do admire the director. Pabst,
          don't you? That's why you included
          his name on the marquee.
          She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German
          Private.

          SHOSANNA
          I'm French. We respect directors
          in our country.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Apparently even Germans.

          SHOSANNA
          Even Germans. Merci for assistance,
          Private. Adieu.
          She turns to go back inside.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Your not finished?

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          I'll finish in the morning.
          She opens the door to go inside.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          May I ask your name?

          SHOSANNA
          You wish to see my papers?
          She hands him her excellently forged papers.
          That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway
          to read her name.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Emmanuelle Mimieux. That's a very
          pretty name.

          SHOSANNA
          Merci. Are you finished with my papers?
          He hands them back.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Mademoiselle. My name is Fredrick Zoller.
          She gives no response.

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          It's been a pleasure chatting with a
          fellow cinema lover. Sweet dreams,
          Mademoiselle.
          He gives her a little salute, and walks into the black of a
          curfew imposed night.
          She looks after him. She didn't show it, but he kinda got to
          her. After all, for any true cinema lover, it's hard to hate
          anybody who, CINEMA MON AMOUR.

          EXT - ROOFTOP CINEMA - NIGHT
          Shosanna stands on the roof of her cinema, late at night,
          lighting up a cigarette. As she takes her first big drag,
          she remembers a voice.

          FLASH ON
          MADAME MIMIEUX, the younger Shosanna, and the black
          projectionist Marcel, in the projection booth. Shosanna
          lights up a cigarette, and Madame Mimieux SLAPS her face
          HARD, knocking the cigarette out of her mouth. Marcel
          quickly STAMPS it out on the floor.

          

          

          

          
          If-7.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          if I ever see you light up a cigarette
          in my cinema again, I'll turn you into
          the Nazi's, do you understand?
          Shosanna is shocked by this statement.

          SHOSANNA
          Oui, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          And for bringing a open flame in my
          cinema, you deserve far worse then
          a Nazi jewish boxcar. With your thick
          head, what do you think the highest
          priority of a cinema manager is?
          Keeping this fucking place from burning
          down to the ground, that's what!
          In my collection, I have over 350,
          35mm, nitrate film prints, which are
          not only immensely flammable, but
          highly unstable. And should they
          catch fire, they burn three times
          faster then paper. If that happens..
          .POOF...all gone, cinema no more,
          every body burned alive. If I ever
          see you with a open flame in my cinema
          again, I won't turn you into the Nazi's
          I'll kill you myself. And the fucking
          Germans will give me a curfew pass.
          Do you understand me?

          SHOSANNA
          Out, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          Do you believe me?

          SHOSANNA
          Out, Madame.

          MADAME MIMIEUX
          You damn well better.

          BACK TO ROOF
          Shosanna exhales cigarette smoke.
          Marcel comes onto the roof.

          MARCEL
          Are you well?

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Even on the roof I can't smoke a
          cigarette without hearing Madames
          voice yelling at me. That's why I
          do it. To hear Madames voice again.

          MARCEL
          We both miss her.

          SHOSANNA
          I know. I'm fine, darling. I'll be
          to bed soon.
          Marcel goes back inside, Shosanna smokes.

          INT - FRENCH BISTRO - AFTERNOON
          Shosanna sits in the back of a French bistro, reading a
          book, "The Saint in New York" by Leslie Charteris, drinking
          wine. When the young German Private from the other day,
          FREDRICK ZOLLER, walks in. He gets a beer, then notices the
          French girl sitting in the back. He smiles, and heads over
          to her. "Oh no, not this guy again", she thinks.
          Again they speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          May I join you?

          SHOSANNA
          Look Fredrick -

          FREDRICK

          (SMILING)
          - You remember my name?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes....Look, you seem a pleasant
          enough fellow -

          FREDRICK
          - Merci.

          SHOSANNA
          Your welcome. - regardless, I want
          you to stop pestering me.

          FREDRICK
          I apologize mademoiselle, I wasn't
          trying to be a pest. I was simply
          trying to be friendly.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't wish to be your friend.

          

          

          

          

          FREDRICK
          Why not?

          SHOSANNA
          Don't act like a infant. You know why.

          FREDRICK
          I'm more then just a uniform.

          SHOSANNA
          Not to me. If you are so desperate for
          a French girlfriend, I suggest you try
          Vichy?
          Just then TWO OTHER GERMAN SOLDIERS come over, obviously
          very impressed with Fredrick. They make a fuss over him in
          UNSUBTITLED GERMAN, which nether Shosanna, or the non German
          speaking members of the movies audience, can understand.
          He signs autographs for them, shakes their hands, and they
          go on their way.
          Shosanna's eyes narrow.

          SHOSANNA
          Who are you?

          FREDRICK
          I thought I was just a uniform?

          SHOSANNA
          Your not just a German soldier, are
          you somebodies son?

          FREDRICK
          Most German soldiers are somebodies son.

          SHOSANNA
          Yeah, but your not just somebody. What
          are you, Hitlers nephew?
          He leans in across the table, she leans in too, and he says;

          FREDRICK
          Yes.

          SHOSANNA
          Really?

          FREDRICK
          No not really, I'm just teasing you.
          She leans back annoyed.

          SHOSANNA
          Then what is it? What are you, a German
          movie star?

          

          

          

          

          6'O

          FREDRICK
          Not exactly.

          SHOSANNA
          (Pfuit), what does that mean, "not exactly".
          I asked if you were a movie star, the
          answer to that question, is yes or no.
          Fredrick laughs at that line.

          FREDRICR
          When you said that just now, you
          reminded me of my sister.
          This catches young Shosanna off guard.

          FREDRICR
          I come from a home of six sisters.
          We run a family operated cinema in Munich.
          Seeing you run around your cinema,
          reminds me of them. Especially my sister
          Helga. She raised me, when our father
          wasn't up to the job. I admire her very
          much. You'd like her, she doesn't wear a
          German uniform.

          SHOSANNA
          You were raised by Helga?

          FREDRICK
          All my sisters, I'm the baby, but Helga
          was the bossiest.

          SHOSANNA
          And your mother and father?

          FREDRICK
          My mother died. And my father was a
          loser. My fathers moto; "If at first
          you don't succeed, quit". The day he
          left, good riddance. My sisters are
          all I need. It's why I like your cinema.
          It makes me feel both closer to them,
          and a little homesick at the same time.

          SHOSANNA
          is your cinema still operatiing?

          FREDRICR
          Oui.

          SHOSANNA
          What's it called?

          

          

          

          

          5!

          FREDRICK
          The Kino Haus.

          SHOSANNA
          How has it done durring the war?

          FREDRICK
          Actually, in Germany, cinema
          attendance is up.

          SHOSANNA
          No doubt, you don't have to operate
          under a curfew.

          FREDRICK
          How often do you fill your house?

          SHOSANNA
          (Pfuit), not since before the war.

          FREDRICK
          So if you had one big engagement, that
          would help you out?

          SHOSANNA
          Of course, but that's not likely to
          happen.
          TWO MORE GERMAN SOLDIERS and their TWO FRENCH DATES approach
          the table. They ask for Fredricks autograph, he signs it for
          them. One of the French Girls says in FRENCH, how exciting
          it is to meet a real live German war hero. Shosanna hears
          it. They leave. So that's it, she thinks.

          SHOSANNA
          So your a war hero? Why didn't you tell me?

          FREDRICK
          Everybody knows that, I liked you didn't.

          SHOSANNA
          What did you do?
          He takes a sip of beer.

          FREDRICK
          I've shot the most enemy soldiers
          in world war two...so far.
          You bet your sweet ass that got her attention.

          SHOSANNA
          Wow.

          

          

          

          

          52

          FREDRICK
          I was alone in a bell tower in a
          walled off city in Russia. It was
          myself, and a thousand rounds of ammo,
          in a bird's nest, against three
          hundred Soviet soldiers.

          SHOSANNA
          What's a bird's nest?

          FREDRICK
          A bird's nest is what a sniper would call
          a bell tower. It's a high structure,
          offering a three hundred and sixty degree
          view. Very advantageous for marksmen.

          SHOSANNA
          How many Russian's did you kill?

          FREDRICK
          Sixty-eight.

          (BEAT)
          The first day. A hundred and fifty the
          second day. Thirty-two, the third day.
          On the forth day, they exited the city.
          Naturally my war story received alot of
          attention in Germany, that's why they
          all recognize me. They call me the
          German Sgt.York.

          SHOSANNA
          Maybe they'll make a film about
          your exploits.

          FREDRICK
          Well, that's just what Joseph Goebbels
          thought. So he did. It's called "Nation's
          Pride", and guess what, they wanted me to
          play myself, so I did. They have posters
          for it in kiosks all over Paris. That's
          another reason for all the attention.

          SHOSANNA
          "Nation's Pride" is about you? "Nation's
          Pride" is starring you?

          FREDRICK
          I know, comical, huh?

          SHOSANNA
          Not so comical. So what are you doing
          in Paris, enjoying a rest?

          

          

          

          

          53.

          FREDRICK
          Hardly. I've been doing publicity,
          having my picture taken with different
          German luminaries, visiting troops,
          that sort of thing. Goebbels wants the
          film to premier in Paris, so I've been
          helping them in the planning.
          Joseph is very keen on this film.
          He's telling anybody who will listen,
          when "Nation's Pride" is released,
          I'll be the German Van Johnson.
          Shosanna, wasn't falling for the young German, by any stretch.
          However his exploits, as well as his charming manner, can't
          help but impress. But his referring to Goebbels as "Joseph",
          like their friends, is all she needed to get on the right side
          of things. This young man is trouble with a capital "T", and
          she needs to stay far fucking away from him.
          She abruptly rises, and says;

          SHOSANNA
          Well, good luck with your premier
          Private. I hope all goes well for
          Joseph and yourself. Au revoir.
          And with that, she disappears. Leaving the perplexed private
          alone.

          EXT - CINEMA MARQUEE - DAY
          It's the next day.
          Shosanna and Marcel are changing the letters on the marquee.
          Marcel excuses himself to visit the toilet.
          $hosanna is alone outside the little cinema, perched up on her
          ladder.

          WHEN...
          .A BLACK NAZI SEDAN pulls up in front of the little cinema.
          A GERMAN MAJOR in a black Gestapo uniform steps out of the back
          of the sedan.
          The DRIVER, a German Private, steps out as well.
          Yelling to the young girl up high on the ladder;
          Both GERMAN and FRENCH will be SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.

          

          

          

          
          5 q.

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Mademoiselle Nimieux?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui?
          Telling his Driver in German to ask her in French;

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Ask her if this is her cinema?
          in French The Driver asks Shosanna;

          DRIVER
          is this your cinema?

          SHOSANNA

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Tell her to come down.

          DRIVER
          Come down please.
          She climbs down the ladder.
          The Driver opens the back door of the sedan, indicating for her
          to get in.

          SHOSANNA
          I don't understand, what have I done?

          DRIVER
          (to Major)
          She wants to know what she's done?

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Who says she's done anything?

          DRIVER
          Who says you've done anything?
          Then in her best imitation of Madame Mimeux's arrogantmanner.

          SHOSANNA
          Then I demand to know what this is about,
          and where do you propose to take me?
          The Driver begins to translate, when the Gestapo Major holds up his
          hand, telling him not to bother. The Major looks at the young
          French girl and tells her in German;

          

          

          

          

          55.

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Get your ass in that car.
          No translation necessary. She climbs into the back of the car,
          followed by the Germans. The sedan takes off.

          INT - SEDAN(MOVING) - DAY
          The Nazi sedan drives through the early afternoon Paris
          streets.

          WE HOLD SHOSANNA IN TIGHT CU
          the whole ride, never showing her Nazi oppressor sitting beside
          her. We just hold on her face trying not to revel anything.
          The sedan stops.
          The car door opens and the Driver offers Shosanna his hand.

          EXT/INT- MAXIUM'S (FAMOUS PARIS CAFE) - DAY
          She steps out of the car, and is lead into a Paris cafe by the
          Gestapo Officer. It takes the young Jewess a moment or two before
          she realizes she's not being led to a Gestapo interrogation
          room, a railroad car, or a concentration camp, but to lunch.
          The best table at Maxims. Three people, and two dogs, sit at it.
          Germany's Minister of Propaganda, and the number two man in
          Hitlers Third Reich, JOSEPH GOEBBELS, his female French translator
          (and mistress), FRANCESCA MONDINO, and young Private Zoller,
          are the people. TWO BLACK FRENCH POODLES, belonging to
          Mademoiselle Mondino, sit together in another chair at the
          table.
          We join them in mid-conversation;
          They all speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          GOEBBELS
          - it's only the off spring of slaves that
          allows America to be competitive athletically.
          America olympic gold can measured in Negro
          sweat.
          Shosanna is lead through the French eatery by the Gestapo Major.
          Private Zoller see's her, and stands up, excuse's himself,
          and greets her before she reaches the table.
          Fredrick says in French, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          Good you came. I wasn't sure weather or
          not you'd except my invitation.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Invitation?

          THEN...
          .Goebbles Voice says OFF SCREEN;

          GOEBBLES(OS)
          Is that the young lady in question,
          Fredrick?
          Private Zoller turns in his direction, takes Shosanna by the
          arm, and leads her to him.

          FREDRICK
          Yes it is, beer Goebbels. Emmanuelle,
          there is somebody I want you to meet.
          Joseph Goebbels, remaining seated, looks up at the young French
          girl, scrutinizing her as he spoons creme brule into his mouth.
          The excited Fredrick introduces Shosanna to the propaganda
          minister formally.

          FREDRICK
          Emmanuelle Mimieux, I'd like to
          introduce you to the minister of
          propaganda, the leader of the entire
          German film industry, and now I'm a
          actor, my boss, Joseph Goebbels.
          Goebbels offers up his long spider-like fingers for Shosanna to
          shake. She does.

          GOEBBELS
          Your reputation precedes you Fraulein
          Mimieux.
          He looks to Francesca to translate, but she's just taken a big
          bite of terri misu.
          They all laugh.
          Fredrick jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          And normally, this is beer Goebbels French
          interpreter, Mademoiselle Francesca
          Mondino.

          FRANCESCA
          looks up at Shosanna.

          

          

          

          

          5'?
          NARRATOR'S VOICE comes on soundtrack;

          NARRATOR (VO)
          Francesca Mondino is much more then
          Goebbels French Interpreter.
          She's also Goebbels favorite French
          actress to appear in his films...

          FLASH ON:

          FILM CLIP
          from one of Francesca's B/W Goebbels produced productions.
          Francesca, dressed as a French peasant girl, with a YOUNG

          GERMAN (MOVIE) SOLDIER.
          She speaks in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in to ENGLISH;

          FRANCESCA/PEASANT GIRL
          I love you, I can't help it. My country
          or my heart, which do I betray?
          A SUBTITLE APPEARS below naming the films title;

          "SENTIMENTAL COMBAT" (1943)

          DOGGY STYLE.

          FRANCESCA

          (ANIMAL-LIKE)
          Do it! Do it! Fuck me - fill me!

          BACK TO FRANCESCA
          looking at Shosanna.

          FRANCESCA
          Bon jour.

          SHOSANNA
          Bon jour.

          

          

          

          

          I
          f.

          FREDRICK
          And you've met the Major.
          The Gestapo officer steps up and says, to Fredrick in German;

          GESTAPO MAJOR
          Actually, I didn't introduce myself.
          (to Shosanna)
          Major Deiter Helistrom of the Gestapo, at
          your service mademoiselle.
          (he clicks
          his heels)
          Please allow me, have a seat.
          The Gestapo Officer pulls out a chair, for the young lady to sit
          down. Shosanna takes the hot seat. Seated to her right is
          Private Zoller. To her left are the two curly pampered
          poodles. Major Helistrom pours Shosanna a glass of red wine
          from a small craft on the table.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Try the wine mademoiselle, it's quite good.
          Goebbels looks across the table at her.

          GOEBBELS
          well I must say, you've made quite a
          impression on our boy.
          Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna.

          GOEBBELS
          I must say fraulein, I should be rather
          annoyed with you.
          Francesca interprets..

          GOEBBELS
          I arrive in France, and I wish to have
          lunch with my star...
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          Little do I know Be's become
          the toast of paris, and now he
          must find time for me.
          Francesca interprets...

          

          

          

          
          c9 Ã¢â¬Â¢

          GOEBBELS
          People wait in line hours, day's,
          to see me. For the Fuhrer and
          Private Zoller, I wait.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          So finally, I'm granted a audience
          with the young Private, and he spends
          the entire lunch speaking of you
          and your cinema.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down
          to business.
          Private Zoller interrupts -

          FREDRICK
          - Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed
          her yet.

          GOEBBELS
          Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm
          sure she's figured it out by now,
          after all she does operate a cinema.
          Francesca, tell her.
          Francesca tells Shosanna in French;

          FRANCESCA
          What they're trying to tell you
          Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has
          spent the last hour at lunch,
          trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels
          to abandon previous plans for Private
          Zollers film premier, and change the
          venue to your cinema.
          Zoller reacts.

          FRANCESCA

          (FRENCH
          to Zoller)
          What?

          FREDRICK
          I wanted to inform her.

          FRANCESCA
          Shit. I apologize Private, of
          course you did.

          

          

          

          

          60.

          GOEBBELS

          (GERMAN
          to Francesca)
          What's the issue?

          FRANCESCA
          The Private wanted to inform the
          mademoiselle himself.

          GOEBBELS
          Nonsense. Until I ask a few
          questions, he has nothing to inform.
          Let the record state, I have not
          agreed to a venue change.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Duly noted.
          Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna;

          GOEBBELS
          You have opera boxes?

          SHOSANNA

          GOEBBELS

          SHOSANNA

          GOEBBELS
          More would be better. How many
          seats in your auditorium?

          SHOSANNA
          Three hundred and fifty.

          GOEBBELS
          That's almost four hundred less
          then The Ritz.
          Fredrick jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          But beer Goebbels, that's not such
          a terrible thing. You said yourself
          you didn't want to indulge every
          two faced french bourgeois taking
          up space currying favor. With less
          seat's it makes the event more
          exclusive. Your not trying to fill
          the house, their fightin g for seats.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          FREDRICK

          (CON'T)
          Besides, to hell with the French.
          This is a German night, a German
          event, a German celebration. This
          night is for you, me, the German
          military, the high command, their
          family and friends. The only people
          who should be allowed in the room,
          are people who will be moved by
          the exploits on screen.
          Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause;

          GOEBBELS
          I see your public speaking has
          improved. It appears I've created
          a monster. A strangely persuasive
          monster. When the war's over,
          politics awaits.
          Table chuckles.

          GOEBBELS
          Well Private, though it is true,
          I'm inclined to indulge you anything.
          I must watch a film in this young
          ladies cinema before I can say,
          yes or no.
          (to Shosanna)
          So young lady, you are to close
          your cinema tonight, and have
          a private screening me.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          What German films do you have?
          Francesca asks..

          SHOSANNA
          My cinema , on German night, tends
          to show older German classics.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          Why not my films?
          Francesca asks...

          

          

          

          

          6Z.

          SHOSANNA
          I draw a older German audience in
          my cinema, that appreciate the
          nostalgia of the earlier time.
          Francesca interprets...

          GOEBBELS
          That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans
          are looking forward, not backwards.
          That era of German cinema is dead.
          The German cinema I create, will not
          only be thee cinema of Europe. But
          the worlds only alternative to the
          degenerate Jewish influence of
          Hollywood.
          Fredrick Jumps in...

          FREDRICK
          Along with being a cinema owner,
          Emmanuelle is quite a formidable
          film critic.
          He chuckles, but alone.

          GOEBBELS
          WSo it would appear. Unfortunately
          for the fraulein, I've outlawed
          film criticism.
          Zoller, thinking fast, says;

          FREDRICK
          Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"?
          I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it.
          And it's so funny, I've been meaning
          to recommend it to her, for her
          German night. That's a great idea,
          let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight.

          GOEBBELS
          Ahhh, "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids",
          "Lucky Kids". When all is said and
          done, my most purely enjoyable
          production. Not only that, I
          wouldn't be surprised, if sixty
          years from now, It's "Lucky Kids"
          that I'm the most remembered for.
          I know it doesn't seem like it now,
          but mark my words.
          Very well, I'll have a print sent
          over to the fraulein'.s cinema.
          We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight.

          

          

          

          

          63
          As Francesca interprets this for Shosanna...
          ...the empty chair next to the young Jewish girl is suddenly
          filled with the bottom half of a grey S.S. officer uniform.

          GOEBBELS
          Ah Landa, your here, this is the
          young lady in question.
          The S.S. Officer sits down, and it's our old friend from the
          first scene COL HANS LANDA.

          FREDRICK
          Shosanna, this4pol Hans Landa of
          the SS., he'll be running security
          for the premier.

          CU SHOSANNA
          A bomb is dropped and detonated behind her eyes. But if she
          gives any indication of this, her war story ends here.
          The S.S. OFFICER
          that murdered her family, takes her hand and kisses it,
          saying in perfect French;

          COL LANDA
          Charmed Mademoiselle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Better known as "The Jew Hunter".
          The table laughs.

          GOEBBELS
          Oh Francesca, what was that funny
          thing the Fuhrer said about Hans?

          FRANCESCA
          What thing?

          GOEBBELS
          You know, you were there, it was a
          funny thing the Fuhrer said,
          about Hans...Something about a pig?
          Francesca's memory is jogged.

          FRANCESCA
          Oh, yes of course.
          She repeats it by whispering it in Goebbels ear.

          

          

          

          

          6 "F

          GOEBBELS
          Oh, yes of course, that's it. So
          the Fuhrer said, he wouldn't be
          surprised if Hans weren't rooting
          out Jews like a truffle pig from
          the play pen.

          FRANCESCA
          That's what we need, pigs that can
          root out Jews.

          COL LANDA
          Who needs pigs when you have me?
          Big hearty laugh around the table.

          GOEBBELS
          Do you have a engagement tonight?

          COL LANDA
          Well, as a matter of fact, I do -

          GOEBBELS
          - Break it. We're all going to the
          Fraulein's cinema tonight to view
          "Lucky Kids".

          COL LANDA
          Splendid.
          Then Reich Ministers companion mademoiselle Mondino,

          INTERRUPTS;

          FRANCESCA
          And now I must get Reich Minister Goebbels
          to his next appointment.

          GOEBBELS
          Slave driver! French slave driver!
          They all chuckle.
          Everybody begins to stand up from the table...
          ..Francesca gathers the stupid dogs...
          .as Col Landa stands, he says;

          COL LANDA
          Actually, in my role as security
          chief of this joyous German occasion,
          I'm afraid I must have a word with
          Mademoiselle Mimieux.

          

          

          

          

          C. 5.
          Mademoiselle Mimieux eyes go to Private Zoller, who responds.

          FREDRICK
          What sort of discussion?

          COL LANDA
          That sounded suspiciously like a
          Private questioning the order of a
          Colonel? Or am I just being sensitive?

          FREDRICK
          Nothing could be further from the
          truth Colonel. Your authority is
          beyond question.
          But your reputation does proceed
          you. Should Mademoiselle Mimieux
          or myself be concerned?

          GOEBBELS
          Hans, the boy means no harm, he's
          simply smitten. And he's correct.
          Your reputation does proceed you.
          Laughter all around. The Reich Minister and his axis entourage,
          make their way to front of the cafe, with the two dumb dogs on
          a leash, leading the way.

          COL LANDA
          No need for concern, you two.
          As security chief, I simply need
          to have a chat with the possible
          new venue's property owner.

          FREDRICK
          I was just hoping to escort
          Mademoiselle Mimieux back to her
          cinema.

          GOEBBELS
          Nonsense! You can eat ice cream,
          and walk along the Sienne another
          time. Right now, allow Col Landa
          to do his job.
          Everybody saystheir farewells.
          Col Landa offers the young jew in hiding a seat at a small
          table in the outside patio area of Maxims.
          The fluency and poetic proficiency of the S.S. jew hunters
          french, revels to the audience, that his feigning clumsiness at
          french with Monsieur Lapadite in the films first scene, was
          simply a interrogation-technique.

          

          

          

          
          bd.
          They speak FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          COL LANDA
          Have you tried the strudel here?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          COL LANDA
          It's not so terrible. So how is it
          the young Private and yourself came
          to be acquainted?
          She's about to answer, when a WAITER approaches.

          COL LANDA
          Yes, two strudels, one for myself,
          and one for the mademoiselle. A cup
          of espresso, with a container of.
          steamed milk, on the side.
          For the Mademoiselle, a glass of milk.
          Considering Shosanna. grew up on a dairy farm, and the last time
          she was on a dairy farm, her strudel companion murdered her
          entire family, his ordering her milk is, to say the
          least... . disconcerting.
          The key to Col Landa's power, and or charm, depending on the
          side ones on, lies in his ability to convince you he's privy to
          your secrets.

          COL LANDA
           So Mademoiselle, you were beginning
          to explain....?

          SHOSANNA

          (ANXIOUSLY)
          Up untill a couple of days ago,
          I had no knowledge of Private Zoller,
          or his exploits. To me, the Private
          was simply just a patron of my cinema.
          We spoke a few times, but -

          COL LANDA
          - Mademoiselle, let me interrupt you.
          This is a simple formality, no
          reason for you to feel anxious.
          The Colonel takes one look at it, and says to the Waiter;

          

          

          

          

          67

          COL LANDA
          I apologize, I forgot to order the
          cream fresh.

          WAITER
          One moment.
          He exits.

          COL LANDA
          (Refuring to
          the apple pie)
          Wait for the cream.
          (Back to

          BUSINESS)
          So Emmanuelle - May I call you
          Emmanuelle?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.

          COL LANDA
          So Emmanuelle, explain to me how
          does it happen, that a young lady
          such as your self, comes to own a
          cinema?
          The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels.
          The S.S. Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking
          up his fork, he says;

          COL LANDA
          After you.
          Shosanna takes Ã¢â¬Â¢a whip creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her
          lead.

          COL LANDA

          (MOUTHFULL
          of pie)
          Success?
          Shosanna, mouth full of pie, indicates she approves.

          .COL LANDA
          Like I said, not so terrible.
          (Back to

          BUSINESS)
          So you were explaining the origin of
          your cinema ownership?

          

          

          

          

          69.

          SHOSANNA
          The cinema originally belonged to
          my aunt and uncle -
          Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket.

          COL LANDA
          - What is there names?

          SHOSANNA
          Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux.
          He records the names in his little book.

          COL LANDA
          Where are they now?

          SHOSANNA
          My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg.

          COL LANDA
          Pity... . Continue.

          SHOSANNA
          Aunt Ada passed away from fever
          last spring.'

          COL LANDA
          Regrettable.

          (RESPECTFUL

          PAUSE)
          It's come to my attention you have
          a negro in your employ, is that true?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is
          Marcel. He worked with my aunt and
          uncle since they opened the cinema.
          He's the only other one who works
          with me.

          COL LANDA
          Doing what?

          SHOSANNA
          Projectionist.

          COL LANDA
          Is he any good?

          SHOSANNA
          The best.

          

          

          

          

          61.

          COL LANDA
          Actually one could see where that
          might be a good trade for them.
          Can you operate the projectors?

          SHOSANNA
          Of course I can.

          COL LANDA
          Knowing the Reich Minister as I do,
          I'm quite positive he wouldn't want
          the success or failure of his
          illustrious evening, dependent on
          the prowess of a negro. So if it
          comes to pass we hold this event
          at your venue, talented no doubt,
          as your negro may be, you will
          operate the projectors. Is that
          exceptable?
          As if she has any say.

          SHOSANNA
          Oui.
          Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit.

          COL LANDA
          So it would appear our young hero is
          quite smitten with you?

          SHOSANNA
          Private Zollers feelings for me
          aren't of a romantic nature.

          COL LANDA
          Mademoiselle...?

          SHOSANNA
          Colonel, his feelings are not
          romantic. I remind him of his sister.

          COL LANDA
          That doesn't mean his feelings
          aren't romantic.

          SHOSANNA
          I remind him of his sister who
          raised him.

          

          

          

          

          70

          COL LANDA
          It's sounding more and more romantic
          by the minute.
          Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S.
          LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a
          fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna.

          COL LANDA
          Cigarette?

          SHOSANNA
          No thank you.

          COL LANDA
          Do you smoke?

          SHOSANNA
          Yes.

          COL LANDA
          Then I insist, you must take one.
          There not French, there German.
          I hope your not nationalist about
          your tobacco, to me French cigarettes
          are a sin against nicotine.
          She takes one, but makes no move to light it.
          He inhales deep, and says;

          COL LANDA
          I did have some thing else I wanted
          to ask you, but right now, for the
          life of me, I can't remember what it
          is. Oh well, must not of been important.
          Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table,
          puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor,
          saluting Shosanna, and saying:

          COL LANDA
          Till tonight.
          And with that he's gone.
          Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief.
          The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet
          ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine.
          During her conversation and strudel with the man that
          exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself.
          She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her
          feet.

          INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          The SILVER SCREEN
          on screen is the German screwball comedy "LUCKY KIDS".
          We hear OFF SCREEN laughter at the on screen aryan antics.

          CU GOEBBELS
          Watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius.

          CU FRANCESCA
          Laughing at the comedy, hand covering her mouth.

          CU TWO BLACK POODLES
          Pantingly watching the screen.

          CU MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Smiling, smoking a French cigarette.

          CU COL LANDA
          Smoking his calabash, amused.

          CU FREDRICK ZOLLER
          Truly enjoying himself.

          CU SHOSANNA
          watching the screen.
          The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the soundtrack.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          While Shosanna sits there pretending
          to be amused by the aryan antics of
          Goebbels Frank Capra copy, "Lucky
          Kids", a thought suddenly comes to
          her.
          We see her face get slightly distracted behind the eyes.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          What if tonight, accidently, the
          cinema burned down? The Third Reich
          would lose it's Minister of
          propaganda, it's national hero, and
          it's top jew hunter, all in one fell
          swoop.
          She chuckles at the thought, though it looks like she's
          laughing at the German comedy.

          SILVER SCREEN
          "The END" card for "Lucky Kids" is projected.
          The Nazi rouges gallery, and Shosanna, applaud the film.

          

          

          

          

          IZ
          The lights go up.

          P
          Goebbels excepts congratulations, as they stand and begin to
          file out into the lobby.

          NARRATOR(VO)
          The screening of "Lucky Kids" was a
          complete success. And Heer Goebbels
          conceded to have the venue changed
          to Shosannas cinema. Not only that,
          in a moment of inspiration, Heer
          Goebbels had a idea.
          Goebbels speaks GERMAN, and Francesca translates;

          GOEBBELS
          I must say, I appreciate the modesty
          of this auditorium. Your Cinema
          has real respect, almost church like.
          Not to say we couldn't spruce the
          place up a bit. In Versailles
          there's a crystal chandelier hanging
          in the banquet hall that is
          extraordinary. we're going to get it,
          and hang it from the very middle of
          auditorium roof. Also I want to go to
          Louvre, pick up a few Greek nudes,
          and just scatter them about the lobby.

          MONTAGE
          we see a quick series of shots that show all that happening.
          The chandelier being removed from the ceiling of Versailles.
          Greek nude statues being hand trucked out of the Louvre.
          A truck driving through the french countryside with the
          enormous crystal chandelier in the back.
          The lobby of Shosanna's cinema, pimped out in Nazi iconography.
          WORKERS buzz around decorating. The Greek statues are moved
          into place.
          We see Workers trying with incredible difficulty, to hoist the
          huge, heavy, and twinkingly fragile chandelier, in Shosannas
          auditorium, which now resembles something out of one of Tinto
          Brass's Italian B-movie rip off's of Visconti's "The Damned".

          SHOSANNA
          watches all this from a opera box, she shakes her head in
          disbelief.

          

          

          

          

          73

          BACK TO SHOSANNA AND THE NAZI "S
          in the lobby, post screening of "Lucky Rids", she's soundlessly
          escorting them to the door, as they make their goodbyes.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          As they left the little French
          cinema that night, all the Germans
          were very happy...
          We see Private Zoller hanging back, so he.can say goodbye.

          NARRATOR (VO)
          None more so then Private Zoller.
          She closes the door on him. Watching the Nazi's walk into the
          Paris night. Their shadows, for a moment onAwall, look
          like grotesque Nazi charcthers. 4644
          The Nazi's are gone.
          Marcel sits at the top of the staircase of the lobby, looking
          down at Shosanna.
          They speak in FRENCH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          MARCEL
          What the fuck are we suppose to do?

          SHOSANNA
          It looks like we're suppose to have
          a Nazi premier.

          MARCEL
          Like I said, what the fuck are we
          suppose to do?

          SHOSANNA
          Well, I need to speak with you
          about that.

          MARCEL
          About what?

          SHOSANNA
          About these Hun swine, commandeering
          our cinema.

          MARCEL
          What about it?
          She slowly walks up the stairs to Marcel. She makes him part
          his legs, and sits on the lower step, between his legs. Her
          back up against his chest, his arms around her shoulders.
          Shosanna has only known this type of intimacy with Marcel.

          

          

          

          

          SHOSANNA
          Well, when I was watching the bosch
          (Said in

          ENGLISH)
          Capra-corn abomination,
          (Back to

          FRENCH)
          I got a idea.

          MARCEL
          I'm confused, what are we talking
          about?

          SHOSANNA
          Filling the cinema with Nazi's and
          their whores, and burning it down
          to the ground.

          MARCEL
          I'm not talking about that, your
          talking about that.

          SHOSANNA
          No, we're talking about that,
          right now. If we can keep this
          place from burning down by
          ourselves, we can burn it down
          by ourselves.

          MARCEL
          Shosanna -

          SHOSANNA
          No, Marcel, just for sake of argument,
          if we wanted to burn down the cinema,
          for any number of reasons, you and I
          could physically accomplish that, no?

          MARCEL
          Oui Shosanna, we could do that.

          SHOSANNA
          And with Madame Mimieux's 350 nitrate
          film print collection, we wouldn't
          even need explosives, would we?

          MARCEL
          You mean we wouldn't need any more
          explosives?

          SHOSANNA
          Oui, that's exactly what I mean.
          She begins kissing his hands.

          

          

          

          

          75.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          I am going to burn down the cinema
          on Nazi night.
          One of his fingers probes her mouth.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          And if I'm going to burn down the
          cinema, which I am, we both know,
          your not going to let me do it
          by myself.
          The back of her head presses up hard against him, as his hand
          both caresses, and grips her lovely neck.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          Because you love me. And I love you.
          And your the only person on this earth
          I can trust.
          She then TWISTS around, so she's straddling him. They are now,
          face to face.

          SHOSANNA

          (CON'T)
          But that's not all we're going to do.
          Does the filmmaking equipment it the
          attic still work? I know the film
          camera does. How about the sound
          recorder?

          MARCEL
          Quite well, actually. I recorded a
          new guitarist I met in a cafe last
          week. It works superb. Why do we
          need filmmaking equipment?

          SHOSANNA
          Because Marcel, my sweet, we're
          going to make a film. Just for the
          Nazi's.

          FADE OFF

          INT - ENGLISH COUNTRY ESTATE - DAY
          A young MILITARY ATTACHE, opens the sliding double doors
          that serve as a entrance to the room.

          MILITARY ATTACHE
          Right this way, Lieutenant.
          A snappy handsome British Lieutenant in dress browns, steps inside
          the room. This officer, who has been mixing it up with
          the Gerrys since the late thirties, is named LT.ARCHIE HICOX.
          A young George Sanders type(The Saint and Private affairs of
          Bel Ami, years).
          Upon entering the room, Lt.Hicox is gobsmacked.
          Standing before him is legendary military mastermind,
          GENERAL ED FENECH, a older George Sanders type (Village of the
          Dammed).
          But in the back of the room, sitting behind a piano,
          smoking his ever present cigar, is the unmistakable
          bulk of WINSTON CHURCHELL.

          LT. HICOX
          Lt. Archie Hicox, reporting sir.

          GEN FENECH
          (Salutes back)
          General Ed Fenech, at ease Hicox.
          Drink?
          Hicox's eye's go to the formidable bulldog behind the piano,
          who's scrutinizing him behind his cigar. However the man behind
          the cigar makes no gesture, and the General, makes no
          acknowledgment of the three hundred pound gorilla in the room.
          Which Lt.Hicox knows enough to mean, if Churchell isn't
          introduced, he ain't there.

          LT.HICOX
          if you offered me a scotch and plane
          water, I could drink a scotch and
          plain water.

          

          

          

          

          ?7.

          GEN.FENECH
          That a boy, Lieutenant. Make it
          yourself, like a good chap,
          will you? Bars in the globe.
          Hicox heads over to the bar globe.

          LT.HICOX
          Something for yourself, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          Whiskey straight. No junk in it.
          The Lieutenant moves over to the Columbus-style globe bar, and
          busies himself mixing spirits, playing bartender chappy.
          Fenech, eyeing the Lieutenant's file.

          GEN.FENECH
          It says here you've run three
          undercover commando operations in
          Germany, and German occupied
          territories? Frankfaurt, Holland,
          and Norway to be exact?
          Back to them, mixing drinks, he says;

          LT.HICOX
          Extraordinary people, the Norwegian's.

          GEN.FENECH
          It says here you speak German fluently?

          LT.HICOX
          Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

          GEN.FENECH
          And your occupation before the war?
          His back still to us, as he bartends...

          LT. H I COX
          I'm a film critic.

          GEN.FENECH
          List your accomplishments?

          LT.HICOX
          Well sir, such as they are, I write
          reviews and articles, for a publication
          called; "Films and Filmmakers".
          As well as our sister publication.

          

          

          

          
          7f .

          GEN.FENECH
          What's that called?

          LT.HICOX
          "Flickers Bi-Monthly". And I've had
          two books published.

          GEN.FENECH
          Impressive. Don't be modest Lieutenant,
          what are their titles?

          LT. HI COX
          The first book was called; "Art Of The
          Eye's, The Heart, and The Mind:A Study
          of German Cinema in the Twenties".
          And the second one was called; ...
          He turns around with his whiskey and plain water, and the
          Generals whiskey no junk. He finishes what he was saying, as
          he walks toward the General, handing him his drink.

          LT.HICOX
          "Twenty-Four Frame Da Vinci".
          It's a subtexual film criticism
          study of the work of German director
          G.W. Pabst.

          LT. HI COX
          What should we drink to, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          (Thinking, for
          a moment)
          Down with Hitler.

          LT.HICOX
          All the way down, sir.

          GEN.FENECH
          Are you familiar with German cinema
          under the Third Reich?

          LT. HI COX
          Yes. Obviously I haven't seen any of
          the films made in the last three
          years, but I am familiar with it.

          GEN.FENECH
          Explain it to me.?

          

          

          

          

          77

          LT.HICOX
          Pardon sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          This little escapade of ours,
          requires a knowledge of the German
          film industry under the Third Reich.
          Explain to me UFA, under Goebbels?

          LT.HICOX
          Goebbels considers the films he's
          making to be the beginning of a new
          era in German cinema. A alternative
          to what he considers the Jewish
          German intellectual cinema of the
          twenties. And the Jewish controlled
          dogma of Hollywood.
          SUDDENLY... Bellowing from the back of the room;

          CHURCHELL
          How's he doing?

          LT. H I COX
          Frightfully sorry sir, once again?

          CHURCHELL
          You say he wants to take on the Jews
          at their own game? Compared to say
          .Louis B.Mayer...how's he doing?

          LT.HICOX
          Quite well, actually. Since Goebbels
          has taken over, film attendance has
          steadily risen in Germany over the
          last eight years. But Louis B.Mayer
          wouldn't be Goebbels proper opposite
          number. I believe Goebbels see's himself
          closer to David O.Selznick.
          Gen.Fenech looks to the Prime Minister.
          With a puff of cigar smoke, Churchell says;

          CHURCHELL
          Brief him.

          GEM.FENECH
          Lt.Bicox, at this point in time I'd
          like to brief you on, Operation Kino.
          Three days from now, Joseph Goebbels is
          throwing a gala premier of one of his
          new movies in Paris -

          

          

          

          

          80.

          LT.HICOX
          - What film sir?
          The General has to resort to peeking at his file.

          GEN.FENECH
          The motion pictures called; "Nation's
          Pride".

          LT.HICOX
          Oh, you mean the film about Private
          Zoller?

          GEN.FENECH
          We don't have any intelligence, on
          exactly, what the film that night
          will be about.

          LT.HICOX
          But it's called "Nation's Pride"?

          GEN.FENECH
          Yes.

          LT.HICOX
          I can tell you what it's about,
          it's about Private Fredrick Zoller.
          He's the German Sgt.York.
          Fenech can't help suppress a smile, they have the right man.

          GEN.FENECH
          In attendance at this joyous Germatic
          occasion, will be Goebbels, Gerring,
          Boorman, and most of the German High
          command, including all high ranking
          officers of both The S.S., and, The
          Gestapo. As well as luminaries of the
          Nazi propaganda film industry.

          LT.HICOX
          The master race at play, aye?

          GEN.FENECH
          Basically, we have all our rotten
          eggs in one basket. The objective of
          Operation Kino.... Blow up the basket.

          LT.HICOX
          (Reciting a
          a poem)
          "...and like the snows of yesteryear,
          gone from this earth". Jolly good, sir.

          

          

          

          

          GEN.FENECH
          An American Secret Service outfit,
          that lives deep behind enemy lines,
          will be your assist. The Germans call
          them; "The Basterds".

          LT.HICOX
          "The Basterds", never heard of them.

          GEN.FENECH
          Whole point of the secret service,
          old boy, you not hearing of them.
          But the Gerrys have heard of them,
          because these yanks have been them
          the devil. Their leader is a chap
          named Lt.Aldo Raine. The Germans
          call him, "Aldo the Apache".

          LT.HICOX
          Why do they call him that?

          GEN.FENECH
          Best guess, is because he removes the
          scalps of the Nazi dead.

          LT.HICOX
          Scalps, sir?

          GEN.FENECH
          The hair.
          He runs his finger along his hairline.

          GEN.FENECH
          Like a red Injun.

          LT.HICOX
          Rather gruesome sounding little
          Dicky bird, isn't he?

          GEN.FENECH
          No doubt the whole lot, a bunch a
          nutters. But you've heard the
          expression, "It takes a thief".

          LT.HICOX
          Indeed.
          General Fenech continues on with his exposition, moving over
          to a military map.

          

          

          

          
          9i.

          GEN.FENECH
          You'll be dropped into France, about
          twenty four kilometers outside of Paris.
          The Basterds will be waiting for you.
          First thing, you go to a little village
          called, "Nadine".
          (He points it
          out on the map)
          Apparently the Gerrys never go there.
          In Nadine, there's a tavern, called,
          "La Louisiane", you'll rendez-vous
          with our double agent, and she'll take
          it from there. She's the one who's
          going to get you in the premiere.
          It will be you, her, and two German
          born members of the Basterds. She's
          also made all the other arrangements
          your going to need.

          LT.HICOX
          How will I know her?

          GEN.FENECH
          I suspect that won't be too much
          trouble for you. Your contact is
          Bridget Von Hammersmark.

          LT.HICOX
          Bridget Von Hammersmark? The German
          movie star is working for England?

          GEN.FENECH
          For the last two years now. one could
          even say Operation Kino was her
          brainchild.
          In the back of the room the bulldog barks;

          CHURCHELL
          Extraordinary women.

          LT.BICOX
          Quite.

          GEN.FENECH
          You'll go to the premiere as her
          escort, lucky devil. She'll also
          have the premiere tickets for the
          other two. Got the gist?

          LT.HICOX
          I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.
          The three British bulldogs laugh.

          

          

          

          

          9 3

          EXT - CINEMA ROOFTOP - DAY
           Shosanna and Marcel are on the rooftop of their cinema,
          literally, making a movie.
          Marcel is behind a old (even then) BOLEX 35MM MOVIE CAMERA,
          positioned low looking up.
           Shosanna, the camera subject, stands on boxes looking down
          into it.
          A old timey MICROPHONE is positioned out of frame.
          As they always do, and always will, they speak FRENCH
          SUBTITLED into you know what.

          MARCEL
          We need a sync mark.

          SHOSANNA
          What is a sync mark?

          MARCEL
          A action and noise put together,
          So we can sync up the picture
          and sound.

          SHOSANNA
          How do we do that?

          MARCEL
          Clap your hands.
          She does.

          MARCEL
          In frame imbecile.
          She claps her hands in front of her face.

          MARCEL
          Ready?
          Shosanna takes a deep breath, then;

          SHOSANNA
          Ready.

          MARCEL
          Action.

          WE CUT BEFORE SHE SPEAKS TO...

          

          

          

          

          GIR

          .THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE

          LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA.
          Big diffrence this time, it's in COLOR.

          MARCEL
          But how do we get it developed?
          Only a suicidal idiot like us would
          develop that footage. How do we get
          a35mm print with a soundtrack?

          SHOSANNA
          Do you know one person who can do
          both things?

          MARCEL
          Of course Gaspar, very nice man,
          took care of all the experimental
          filmmakers. But nobody in their
          right mind would strike a print of
          what your talking about. If the
          Nazi's found out, their life wouldn't
          be worth this.
          He snaps his fingers.

          SHOSANNA
          In a wolf fight, you ether eat the
          wolf, or the wolf eats you. If we're
          going to obliterate the Nazi's,
          we have to use their tactics.

          MARCEL
          What does that mean?

          SHOSANNA
          We find somebody who can develop
          and process a35mm print. And we
          make them do it, or we kill them.
          Once we tell them what we want to
          do, if they refuse, we have to kill
          them anyway, or they'll turn us in.

          MARCEL
          Would you do that?

          SHOSANNA
          Like that.
          Snaps her fingers.

          

          

          

          

          ?S,

          INT - SMALL FILM PROCESSING LAB- LATE NIGHT
          A old mom and pop film processing lab circa the Thirties.
          Late late at night.
          GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French
          filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE
          BEATING at the hands of his friend Marcel.
          Shosanna watches, pitiless.

          SHOSANNA
          Bring that fucker over here!
          Put his head down on that table.
          Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat
          against the table top.
          Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by
          his face.

          SHOSANNA
          You ether do what the fuck we tell
          you to, or I'll bury this axe in your
          collaborating skull.

          GASPAR
          I'm not a collaborator!

          SHOSANNA
          Then prove it! Or does your manhood
          go no deeper, then standing to piss?
          Marcel, does his wife, and children
          know you?

          MARCEL
          Oui.

          SHOSANNA
          Then after we kill this dog for
          Germans, we'll go and silence them.
          She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high...

          SHOSANNA
          Prepare to die, collaborator fucker!

          CUT TO

          GASPAR
          hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35mm FILM. Outside
          the shop window, it's morning.

          

          

          

          

          INT - PROJECTION BOOTH-
          WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zollers
          life story "Nations Pride"(clearly marked) on the floor of
          the projection booth.
          The can for REEL 4is open and empty.
          Shosanna's at the editing bench, REEL 4, is up on the
          rewinds...
          Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcels footage into REEL 4 of
          Fredricks film. Rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and
          puts a piece of RED TAPE on REEL 4 CAN.
          She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind
          her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS.

          BLACK FRAME

          FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO

          EXT - LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN) - NIGHT
          We see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out
          front that reads, "La Louisiane".

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS:
          "The Village of

          NADINE, FRANCE"
          TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE
          Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a
          German grey S.S. Cap't uniform. They look out of a window, in a
          apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern.

          LT.ALDO
          You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous
          was in a fuckin basement.

          LT.HICOX
          I didn't know.

          LT.ALDO
          You said it was in a tavern?

          LT.HICOX
          it is a tavern.

          

          

          

          

          LT.ALDO
          Yeah, in a basement. You know,
          fightin in a basement offers a lot
          of difficulties, number one being,
          your fighting in a basement.
          Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S.
          Lieutenant uniform.

          WICKI
          What if we go in there, and she's
          not even there?

          LT.HICOX
          We wait. Don't worry, she's a British
          spy, she'll make the rendez-vous.
          WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes,
          are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg,
          and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey
          uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself,
          sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his
          boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening
          chapter, is dead.
          Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of
          the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly.
          .Stiglitz is fucking werid...
          Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz...

          LT.NICOX
          Stiglitz, right?

          STIGLITZ
          That's right, sir.
          He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the
          leather strap.

          LT.HICOX
          I hear your pretty good with that?
          Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer.

          LT.HICOX
          You know, we're not looking for
          trouble, right now. We're simply
          making contact with our agent.
          Should be uneventful. However, on
          the off chance I'm wrong, and things
          prove eventful. I need to know, we can
          all remain calm.

          

          

          

          

          99.
          The renegade Gerry Sergeant, stops his blades progress, and
          looks up at the limy Lieutenant.

          STIGLITZ
          I don't look calm to you?

          LT.HICOX
          Well, now you put it like that,
          I guess you do.
          He turns his attention back to his blade.
          Hicox moves over to Aldo, and asks him privately;

          LT. HI COX
          This Gerry of yours, Stiglitz?
          Not exactly the loquacious type,
          is he?
          Aldo just looks at him.

          LT.ALDO
          Is that the kinds man you need, the
          loquacious type?

          LT.HICOX
          Fair point, Lieutenant.

          LT.ALDO
          So y'all git in trouble in there,
          what are we suppose to do?
          Make bets on how it all comes out?

          LT.HICOX
          If we get into trouble, we can
          handle it. But if trouble does
          happen, we need you to make damn
          sure no Germans, or French, for
          matter, escape from that basement.
          If Frau Von Hammersmark's cover is
          compromised, the mission is kaput.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Speaking of Frau Von Hammersmark,
          who's idea was it for the death trap
          redez-vous?

          LT.HICOX
          She chose the spot.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Well isn't that just dandy?

          

          

          

          

          LT.HICOX
          Look, she's not a military strategist.
          She's just a actress.

          LT.ALDO
          Ya don't got to be Stonewall
          Jackson to know you don't want to
          fight in a basement.

          LT.HICOX
          She wasn't picking a place to fight.
          She was picking a place, isolated,
          and without germans.

          PFC.HIRSCHBERG
          Lieutenant, I hate to be contrary,
          but I got me a Nazi pissin on
          Louisianna two-o'clock.
          They move to the window, and sure enough, ONE LONE NAZI
          PRIVATE, relieves himself against the side wall.
          Lt.Bicox, this was definitely, not the plan.

          LT.HICOX
          Shit.
          Sgt.Donowitz chides him;

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          So what do you think your fraulein
          Von Hammer -

          LT.HICOX
          - Obviously, I don't know,Sgt.
          The British officer watches the German soldier, who's not
          suppose to be there. When Hugo Stiglitz joins him at the
          window. Stiglitz looks down at the urinating Nazi, S.S. dagger
          in hand.

          STIGLITZ
          If we're going, let's go.
          He sheaths the dagger.

          EXT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN) - NIGHT
          The GERMAN PISSING PRIVATE, sloppily finishes his task.
          Craming his noodle back in his pants, he descends the stairs
          that lead him back into the basement tavern. We Follow him...

          

          

          

          INT - LA LOUISIANE (BASEMENT TAVERN)- NIGHT
          .Inside the basement tavern, La Louisiane. it has a very low
          hanging basement ceiling. A old looking wood bar off to the
          right. And the only other space in the little tavern, is taken
          up by two large(at least in here) tables, which take up both
          half's of the room. And despite rumors to the contrary, one of
          the two tables, is completely filled with drunken celebrating
          Nazi enlisted men, of which our urinating friend is one of
          five.

          FIVE NAZI'S
          ONE GERMAN MASTER SGT, ONE FEMALE GERMAN SGT (a powerfully built
          stocky type), and THREE MALE GERMAN PRIVATES.
          The Five Nazi's are sitting around the table, drinking, and
          playing a very fun game with none other then the fraulein of
          the hour, UFA diva, BRIDGET VON HAMMERSMARK. Dressed to the
          nines in a chic Forties style women's suit, complete with
          fedora. The game their playing consists of each player having
          a card with the name of a famous person, real or imaginary,
          stuck to their forehead. The player doesn't know what name is
          on their forehead. So they ask the others questions to figure
          out who they are.
           The Five Germans, five cards read; MASTER SGT #1(POLA NEGRI),

          FEMALE SGT #2(BEETHOVEN), GERMAN PRIVATE #3(MATA HARI),

          GERMAN PRIVATE #4 (EDGAR WALLACE), GERMAN PRIVATE #5
           (WINNETOU). And Bridget Von Hammersmark, who wears her card in
          the brim of her fedora, has GENGHIS KHAN.
          It's German#5 (WINNETOU) turn to ask questions.
           The DIALOGUE will be in GERMAN, and SUBTITLED into ENGLISH.
          Also, while some dialogue will be written for the German
          Soldiers, it will be mostly made up from the exuberance
          of their game playing, and celebrating.

          WINNETOU
          .okay, I'm not German. Am I American?
          The whole table bursts out laughing.

          FEMALE SGT/BEETHOVEN
          Yes you arel

          EDGAR WALLACE
          Well, not really.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          What do you mean, not really? Of
          course he is.

          

          

          

          

          91

          EDGAR WALLACE
          Well if he's so American, how come
          he's never been translated into
          English? He's not American. He's
          suppose to be American, but he's not
          a American creation. In fact, he's
          something very different.

          WINNETOU
          Okay, I'm a fictional, literary
          character, from the past, I'm American,
          and that's controversial.

          BRIDGET/GENGUS
          No it's not controversial. The nationally
          of the author, has nothing to do with
          the nationally of the character.
          The Character is the character.
          Hamlet's not British, he's Danish.
          So yes, this character was born in
          America.

          WINNETOU
          Well I'm glad that's settled. If I had
          a wife, would she be called a squaw?
          He's got it.
          The table Laughs.
          The TABLE

          YES!

          WINNETOU
          Is my bloodbrother, Old Shatterhand?
          The TABLE
          Yes!

          WINNETOU
          Did Karl May write me?
          The TABLE
          Yes!
          In the BACKGROUND, WE SEE, our three counterfeit German
          Officers, Hicox, Wicki, and Stiglitz, enter the basement
          tavern. They obviously. see the five German soldiers, but their
          too far away for us (the audience) to read their face. No
          doubt their less then happy. Fraulein Von Hammersmark
          see's them as well. Without getting up, she waves to them.

          

          

          

          

          QZ

          BRIDGET
          Hello, my lovelies, I will join you
          in moments. I'm finishing up a game
          with my five new friends here.

          LT.HICOX
          No hurry, Frau Von Hammersmark.
          Take your time, enjoy yourself.

          BRIDGET
          (To Winnetou)
          So who are you?

          WINNETOU
          I am WINNETOU, CHIEF of the APACHES!
          The table CHEERS, and APPLAUD the Apache Chief, as he takes
          the card off his forehead.
          The other Four German Soldiers drink down there beer(part of
          the game).
          Bridget Von Hammersmark knock backs her champagne.

          MATA HARI
          Frau Von Hammersmark, when your
          friends came in, did you realize
          you did a double take, like in the
          movies?

          BRIDGET
          Really? No, I wasn't aware of that
          at all.

          MATA HARI
          They must be second nature to you now?
          Did they teach you how to do a double
          take in the movies?

          BRIDGET
          Well, yes they did, but it's not really
          that difficult.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Do one for us.
          The Tableheartily agrees.
          Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect,
          and perfectly funny, Double Take.
          The Table loves it.

          

          

          

          
          q3.

          MATA HARI
          My turn, I want to try.
          Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double
          Take.

          EDGER WALLACE
          I want to try.
          He does.
          Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes.

          HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ
          watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't
          understand.

          THEN...
          .Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the
          Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at
          the name Gengus Khaun for the first time.

          BRIDGET
          Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that.
          She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the
          Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek
          kiss, as if she knows them well.
          They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink
          Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed
          Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more
          champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning
          back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other
          person in the establishment.
          Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          LT.HICOX
          I thought this place was suppose to
          have more French then Germans?

          BRIDGET
          Normally that's true. The Sgt over
          there's wife, just had a baby. His
          commanding officer gave him, and his
          mates the night off to celebrate.

          WICXI
          We should leave.

          

          

          

          

          BRIDGET
          F No, we should stay. For one drink at
          least. I've been waiting for you in a
          bar, it would look strange if we left
          before we had a drink.

          LT.HICOX
          She's right, just be calm, and enjoy
          your booze.

          BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE
          The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing,
          rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she
          won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a
          name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says;

          NAPOLEON.
          The Germans all laugh.

          BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE

          BRIDGET
          There's been some new developments.
          The cinema venue has changed.

          LT.HICOX
          Why?

          BRIDGET
          No one knows. But that in itself
          shouldn't be a problem. The cinema
          it's been changed to is considerably
          smaller then The Ritz. So whatever
          materials you brought for The Ritz,
          should be doubly effective here.
          Now this next piece of information
          is colossal, try not to over react.
          The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow.
          Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE.
          Bridget's eyes bore holes in him.

          BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS
          They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing.
          Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they
          did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all
          get wet.

          

          

          

          

          9

          BACK TO BASTERDS

          BRIDGET
          (To Hicox)
          You'll be going as Ernst Schuller.
          You'll say your a associate producer
          on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland". It's the
          one German production not under Goebbels
          control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead
          at a Goebbels film affair.

          BACK TO REAL GERMAN TABLE
          Master Sgt.Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over,
          dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table.

          BACK TO BASTERDS
          We See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity.
          the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and
          head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark.

          BRIDGET
          .the films gone through many delays,
          and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so
          if you have to speak...
          Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her
          to cool it.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just
          thinking, could you sign a autograph
          to my son on his birthday?

          BRIDGET
          I'd love to Wilhelm.
          (To the Table)
          This handsome happy Sgt, just became
          a father today.
          The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt.
          The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his
          superior officers.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you, heil Hitler.
          He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; "Heil
          Hitler".
          As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch..

          BRIDGET
          So Wilhelm, do you know the name of
          this progeny yet?

          

          

          

          

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          I most certainly do, fraulein. His
          name is Maximilian.
          Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt.

          STIGLITZ
          Wonderful name, Sgt.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old
          enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy
          him a blue one. And I will paint on
          the side "The Blue Max".
          He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers.
          They do.
          Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish.

          BRIDGET
          There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet.
          She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick.
          Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the
          napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured
          item to the young father.

          BRIDGET
          Nothing but the best for little Maximilian.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may
          not know who you are now. But he will.
          I will show him all of your movies.
          He will grow up with your films,
          and this napkin on his wall.
          Then, to the whole tavern...

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          I purpose a toast to the greatest actress
          in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is
          no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark!
          The whole room toasts.
          This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his
          table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is
          drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings
          you to France?

          

          

          

          

          97 .
          Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been
          exhausted long ago, Lt.Hicox butts in.

          LT.HICOX
          None of your business,Sgt.
          You might not have worn out your welcome
          with the fraulein, with your drunken
          boorish behavior, but you have wore out
          your welcome with me.
          The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet.

          LT.HICOX
          Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted
          man. This is a officers table. I suggest
          you stop pestering the fraulein, and
          rejoin your table.
          The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer.

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is
          is very unusual.
          The whole room pauses-for different reasons...

          SGT.POLA NEGRI
          Where are you from?
          A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two
          German born impostors spring into action.

          WICKI
          Sgt.! You must be ether drunk or mad,
          to speak to a superior officer with
          such impertinentness!
          Stiglitz, STANDS and YELLS to the other table;

          STIGLITZ
          I'm making YOU,...
          (Pointing at

          WINNETOU)
          .and YOU,..
          (Pointing at
          Edgar Wallace)
          .responsible, for him.
          (Pointing at
          Sgt.Pola)
          I suggest you take hold of your friend,
          or he'll spend Max's first birthday
          in jail for public drunkenness!

          

          

          

          

          78
          The Germans SPRING UP, and take hold of Sgt.Pola...

          1W

          WHEN...
          A GERMAN VOICE rings out;

          GERMAN VOICE (OS)
          Then might I inquire?
          The Five known Germans move aside, reveling the unknown German
          in the room, unseen till now, our old friend from before
          MAJOR DEITER HELLSTROM of the GESTAPO. The Major stands from
          the little table he was sitting at.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Like the young newly christened father,
          I too have a acute ear for accents.
          And like him, I too find yours odd.
          From where do you hail, Cap't?
          Wicki jumps in;

          WICKI
          Major, this is highly inappr -

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          T wasn't speaking to you
          Lt.Saltzberg,
          (Turning to

          STIGLITZ)
          or you ether, Lt.Berlin.
          (Looking at

          HICOX)
          I was speaking to Cap't I--don't-know-what.
          The Gestapo Major is now standing beside Sgt.Pola, before the
          impostors table.
          Lt.Hicox, calmly explains his origin.

          LT.HICOX
          I was born in the village that rests
          in the shadow of Piz Palu.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          The mountain?

          LT.HICOX
          Yes. In that village we all speak like
          this. Have you seen the Riefenstahl film?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Yes.

          

          

          

          
          f q s

          LT. HICOX
          Then you saw me. You remember the skiing
          torch scene?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Yes I do.

          LT.HICOX
          In that scene was myself, my father,
          my sister, and my two brothers. My
          brother is so handsome, the director
          Pabst, gave him a Close Up.
          As Bridget Von Hammersmark places a cigarette in a ivory
          cigarette holder, which Hicox, as if on cue, lights for her,
          she says;

          BRIDGET
          Major, if my word means anything, I can
          vouch for everything the Young Cap't has
          just said. He does hail from the bottom
          of Piz Palu, he was in the film,
          and his brother is far more handsome
          then he.
          The impostors laugh.
          Then....so does the Gestapo Major. He turns to the Sgt.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          You should rejoin your friends.
          Which the young Sgt is more then happy to do. That table
          begins playing there game again.
          Major Hellstrom, the highest ranking officer in the room, bows
          graciously to the female German celebrity.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          May I join you?

          BRIDGET
          By all means, Major.
          The Gestapo Major sits at the table, opposite Lt.Hicox, and
          Wicki. The French Barmaid brings over the Majors beer stein.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          So that's the source of your bazaar
          accent? Extraordinary. So what are
          you doing here Cap't?

          LT.HICOX
          Aside from having a drink with the lovely
          fraulein?

          

          

          

          

          ,00 .

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Well that pleasure requires no explanation.
          Chuckle...Chuckle

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I mean in country. Your obviously not
          stationed in France, or I'd know who
          you are.

          LT Ã¢â¬Â¢ I'! I COX
          You know every German in France?

          MAJOR BELLSTROM
          Worth knowing.

          LT.HICOX
          Well, there in lies the problem. We
          never claimed to be worth knowing.
          Chuckle... Chuckle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          (Chuckling as
          he asks)
          All levity aside, what are you doing
          in France?

          LT.HICOX
          Attending Goebbels film premiere as
          the frauleins escort.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Your the frauleins escort?

          LT.HICOX
          Somebody has to carry the lighter.
          Chuckle chuckle.

          BRIDGET
          The Captain is my date, but all three
          are my guests. We're old friends Major,
          who go back along time. Longer then
          a actress would care to admit.
          Chuckle chuckle.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Well, in that case, let me raise a glass
          to the three luckiest men in the room.

          BRIDGET
          I'll drink to that.

          

          

          

          

          101
          They cheers.

          BACK TO THE REAL GERMAN TABLE
          They continue to have alot of fun playing their game.

          BACK TO OFFICERS TABLE

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I must say, that game their playing
          looks like a good bit of fun. I didn't
          join them, because your quite right Cap't,
          officers and enlisted men shouldn't
          fraternize. But seeing as we're all
          officers here,
          (Bowing to

          BRIDGET)
          .and sophisticated lady friends of
          officers. What say we play the game?
          Lt.Hicox begins to refuse, when Bridget (feeling she knows
          better), interrupts him;

          BRIDGET
          okay, one game.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          WUNDERBAR
          The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays
          them out in front of Bridget and the officers.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          So the object of the game, is to write
          the name of a famous person on your card.
          Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For
          instance, you could write Confucius or
          Fu Manchu.
          (He SNAPS his

          FINGERS)
          Eric' More pens.
          (Back to players)
          And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's.
          When you finish writing, put the card
          face down on the table, and move it to
          the person to your left. The person to
          your right, will move their card in
          front of you. You pick up the card
          without looking at it, lick the back,
          and stick it on your forehead like so.
          He demonstrates.

          

          

          

          
          )oz.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          (CON'T)
          And in ten yes or no questions, you must
          guess who you are...
          As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the
          game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO
          STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY.
          Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED
          FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody
          wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP.
          The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being
          this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into
          it.
          The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          .So let's give it a try, shall we?
          Everybody write your names.
          The Five players write their names...
          Then move their cards to the right...
          Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead...

          So... . I visited America, aye?
          The Table says; "Yes".

          Was this vist...fortuitous?

          WICKI
          Not for you.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          .Bummm. My native land, is it what
          one would call, exotic?
          The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic.

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Hummmm. That could be ether a reference
          to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going
          to let my first instinct take over, and
          ask, am I from the jungle?
          The Tablesays; "Yes you are".

          MAJ.KING KONG
          Now gentlemen, around this time you could
          ask, weather your real or fictitious.
          I however, think that's too easy, so I
          won't ask that, yet. Okay, my native land
          is the jungle? I visited America, but my
          visit was not fortuitous to me, but the
          implication is that it was to somebody
          else. When I went from the jungle to
          America,... .Did I go by boat?
          "Yes".

          LT.HICOX
          Major, I don't mean to be rude. But the
          four of us are very good friends. And
          the four of us haven't seen each other
          in quite a while. So...
          Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I beg to differ Cap't. It's only if the
          fraulein considers my presence a
          intrusion, that I become a intruder.
          How about it fraulein? Am I intruding?

          BRIDGET
          Of course not, Major.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I didn't think so. It's simply the young
          Cap't is immune to my charms.
          The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation?
          Then, the Major laughs.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding.

          

          

          

          

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old
          single malt scotch whisky from the

          LT.HICOX
          Your most gracious, sir.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses!
          You don't want to contaminate the thirty-
          three with the swill you were drinking.

          ERIC
          How many glasses?

          LT.HICOX
          Five glasses.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Not me. I like scotch, scotch doesn't like
          me.

          Nor I. I'll stay with bubbly.
          Lt.Bicox, hold up three fingers(pinky to index), to Eric the
          owner.

          LT.HICOX
          Three glasses.
          Eric brings the three glasses, and the old bottle, pouring for
          the three soldiers.
          Major Helistrom lifts up his beer stein, and toasts;

          The Gestapo Major puts down his beer stein, and then WE HEAR a
          CLICK, under the table.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Did you hear that? That's the sound of
          my Luger pointed right at your testicles.

          You were saying?

          LT.HICOX
          I was saying that makes two of us. I've
          had a gun pointed at your balls since
          you sat down.

          SGT.STIGLITZ
          That makes three of us.

          UNDERTABLE
          We See all three guns pointed at appropriate crotches. As well
          as Bridget's legs, right besides the Nazi Major's. Her pretty
          gams are sure to be chewed up in the possible crossfire.

          SGT.STIGLITZ
          And at this range, I'm a real
          Fredrick Zoller.
          Hugo alsobrings out his dagger, and sitcks it in the table top.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Hummmmm ... Looks like we have a bit
          of a sticky situation here.

          LT. H ICOX
          What's going to happen, Major, is your
          going to stand up, and walk out that
          door with us.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          No no no no no no, I don't think so.
          I'm afraid you and I both know, no matter
          what happens to anybody else in this room,
          the two of us aren't going anywhere.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          (pointing behind
          him at the table)
          Too bad about them though. They seem
          like a likeable
          (referring to
          Stiglitz and Wicki)
          You two will have to shoot them.

          BRIDGET
          Then Major, i implore you. For the
          sake of those German troops, will
          you please leave with us?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM
          Oh Bridget, your concern for German
          troops, gets me
          (Pointing at
          his heart)
          .right here. You mean for the sake
          your whore legs, don't you? You can't
          afford to get any bullet holes in them,
          your not finished spreading them for
          all the Hollywood Jews.
          Lt.Hicox picks up his thirty-three year old single malt
          scotch, and says;

          'Well, if this is it old boy, I hope
          you dont mind if I go out speaking
          the kings?

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          (ENGLISH)
          By all means, Cap't.
          The English film critic, commando, picks up the thirty-three
          the Nazi Major bought him, and says;

          LT.HICOX
          There's a special rung in hell reserved
          for people who waste good scotch.
          And seeing as I might be rapping on
          the door momentarily...
          He downs the stuff.

          LT.HICOX
          (To the Nazi

          MAJOR)
          I must say, damn good stuff, sir.

          

          

          

          
          He puts the glass down.

          LT.HICOX
          Now about this, "Pickle", we find
          ourself's in. It would appear, there's
          only thing left for you to do.

          MAJOR HELLSTROM

          well.

          HELLSTROM
          FIRES into HICOX'S BALLS and KNEE CAPS.

          STIGLITZ
          then JUMPS over the table, and begins STABBING HELLSTROM with the

          DAGGER.
          HICOX FALLS to the floor....DEAD.
          BRIDGET FALLS to the floor.,SHOT.

          WICKI
          brings his weapon out from underneath the table, and BEGINS
          FIRING across at The GERMANS at the table, who unaware, were
          still PLAYING THE GAME.

          WINNETOU
          is SHOT IN THE BACK, before he even knew what was happening.
          EDGAR WALLACE and The FRENCH BARMAID

          FEMALE SGT.BEETHOVEN and STIGLITZ bring their guns toward each

          The SHOOTING STOPS...the SMOKE caused by the gunfire ... starts
          to DISSIPATE... The only one in the room left alive, is the
          young German Sgt, with the machine gunn.
          WE HEAR the feet of the soldiers outside, reach the basement
          entrance.
          The door opens...
          , .The German Sgt, sends FIFTY BULLETS in the doors
          direction...
          No one goes through it.
          What we have here, is a rabbit hole like situation. No one
          inside is getting out, no one outside is getting in.
          The young German Sgt, YELLS in ENGLISH, to the outside;

          GERMAN SGT
          You outside! Who are you? British,
          American, what?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay, talk!

          GERMAN SGT
          I'm a father! My baby was born today
          in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name
          is Max! We were in here drinking and
          celebrating! They're the ones that
          came in shooting and killing!
          It's not my fault!

          

          

          

          
          Ito.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)

          What's your name soldier?

          GERMAN SGT

          guys you just killed!

          WILHELM

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay Wilhelm... .is anybody alive
          on our side?

          WILHELM
          No!
          We hear a VOICE OFF SCREEN, yell out;

          BRIDGET'S VOICE(OS)
          I'm alive!
          Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice.

          STILL

          R
          On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the
          alive Bridget Von Hammersmark.
          The German Sgt points the muzzle of the machine gunn at
          the German celebrity; with hate in his eyes.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Who's that?

          WILHELM
          (To BRIDGET,

          LOW)
          Make a sound whore, and I spit!
          Meaning the muzzle.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Wilhelm, who is that?

          WILHELM
          is the girl on your side?
          Pause.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Which girl?

          

          

          

          

          WILHELM

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)

          WILHELM
          (To Bridget
          LOW in GERMAN)
          I thought so. So you run with the
          American's now, huh? Now times are
          bad?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Is she okay?

          WILHELM
          (To Bridget
          LOW in GERMAN)
          You despicable traitor.
          (To Aldo)
          She's been shot, but she's alive.
          (To Bridget
          LOW in GERMAN)
          For now.
          We hear The Basterds Curse their luck Off Screen.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay Wilhelm, what'd ya say we
          make a deal?

          WILHELM
          What's your name?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call yap Willi?

          WILHELM
          Yes.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          So Willi, you know we could lob three
          or four or five or six grenades down
          there, and your little war story ends
          here. But good fer you, bad fer her,
          you die, she dies. So what say we
          make a swap?

          WILLI
          Keep talking?

          

          

          

          

          112.

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Okay, Willi here's my deal! You let
          me and one of my men come down to
          take the girl away! And we take the
          girl, and leave! That simple, Willi!
          You go your way, we go ours! And little
          Max, gets to grow up playing catch with
          his daddy! So what'ya say, Willi, we
          got a deal?
          Willi thinks...
          Bridget watches Willi think...

          WILLI
          Aldo?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          I'm here Willi!

          WILLI
          I want to trust you.... But howcanI?

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          What choice ya got?

          WILLI
          I could kill the girl!

          ALDO'S VOICE(OS)
          Well now, Willi, that's true enough.
          But something you need to know, so
          you don't get the wrong idea. Ain't
          none of us give a fuck bout that
          girl. But, admittedly, if you kill
          her, it would fuck up our plans. But
          you'll be dead by then anyway, so
          what'd you care? And lets not
          forget that little gatzenjammer
          Max, growin up without a pop. So in
          the spirit of gettin you home to
          him, we got a deal, Willi?

          WILLI
          Okay Aldo, I'm going to trust you!
          Come down, no guns!
          Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands.
          Willi keeps his machine gunn trained on them.
          Aldo with his hands up, says;

          A

          

          

          

          

          ALDO
          Hey Willi, what's with the machine
          gunny I thought we had a deal?

          WILLI
          We do have a deal, now git the girl
          and go.

          ALDO
          Not so fast, Willi, we only have a
          deal, we trust each other. A Mexican
          stand off ain't trust.

          WILLI
          You need guns on me for it to be
          a Mexican stand off.

          ALDO
          you got guns on us, you decide to
          shoot, we're dead. Up top, they got
          grenades, they drop 'em down here,
          your dead. That's a Mexican stand
          off, and that wasn't the deal.

          WILLI
          Just take that fucking traitor, and
          go! See? Now your down here
          Now you get tricky - t

          ALDO
          - No tricks!- Ain't nobody gittin
          tricky, Willi; I swear to god, I'm
          too damn dumb toget tricky. But

          (MEANING

          HIRSCHBERG)
          him and I lived upto the deal. We
          came down without guns. Now it's
          your turn. No trust,no deal.
          Willi pointing gunn at them.,,, -thinking...

          ALDO
          i know your scarred. I'm scarred,
          he's scarred, we're all scarred.
          So what's it gonnabe Willi?
          Ether we got a deal, or you might
          as well just shoot us now.
          Willi decides...
          He puts the machine gunn down on the bar.

          

          

          

          

          WILLI
          Fine. Take that fucking traitor and
          get her out of my sight.

          ALDO
          Danka, Willi, danka. okay, Hirschbeg,
          you grab her shoulder -

          WHEN...
          From behind Aldo and Hirschberg, Bridget lifts up Major
          Hellstroms Luger, and EMPTIES the remaining bullets into
          Sgt.Willi, who FALLS to the floor, DEAD.
          Aldo and Hirscberg spin around shocked.

          ALDO
          You fuckin bitch! I had a deal with
          that man!
          From the floor, the bloody, sweaty, and in excoriating pain
          (she'll probably lose that leg), German movie star, says to the
          two American soldier's she's just meeting for the first time;

          BRIDGET
          He was a enemy soldier, who knew who
          I was. He couldn't live.

          3
          Hirscberg loses control, and RICKS the woman on the floor,
          hard in the side.

          HIRSCHBERG
          I ought'a beat your fuckin head in

          ALDO
          Stop it. Just pick her up, and get
          that bitch outta here.

          HIRSCHBERG
          Aldo, she just-

          ALDO
          - She's right.

          HIRSCHBERG
          What?

          ALDO
          I said, she's right. He was a Nazi
          soldier. If he lived, he would doomed
          the mission.

          ELI

          ALDO

          (CON'T)
          Don't mean I like it, don't mean I
          like her, but she's right. Now as
          Willi said, "take this fuckin
          traitor, and get 'er outta my sight".

          Hirschberg, carrying Fraulein Von Hammersmark, and Aldo emerge
          from the bowels of the basement.
          Bridget points at a fancy black sedan, telling them it's her's.
          Aldo, Hirschberg, Bridget, Donowitz, and Utivich pile in, and
          take off.

          INT - FRENCH HOUSE IN COUNTRY (BEDROOM)- NIGHT
          NOTE:In this entire scene, no French spoken will be SUBTITLED.
          A OLD MAN lies asleep under the covers of his blankets, in his
          bed, in his bedroom...

          WHEN...
          OFF SCREEN the sound of a DOOR BEING KICKED OPEN...
          r .The SOUND of what sounds like EIGHT DOGS BARKING .... and the

          head, shocking, Donny SLAMS the 45. hard against the Old Man's
          scarring, and bringing the old gent to attention.

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          Doctor? Are you a fucking doctor?
          He nods his head, yes.

          Donny YANKS/DRAGS the Old Man out of bed, in his almost
          comical nightshirt (which makes him cuter, thus the brutality
          against him hurts more) towards the door...

          INT - DOCTORS EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT
          .Into a doctors examining room, built into a French country
          house, with a examining table, and medical instruments.
          However, it's obviously the medical examining room
          of a veterinarian.
          Along the walls are different cages with eight excited BARKING
          dogs in it.
          The Soldiers are putting the shot in the leg, bleeding, and in
          excruciating pain, Bridget on the examining table.
          Donny, still holding on to the Old Man, points in the girls
          direction...

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          I take care of animals...
          Bridget screams from the table...

          BRIDGET

          (ENGLISH)
          He's a fucking veterinarian you
          imbecile!

          

          

          

          

          1 00.

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          I
          It's still a doctor. If he can get
          a bullet out of a cow, he can get
          a bullet outta you.

          LT.ALDO
          Right now, we just need morphine.
          Donny yells at the Old Man;

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          Morphine! We need morphine!
          The Old Man tries to explain in French, that he's not a human
          doctor...

          WHEN...
          ..Donny takes the 45. and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the
          cages.
          Everybody jumps.
          Donny SCREAMS at the Old Man;

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          MORPHINE!!!

          7

          BANG
          He SHOOTS another dog...

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          MOREPHINE!!!
          The Old Man begs him to stop, and goes to get the morphine.

          CUT TO
          The BODY of Gestapo Major DEITER HELLSTROM dead on the floor.

          INT - LA LOUISTANE- NIGHT
          Were back in the basement tavern. Colonel Hans Landa stands
          over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, a smile
          breaks out on his face.
          He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          Ahhh Hugo, you've moved up in the
          world I see. Lieutenant. And with
          your record of insubordination.
          Truly remarkable.

          A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN, joins the S.S. Officer.

          And that ones...
          (Pointing at

          WICKI)
          .name is Weiheim Wicki. Bets
          Austrian born jew, who immigrated
          to the United States when things
          began turning sour for the Israelites.
          They are the two German born members of
          The Basterds. They've been known
          to don german uniforms, to ambush squads.

          FLASH ON
          Three Nazi Soldiers walking towards a company of other German
          Soldiers. The Three Soldiers backs are to us. Dried bloody
          bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms.
          The SGT of the German company, yells to the trio;

          SGT.GERMAN COMPANY
          What brings you all the way out here?
          The TRIO MOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine gunns.

          BACK TO LANDA

          COL LANDA
          But that doesnt look like this.
          This is odd.
          Looking down he see's something...
          .bending down, he examines fraulein von Hammersmarks two
          pretty dress shoes lying on the floor.
          One shoe is covered in blood.
          The other, while blood speckled, is fairly clean.
          Picking up the clean shoe, and holding it in his hand.

          COL.LANDA
          It would appear somebodies missing.
          Somebody fashionable.
          A OFF SCREEN SOLDIER'S VOICE cries out;

          SOLDIERS VOICE(OS)
          Col, this ones still alive!
          We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt.Willi lies.
          He's shot in the chest, but it looks like Max's daddy is still
          alive.

          

          

          

          

          !!.

          INT - EXAMINING ROOM -ÃÂ° NIGHT
          Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot.
          The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the
          German lady.

          LT.ALDO
          Now 'fore we yank that slug outta ya,
          you need to answer a few questions

          BRIDGET
          Few questions about what?

          LT.ALDO
          About I got three men dead back there,
          and why don't you try tellin us what
          the fuck happened?

          BRIDGET
          The British officer blew his German
          act, and a Gestapo Major saw it.

          LT.ALDO
          'fore we get into who shot John,
          why did you invite my men to a
          rendez-vous in a basement with a bunch
          of Nazis?

          BRIDGET
          I can see, since you didn't see
          what happened inside, the Nazi's
          being there must look odd.

          LT.ALDO
          Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda
          odd in English, it's called,
          suspicious.

          BRI DGET
          Don't let your imagination get the
          better of you, Lieutenant. You met
          the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby
          tonight. His commanding officer gave
          him and his friends the night off to
          celebrate. The Germans being there
          was just a tragic coincidence.
          Aldo thinks for a moment...

          LT. ALDO
          Okay, I'll buy that. He was ether
          there with his men waiting for us,
          or he was there celebrating his
          sons birthday, he wasn't doin both.

          

          

          

          

          120.

          LT.ALDO
          How did the shootin start?

          BRIDGET
          The English man, gave himself away.

          LT. ALDO
          How did he do that?

          BRIDGET
          He ordered three glasses.
          She holds up three fingers, index to pinky.

          BRIDGET
          We order, three glasses.
          She holds up three fingers, thumb to index.

          BRIDGET
          That's the German three. The other
          is odd. Germans would, and did notice it.

          LT. ALDO
          Okay, let's pretend there were no
          Germans, and everything went exactly
          the way it was suppose to. What would
          of been the next step?

          BRIDGET
          Tuxedos. To get them into the
          premiere, wearing military uniforms,
          with all the military there, would
          of been suicide. But going as
          members of the German film industry,
          they wear tuxedos, and blend in with
          everybody else. I arranged a tailor
          to fit three tuxedos tonight.

          LT.ALDO
          How did you intend to get them into
          the premiere?

          BRIDGET
          Hand me my purse.
          They do. And she opens it, and takes out three tickets to the
          film premiere.

          BRIDGET
          Lt.Hicox was going as my escort.
          The other two were going as a German
          cameraman and his assistant.

          

          

          

          

          INN ÃÂ®

          LT. ALDO
          Can you still get us in that
          premiere?

          BRIDGET
          Can you speak German better then your
          friends, no. Have I been shot, yes.
          I don't see me tripping the light
          fantastique up the red carpet any
          time soon. Least of all by tomorrow
          night.

          (PAUSE)
          However, there's something you don't
          know. There's been two recent
          developments regarding Operation
          Kino. One, the venue has been
          changed from The Ritz, to a much
          smaller venue.

          LT.ALDO
          Enormous changes at the last minute?
          That's not very Germatic. Why the
          hell is Goebbels doin stuff so damn
          peculiar?

          BRIDGET
          It probably has something to do with
          the second development.

          LT. ALDO
          Which is?

          FLASH ON
          IN A PRIVATE DINNING ROOM IN GERMANY, The FUHRER, aka Adolph
          Hitler, aka Adolph Shicklegroover, aka The Bohemian Corporal,
          having dinner with Goebbels, only a few short days ago.
          The FUHRER

          (GERMAN)
          I've been rethinking my position in
          regards to your Paris premiere of
          "Nations Pride". As the weeks have
          gone on, and the Americans are on
          the beach, I do find myself thinking
          more and more about this Private
          Zoller. This boy has done something
          tremendous for us. And I'm beginning
          to think my participation in this
          event could be meaningful.

          BACK TO BRIDGET

          BRIDGET
          The Fuhrer's attending the premiere.

          

          

          

          

          1 2 Z.
          Donny breaks the teams silence;

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          What?

          LT.ALDO
          When the hell did this happen?

          BRIDGET
          The venue change, two weeks ago.
          The Fuhrer's attendance, four days
          ago.

          LT. ALDO
          And how come London don't know
          nothing about that?

          BRIDGET
          We need to get something straight,
          once and for all. Everything London
          knows, it learned from me. If I
          don't know, London doesn't know.
          So now, this is me, informing you,
          Hitler's coming to Paris.

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          FUCK A DUCK?
          Aldo stands up from the chair, pacing as he takes in this new
          information.

          BRIDGET
          What are you thinking?

          LT.ALDO
          I'm thinking getting a wack at
          plantin ole Uncle Adolph makes
          this a horse of a different color.

          BRIDGET
          What's that suppose to mean?

          LT.ALDO
          It means, your gettin us in that
          premiere.

          BRIDGET
          I'm going to probably end up losing
          this leg, bye bye acting career,
          fun while it lasted. How do you
          expect me to walk up a red carpet?

          

          

          

          

          X73

          LT.ALDO
          The doggie docs gonna dig that slug
          outta your gam. Then he's gonna wrap
          it up in a cast, and you gotta good
          how I broke my leg mountain climbing
          story. That's German, ain't it?
          Y'all like climbin mountains,
          don'tch?

          BRIDGET
          I don't. I like smoking, drinking,
          and ordering in restaurants, but I
          see your point.

          LT. ALDO
          We fill ya up with morphine, till
          it's comin out ya ears. Then just
          limp your little ass up that
          rouge car-pet.

          BRIDGET
          Splendid. When the Nazi's put me up
          against a wall, it won't hurt
          so much.
          (Changing tone)
          I know this is a silly question
          before I ask it, but can you
          American's speak any other language
          then English?

          HIRSCHBERG
          Other then Yiddish?

          BRIDGET
          Preferably.
          Donny referring to Aldo and himself.

          SGT.DONOWITZ
          We both speak alittle Italian.

          BRIDGET
          With a atrocious accent, no doubt.
          But that doesn't exactly kill us
          in the crib. Germans don't have a
          good ear for Italian. So you mumble
          Italian, and brazen through it, is
          that the plan?

          LT. ALDO
          That's about it.

          

          

          

          

          BRIDGET
          That sounds good.

          LT. ALDO
          it sounds like shit, but what else
          we gonna do, go home?

          BRIDGET
          No, it's good. If you don't blow it,
          with that, I can get you in the
          building.
          (Change tone)
          So, who does what?

          LT.ALDO
          Well I speak the most Italian, so
          I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks
          the second most, so he'll be your
          Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg
          third most, so he'll be Donnys
          assistant.

          HIRSCHBERG
          I don't speak Italian.

          LT. ALDO
          Like I said, third best. Just keep
          your fuckin mouth shut. In fact why
          don't you start practising, right now.

          BRIDGET
          (Meaning Utivich)
          What about the little one?

          UTIVICH
          Do you mean me?

          BRIDGET
          I didn't mean any offence.

          UTIVICH
          None taken you German cunt.

          LT.ALDO
          Utivich is the chauffeur.

          UTIVICH
          I can't drive.
          Bridget SCREAMS in frustration;

          BRIDGET
          You Americans are fucking useless!

          

          

          

          

          UTIVICH
          IVGimmie a break, I'm from Manhattan.

          LT.ALDO
          No worries, son. We got over fourteen
          hours before the movie tomorrow.
          More then enough time for you to learn
          to drive.

          UTIVICH
          NO no no no, Lieutenant, it's not!

          LT.ALDO
          Oh yes yes yes yes, Private, it is.
          And yes yes yes yes, you will.
          (Changes tone)
          Look Utivich, you and I both know,
          if we went to grade school together,
          you damn sure ain't copyin off of my
          test. Well I lern't to drive in four
          hours on a Tennessee mountain road.
          And I'm a shit for brains coal miner
          bootlegger. Hirschberg, you know how
          to drive, right?

          HIRSCHBERG
          Yes.

          LT.ALDO
          Teach 'em.

          BRIDGET
          But there is a problem. I'm a movie
          star. This is a movie premiere.
          I can't show up looking like I was
          just in a Nazi gun fight. Now I
          have a dress for the premiere at my
          hotel. But sometime tomorrow, I
          have to get my hair done.
          All The Basterds, except Donny, burst out laughing.

          LT. ALDO
          Sister, you must got wunderbar luck.
          Guess who went to beauty school?

          "REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE"

           FADE OFF

          INT - SHOSANNAS AND MARCELS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT
          We're in Shosannas and Marcels living quarters, above the
          cinema. We've never been in here before.

          A SUBTITLE APPEARS ON SCREEN:

          NIGHT OF "NATION'S PRIDE" PREMIERE
          She's standing before a full length mirror, in a real
          attractive Forties style dress for the premiere. She's stunning.
          This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity,
          or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows
          this is the last night of her life, no time like the present.
          SOUNDS of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the
          German brass band that's blaring Third Reich Marches, can be
          heard coming from below.
          Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the
          Germatic miasma below.
          SHOSANNAS POV: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of
          SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos,
          and female finery, walking up the long red carpet(with a big
          Swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosannas
          cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German Radio
          and Film crews covering the event for the fatherland back
          home. And of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security
          for this joyous Germatic occasion.
          Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it.
          A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL, being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR,
          the lugi HITS him right on his bald head.
          Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very
          fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the
          period style black fish net veil over her face. She takes out
          a small GUN, and puts it in the pocket of her dress., and it's
          on. She exits the apartment door, to join the premiere.
          From this point on, there's no turning back, it's all the way
          baby, all the fucking way!

          INT - CINEMA STAIRWELL - NIGHT
          The stairwell in the building that connects the living
          quarters, with the cinema. She walks down the stairs, goes
          through a door that puts her next to the projection booth
          door. She takes out a key and opens it.

          INT - PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT
          Marcels prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver
          metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid
          out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel
          three, our specially marked can for reel four, and can for
          reel five(which should never see the light of a projector)
          lie in wait.
          Shosanna, looking like a Forties movie star, enters the
          projection booth.
          The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          MARCEL
          Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this
          is so exciting. Pleased to meet you.

          SHOSANNA
          Shut up fool.
          Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips
          meet.

          SHOSANNA
          Cheeky black bugger. I have to go
          down and socialize with these Hun
          pigs. Let's go over it again?

          MARCEL
          Reel one is on the first projector.
          Reel two is on the second. Three
          and four are ready to go.

          SHOSANNA
          Okay, the big sniper battle in the
          film begins around the middle of
          the third reel. Our film, comes on
          in the forth reel, so Somewhere
          towards the end of the third reel,
          go down and lock the doors of the
          auditorium. Then take your place
          behind the screen, and wait for my
          CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN!

          INT - CINEMA LOBBY - NIGHT
          The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the
          German beautiful people, enter the cinema. They mingle in the
          swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered lobby. Nazi
          Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and German
          Celebrities(Emil tannings, Veit Harlin), hob knob and drink
          Champagne from passing WAITERS who carry glasses on silver
          trays.
          We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big
          staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor
          entrance. She descends the staircase, and busies herself with
          theatre stuff.
          At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race
          in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his
          finest SS Uniform, smoking on his Calabash.

          CAMERA FRAME
          directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of
          Col.Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the
          cinema. On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance,
          from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the
          building.

          THEN...
          .A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left
          side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside of Landas
          think bubble, a little scene plays out.

          THINK BUBBLE
          Inside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a
          PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col.Landa enters the room, and
          screams at everybody;

          COL.LANDA
          I want everybody out of this room!
          They start to leave.

          COL.LANDA
          That means now, goddamnit!
          They RUSH OUT.
          He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none
          other then SGT.WILLI, and yes, he's still alive.
          Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed, sits down.

          COL.LANDA
          Can you speak, Sgt?

          

          

          

          

          L - )1.

          SGT.WILLI

          (WEAKLY)
          Yes Colonel.

          COL.LANDA
          Tell me everything that happened in
          there?
          The THINK BUBBLE DISSOLVES away, reveling the entrance again,
          and as if on perfect cue, in walks Bridget Von Hammersmark,
          dressed lovely, leg in a big white cast. The three basterds in
          their tuxedos, flank her.

          CU COL.LANDA
          smiles.
          He descends the stairs, towards the four saboteurs...
          They speak in GERMAN, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          Fraulein Von Hammersmark, what
          has befallen Germany's most elegant
          swan?

          BRIDGET
          Colonel Landa, it's been years.
          Dashing as ever I see.

          COL.LANDA
          Flattery will get you everywhere,
          fraulein.
          They chuckle, and air kiss.

          COL.LANDA
          So what's happened to your lovely
          leg, a by product of kicking ass in
          the German cinema, no doubt.

          BRIDGET
          Save your flattery, you old dog.
          I know too many of your former
          conquests, to fall into that honey
          pot.
          Chuckle-chuckle...

          COL.LANDA
          Seriously, what happened?

          

          

          

          

          130.

          BRIDGET
          Well, I tried my hand, foolishly I
          might add, at mountain climbing.
          And this was the result.

          COL.LANDA
          Mountain climbing? That's how you
          injured your leg, mountain climbing?

          BRIDGET
          Believe it or not, yes it is.
          A brief moment passes between the two...

          THEN...
          The Colonel BURSTS OUT with UPROARIOUS LAUGHTER. So uproarious
          in fact, that it's quite disconcerting to the four saboteurs.
          The Colonel begins to regain his composure...

          COL.LANDA
          Forgive me, fraulein. I don't mean
          laugh at your misfortune. It's just
          .mountain climbing? I'm curious
          fraulein, what could of ever
          compelled you to undertake such a
          foolhardy endeavor?
          The Double meaning is not lost on the German actress.

          BRIDGET
          Well, I chant be doing it again,
          I can tell you that.

          COL.LANDA
          That cast looks as fresh as my old
          Uncle Gustave, when were you climbing
          this mountain, last night?

          BRIDGET
          Very good eye, Colonel. It happened
          yesterday morning.

          COL.LANDA
          Hummm. And where exactly in Paris
          is this mountain?
          This stops her for a seconded.
          Then Landa laughs it off, taking them off the hook.

          

          

          

          

          13[.

          COL.LANDA
          I'm just teasing you, fraulein. You
          know me, I tease rough. So who are
          your three handsome escorts?

          BRIDGET
          I'm afraid neither three speak a
          word of German. Their friends of
          mine from Italy. This is a wonderful
          Italian stuntman, Antonio Margheriti.
          (Meaning Aldo)
          A very talented cameraman, Enzo Gorlomi.
          (Meaning Donny)
          And Enzo's camera assistant, Dominick
          Decocco.
          The German fraulein turns to the three tuxedo wearing
          Basterds.

          BRIDGET

          (ITALIAN)
          Gentlemen, this is a old friend, Col.
          Sans Landa of the S.S.
          The Basterds know only too well who Landa the Jew Hunter is,
          but they can't show it.

          LT.ALDO

          COL.LANDA
          Margheriti...?

          .Margheriti?

          Turning his gaze to Donny.

          What's your name again?

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          Gorlomi.
          Now to Hirschberg...

          COL.LANDA

          (ITALIAN)
          And you?
          Then Hischberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the

          GROUP;

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          Well, my two cameraman friends need
          to find there seats.
          Col.Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          Not so fast, lets enjoy some champagne.
          Everyone gets a glass.

          COL.LANDA

          - Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please
          join us, I have some friends I'd
          like you to meet.
          Shosanna joins the circle, and is handed a champagne glass.
          This is the first moment The Basterds are aware of Shosanna.

          COL.LANDA

          (FRENCH)
          May I say Mademoiselle, you look
          divine.

          SHOSANNA

          This lovely young lady, is Mademoiselle

          and she is our hostess for the evening.

          (FRENCH)
          And Mademoiselle, this battered, broken,
          and none worse for the wear German
          goddess, is Bridget Von Hammersmark.

          I'm afraid my companions don't speak
          any French, there Italian. This is
          Antonino, Enzo, and Dominick.
          All three smile goofy spaghetti bender smiles.

          COL.LANDA

          (FRENCH)
          Actually fraulein Von Hammersmarks
          Italian associates, need help finding
          there seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle
          Mimieux would be so kind to escort
          them?

          SHOSANNA

          (FRENCH)
          It would be my pleasure. Let me see
          your tickets?
          Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her.
          Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo,
          then follow the young french girl into the auditorium.

          INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and black
          uniforms.
          Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats.
          After she points out their seats, she turns to leave...
          Hirschberg...
          .reaches out and grabs her wrist.
          He looks her in the face, and filled with tremendous guilt,
          because if he's successful tonight he's going to blow this
          cute French girl to smithereens, he says;

          HIRSCHBERG
          Grazie.

          

          

          

          
          13r.
          The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian
          boy with slicked back hair, that makes him look kind of
          Jewish, with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful
          tonight, she's going to burn him alive, and says;

          SHOSANNA
          Prego.

          BACK TO LOBBY
          They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER
          YELLS in GERMAN in the lobby;

          GERMAN SOLDIER
          Take your seats! The show is about to
          begin! Everybody take your seatsl
          Col.Landa, Lt.Aldo, and Bridget are still together.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          I must call The Fuhrer. He doesn't
          want to make his entrance untill
          everybody seated. Come with me Frau
          Von Hammersmark. The Fuhrer has
          heard your here, and he wishes to
          commend you personally.

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          Me? Why?

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          Don't be modest. Everybody is quite
          taken with your resolve. A accident,
          like you've just experienced, and
          yet you still show up to to a
          important Party event. The Fuhrer
          was quite adamant in his gratitude.
          We'll use Mademoiselle Mimieux's office.
          (To Aldo
          in Italian)
          I'm afraid I must rob you of your
          companion, but only for a moment.

          BRIDGET

          (ITALIAN)
          Yes, apparently The Fuhrer wishes
          to commend me.

          Wait here a moment. I promise I won't
          detain her long.
          What are ether of them suppose to do, argue?
          Col.Landa goes over to one of the Nazi GAURD/USHER, and
          whispers in his ear, gesturing toward Aldo. Like he's saying,
          leave the boy alone, till we come back... .Or is he?
          Col.Landa limps Bridget away towards Shosannas office.
          As Aldo stands in the lobby, more and more people enter the
          auditorium, till it's only Aldo and the six Nazi Gaurd/Ushers
          in the now vacant lobby.

          INT - SHOSANNA'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          Shosanna's cinema manager office. It's small, cluttered, and
          dominated by a desk.
          They both enter.
          Col.Landa closes the door behind him, and LOCKS IT.
          Bridget notices, but says nothing.
          Now the two Germans are alone.

          COL.LANDA
          Have a seat fraulein.
          Pointing at one lone chair in front of the desk.
          She lowers herself in the chair.
          Instead of moving around to the other side of the desk,
          opposite her. The SS Colonel pulls another little chair over,
          and places it in front of the fraulein.
          He sits. Their knees almost touching.
          The colonel points to the foot not in the cast.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          Let me see your foot.

          BRIDGET

          (GERMAN)
          I beg your pardon?

          

          

          

          

          1 31
          Patting his lap.

          COL.LANDA
          Put your foot in my lap.

          BRIDGET
          Colonel, you embarrass me.

          COL.LANDA
          I assure you fraulein, my intention
          is not to flirt.
          Patting his lap more with more aggression.
          The nervous fraulein, lifts up her strapy dress shoe enclosed
          foot, and places it in the Colonel's lap.
          The Colonel, very delicately, unfastens the thin straps that
          hold the frauleins shoe on her foot...
          .He removes the shoe...
          .Leaving only the frauleins bare foot...

          THEN...
          He removes from his heavy SS coat pocket, the pretty dress shoe
          the fraulein left behind at La Louisiane...
          He slips it on her foot...
          .it fits like a glove.
          Bridget knows she's BUSTED.
          Col.Landa smiles and says in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          What's that American expression...
          "if the shoe fits...you must wear it".
          He removes her foot from his lap.

          BRIDGET

          What now Colonel?

          COL LANDA

          .to my last breath.

          COL.LANDA

          (GERMAN)
          "Resist to your last breath"?

          SUDDENLY...
          Hans LUNGES forward, putting his strong mitts around Bridget
          Von Hammersmarks lily white delicate neck, and with all the
          violence of a Lion in mid-pounce, SQUEEZES with all his MIGHT.
          Bridgets face turns tomato RED, as the VEINS in her face
          BULGE, and her esophagus is CRUSHED in his GRIP.
          With a violent YANK, he JERKS her TO THE FLOOR. She TUMBLES
          out of the chair, Landa never releasing his GRIP around her
          throat. Nov fully on top of her, he BEARS DOWN, SQUEEZING THE
          VERY LIFE OUT OF HER. Every thing he has, he brings to bear on
          the elegant ladies neck.
          Then, to finally finish her off, he begins BANGING THE BACK OF

          HER HEAD, HARD AGAINST THE FLOOR...

          BANG!

          BANG!

          BANG?
          She's dead.
          He releases the grip around her throat. His hands are

          TREMBLING...
          He rises.
          Strangling the very life out of somebody with your bear hands,
          is the most violent act a human being can commit.
          Also, only humans strangle, the opposable thumbs being quite
          important part of the endeavor. As Hans Landa stands, the
          sheer violence he had to call on to accomplish this task,
          still surges through him. He tries to gain control of the
          trembling, that is rippling through his body. He takes out a
          silver SS FLASK(filled with peach schnapps), and knocks back
          a couple of swigs. He holds his hand out in front of him. The
          TREMBLING is beginning to subside. He picks up the telephone.

          

          

          

          

          139-
          Into the phone in German he says;

          COL.LANDA
          Inform The Fuhrer the audience has
          taken there seats, and we're ready
          to begin.
          Step one, in Hans master plan, done.
          He then dials another number...

          INT - LOBBY - NIGHT
          Aldo in the lobby...

          WHEN...
          .he's JUMPED by the SIX NAZI USHERS...
          He's THROWN ROUGHLY to the ground face first. Like the modern
          day Secret Service, within seconds, his wrists are handcuffed
          behind his back, he's searched, they find the BOMB attached to
          his ankle, it's removed, a BLACK CLOTH BAG is pulled over his
          head, then he's hoisted up, and RUSHED out of the building.
          This happens in mere seconds, and quietly too, no one in the
          auditorium is none the wiser...

          INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
          ,including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting amongst the
          master race, waiting for showtime.

          EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT
          The Six Nazi Soldiers, hustle the hooded Aldo, down the red
          carpet, then into the alley besides the cinema.
          Aldo's put up against a wall.
          Inside the black hood, he's SCREAMING every insulting thing
          about Germany, Germans, German food, German
          shepherd... anything.

          COL.LANDA'S VOICE(OS)
          Shut up!
          The faceless black hood does.
          Col.Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded
          prisoner, says in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          As Stanley said to Livingston;
          Lt.Aldo Raine, I presume?

          

          

          

          
          I 'to.

          LT. ALDO
          Hans Landa?

          COL.LANDA
          You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
          Alas, your now in the hands of the
          SS. My hands to be exact. And they've
          been waiting along time, to touch you.
          He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's
          face right in the middle of the hood.
          Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES.

          COL.LANDA
          Caught ya flinching.
          In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck.
          Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the
          truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform,
          bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant.
          The Truck drives off.
          Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers
          motorcade pull up to the cinema.. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels,
          Francesca, and the rest of the entourage, make there way down
          the red carpet into the cinema.
          Landa smiles.

          EXT TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT
          We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of
          night.
          We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino.

          INT - TRUCK(MOVING) - NIGHT
          The two hooded prisoners, bounce along in the back of the
          truck.
          Utivich, is crying inside his hood.

          LT.ALDO
          Utivich?

          UTIVICH
          Is that you Lieutenant?

          LT. ALDO
          Yep.

          

          

          

          
          lyl.

          UTIVIC}I
          Do you know what happened to Donny?
          Hirchberg? The woman?

          LT.ALDO
          No I do not.

          UTIVICH
          Lieutenant, sorry I'm crying.

          LT. ALDO
          Nothin to be sorry about, son.
          This bag, get to anyone.

          UTIVICH
          Not exactly John Wayne, am I?

          LT.ALDO
          John Waynes a pampered movie star.
          He burst into tears, if his cook,
          busts his yoke at breakfast. Just
          try puttin a bag over his head, and
          hear what kinda sounds he makes.
          Utivich, giggles through the tears.

          LT.ALDO
          I just want you to know, son, I was
          real proud of you tonight. Learnin
          how to drive overnight. Driving in
          that Limo line. You was in the hot
          seat, son, and you stood up real good.
          Utivich Cries LOUDER.
          Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot
          on top.
          The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on Utivich.
          In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity.

          EXT- COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
          The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris(not La
          Louisaiane),
          The two hooded prisoners, are walked inside the establishment.

           INT - COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT
          The hooded men are lead into the closed for business, but open
          for something else, rustic tavern.

          

          

          

          
          0The Nazi Guards, unlock the handcuff, then sit them down inchairs.
          Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF.
          The two prisoners, are seated at a table, in what they can now
          see, is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one
          bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end
          of the table, sits Colonel Hans Landa.
          A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at  a impressive looking two way
          radio set up in the tavern.
          Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled,
          discombobulated American soldiers.
          They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene.

          COL.LANDA
          Italian? Really?

          (BEAT)
          What could you have possibly been
          thinking?

          LT. ALDO
          Well, I speak alittle Italian -

          COL.LANDA
          I speak a little Tagalog, but I
          wouldn't begin to presume I could
          pass for Filipino. Don't get me
          wrong, I understand you were in a
          pickle, what with you losing your
          Germans. And I have nothing but
          admiration for improvisation.
          Still.... Chico Marx is more
          convincing. if the three of you had
          shown up to the premiere dressed
          in womans attire, it would have been
          more convincing.
          Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners.

          (GERMAN)
          You may leave us. But stay alert
          outside.
          They exit, leaving the Colonel, the Lieutenant, the
          Private and a German Radio Man in the corner.

          

          

          

          

          "43'

          COL.LANDA
          So your Aldo the Apache?

          LT. ALDO
          So your The Jew Hunter?

          COL.LANDA
          Jew Hunter, (pfuit), I'm a detective.
          A damn good detective. Finding
          people is my specialty. So naturally,
          I worked for the Nazi's finding people.
          And yes, some of them were Jews.
          But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck.

          UTIVICH
          Well you do hafts admit, it is
          catchy.

          COL.LANDA
          Do you control the nicknames, your
          enemies bestow on you? Aldo the
          Apache and The Little Man?

          UTIVICH
          What do you mean, The Little Man?

          COL.LANDA
          The Germans nickname for you.

          UTIVICH
          The Germans nickname for me is, The
          Little Man?

          COL.LANDA
          Or "The Little One, ether one means you.
          And as if to make my point, I'm
          a little surprised how tall you
          were in real life. I mean, your a
          little fellow. But not circus midget
          little, as your reputation would
          suggest.

          LT.ALDO
          Where is my men? Where is Bridget
          Von Hammersmark?

          COL.LANDA
          Bridget Von Hammersmark. Oh I'm sure
          she's in whatever, big bubbling
          cesspool in hell, the devil reserves
          for traitors of her ilk.

          

          

          

          

          COL. LANDA

          (COR'T)
          Well, lets just say, she got what
          she deserved. And when you purchase
          friends like Bridget Von Hammersmark,
          you get what you pay for.
          Now as far as your Pisanos,
          Sgt.Donowitz, and Pt.Hirschberg-

          LT. ALDO
          How do you know our names?

          COL.LANDA
          Lt.Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't
          interrogate every single one of your
          swastika marked survivors... .?
          We simply aren't operating on the
          level of mutual respect I assumed.
          Now, back to the whereabouts of your
          two Italian saboteurs. At this
          moment, both Hirschberg, and
          Donowitz, should be sitting in the
          very seats we left them in. Seats,
          0023 and 0024, if my memory serves.
          Explosives, still around
          there ankle, still ready to
          explode. And your mission, some
          would call a terrorist plot, as of
          this moment, is still a go.
          The two Basterds don't believe this. It can't be true.

          LT. ALDO
          That's a pretty exciting story.
          What's next, Eliza on the ice?

          COL.LANDA
          However, all I have to do, is pick
          pick up that phone right there.
          Inform the cinema, and your plans
          kupet.

          LT. ALDO
          IF, their still there, and IF their
          still alive, and that's one big IF,
          there ain't no way, you gonna take
          them boys without settin off them
          bombs.

          

          

          

          

          I R.T.

          COL.LANDA

          M
          I have no doubt, and yes, some
          Germans will die., and yes, it will
          ruin the evening, and yes, Goebbels
          will be very very very mad at you
          for what you've done to his big night.
          But you won't get Hitler, you won't
          get Goebbels, you won't get Gering,
          and you won't get Boorman. And you
          need all four to end the war.

          (PAUSE)
          But if I don't pick up that phone,
          right there, you may very well get
          all four. And if you get all four,
          you end the war...tonight.
          The Nazi Colonel lifts up the bottle of Chianti, and fills
          three glasses. As he pours, he says;

          COL.LANDA
          So gentlemen, lets discuss the
          prospect of ending the war-tonight.
          All three have their Chianti filled glasses.

          COL.LANDA
          So the way I see it, since Hitlers
          death, or possible rescue, rests
          solely on my reaction...If I do
          nothing ...it's as if I'm causing his
          death, even more then yourselves.
          Would you agree?

          LT. ALDO
          I guess so.

          COL.LANDA
          How about you Uitivich?

          UITIVICH
          I guess so too.

          COL.LANDA
          Good, we more or less, all agree.
          Gentlemen, I have no intention, of
          Killing Hitler, and killing Goebbels,
          and Killing Gerring, and killing
          Boorman, not to mention winning the
          war single handedly for the allies,
          only later, to find myself standing
          before a Jewish tribunal.

          

          

          

          
          I q
          Now they get it.

          COL.LANDA
          If you want to win the war, tonight,
          We have to make a deal.

          LT.ALDO
          What kinda deal?

          COL.LANDA
          The kind you wouldn't have the
          authority to make. However, I'm sure
          this mission of yours, has a
          commanding officer? A General, I'm
          betting. For ..

          (THINKING)
          .O.S.S. would be my guess.
          Aldo's eyebrows reveal that was a good guess.

          COL.LANDA
          Oooh, that's a bingo. Is that the
          way you say it, That's a bingo?

          LT.ALDO
          You just say, bingo.

          COL.LANDA
          Bingo! How fun. But I digress, where
          were we? Oh yes, make a deal. Over
          there is a very capable two way
          radio. And sitting behind it, is a
          more then capable radio operator,
          named Herrman. Get me somebody on
          the other end of that radio with the
          power of the pen, to authorize my
          - Let's call it, the terms of my
          conditional surrender, if that taste
          better going down.

          Landa, with radio headphones over his ears, and a microphone
          in his hand, talks to the UNSEEN/UNHEARD American Brass on the
          other end.

          COL.LANDA
          .So, when the military history of
          this night is written, it will be
          recorded, that I was part of
          "Operation Rino" from the very
          beginning, as a double agent.
          Anything I've done in my guise as a
          SS Colonel, was sanctioned by The
          O.S.S., as a necessary evil to
          establish my cover with The Germans.
          And it was my placement, of
          Lt.Raines dynamite in Hitler and
          Goebbels opera box that assured
          there demise. By the way, that last
          part is actually true.

          FLASH ON

          BACK TO LANDA

          COL.LANDA
          I want my full military pension and
          benefits under my proper rank.
          I want to receive the congregational
          medal of honor, for my invaluable
          assistance in the toppling of the Third
          Reich.

          

          

          

          
          He looks over and sees Aldo and Uitvich watching the one sided
          conversation.

          COL.LANDA
          In fact, I want all the members of
          "Operation Kino" to receive the
          congregational medal of honor. Full
          citizenship for myself - but that
          goes without saying. And I would
          like the United States of America to
          purchase property for me on
          Nantuckett island, as a reward for
          all the countless lives I've saved
          by bringing the tyranny of the
          National Socialist party to a
          swifter then imanged end. Do you
          have all that, sir?

          (PAUSE)
          I look forward to seeing you face to
          face as well, sir.

          (PAUSE)
          He's right here.
          The Colonel hands the headphones and microphone to Aldo.

          LT.ALDO
          Yes, sir?
          We HEAR the VOICE on the other end of the radio, give Aldo his

          ORDERS;

          RADIO VOICE(OS)
          Colonel Landa will put you and
          Private Uitivich in a truck as
          prisoners. Then he and his radio
          operator, will get in the truck,
          drive to our lines. Upon crossing
          our lines, Colonel Landa and his
          man will surrender to you. You will
          then take over driving of the truck,
          a bring them straight to me for
          debriefing. Is that clear, Lieutenant?

          LT.ALDO
          Yes, sir.
          The Conversation is over, he puts the radio down.
          The three men look at one another.
          Landa picks up his wine.

          COL.LANDA
          So I suppose the only thing left to
          do is lift a glass, and toast to
          Donowitz and Hirschbergs success.
          You too Herrman, come over here.
          The four men, Col.Hans Landa, Lt.Aldo Raine, Pvt.Smithson
          Uitivich, and Herrman, lift up four glasses of wine.

          COL.LANDA
          Gentlemen, To history, and it's
          Witnesses.

          BACK TO THE PREMIERE

          WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN.
          Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in a ornamental tower in
          a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIER's below.

          A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY
          peering at the German Private through binoculars. He lowers
          the long range glasses, and confers with one of his OFFICERS.

          (RUSSIAN)
          What's the death toll?

          OFFICER

          (RUSSIAN)
          47, so far.

          WE HEAR A SHOT.

          OFFICER

          (RUSSIAN)
          48. General, I implore you, we must
          destroy that tower!

          GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY

          (RUSSIAN)
          That tower is one of the oldest, and
          most beautiful structures in Russia.
          I won't be responsible for turning a
          thousand years of history into dust!
          A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER, tries to run between two buildings.
          Zoller, gets him.
          Then proceeds to pick him apart, one single bullet at a time.

          SHOSANNA IN PROJECTION BOOTH
          She removes "REEL 4" (The Special Shosanna Reel), and prepares
          it on the 2nd Projector. Reel3, on the first Projector,
          playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it's
          going to be show time.
          Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH;

          MARCEL
          It's time. I should go lock the auditorium,
          and take my place behind the screen.
          This is the last time they will ever see each other, too much
          to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I
          die wet one on her.

          DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG
          sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS
          UNIFORM NAZI'S. They've developed a dopey way of communicating
          with each other in this hostel environment.
          Basically, speaking English like it were gibberish Italian.
          They say English words, only adding a "I", or a "A", or a "O",
          to the end of it. And saying it in a exaggerated Italian
          accent, complete with pantomimes.
          Donowitz leans into Hirschberg, and says in a wispier;
          They speak in ITALIA-ISH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          SGT.DONOWITZ

          (ITALIA-ISH)
          I-a Go-a Toilet-a, Set-ta Boom-a.
          (I go to the toilet and set the bomb)
          When-a I-a Go-a, you-a Set-ta Boom-a.
          (When I go, you set your bomb)
          Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes, he can't set his bomb
          surrounded by all these Nazi's.
          Donowitz, pantomimes crossing his legs, setting bomb on ankle
          in his seat. Then getting up, and dropping it in the back of
          the auditorium, in the dark.
          Hirschberg doesn't get it.

          HIRSCHBERG
          What-a?
          (What?)
          Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less
          patience.

          15Z.
          Donowitz stands from his seat, and walks out of the dark
          auditorium, into the lobby. The Nazi Guards/Ushers are gone,
          the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down
          to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant
          the Boom-a, I mean, The Bomb.

          DESCENDING THE STAIRS
          leading to the Water closet. Like a lot of old cinema's, not
          only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you
          had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to
          it. In the Smoking Lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the
          Guards/Ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers
          gossip. They're all in dress uniforms, and all are armed.
          Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool, and walks right through
          them.
          They look up, but don't disturb there time off vibe.
          Donny enters the big Water Closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI
          ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if
          Donny has the whole wash room to himself.
          He enters the privacy of a toilet stall, locks the door.

          MARCEL IN LOBBY
          He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth,
          into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors,
          and peers inside.

          WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCELS POV:
          in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to
          Fredrick's exploits on screen.
          Marcel closes the door, and with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT.

          INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM
          WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on
          ether side of the screen....due to curtains placed there, no
          one notices Marcels actions.
          Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN, WE SEE the IMAGE
          (backward) of Fredricks sniper battle HUGE COVERING ENTIRE
          SIDE ROOM ...A PILE of over300nitrate FILM PRINTS, lay like a
          junk pile, right behind the screen.
           Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen, and
           Pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, a absolute no-no in a
           cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?4.
           He smokes, and waits for his cue to... .BURN IT DOWN!

          

          

          

          

          )53.

          FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX
          along side Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and BOORMAN. On screen
          the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in
          Goebbels ear, we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic
          face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels), and says in German;

          GOEBBELS
          Perfectly understandable, dear boy.
          You go now, and we'll see you after
          the show.
          He exits the opera box. And walks to the projection booth
          door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way.
          The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly,
          stares at him.
          Be, as per usual, is all smiles and charm.
          They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH;

          FREDRICK
          Are you the manager, of this cinema?
          I want my money back. That actor in
          the movie stinks.
          He laughs.

          IV
          She doesn't even smile. She says, in all serious business;

          SHOSANNA
          What are you doing here?

          FREDRICK
          I came to visit you.

          SHOSANNA
          Can't you see how busy I am?

          FREDRICK
          Then allow me to lend a assist.

          SHOSANNA
          Fredrick it's not funny, you can't
          be here. This is your premiere, you
          need to be out there with them.
          As Fredrick prepares to tell his little tale, with all the
          charm at his command, Shosanna listens, knowing the third reel
          is just about over, and her big reel change is coming up.

          

          

          

          

          FREDRICK
          Normally, you would be.right.
          And for all the other films I do,
          I intend to endure evenings like
          tonight, in the proper sprit.
          However the fact remains, this film,
          is based on my military exploits.
          And in this case, my exploits
          consisted of me killing many men.
          Consequently, the part of the film
          that's playing now,... .I don't like
          watching this part.

          SHOSANNA
          Fredrick, I am sorry, but -

          FREDRICK
          - So, I thought, I'd come up here
          and do what I do best, annoy you.
          And from the look on your face, it
          would appear I haven't lost my touch.

          DONNY IN TOILET
          Sgt.Donowitz, with BOMB in his lap, sets the timer, six
          minutes from now. He then places the bomb in the back of the
          toilet tank.

          CAMERA ON FLOOR OF WATER CLOSET
          we see the tile of the floor stretch out before us. We see
          Donny's feet in the closed toilet stall. We HEAR, the OFF
          SCREEN Nazi Enlisted Man, finish his piss. Then HIS SHOES WALK
          THROUGH FRAME... .WE FOLLOW THEM TO... .The SINK...WE STAY ON
          The Shoes ...as WE HEAR The Soldier WASH HIS HANDS... THEN...
          THE CAMERA RISES UP HIS PANT LEG...Till...WE"RE EYE LEVEL with
          the German Soldier, with a ARMY CAP on his head, who's
          done washing his hands....THEN....The Soldier removes
          his cap, brushes some bangs out of his face, and WE CAN SEE

          THE SWASTIKA HAND CARVED INTO HIS FOREHEAD, UNDENIABLE MARK
          OF THE BASTARDS. He SPLASHES some WATER ON HIS FACE, puts his
          cap back on his head, and joins his comrades in the smoking
          lounge. As he exits FRAME, he says to somebody OFF SCREEN;

          SWASTIKA FOREHEAD

          (GERMAN)
          Hey Fritz, you owe me three cigarettes,
          now pay up.

          SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK
          Fredrick still outside the doorway, and Shosanna, still baring
          the way.

          SHOSANNA
          I have to get prepared for the reel
          change.

          

          

          

          

          FREDRICK
          Let me do it?

          SHOSANNA
          No.

          FREDRICK
          Oh please, it's been two years since
          i've done a reel change.

          SHOSANNA
          I said, no.

          FREDRICK
          (Cute whine)
          Come on, it's my premiere.

          SHOSANNA
          Are you so use to the Nazi's kissing
          your ass, you've forgotten what the
          word,ÃÂ°ÃÂ°No" means? No Fredrick, you
          can't come in here, now go away!
          No subtitles for Fredrick needed this time, he gets it.
          He does a one-armed PILE DRIVE PUSH on the door, knocking both
          it OPEN, and Shosanna back into the room.
          Fredrick, a different cat then we've seen up till now, enters
          the booth, closing the door behind him, and LOCKING it.
          The quite startled Shosanna, says to Fredrick;

          SHOSANNA
          Fredrick, you hurt me.

          FREDRICK
          Well, it's nice to know you can feel
          something. Even if it's just physical
          pain.
          Fredrick steps forward...
          Shosanna steps backwards...

          FREDRICK
          I'm not a man you say, "Go away"
          to. There's over three hundred
          dead bodies in Russia, that if
          they could, would testify to that.
          After what I've done for you, you
          disrespect me at your peril.

          

          

          

          

          156.

          BACK TO WASHROOM
          The Swastika Forehead Soldier, get a light for his cigarette.
          He takes a big drag.

          SOLDIER'S POV:
          He faces the washroom, and down that long throw, he sees Donny
          emerge from the toilet stall. His tuxedo jacket is off, and
          draped over his right hand. Sporting the white dress shirt,
          and black tuxedo vest. He's quite far away, so now he just
          looks like some guy in a tux, who just finished taking a shit.
          Donny walks toward us ...

          CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          seeing him get closer...

          SOLDIER POV:
          Donny gets closer...

          CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          seeing him closer still...

          SOLDIER POV:
          Donny gets closer...

          CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          begins to notice...

          SOLDIER POV:
          Donny getting closer, begins to notice, German soldier notice
          him...

          CU SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          now Donny is close enough for the Soldier to recognize. His
          face SCREAMS;

          SWASTIKA FOREHEAD
          The Bear Jew!1!
          The Soldier's GUN is out of it's holster, and rising toward
          Donny's chest...

          WHEN...
          Donny raises his right arm, with the tuxedo jacket on it, and
          FIRES a GUN concealed under it.
          HITTING Swastika Forehead in the chest...Who finishes raising
          his GUN, FIRING HITTING Donny in the chest...
          The Two Soldier's FIRE INTO each other.... Till there weapons are
          empty, and the two men lie dead on the floor.
          The Nine other NAZI'S in the room, stand shocked at what just
          happened in front of them.

          SHOSANNA AND FREDRICK IN PROJECTION BOOTH
          Fredrick hears the gunshots below them, and turns towards the
          door.

          FREDRICK
          What the hell was that?
          While Fredrick's back is turned, Shosanna takes a GUN out of
          her pocket, and SHOOTS Fredrick THREE TIMES in the back...
          ..Be CRASHES HARD into the door, then FALLING FACE FIRST to
          the floor...
          Shosanna, gun in hand, looks out projection booth window into
          the audience...
          The ON SCREEN BATTLE rages so LOUDLY with GUNFIRE, that her
          weapon didn't stand a chance of being heard.
          Her eyes go from the audience...
          .up to the big screen...
          .Which holds FREDRICK ZOLLER in a tight handsome CLOSE UP.
          The Face on the silver screen, breaks the young girl's
          heart...
          .She looks to his body, lying face down on the floor, blood
          flowing from the holes she put in his back...
          .His body moves a little, and he lets out a painful MOAN...
          .DIEING though he is, at this moment, Fredrick is still

          ALIVE...
          Shosanna moves to him...
          ..She touches him, and he lets out another MOAN...
          .She turns his body over on it's back...
          ..he's holding a LUGER in his hand...
          .he FIRES TWICE...

          BANG BANG
          Two bullets HIT HER POINT BLANK IN THE CHEST...
          THROWING HER against the wall, then FALLING FORWARD on her
          knees to the floor...
          ..Fredrick, Luger still in hand, takes aim from the floor...

          HITTING the bloody girl on the floor, in the thigh...
          .SPINNING her BODY around in agony...
          Like he did to the Russian on screen, he picks her apart, one
          bullet at a time...

          .FIRES...

          BULLET BLOWS OFF HEEL OF HER FOOT...
          Luger drops to floor, Fredrick DIES.
          Our young French Jewish heroine, lies on the projection booth
          floor, in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with
          bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and

          DIEING...

          WHEN...
          ..the little bell on the 1st projector, starts to ring,
          informing the projectionist, it's time for The REEL CHANGE.
          Dieing or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she's
          going to have to lift her ass off the floor, and execute this
          fucking reel change.

          CINEMA AUDITORIUM
          The battle on screen continues waging. The audience is
          riveted.
          The FUHRER
          watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle.
          He says to Goebbels in German;

          HITLER
          Extraordinary Joseph, simply
          extraordinary. This is your finest
          film yet.
          Goebbels is beyond proud, he smiles to Francesca, who proudly
          pats his hand.

          PROJECTION BOOTH
          Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great painful
          effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR...

          like the German heroine in one of Riefenstahl's mountain films,

          Piz Palu...

          CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (b/w sky),
          SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so on screen Shosanna is looking
          down on the Nazi's, the way Fredrick was looking down on the
          Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE stares
          down the auditorium of Nazi's, brings to mind Orwells "1984"
          Big Brother.
          HITLER and GOEBBELS
          React.

          HIRSCHBERG
          standing in the middle of the aisle, turns towards the screen.
          When he see's Shosanna's GIANT FACE, he's gobsmacked.

          BEHIND SCREEN

          SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE ON SCREEN
          She stares down the packed house of Nazi's, and says
          in FRENCH;

          SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
          I have a message for Germany. I'm
          interrupting your Nazi propaganda
          horse shit, to inform you despicable
          German swine, that your all going to
          die.
          HITLER and GOEBBELS
          react.

          HIRSCHBERG
          react.

          MARCEL
          smiles.

          SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
          And I want you to look deep in the face
          of The Jew who's going to do it.

          AUDITORIUM AUDIENCE
          While the shocked German audience is transfixed to thescreen,
          behind the heads of most of them...
          The BOMB Landa set in Hitlers and Goebbels opera box...

          EXPLODES.

          

          

          

          
          BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS, HITLER, FRANCESCA, BOORMAN, and
          propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theatre seat, across the
          auditorium, into the opposite wall, and taking out a portion
          of the ceiling as well.
          The crowd reacts...
          The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles, to
          topple from it's jerry-rigged placement, and CRASH on to the
          audience below...
          ON SCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY.

          SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE
          My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is
          the face of Jewish Vengeance! Marcel,

          BURN IT DOWN!

          BEHIND THE SCREEN
          Marcel takes his cigarette, and FLICKS IT into the pile of
          nitrate film.
          ON SCREEN SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the
          scrambling little Nazi's, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE

          OUT OF A GIANT BLAST FURNACE, BURST THROUGH SHOSANNAS FACE,
          and CLIMB UP THE WALLS of the cinema.
          The AUDIENCE
          STAMPEDES towards the exits...

          HIRSCHBERG
          with bomb set on ankle, is caught in a massive Day of the
          Locust SWARM OF BODIES...
          People frantically pound on locked doors, trapping them to
          there grizzly fate.
          The FLAMES and FIRE spread through thr auditorium...
          Hirschberg caught in people crunch, knows this is it.

          HIS ANKLE BOMB GOES OFF
          right underneath everybody in the room.
          The effect this has on the people in the room, is very similar
          to that of the effect a M-80blowing up in a ant hill, would
          have on the ants. The auditorium is a literal red rain of legs,
          arms, heads, torsos, and asses.

          THEN...

          DONOWITZ TOILET BOMB
          BLOWS UP UNDERNEATH the auditorium.

          EXT -- WOODS - MORNING
          It's a misty early morning, in the woodsy area. The German
          truck, with Aldo and Uitvich in the back, and Landa and
          Herrman in the front comes to stop.
          LANDA and HERRMAN IN TRUCK CAB
          Herrman, behind the wheel, tells Landa in German;

          HERRMAN
          These are the American lines, sir.
          In the back of the truck, sit the two last remaining members
          of The Basterds, Lt.Aldo Raine, and Prvt.Smithson Uitivich,
          both with their hands cuffed behind there back.
          Landa and Herrman appear at truck rear, says in ENGLISH;

          COL.LANDA
          Okay Gentlemen, you can climb down.          

          

          143
          Aldo and Uitivich climb down from the truck.
          Col.Landa indicates for Herrman to remove the handcuffs from
          the two prisoners.
          He does.

          COL.LANDA
          Herrman, hand them your weapon.
          He does.
          Col.Landa hands over his LUGER, and his very cool looking SS

          DAGGER.

          COL.LANDA
          I am officially surrendering myself
          over to you, Lt.Raine. We are your
          prisoners.

          LT.ALDO
          Thank you very much Colonel. Uitivich,
          cuff the Colonel's hands behind his
          back.

          COL.LANDA
          Is that really necessary?
          As Uitivich cuffs the. Colonels hands behind his back, Aldo

          SAYS;

          LT.ALDO
          I'm a slave to appearances.
          Then Aldo takes the Luger, and SHOOTS HERRMAN DEAD.
          The bound Col.Landa is appalled.

          COL.LANDA
          Are you mad? What have you done? I made
          a deal with your General for that mans
          life!

          LT. ALDO
          Yeah, they made that deal, but they
          don't give a fuck about him, they
          need you.

          COL.LANDA
          You'll be shot for this.

          

          

          

          
          t 6 q.

          LT.ALDO
          Raw I don't think so, more like I'll
          be chewed out. I've been chewed out
          before. You know, Uitvich and myself,
          heard that deal you made with the Brass.
          End the war tonight? I'd make that deal.
          How bout you Uitivich, you make that
          deal?

          UITIVICH
          I'd make that deal.

          LT.ALDO
          I don't blame ya. Damn good deal.
          And that pretty little nest ya
          feathered for yourself. Well, if
          your willing to barbecue the whole
          high command, I suppose that's worth
          certain considerations. Now I don't
          care about you gettin pensions,
          merit badges, ticker tape parades,
          who gives a damn, let's all go home.
          But .1do have one question?
          When you go to your little place on
          Nantuckett Island, I image you gonna
          take off that handsome looking SS
          uniform of yours, ain't ya?
          For the first time in the movie, Col.Landa doesn't-respond.

          LT.ALDO
          That's what I thought. Now that...
          .I can't abide. How bout you
          Uitivich, can you abide it?

          UITIVICH
          Not one damn bit, sir.

          LT.ALDO
          I mean if I had my way, you'd wear
          that goddamn uniform for the rest of
          your pecker suckin life. But I'm
          aware that's ain't practical. I mean
          at some point ya gotta hafta take it
          off.
          He opens LandaSS DAGGER, and holds the BLADE in front of Hans
          face.

          LT.ALDO
          So I'm gonna give you a little
          somethin you can't take off.

          CUT TO

          CU COL.LANDA
          The Dagger has just completed carving a swastika deep into his
          forehead.

          COL.LANDA'S POV:
          On the ground, looking up at Aldo, bloody knife in hand, who
          straddles him.. And Uitivich, who's next to him. The two
          Basterds admire Aldo's handiwork.

          LT.ALDO
          You know somethin Uitivich, I think
          this just might be my masterpiece.

          La scène suivante, présente dans la version originale du film, a
          été coupée dans de nombreuses copies diffusées, de nos jours,
          aussi bien au cinéma qu'à la télévision.
                         
          ILOT BOISÉ - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR

          C'est un paysage romantique, un peu irréel, semblant sortir d'un
          conte de fées.
                         
          Une petite île, où sont plantés de nombreux arbres. Nous sommes
          face à l'île, comme si la caméra était située sur l'eau, ou bien
          sur la rive en face de l'île.
                         
          Un peu sur la droite, on aperçoit une coquette petite maison au
          milieu des arbres. Devant la maison, un arbre est tombé dans
          l'eau, mais l'extrémité inférieure du tronc repose toujours sur la
          rive de l'île.
                         
          Une petite fille de cinq ou six ans, vêtue d'une belle robe
          blanche, monte sur le tronc d'arbre, suivie d'un jeune garçon
          d'une dizaine d'années, vêtue très élégamment comme un petit
          écolier anglais. Le petit garçon jette une branche dans l'eau,
          puis vient s'asseoir à côté de la petite fille. Elle a un panier
          d'osier à la main, et lui un gros livre sous le bras. Les deux
          enfants se sourient. Il pose le livre sur ses genoux. Elle se
          penche vers lui.

          La petite fille ressemble étrangement à celle qui sera Paulette
          dans la suite du film, et le petit garçon à celui qui sera Michel
          Dollé.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est l'histoire d'une petite fille...
                         
                          PAULETTE
           D'une petite fille comment ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           D'une petite fille comme toi, et d'un petit garçon...
                         
                          PAULETTE
           D'un petit garçon comme toi ?
                         
          Michel relève sa casquette, déboutonne sa veste, et ouvre le
          livre.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Écoute...
                         
          Il remet sa casquette en place. Paulette ouvre son panier et tend
          une sucette à Michel.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Tu veux une sucette ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Après.
                         
          Gros plan de la couverture en maroquin du livre, et qui représente
          les deux enfants se tenant par la main. Michel ouvre le livre à la
          première page.
                         
          Le générique est inscrit sur les pages du livre, et il défile au
          fur et à mesure que Michel tourne les pages. La page qui suit la
          fin du générique raconte le début de l'histoire.
          Les doigts de Michel suivent le texte pendant qu'il lit.
                         
           MICHEL DOLLÉ (voix off)
           « Jamais le mois de juin n'avait été aussi beau que cette
           année-là. »
                         
          Paulette écoute Michel avec beaucoup d'attention tout en suçant sa
          sucette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tout éclatait de joie. Les blés, à travers la France,
           commençaient à jaunir et préparaient du pain... »
                         
          Michel tourne la page du livre.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           « ... pour quarante millions d'hommes... Et puis le soir,
           quand les hommes avaient bien fait leur travail, le chant
           du rossignol ruisselait dans les bois. » Parce qu'au mois
           de juin, les rossignols chantent.
          Gros plan sur le livre et le doigt de Michel qui suit le texte.
                         
           MICHEL DOLLÉ (voix off)
           « Et les rossignols de cette année-là chantaient comme
           d'habitude et ne savaient pas ce qui se passait en
           France. »
                         
          Michel tourne la page. La page suivante occupe tout l'écran, et
          représente un plan général d'une rivière traversée par un pont.
                         
                         NOTE
          Retour à la version normale, telle qu'elle est présentée dans
          toutes les copies du film. Dans les copies, où la scène précédente
          a été coupée, le générique est toujours présenté sur un livre dont
          on tourne les pages, sauf que le fond, en arrière-plan du livre,
          n'est plus la rivière, mais un tissu à motif de fleurs, et que la
          main, qui tourne les pages, n'est plus celle de Michel, mais celle
          d'une femme. Après la fin du générique, on passe directement sur
          une vue plus rapprochée du pont enjambant la rivière. Sur cette
          image apparaît, en lettres blanches, le texte suivant :
                         
                          JUIN
                          1940
                         
          ROUTE DE CAMPAGNE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Plan d'ensemble du pont. Ce pont est la continuation d'une route
          de campagne, sur laquelle marche un grand nombre de personnes,
          portant des sacs et des valises, trainant des enfants. Certains
          poussent ou tirent des charrettes, sur lesquelles sont empilés des
          objets hétéroclites. Certaines de ces charrettes sont tirées par
          un cheval. Il y a même quelques vélos, des voitures et des
          camionnettes.
                         
          Plans sur la route, puis de nouveau le pont, et plans rapprochés
          sur les gens en exode.
                         
          Nous reconnaissons cette scène comment étant celle du
          malheureusement célèbre exode de 1940.
                         
          Tout à coup, on entend un bruit de moteur d'avion. Un plan du ciel
          nous montre un groupe d'avions allemands. (La plupart des photos
          d'avions allemands dans le ciel proviennent de films d'archive de
          la guerre.)
                         
          La foule des gens en exode fuit dans tous les sens pour éviter les
          bombes lâchées par les avions, abandonnant, sur la route, leur
          charrettes, leurs voitures, leurs vélos, et même leurs baluchons.
          Les gens se précipitent sur les bas-côtés de la route, se cachant
          derrière les talus. Le bruit des moteurs d'avion augmente et une
          femme se met à hurler.
                         
          Plan du ciel. Un avion bascule sur l'aile pour descendre en piqué
          sur la foule.
                         
          Retour sur la foule des réfugiés qui court pour s'abriter des
          avions.
                         
          Un avion lâche des bombes.
          Des bombes éclatent près du pont, soulevant des nuages de
          poussière. Plan rapproché sur une femme qui hurle.
                         
          Les bruits des avions s'éloignent et les gens aplatis à terre
          commencent à relever la tête. Puis ils se précipitent vers la
          route en se bousculant pour récupérer leurs affaires et reprendre
          leur exode.
                         
          Parmi ces gens, un jeune couple avec une petite fille blonde de
          cinq ou six ans. Il s'agit de Paulette et de ses parents. Paulette
          tient un petit chien noir et blanc dans ses bras. La famille
          s'installe dans sa voiture (une Peugeot 202 décapotable et
          décapotée), le père au volant, la mère à côté de lui avec la
          fillette sur ses genoux. Le père actionne le démarreur, le moteur
          tousse, mais ne veut pas démarrer. Il recommence l'opération deux
          fois, toujours sans succès. On entend une autre voiture qui
          klaxonne derrière lui. Le père lève les bras en signe
          d'impuissance et essaie, encore une fois, de démarrer... sans
          succès. Cette fois-ci, ce ne sont plus des coups de klaxon, mais
          des cris qui retentissent.
                         
           DES VOIX DIVERSES
           Alors quoi ?... Dégagez !... Dégagez !...
                         
                          PÈRE PAULETTE
           Mais je fais ce que je peux !
                         
          La mère, qui semble gênée, se retourne. Le père, lui, sort de la
          voiture et soulève le capot du moteur. Si les piétons continuent à
          marcher, en jetant un regard rapide et indifférent à la voiture,
          les automobilistes, qui sont bloquées par la voiture en panne,
          vocifèrent des propos inintelligibles. Puis ils se rapprochent de
          la voiture, bouscule le père, et commencent à pousser la voiture
          vers le bas-côté. La mère, affolée, sort de la voiture, avec sa
          fille.
                         
          La voiture dévale le bas-côté de la route et s'immobilise dans une
          prairie. Le père court derrière sa voiture.
                          PÈRE PAULETTE
           Ah, les salauds !...
                         
          Il s'approche de la voiture.
                         
                          PÈRE PAULETTE
           Elle est foutue !...
                         
          Paulette se précipite sur la voiture immobilisée, ouvre la
          portière et récupère son petit chien. Elle le cajole et
          pleurnichant.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Mon petit Jock, mon petit chien...
                         
          Ses parents sortent des paquets et des valises de la voiture.
                         
                          MÈRE PAULETTE
           Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
                         
                          PÈRE PAULETTE
           Mais ne t'énerve pas, il faut passer le pont.
                         
          La mère voudrait emporter tous leurs bagages. Le père s'interpose.
                         
                          PÈRE PAULETTE
           On peut pas tout prendre. On va pas continuer avec trois
           valises !...
                         
          Paulette, indifférente aux problèmes de ses parents, continue à
          cajoler son chien, en marmonnant, d'une voix un peu
          pleurnicharde : « Mon petit chien... Mon petit chien... »
                         
          La mère ramasse ses baluchons et entraîne sa fille vers la route.
          Le père, chargé lui aussi, les suit, mais marque un temps d'arrêt,
          se retourne, et regarde sa voiture une dernière fois.
                         
          Paulette et ses parents arrivent sur la route où tout le monde
          court. On entend, de nouveau, les bruits d'avion qui se
          rapprochent.
                         
          Dans le ciel, arrivée d'une imposante escadrille d'avions. Les
          avions lâchent de nouveau leurs bombes. On voit les bombes qui
          éclatent au milieu des pauvres « exodiens ».
                         
          Les gens courent dans tous les sens. Une vieille femme se cache
          derrière un arbre.
                         
          Le père, la mère et Paulette, comme d'autres personnes qui les
          entourent, se jettent à terre, entourés de leurs paquets.
                         
          Un cheval, attelé à une charrette, se cabre. Une roue de la
          charrette surchargée casse. Le cheval hennit.
                         
          Sur la route, les bombes soulèvent des nuages de poussière. Le
          bruit effraie le petit chien, qui se libère des bras de Paulette
          et s'enfuit vers le pont.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Jock !... Jock !...
                         
          Paulette l'appelle, puis part à sa poursuite. Sa mère la regarde,
          affolée.
                         
                          MÈRE PAULETTE
           Paulette !... Paulette !...
                         
                          PÈRE PAULETTE
           Paulette !...
                         
          Criant « Paulette !... Paulette !... », la mère, suivie du père,
          se lancent, en courant, à la poursuite de Paulette, qui,
          finalement, rattrape son chien au milieu du pont. Les parents
          rejoignent leur fille, qui cajole son chien dans ses bras.
                         
          Un avion fonce vers eux.
                         
          Le père entraîne sa femme et sa fille à se coucher à côté de lui,
          dans une alcôve ménagée dans le parapet du pont.
                         
          Juste au-dessus d'eux, une affiche est collée sur le parapet, et
          sur laquelle est écrit : « Samedi prochain, au Café des Amis, les
          Maîtres du Mystère : le professeur Olaf et son médium Mlle
          Givrialda. ». L'affiche comporte aussi des portraits des deux
          « artistes ».
                         
          Sur le pont, on peut suivre l'avancée du mitraillage effectué par
          l'avion. A chaque impact correspond une petite giclée de
          poussière. Cette ligne de mitraille atteint la petite famille,
          passe sur le corps du père et de la mère, mais évite Paulette,
          plus petite qu'eux. Le père et la mère pousse un cri. Le père
          retombe, inanimé. La mère a un soubresaut puis se retourne sur le
          côté. Paulette relève la tête et regarde sa mère, ne semblant pas
          comprendre ce qui vient de se passer. Elle lui caresse la joue,
          puis caresse sa propre joue. Elle répétera souvent ce dernier
          geste au cours du film. Elle se redresse lentement, puis se
          recouche à côté de sa mère, la tête appuyée sur son chien, qui est
          agité de légers tremblements. Il a donc, lui aussi, été touché par
          la mitraille. Elle reste un long moment à regarder le visage de sa
          mère, puis elle se redresse de nouveau. Elle ramasse son chien et
          se relève complètement. Le chien n'a plus que quelques
          tremblements convulsifs des pattes arrière. Paulette le cajole et
          l'embrasse.
                         
          Autour de Paulette, les bombes continuent à tomber, sans que cela
          semble la perturber.
                         
          Le cheval fou, effrayé par l'une des dernières bombes tirées par
          les avions qui, maintenant, s'éloignent, se met à trotter en
          traînant sa charrette à une roue derrière lui. Il traverse le
          pont. Paulette fait un écart pour l'éviter. Il est suivi par la
          foule des gens qui ont repris leur exode. Paulette se fait
          bousculer sans ménagement. Un homme d'une cinquantaine d'années,
          tirant une charrette à bras, s'arrête à la hauteur de Paulette.
          Sur la charrette, assise sur un amas de colis hétéroclites, une
          vieille femme au visage revêche.
                         
                          L'HOMME
           Ben, qu'est-ce que tu fais là, toi ? Tu veux te faire
           écraser... Allez, viens ! Allez, grimpe !
                         
          L'homme aide Paulette à monter sur la charrette, puis se
          repositionne entre les brancards de sa charrette et se remet en
          marche. Paulette s'assoit sur les paquets à côté de la vieille,
          qui la regarde d'un air peu aimable et dit en grognant à l'homme :
                         
           LA VEILLE FEMME
           On n'est pas assez chargé comme ça ?
                         
          Elle regarde le chien que Paulette tient dans ses bras. Elle
          cherche à le lui prendre et Paulette résiste.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non !
                         
           LA VEILLE FEMME
           Tu vois pas qu'il est mort !
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ah ?... Il est mort ?
          La vieille finit par lui prendre le chien des mains.
                         
           LA VEILLE FEMME
           Mais oui, voyons !
                         
          Elle le jette par-dessus le parapet, dans la rivière.
                         
          Paulette regarde son chien flotter au fil du courant.
                         
          L'homme s'arrête à l'extrémité du pont, gênant un peu le passage
          des automobilistes, qui klaxonnent. Le conducteur d'une
          camionnette est plus insistant que les autres.
                         
                          L'HOMME
           Casse-la moi, ma charrette, et je te fous le feu à ton
           camion.
                         
           LA VEILLE FEMME
           Oh, toi, si tu veux te battre, c'est pas par là, la guerre.
                         
          L'homme se tourne vers elle.
                         
                          L'HOMME
           Et toi, garde ton souffle pour péter !
                         
           LA VEILLE FEMME
           T'occupe pas de mes fesses !
                         
                          L'HOMME
           T'es encore bien contente que je m'en occupe !
                         
          Profitant de la dispute, Paulette descend de la charrette. Elle se
          faufile sous la charrette, puis elle se penche par-dessus le
          parapet, et elle voit son chien qui dérive au fil de l'eau. Elle
          file vers l'extrémité du pont.
                         
          CHEMIN LONGEANT RIVIÈRE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
          Le cheval fou, traînant toujours son attelage cassé, galope le
          long de la rivière.
                         
          Paulette descend sur la berge, et commence à trottiner le long de
          la rivière, suivant la progression de son chien, qui flotte dans
          l'eau.
                         
          Un avion passe dans le ciel.
                         
          Le cheval trotte maintenant plus lentement le long de la berge.
                         
          Paulette trottine toujours le long de la rivière en surveillant
          son chien.
                         
          L'avion repasse dans le ciel, et le cheval s'emballe un peu.
                         
          Le chien se rapproche de la berge.
                         
          Le cheval s'éloigne de la rivière et galope à travers champs.
                         
          Paulette se penche pour récupérer son chien, qui est maintenant
          tout près de la berge.
          Le cheval trotte maintenant sur un chemin, mais ralentit son
          allure. Le moyeu de la roue cassée roule sur le bord du chemin.
          Derrière le cheval et sa charrette cassée, Paulette trottine avec
          son chien dans les bras.
                         
          PRÉ DES DOLLÉ - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Un jeune garçon d'une dizaine d'années tire une vache derrière
          lui, pour l'amener dans le pré, où il y a déjà une dizaine
          d'autres vaches. C'est visiblement un petit paysan, culotte de
          velours côtelée à mi-genoux, chemisette rapiécée, béret et
          galoches sans chaussettes. Il tient un bâton à la main. Il s'agit
          de Michel Dollé. Michel s'arrête net en voyant le cheval s'avancer
          dans le champ.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Un cheval !... Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce cheval ?
                         
          Michel court vers le pré voisin, où l'on aperçoit deux paysans et
          une paysanne en pleine fenaison. Les deux hommes sont le père de
          Michel et son fils aîné Georges, et la femme est la mère de
          Georges et Michel. Près d'eux, un mulet attelé à une charrette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Y a un cheval !...
                         
          Les trois paysans lèvent la tête aux cris de Michel, et regardent
          dans la direction qu'il indique.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben oui... Qu'est-ce que c'est que ce... ?
                         
          Le cheval s'est arrêté au milieu des vaches. Georges court vers
          lui. Au loin, on aperçoit un autre fils Dollé, Raymond, qui arrive
          de la ferme.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Attention ! Georges, c'est un cheval de la guerre !
           Touches-y pas !
                         
          Dans le ciel, un avion passe, presque en rase-motte. Georges
          s'arrête de courir et regarde l'avion. Puis il reprend sa course
          vers le cheval. Il s'approche de l'animal et lui tapote
          l'encolure. L'avion revient, et le cheval, affolé, s'emballe et
          renverse Georges. Georges gémit en se tenant le ventre. Ses
          parents et Raymond accourent vers lui.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Ahhh !...
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ils t'ont tiré dessus ?
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Et non ! C'est ce putain de cheval !
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Je t'avais bien dit, de ne pas y toucher.
          Les parents et Raymond soulèvent Georges pour le transporter à la
          ferme.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Ah !... Ah !... Doucement, bon Dieu !... Vous me faites
           mal... Vous me faites mal !
                         
          Michel les regarde s'éloigner, puis se retourne vers les vaches.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Y'a la Titine qui a foutu le camp !
                         
          En effet, l'une d'entre des vaches se sauve au galop. Michel court
          derrière la vache qui galope vers la rivière.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Hé !... Hé !...
                         
          CHEMIN LONGEANT RUISSEAU - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Paulette marche le long d'un ruisseau, qui doit être un affluent
          de la la rivière qui passe sous le pont de la route. Elle serre
          toujours son chien mort contre elle.
                         
          La vache descend vers le ruisseau... et Paulette, qui se met à
          pleurer. La vache s'arrête un instant près de Paulette, puis elle
          s'éloigne. Michel arrive alors que la vache part en trottant dans
          le ruisseau.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Hé ! Hé !
                         
          Il s'arrête près de Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Alors, quoi ? Tu pouvais pas l'arrêter ?
                         
          Paulette secoue la tête.
                          PAULETTE
           Non.
                         
          Les deux enfants se regardent, un peu intimidés l'un par l'autre.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'as peur ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           J'ai pas peur, c'est pas méchant, une vache.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Alors quoi ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je pouvais pas, j'ai mon chien.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce qu'il a, ton chien ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Il est mort.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           D'où tu viens, toi ?
                         
          Paulette montre une direction assez vague.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Par là.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'es pas d'ici, toi ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non. Et toi ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Moi, oui... Où elle est, ta mère ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Elle est morte.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Et ton père ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Il est mort.
                         
          Un silence. Michel regarde Paulette, sans savoir trop quoi dire.
          Puis il se dirige vers le ruisseau.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Et bien, moi, mon père, il est pas mort ! Et il va me fiche
           une raclée si je ramène pas la vache.
                         
          Il s'arrête au bord de la rive et se tourne vers Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Allez ! Viens ! Aide-moi à la ramener.
                         
          Paulette hésite.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Mais mon chien ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Laisse-le, ton chien, je t'en donnerai un autre.
                         
          Paulette pose le chien au pied d'un fourré, puis elle se dirige
          vers Michel.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Un beau ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Un pas mal.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Où est-ce qu'il est ?
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           A la maison.
                         
          Il lui tend la main pour l'aider à traverser le ruisseau. Derrière
          eux, la vache broute tranquillement. Les deux enfants, se tenant
          par la main, courent vers la vache, qui se met à courir devant eux

          Le chemin qui mène à la ferme des Dollé.
                         
          Un chien trottine sur le chemin vers la vache et les enfants.
                         
          La vache marche devant les enfants. Michel tient son bâton d'une
          main et la chaîne de la vache de l'autre.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           C'est ce chien-là que tu vas me donner ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Non, celui-là, c'est aux voisins.
                         
          Le chien dépasse les enfants et se retourne. Il grogne un peu.
          Michel lui donne un coup de pied.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Il sait nager ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je sais pas. On est fâchés avec les voisins.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Comment c'est, son nom ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Nous, on l'appelle Gouard. C'est le nom des voisins.
                          PAULETTE
           Et vous, c'est comment, votre nom ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Dollé.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Et toi ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Michel... Et toi ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'es parisienne, toi ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Oui. Et toi ?
                         
          Michel répond d'un ton moins enjoué, visiblement déçu de ne pas
          être Parisien.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Moi, non.
                         
          La vache accélère le pas, obligeant les enfants à accélérer le
          leur.

          La vache entre dans l'étable, où se trouvent déjà d'autres vaches.
          Les enfants entrent derrière elle. Paulette a l'air un peu
          soucieuse.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ton père... le chien, il voudra que je le garde ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je sais pas.
                         
          On entend aboyer un chien. Les enfants ressortent pour regarder.
          Le père Dollé les bouscule pour prendre une fourche.

          Le père Dollé, sa fourche à la main, poursuit le chien des Gouard
          à travers la cour. Le chien traverse en courant la passerelle qui
          sépare les deux fermes.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce que tu viens foutre encore chez moi, chien de
           cocu ?
          Les deux enfants se rapprochent du père Dollé. On aperçoit le père
          Gouard, un seau à la main, dans la cour de sa ferme.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Je t'apprendrai à écouter aux portes !

          Plan sur les cours des deux fermes, avec une passerelle de bois
          entre les deux. Le père Gouard regarde son voisin d'un air
          furieux.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Qu'est-ce qu'il t'a fait, mon chien ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Il m'a fait qu'il vient gueuler chez moi. Et j'ai un
           blessé !
                         
          Le père Gouard ricane.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Tu soignes les blessés, maintenant ? Pour qu'ils crèvent
           plus vite ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           C'est bon pour toi, de faire crever les gens !
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Je fais crever les gens, moi ? Et qui c'est qui te l'a
           tirée de l'eau, ta grand-mère ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Elle était déjà noyée, la grand-mère, quand tu l'as
           sortie !
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Preuve que non, c'est qu'on me l'a donnée, la médaille de
           sauvetage.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Je t'avais rien demandé... Et puis, tu me les casses, avec
           ta médaille de sauvetage.
                         
          Il semble furieux, mais il renonce à discuter plus longtemps. Il
          se retourne et découvre Paulette donnant la main à son fils.
          Paulette semble assez inquiète sous le regard perçant du paysan.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce que c'est encore, ça ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Elle vient de la route... Son père a été tué, et puis sa
           mère...
                         
          Le père Dollé se rapproche de Paulette, puis il se tourne, un peu
          gêné, vers Michel.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben... Qu'est-ce que tu veux que j'y fasse ?
          Il s'éloigne d'eux. Michel tire Paulette par la main.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           On pourrait peut-être la garder...
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           T'es pas fou ? Avec ton frère qui est blessé.
                         
          Michel prend un air hypocritement résigné.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ben tant pis... Elle va aller chez les Gouard.
                         
          Dollé sursaute. Il regarde Michel d'un air furieux.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Chez les Gouard ? T'as pas honte ? Pour qu'il demande
           encore une autre médaille ?
                         
          Il pose sa fourche et regarde Paulette en souriant.
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Allez, viens, tu vas nous raconter ça...
                         
          Il pousse les deux enfants vers l'entrée de la ferme. Avant
          d'entrer dans la maison, Il se retourne un instant vers la ferme
          des Gouard.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - SALLE COMMUNE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Michel tient une Paulette un peu apeurée par la main. Elle regarde
          vers le lit où l'on entend Georges qui crie.
                         
           GEORGES DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Et doucement !... Bon Dieu !... Vous me faites mal...
                         
          Les deux enfants, qui se tiennent toujours par la main, s'approche
          du lit, sur lequel on a couché Georges. Son frère Raymond et sa
          soeur Berthe sont en train, assez maladroitement, de lui retirer
          son pantalon. Paulette a l'air assez intriguée par la scène.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Oh, la vache de cheval !... Oh, doucement !...
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Ben, aide un peu !...
                         
          Berthe viens enfin de retirer le pantalon de son frère. Elle le
          retourne pour le plier et de la monnaie tombe des poches.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Mes sous !... Faut qu'on ramasse mes sous.
                         
          Georges s'installe dans le lit, aidé par son frère. Berthe se
          penche pour ramasser l'argent tombé de la poche du malade. La mère
          s'approche, un verre à la main.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Un peu de lait, ça ne te fera pas de mal.
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Il aimerait peut-être mieux de la goutte !
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Oh oui, j'aime mieux !
                         
          Raymond est visiblement le moins brillant, intellectuellement, de
          tous les enfants Dollé. Il borde le lit. La mère se penche vers
          son fils.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Bois, mon pauvre Georges.
                         
          Georges découvre Paulette.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Qui c'est qu'est là... là ?
                         
          Raymond, Berthe et leur mère se tourne vers Paulette.
                         
          Le père repose le verre de vin qu'il venait de boire et s'approche
          de Paulette.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben oui... Ben je vais te dire... Elle vient de la route...
                         
          Il prend Paulette par les épaules. Mais Michel la reprend pour la
          plaquer contre lui.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est moi qui l'ai trouvée.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oh ! Toi !...
                         
          La mère repose le verre de lait, toujours plein, sur la table afin
          de mieux examiner Paulette. Elle s'assoit en face d'elle, pendant
          que le père se coupe une tranche de pain.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben, qui que c'est ?... Mais elle est habillée en
           dimanche...
                         
          Berthe s'approche de Paulette et tâte le tissu de sa robe.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           C'est du tissu comme ça que je voulais pour ma robe.
                         
          Elle soulève la robe de Paulette, qui lui dégage la main.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non !
                         
          Le père continue à couper des tranches de pain.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ses parents ont été tués sur la route. Alors... elle va
           nous raconter ça.
          Le père tend une tranche de pain à Paulette, mais Michel la saisit
          au passage.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est moi qui lui donne.
                         
          Les autres enfants Dollé entourent Paulette.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           C'est vrai, ça ? Tu vas nous raconter la guerre ?
                         
                          RENÉE DOLLÉ
           T'as vu des bombardements ?
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           D'où tu viens ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Comment qu'on t'appelles ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Quel âge que t'as ?...
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oh ! Ben, tu veux rien nous dire.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'as pas soif ?
                         
          Michel prend le verre de lait sur la table et le tend à Paulette,
          qui le regarde d'un air un peu dégoûté.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tiens !
                         
                          PAULETTE
           C'est sale !
                         
          La mère prend le verre des mains de Michel, et plonge son doigt
          dans le lait.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oh ! Ben forcément, tiens ! Regarde ton verre, y a une
           mouche.
                         
          La mère retire la mouche du verre et tend le verre à Paulette, qui
          ne le prend pas.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tiens. Bois... Mais t'as pas soif ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non !
                         
          Paulette semble encore plus dégoûtée.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Elle en veut pas !...
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Vous lui faites peur à tourner autour. C'est pas une bête
           curieuse. Allez, faut faire un peu semblant de ne pas
           s'occuper d'elle.
                         
          Tous s'éloignent de Paulette, sauf Michel. Paulette, qui a
          toujours sa tranche de pain à la main, se tourne vers Michel.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Michel, je suis fatiguée.
                         
          Michel soulève Paulette, un peu difficilement, mais avec beaucoup
          de tendresse, et la dépose sur un lit voisin.
                         
          Fondu au noir
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - SALLE COMMUNE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Un peu plus tard.
                         
          Le père est assis sur l'un des deux bancs qui longent la grande
          table, avec Paulette endormie sur les genoux. En face de lui, sur
          l'autre banc, Michel fait ses devoirs. Raymond, assis dans un
          fauteuil, bricole un morceau de bois. Le père lit le journal
          déplié devant lui, et en appui sur une bouteille. Une lampe à
          pétrole, posée sur la table, éclaire la scène.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           « La situation militaire s'était brusquement aggravée sur
           tous les fronts au cours de la journée d'hier. Les
           ministres ont siégé en permanence. »
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Ah ! Tu vois !
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ouais...
                         
          Paulette, toujours dans les bras du père Dollé, ouvre un oeil et
          regarde Michel. Celui-ci fait le pitre en calant un crayon sous
          son nez, comme une moustache. Pendant que le père reprend sa
          lecture, Paulette fait semblant de se rendormir en fermant les
          yeux. Michel pose le crayon, fait une petite boulette de papier et
          l'envoie en direction de Paulette.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           « A Bucarest, le Cabinet Tata...res, ou... ». Ça, je m'en
           fous... « La résistance de nos troupes reste souple et
           efficace... L'archevêque de Westminter (il prononce à la
           française : veste-munster) ordonne... »
                         
          Le père s'arrête net de lire, car il vient de recevoir, dans la
          figure, le projectile destiné à Paulette. Il se frotte le nez et
          se tourne vers Michel.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Fais ton problème
                         
          Par-dessus l'épaule du père, on peut lire le journal qu'il lit. Il
          s'agit de « La Montagne ». A la une du journal, le gros titre
          suivant : « Reynaud démissionne. Pétain lui succède. » Michel a
          repris son problème, dont il fait profiter tout le monde.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Un rôti de veau de deux kilos cinq a coûté cent quarante-
           deux francs.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           « Alerte sur Malte... » Tiens !...
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Combien coûterait, à ce prix, une escalope de veau de cent
           cinquante grammes.
                         
          Berthe, qui descend l'escalier du grenier, un oreiller sous le
          bras, arrive derrière Michel et regarde le dos du journal,
          toujours appuyé sur la bouteille.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Ah ! Dis donc !
                         
          Le père regarde Paulette.
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           La réveille pas.
                         
          Berthe relève la tête.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Le fils Gouard...
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Le fils Gouard ?
                         
          Le père retourne le journal. Et sur la dernière page, on voit la
          photo d'un soldat, entre les rubriques « Echos » et Faits
          Divers ». Raymond s'approche du journal
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           T'es folle, ben pourquoi il serait sur le journal, le fils
           Gouard ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Et pourquoi pas ? Si on l'a décoré !
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Décoré ? Le Francis ? Et bien, ça me ferait bien mal.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           En tous cas, il y est, lui, à la guerre !
                         
          Le père replie son journal et regarde sa fille d'un air
          visiblement énervé.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           T'as pas à parler du fils Gouard... Qu'est-ce que tu veux ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Une couverture pour la gosse.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Prends-la... Ben prends-la à Raymond.
                         
          Raymond se précipite vers son lit et s'assoit dessus. Derrière la
          mère Dollé, on aperçoit Renée, la fille cadette, qui essuie la
          vaisselle.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Oh ! Pardon !... Moi, j'en ai pas de trop...
                         
          Michel se tourne vers Berthe.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Prends la mienne...
                         
          Raymond se lève du lit.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           C'est pareil, on a le même lit !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Alors, j'ai le droit de la donner.
          Raymond regarde, d'un air penaud, sa soeur prendre la couverture.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Oh !... Ben non alors !
                         
          Michel retourne vers ses devoirs. Le père regarde Paulette
          endormie avec une certaine tendresse.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Pauvre gosse !
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           A cet âge-là, ça se rend pas compte.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Dix-sept, il en est mort, rien qu'aujourd'hui sur le pont,
           et à côté... Ils n'ont même plus de cercueil pour les
           enterrer.
                         
          Le père se tourne vers Georges.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tu vois, c'est pas le moment de mourir, t'auras même pas de
           boîte !
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce qu'on en fait, des morts ?
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           On fait un trou, et hop !... comme des chiens.
                         
          Le père se penche sur Paulette, qui semble toujours endormie sur
          ses genoux.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Chut !... C'est pas des choses à raconter.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Mais elle dort...
                         
          Le père regarde tendrement Paulette, qu'il tend délicatement à la
          mère.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Allez...
                         
          Celle-ci la prend dans ses bras, et commence à monter l'escalier,
          suivie par Renée et Michel, qui sourit. Le père ramasse son
          journal, se lève, et se dirige vers Georges.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           T'as vu ?
                         
          Il s'assoit sur bord du lit. Georges semble souffrir tellement
          qu'il ne s'aperçoit même pas de sa présence.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           « Un side-car allemand tombé aux mains de nos troupes... »
           Regarde.
          Il tend le journal à Georges, qui soupire sans le regarder.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           T'as mal ?
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Ouais !... Oh ! Je sais pas.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - GRENIER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Berthe prépare le lit de Paulette, pendant que la mère la
          déshabille. Paulette, debout, se frotte les yeux. Michel regarde
          la scène.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Ce qu'elle est propre !...
                         
          Renée lui sent la chevelure
                         
                          RENÉE DOLLÉ
           On dirait du parfum.
                         
          Berthe la sent à son tour.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Ben non, c'est qui sont propres.
                         
                          RENÉE DOLLÉ
           Elle ne s'habituera jamais ici.
                         
          La mère couche Paulette sur le lit.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Pourquoi qu'elle s'habituerait pas ?
                         
          La mère borde le lit, aidée par Berthe.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tu voudrais bien la garder, toi, hein ?
                         
          Elle se tourne vers ses enfants.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Allez, hop ! Descendez !
                         
          Elle prend la lampe à pétrole et descend l'escalier, en poussant
          ses filles devant elle. Michel ferme la marche. Paulette se
          retourne dans son lit.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           J'ai peur... Je ne veux pas rester dans le noir.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'auras qu'à crier Michel. Je reviendrais.
                         
          Il continue à descendre. Paulette chuchote :
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Michel !...
          Michel tourne la tête avant de disparaître complètement dans
          l'escalier.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Plus fort...
                         
          Paulette hausse la voix.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Michel !...
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Comme ça !
                         
          Michel descend l'escalier.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Michel !...
                         
          Paulette a maintenant des larmes dans la voix.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Michel !... Michel !...
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - SALLE COMMUNE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Michel s'approche du lit de son frère, sur lequel le père est
          toujours assis. On entend Paulette appeler du grenier.
                         
           PAULETTE (voix off)
           Michel !... Michel !...
                         
          Le père se tourne vers Michel.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce qu'elle veut ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je sais pas, elle m'appelle.
                         
           PAULETTE (voix off)
           Michel !...
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Ah ! Faites-la taire, Bon Dieu !
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Allez, fais-la taire !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Et mon problème ?
                         
           PAULETTE (voix off)
           Michel !...
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Fais ce qu'on te dit.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Bon... je ferai pas mon problème.
          Michel remonte l'escalier.
                         
           PAULETTE (voix off)
           Michel !... Michel !...
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - GRENIER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Dans la pénombre, Michel s'approche du lit et se penche vers
          Paulette.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           J'y vois rien.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ferme les yeux, compte jusqu'à dix et tu verras... Combien
           j'ai de doigts ?
                         
          Michel met sa main sous le nez de Paulette, qui s'est légèrement
          redressée, appuyant sa joue sur son poing fermé.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je te dis que je n'y vois rien.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Alors, tu sais pas compter.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Trois !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tu vois bien qu'on y voit.
                         
          Paulette tire la langue à Michel.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Pourquoi tu me tires la langue ?
                          PAULETTE
           Pour voir si tu y vois.
                         
          La pièce est brusquement éclairée d'une vive lumière, suivie du
          bruit d'un bombardement. Michel se lève et se précipite vers la
          lucarne.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oh ! Une fusée... Viens voir.
                         
          Paulette se cache sous la couverture.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           J'ai peur, il faut se coucher par terre.
                         
          Michel se tourne vers Paulette, toujours cachée sous sa
          couverture.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tu as peur quand il fait noir, et puis tu as peur quand ça
           éclaire !
          Paulette sort la tête de sa couverture.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ça éclaire encore ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Non.
                         
          Une vive lumière sort de la lucarne. Paulette se recache.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Menteur !...
                         
          Michel ferme le volet intérieur de la lucarne.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Bon... Voilà...
                         
          La pièce est très sombre tout à coup. Michel se dirige vers le lit
          et soulève la couverture, découvrant le visage apeuré de Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est fini, je te jure.
                         
          Paulette se redresse légèrement, et s'appuie la joue sur la main.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je veux pas rester ici.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'es bien forcée. Où tu veux aller ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je veux retrouver ma maman et mon papa... sur le pont.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ils y sont plus sur le pont.
                          PAULETTE
           Pourquoi ?.. Où ils sont ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Dans un trou.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Dans un trou ?
                         
          Michel semble gêné.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oui.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Et hop ! Comme des chiens ?
                         
          Michel semble surpris : il ne savait pas que Paulette, qu'il
          croyait endormie, avait entendu les réflexions stupides de son
          frère.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ben... oui...
                         
          Paulette s'allonge sur son lit.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           A cause de la pluie... Dans un trou... Pour pas qu'ils
           soient mouillés ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ça doit être pour ça...
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Mais alors, mon chien... Michel... Il va être mouillé.
                         
          Paulette ferme les yeux et s'endort.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tu dors ?... Tu n'as plus peur ?... Je peux m'en aller ?...
                         
          Il se lève lentement et se dirige vers l'escalier, qu'il descend
          sur la pointe des pieds.
                         
                         FONDU ENCHAÎNÉ
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - SALLE COMMUNE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Nous sommes au milieu de la nuit. Toute la famille Dollé dort...
          et ronfle ! Michel et Raymond dorment dans le même lit.
                         
          Un papillon vole dans la pièce. On suit son ombre projetée sur le
          mur par la lampe qui est restée allumée sur la table de nuit de
          Georges qui, lui, ne dort pas. Le papillon, attiré par la lumière,
          finit par tomber dans le verre de la lampe à pétrole, où il meurt
          instantanément. On entend Paulette crier : elle a certainement
          fait un cauchemar. Georges sursaute, et se tourne vers le lit de
          ses frères.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Michel !... Michel, je te dis !...
                         
           PAULETTE (pleurnichant en voix off)
           Papa !... Maman !... Maman !... Maman !...
                         
          Comme Michel ne semble entendre, ni son frère, ni Paulette,
          Georges attrape un paquet de petits beurres posé au milieu des
          médicaments sur la table de nuit et le lance en direction de
          Michel.
                         
          Michel reçoit le paquet sur la tête et se réveille en sursaut en
          se frottant les yeux. Il semble un peu affolé. Il porte une longue
          chemise de nuit rapiécée.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce qu'il y a ?
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Tu l'entend pas ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Qui ça ?
           GEORGES DOLLÉ (d'une voix furieuse)
           Je veux pas qu'elle crie !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Gueule pas comme ça.
                         
          Il se lève, prend la lampe sur la table de nuit de son frère et
          monte l'escalier. On entend Paulette gémir.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - GRENIER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Michel s'assied sur le bord du lit, près de la tête de Paulette.
          Il lui caresse le front.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Pourquoi que tu cries ? T'as peur ?
                         
          Paulette semble un peu absente. Elle n'est visiblement qu'à moitié
          réveillée.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Alors, faut pas crier comme ça.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je crie pas.
                         
          Paulette ferme les yeux. Michel recouvre soigneusement Paulette,
          qui s'est rendormie, le visage serein. Puis il redescend sans
          bruit.

          Michel s'approche du lit de Georges et repose la lampe sur la
          table de nuit.
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ça y est, je lui ai expliqué. Elle dort.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Et moi, je dors pas.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Si tu veux, moi non plus, je dormirai pas... Tu veux que je
           te lise le journal ?
                         
          Georges hoche à peine la tête. Michel rapproche une chaise du lit,
          prend le journal que le père a laissé sur le lit, et demande :
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce que je te lis ?... La guerre ?...
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Ah non ! Pas la guerre ! Le feuilleton.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           « Il était encore trop tôt pour donner le signal du départ.
           Néanmoins, ceux des compagnons qui devaient faire la route
           à cheval... »
                         
          Georges lève la main.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Parle pas de cheval.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Bon, je te lis après... « Et pourtant, toutes les
           précautions avaient été prises à l'extérieur de l'ha...
           l'ha...cienda... »
                         
          Les deux frères font une petite moue, car ni l'un, ni l'autre, ne
          semble comprendre ce mot étranger.

          FERME DES DOLLÉ - SALLE COMMUNE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Le lendemain matin.
                         
          Michel est assis à table et boit son bol de lait. En face de lui,
          Berthe coupe des morceaux de pain et les dépose dans un bol.
          Derrière Michel, la mère est en train de refaire son lit. Le coq
          chante et Georges gémit faiblement dans son lit. Michel se lève et
          contourne la table.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Paulette !...
                         
          Il s'essuie la bouche sur un torchon posé sur la table et se
          dirige vers l'escalier, devant lequel il s'arrête. Il lève la
          tête.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'es pas encore levée ?
           PAULETTE (voix off provenant du grenier)
           Je m'habille.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Dépêche-toi.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off du fond de la pièce)
           Criez pas si fort.. Vous voyez bien qu'il y a un malade.
                         
          Paulette descend l'escalier en enfilant sa robe, et accompagnée du
          chien. Arrivée en bas, elle se dirige vers le lit de Georges, qui
          toussote.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Oh !... Qu'est-ce qu'il a, le monsieur ?
                         
          Georges caresse doucement la joue de Paulette qui continue à
          s'habiller.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Il a reçu un coup de pied de cheval.
          Paulette pointe le doigt vers le crucifix accroché au mur au-
          dessus du lit.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Qu'est-ce que c'est, ça ?
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           C'est le Bon Dieu.
                         
          La mère semble choquée par la question de la fillette et
          s'approche d'elle.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           T'en as jamais vu ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Si, mais je savais pas ce que c'était.
                         
          La mère s'approche de Paulette et la pousse vers la table.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Viens boire ton lait.
                         
          Michel, qui s'est rassis à table devant son bol, sourit à
          Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Bonjour.
                         
          La mère assoit Paulette à côté de Berthe, qui verse du lait dans
          le bol de la fillette, qui sourit à Michel.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Elle sait pas ce que c'est que le Bon Dieu.
                         
          Georges se redresse de son oreiller, et dit, d'une voix peu
                         AIMABLE :
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           J'ai soif.
                         
          La mère est en train de coiffer Paulette. Berthe regarde sa mère.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           C'est à se demander d'où elle sort.
                          (A PAULETTE)
           D'où tu viens ?
                         
          Michel baisse son bol pour répondre.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est une parisienne.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Pauvre gosse !
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Faudra la faire baptiser.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben, en attendant, faut la déclarer au maire.. Ils nous
           accuseraient bien de l'avoir volée.
                         
          Elle verse du vin dans un verre.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           C'est pas au maire qu'il faut aller. C'est aux gendarmes.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           « Mairerie » ou gendarmerie, y faut leur dire.
                         
          Elle repose la bouteille sur la table et se dirige vers le lit de
          Georges.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           J'irai, moi, aux gendarmes.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Toi, occupe-toi de tes vaches.
                         
          Berthe finit de coiffer Paulette, qui sourit à Michel.
                         
          Michel se lève et se tourne vers Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tu viens avec moi ?
                         
          Paulette récupère les morceaux de pain dans son bol et les mange.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Attends, j'ai pas fini.
                         
          Michel ouvre la porte et sort.
                         
          Paulette continue à manger tranquillement.
                         
          Raymond entre, poussant un vieux vélo, qu'il dépose contre le mur.
          Il a, sur la tête, un chapeau feutre gris. Il tient quelque chose
          caché derrière son dos. Il s'approche du lit de Georges.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Regarde !...
                         
          Georges se redresse sur son lit.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Regarde ce qu'ils lâchent sur la route, les Parisiens.
                         
          Il enlève le feutre, et, à la place, pose sur sa tête un élégant
          chapeau noir à bords roulés, celui qu'il cachait derrière son dos.
          Il fait le pitre.
                         
          Georges rit malgré sa douleur, surtout lorsque son frère met le
          chapeau de travers, en singeant Napoléon, une main glissée dans
          l'échancrure de sa chemise.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Me fais pas rire... Me fait pas rire... ça me fait mal.
                         
          Raymond met le chapeau sur la tête de Georges, qui ne peut
          s'empêcher de continuer à rire, malgré la douleur qui lui tiraille
          le ventre.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Tiens !... Comme ça, tu le verras pas.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Me fait pas rire... Oh ! Bon Dieu, j'ai mal !
                         
          Il se recouche. La mère s'approche du lit.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Et le docteur ?
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Ah oui, le docteur. Mobilisé à l'hôpital. C'est la cause au
           bombardements.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Ce que j'ai besoin, c'est pas le docteur, c'est les pompes
           funèbres.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           T'en fais pas... Y a toujours le vieux corbillard... En le
           reclouant un peu.
                         
          Les deux frères rient ensemble, et Georges plus fort que Raymond.
                         
                         FONDU ENCHAINÉ
                         
          CHEMIN LONGEANT RUISSEAU - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Paulette se dirige vers l'endroit où elle a, la veille, déposé le
          cadavre de son chien, une petite binette à la main.
                         
                         NOTE
          La scène suivante, présente dans la toute première version
          originale du film, a été coupée dans toutes les copies présentées
          ultérieurement. Peut-être a-t-on estimé que de montrer Paulette en
          train de faire danser le cadavre de son chien était un peu trop
          macabre.
                         
          Paulette tient son chien par les pattes de devant, pour le faire
          tenir debout sur les pattes arrière. La binette est posée à côté
          d'elle.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Fais le beau !
                         
          Elle essaie de le faire danser, puis, tout à coup, elle le laisse
          retomber par terre. Elle soulève sa robe et regarde un insecte qui
          grimpe sur sa jambe. L'insecte s'envole et va se poser sur une
          fleur de liseron. Elle veut cueillir la fleur, mais tirant un peu
          trop fort, c'est toute une guirlande de liseron qu'elle arrache.
          Elle se tourne vers le chien, puis, après un instant d'hésitation,
          elle lui entoure le cou avec la guirlande de liseron. Elle le
          soulève de nouveau par les pattes de devant.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Fais le beau ! Danse !
          Elle danse avec le chien en chantonnant. Puis, lassé par ce jeu,
          elle s'arrête, repose le chien, prend la binette et commence à
          creuser.
                         
                         NOTE
          Retour à la version normale du film, telle qu'elle est présentée
          dans toutes les copies existantes.
                         
          Paulette s'agenouille près du cadavre de son chien, posé sur
          l'herbe. Elle pose la binette à côte du chien et le caresse
          délicatement. Puis elle se caresse la joue, comme elle l'avait
          fait après avoir caressé la joue de sa mère décédée. Elle déplace
          légèrement le chien, prend la binette et commence à creuser. Tout
          à coup, elle tourne la tête, car elle vient d'entendre un bruit de
          sonnette.
                         
          Le curé du village arrive sur sa bicyclette, et se dirige vers la
          rivière, et vers Paulette.
                         
          Paulette pose sa binette et ramasse son chien.
                         
          Le curé descend de vélo, terminant à pied, le vélo à la main, le
          petit raidillon qui descend vers le ruisseau.
                         
          Paulette met le chien derrière son dos et le maintient en place
          avec ses deux mains.
                         
          Le curé porte son vélo pour traverser le ruisseau. Puis, arrivé
          sur l'autre rive, il le repose et s'approche de Paulette.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Je ne te connais pas, moi ?... Tu n'es pas d'ici ?
                         
          Paulette recule de façon à se plaquer le dos contre un arbre,
          tenant toujours, à deux mains, le chien caché derrière elle. Elle
          regarde le curé d'un air inquiet et méfiant. Ce dernier sourit, et
          se penche vers Paulette, appuyé sur son vélo.
                          LE CURÉ
           Tu as perdu ta langue ?
                         
          Paulette fait « non » de la tête.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Où habites-tu ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Chez Monsieur Dollé. Papa est mort, et maman aussi.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Pauvre enfant... Leur as-tu dis une prière, au moins ?
                         
          Paulette fait « non » de la tête.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Tu ne veux pas en dire une ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je sais pas quoi dire.
                          LE CURÉ
           Il faut apprendre... Mets tes mains comme ceci.
                         
          Le curé joint les mains. Paulette regarde les mains du curé, mais
          ne bouge pas.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Non ?... Alors, répète : « Que le Bon Dieu les reçoive dans
           son Paradis. »
                         
                          PAULETTE
           « Que le Bon Dieu les reçoive dans son Paradis. »
                         
          Le curé fait le signe de la croix.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Au nom du Père, du Fils et du Saint-Esprit. Ainsi soit-il.
                         
          Paulette répète la phrase du curé, mais sans se signer.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Au nom du Père, du Fils et du Saint-Esprit. Ainsi soit-il.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Fais comme moi.
                         
          Le curé refait un signe de croix.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Tu ne veux pas ? Michel t'apprendra... Il apprend bien son
           catéchisme, Michel.
                         
          Au nom de Michel, Paulette esquisse un sourire. Le curé s'éloigne
          en poussant sa bicyclette. Paulette le regarde partir, tenant
          toujours son chien caché derrière son dos. Lorsqu'elle estime que
          la voix est libre, elle se dégage de l'arbre.
           MICHEL DOLLÉ (criant en voix off)
           Paulette !...
                         
          Michel s'avance à travers bois, mais il ne voit pas Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Paulette !...
                         
          Paulette ne lui répond pas. Elle prend son chien dans ses bras,
          ramasse sa binette, et s'éloigne du ruisseau.
                         
           MICHEL DOLLÉ (criant en voix off)
           Paulette !...
                         
          Michel continue à chercher dans la forêt.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Paulette !...
                         
          Paulette traverse le ruisseau et marche le long de la berge.
                         
          Michel continue à chercher.
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Paulette !...
                         
          MOULIN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Paulette se dirige vers un vieux moulin à eau désaffecté, mais
          dont la bâtisse semble encore solide. Elle entre à l'intérieur du
          moulin.
                         
           MICHEL DOLLÉ (criant en voix off)
           Paulette !...
                         
          MOULIN - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Paulette entre dans le moulin. Au fond du moulin, la grande roue,
          totalement immobile. Paulette cherche un endroit pour enterrer son
          chien.
                         
          CHEMIN LONGEANT RIVIÈRE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Michel se dirige vers le moulin. On aperçoit une autre roue, elle
          aussi immobile, à l'extérieur du moulin.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Paulette !...
                         
          MOULIN - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Paulette pose son chien et commence à creuser le sol en terre
          battue. Derrière elle, Michel entre dans le moulin.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Paulette !...
                         
          Michel s'approche de Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ah ! Dis... Qu'est-ce que tu fais là ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ça ne te regarde pas.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je te cherche partout... Tu fais un trou ?
                         
          Elle ne lui répond pas et continue à creuser.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ah !... C'est pour ton chien. Donne...
                         
          Il cherche à lui prendre la binette des mains, mais elle résiste
          un peu.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Donne... c'est trop dur...
                         
          Elle finit par céder, et Michel se met à creuser un peu plus
          énergiquement que Paulette. Après quelques coups de binette, il
          s'arrête de creuser et regarde Paulette.
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ça, c'est une idée... On va faire un beau petit cimetière.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Qu'est-ce que c'est qu'un cimetière ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est là qu'on met les morts pour qu'ils soient tous
           ensemble.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Pourquoi on les met ensemble ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Pour pas qu'ils s'embêtent.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Mais alors, mon chien, il va s'embêter, tout seul ?
                         
          Michel réfléchit une seconde et hausse les épaules.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ben... oui...
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Faudra lui en trouver un autre !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Un autre chien... ça, c'est difficile.
                         
          Un bruissement d'ailes fait lever la tête de Michel. Paulette
          regarde dans la direction où regarde Michel.
                         
          Dans la charpente du moulin, un hibou, posé sur une poutre, semble
          observer les enfants.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est Monsieur le Maire.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Pourquoi ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est son nom... c'est un hibou.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           C'est méchant ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Non, ça roupille tout le temps... Tu vas voir.
                         
          Michel se dirige vers une échelle qui permet d'accéder au hibou.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Faut pas le tuer.
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Penses-tu ! Ça serait même pas la peine, ça vit cent ans.
                         
          Paulette fait une petite moue, semblant incapable de réaliser ce
          que représente cent ans.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Cent ans !...
                         
          Michel grimpe vers le hibou.
                         
          Paulette dépose son chien dans le trou creusé par Michel, puis
          commence à le recouvrir de terre. Tout en travaillant, elle récite
          la prière que lui a apprise le curé. A chaque fois qu'elle dit
          « Au nom du Père, du Fils et du Saint-Esprit », elle fait un
          rapide signe de croix.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Que le Bon Dieu le reçoive dans son Paradis. Au nom du
           Père, du Fils et du Saint-Esprit. Ainsi soit-il... Que le
           Bon Dieu le reçoive dans son Paradis. Au nom du Père, du
           Fils et du Saint-Esprit. Ainsi soit-il... Que le Bon Dieu
           le reçoive dans son Paradis. Au nom du Père, du Fils et du
           Saint-Esprit. Ainsi soit-il...
                         
          Michel atteint le nid du hibou sur la poutre. On entend, de loin,
          Paulette qui continue à psalmodier ses « Que le Bon Dieu... etc. »
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Toi, ne bouge pas...
                         
          Michel glisse la main derrière le hibou, dans son nid. Il sort une
          taupe morte qu'il tient par la queue.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je t'en donnerai une autre.
                         
          Michel redescend vers Paulette, en tenant la taupe par la queue.
          Il a maintenant atteint le bas de l'échelle. Il s'approche de
          Paulette, tenant toujours la taupe par la queue. Paulette continue
          à psalmodier ses prières tout en comblant la tombe de son chien.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           J'ai une taupe !... Une belle !...
                         
          Paulette se redresse et regarde la taupe.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Il en faudra d'autres.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est pas ce qui manque, les taupes.
                         
          La voix de Paulette se fait presque geignante lorsqu'elle dit :
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Des chats...
                         
          Michel, lui, énumère, sur un timbre de voix nettement plus posé :
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Des hérissons, des lézards...
                         
          Paulette n'est visiblement plus dans son état normal.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Des chevaux, des vaches...
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Des serpents à sonnette.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Des lions.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Des tigres.
                         
          Paulette a presque des sanglots dans la voix lorsqu'elle dit :
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Des gens !...
                         
          Paulette a le souffle un peu court. Michel a l'air un peu surpris
          par les derniers mots de Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Si tu veux... Et puis on leur mettra des croix.
                         
          Michel reprend la binette, et creuse un autre trou pour la taupe.
          Paulette s'est accroupie pour le regarder creuser.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Pourquoi des croix ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ben dis donc !... Qu'est-ce qu'ils t'ont appris, tes
           parents ?... Tu vas voir.
          Il pose la binette, prend un morceau de bois, qu'il casse en deux,
          et en fait une croix, qu'il lie avec du fil de fer.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Regarde... Tiens... Regarde... Là... C'est ça, une croix.
                         
          Il plante la croix sur la tombe du chien.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           C'est le Bon Dieu.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ben oui... C'est le Bon Dieu.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Attends.
                         
          Elle sort un collier de sa poche.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Il est joli, ton collier.
                          PAULETTE
           Il est cassé.
                         
          Elle entoure la croix de son collier. Michel semble ravi.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est mieux.
                         
          Il arrange le collier autour de la croix.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Oui... mais il y en a une plus belle au-dessus de ton
           frère.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tu la trouves belle, toi ?
                         
          Paulette fait « oui » de la tête.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je t'en ferai des encore mieux, moi. Avec des clous et un
           marteau.
                         
          D'un grand geste des bras, il désigne toute la pièce.

          Michel est assis par terre les jambes écartées. Ils cloue deux
          lattes de bois ensemble en forme de croix. Paulette, assise sous
          la table, inspecte les potirons entreposés dans le grenier. Elle
          rit de la forme étrange du fruit qu'elle tient dans ses mains
                          PAULETTE
           Oh !... Regarde celle-là.
                         
          Michel détache la croix clouée sur le plancher, mais l'une des
          lattes se fend en deux.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Zut !... Faut que je recommence... Recommence aussi, tu les
           sais pas bien.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je vous salue, Marie pleine de grâce...
                         
          Michel cloue une autre croix.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Le Seigneur est avec vous.

          Le Père Dollé, assis à table, où il coupe des tranches de pain,
          lève des yeux agacés vers le plafond, et le grenier, où l'on
          entend les coups de marteau de Michel. La Mère Dollé s'affaire
          devant la cheminée. Les filles mettent le couvert. Raymond est
          assis sur un escabeau près du lit de Georges.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Des prières !... Il en a de bonnes, le curé.
                          (A RAYMOND)
           Tu les sais, toi, tes prières ?
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Comment qu'on y disait déjà à la grand-mère ?... « Notre
           Père qui êtes aux Cieux... »
                         
                          RENÉE DOLLÉ
           A la grand-mère, on y disait : « Marie... je vous salue,
           Marie... »
                         
          Georges, immobile dans son lit, les mains croisées sur le ventre,
          réagit d'une voix affaiblie.
                         
                          GEORGES DOLLÉ
           Je ne veux pas qu'on me dise Marie !
                         
          Les coups de marteau continuent de plus belle. Le père lève les
          yeux vers le plafond.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce qu'ils foutent là-haut ?
                         
          Toute la famille, sauf Georges, lève les yeux vers le plafond.
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ

                          PAULETTE
           Dis, Michel, qu'est-ce que c'est, les entrailles ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Les entrailles ?... Ça doit être là où Georges est
           blessé... Continue.

           Est béni... Après ?
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est fini. Dis « Amen ».
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Amen. Pourquoi qu'elles finissent toutes pareilles.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ça veut dire que c'est fini. Recommence.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ameeeen !...
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Recommence tout.
                         
          Michel inspecte la croix qu'il vient de terminer. Derrière lui, on
          voit le Père Dollé apparaître en haut de l'escalier, sans que les
          enfants le remarquent.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Notre Père, qui êtes aux Cieux, que votre nom soit
           sanctifié... sanctifié...
                         
          Michel, qui a recommencé à clouer, dit d'une voix un peu énervé :
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Que votre règne arrive.
                         
          Le Père Dollé balance, à Michel, une baffe qui l'envoie valdinguer
          sur le plancher.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tiens, le v'là ! Je t'apprendrai à cogner avec un marteau.
           Tu sais pas qu'il lui faut du calme.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Mais je lui apprenais ses prières... Oh ben, zut alors !
          Paulette semble affolée par cette scène de violence physique.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je les sais pas !... Je les sais pas !...
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ses prières ?
                         
          Le Père ramasse une croix.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Et ça, c'est des prières ? Tu fais des croix dans la maison
           d'un malade ? Tu veux le faire mourir ?
                         
          Il prend Paulette par la main et l'entraîne vers l'escalier.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Et puis, je veux plus vous voir ensemble.
                         
          Michel se relève en se tenant la joue et suit son père, qui, déjà
          engagé dans l'escalier, se tourne vers lui.
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Toi, reste là. Tu es puni. Tu te coucheras sans manger.

          Berthe apporte une marmite fumante sur la table. La Mère Dollé
          prend la louche et sert la soupe à Raymond. Renée est assise à
          côté de lui. On entend Georges qui râle dans son lit. Berthe
          s'assoit entre Raymond et Renée, en face de sa mère.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ (à Georges)
           Ben alors, qu'est-ce que t'as donc ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Tu réponds pas à ta mère ?
                         
          Elle tend son assiette à sa mère, qui la sert. Georges continue à
          râler.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Ça va pas ?
                         
          Il se lève et s'approche du lit. Il se penche sur son frère.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Tu craches ?
                         
          Il se tourne vers les autres.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Il crache un peu de sang.
                         
          La mère, qui se servait la soupe après avoir servi Renée, se lève
          et rejoint Raymond auprès du lit.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Et puis, je comprends plus ce qu'il dit... Hé !... Il
           crache encore.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben, qu'est-ce que t'as ?
                         
          Le père Dollé arrive en bas de l'escalier, tenant Paulette par la
          main. Il tourne la tête vers le grenier.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tu boufferas pas !
                         
          Les deux filles rejoignent leur mère près du lit. Le père Dollé
          lâche Paulette et s'approche à son tour du lit. Toute la famille,
          sauf Michel et Paulette, entoure maintenant le lit
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce que t'as ?

           Y réponds pas.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           C'est la première fois que je vois cracher du sang.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Faudra nettoyer les draps.

           Donnes-y un mouchoir.
                         
          Le père Dollé contourne ses filles et rejoint sa femme et son fils
          Raymond à la tête du lit.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Alors, ça va mieux ?
                         
          La mère essuie la bouche de Georges, qui râle de plus en plus
          faiblement.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tape-lui dans le dos.
                         
          Raymond tapote le dos de son frère.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Un peu de tisane ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Ça doit être le coeur.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           C'est quand même malheureux qu'avec tant de monde, on
           n'arrive pas à lui trouver un bout de prière.
                         
          Paulette s'est assise à table et mange sa soupe.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Michel, il les sait.
                         
          Toute la famille se tourne vers elle, comme si, tout à coup, ils
          avaient oublié sa présence. Le père est le premier à réagir.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           T'as raison.
                         
          Le Père Dollé se dirige vers l'escalier et lève la tête vers le
          grenier.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Michel !
                         
          Michel est assis sur les dernières marches en haut de l'escalier.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je suis puni.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Je te dis de descendre.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Alors, je suis plus puni ?
          Michel descend l'escalier en faisant claquer ses galoches.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Mets-toi dans le coin et dis tes prières.
                         
          Michel se dirige vers le coin indiqué par son père, puis il se
          rapproche de la table et s'assoit sur le banc à côté d'une grosse
          miche de pain.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Et à genoux !
                         
          Michel fait semblant de ne pas entendre le dernier ordre de son
          père, et reste assis sur le banc, ne quittant pas la miche de pain
          des yeux. Il commence à réciter ses prières, mais s'amuse à
          mélanger les paroles du « Notre Père » et du « Je vous salue,
          Marie ».
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Notre Père qui êtes aux Cieux. Vous êtes bénie entre toutes
           les femmes, donnez-nous aujourd'hui notre pain quotidien,
           et Jésus, le fruit de vos entrailles, est béni. Priez pour
           nous, pauvres pécheurs, que votre nom soit sanctifié, que
           votre volonté soit pleine de grâce. Notre Père, Sainte Mère
           de Dieu, donnez-moi du pain... donnez-moi du pain...
                         
          Il a prononcé les deux dernières phrases d'une voix rageuse. Il
          arrache un morceau de mie à la boule de pain, et le porte à sa
          bouche.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           ...quotidien !...
                         
          Puis, baissant les yeux, il continue à marmonner d'une voix plus
          faible, et donc inintelligible pour les autres membres de la
          famille, trop occupés par Georges.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Crotte alors, crotte, crotte, crotte, crotte, crotte,
           crotte...
                         
          Il jette un regard furtif vers sa famille assemblée autour du lit
          de Georges. Personne ne semble s'occuper de lui. Et il continue à
          marmonner, d'une voix encore plus faible, et quasiment
                         INCOMPRÉHENSIBLE :
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Marie mère de, Marie mère de, Marie mère de... merde
           alors !
                         
          Ne voulant certainement pas abuser de sa bonne étoile, il décide
          de reprendre, à voix plus intelligible, une prière à peu près

          Autour du lit, la famille est toujours assemblée.
                         
           MICHEL DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Notre Père, qui êtes au cieux, que Votre Nom soit
           sanctifié...
                         
          Michel a repris sa contemplation gourmande de la miche de pain.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Que Votre Volonté soit pleine de grâce.
                         
          Il s'arrête de prier, fasciné par le spectacle d'une petite souris
          qui vient de grimper sur la table. La souris se promène
          tranquillement, et vient renifler le contenu d'une cuiller.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Dis pas ça, tu vas lui faire peur.

           Tout à l'heure, il parlait de clouer la planche du
           corbillard.
                         
          La famille chuchote autour du lit. Raymond dit d'une voix plus
                         AUTORITAIRE :
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ

           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Y a de l'huile de ricin.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben. Donnes-y une goutte.
                         
          La mère s'éloigne du lit.
                         
          Michel observe toujours la souris sur la table.
                         
          La mère revient vers le lit de Georges, portant, d'une main, un
          petit flacon ouvert, et de l'autre, une cuiller dans laquelle elle
          a versé un peu du contenu du flacon. Elle marche doucement pour ne
          pas renverser la cuiller.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Si ça fais pas de bien, ça fera pas de mal !
                         
          La mère approche la cuiller de la bouche de Georges.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben quoi, t'ouvres plus la bouche ?
                         
                          RENÉE DOLLÉ
           Il fait les mêmes yeux que la grand-mère.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Il faut le prendre par la douceur.
                         
          Il prend la cuiller des mains de sa femme.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Raisonne-toi, Georges.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben... ouvre les yeux, au moins.
                         
          Le père approche la cuiller de la bouche de Georges.
                         
                          RENÉE DOLLÉ
           Il ferme les yeux maintenant.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           C'est peut-être qu'il dort.
                         
          Georges, les mains croisées sur la poitrine, a les yeux fermés et
          ne bouge plus. Lorsque son père lui pose la cuiller sur les
          lèvres, il ne réagit pas.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Allez, bois ça.
                         
          Il rend la cuiller à sa femme.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ah, donne-lui, la mère.
                         
          A son tour, elle approche la cuiller de la bouche de Georges.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Il serre les dents.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           C'est peut-être qu'il est mort.
                         
          Michel relève la tête et regarde vers le lit, le visage soudain
          inquiet. Il se lève et s'approche du lit en récitant, de façon
          correcte cette fois-ci, ses prières.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Notre Père, qui êtes aux Cieux, que Votre Nom soit
           sanctifié, que Votre Règne arrive, que Votre Volonté soit
           faite sur la terre comme au ciel. Donnez-nous aujourd'hui
           notre pain de chaque jour. Pardonnez-nous nos offenses,
           comme nous pardonnons à ceux qui nous ont offensés. Mais ne
           nous laissez pas succomber à la tentation, mais délivrez-
           nous du mal. Ainsi soit-il.
                         
          Paulette se lève de table et s'approche du lit. Michel vient de
          recommencer, à voix plus basse, le « Notre Père ». Arrivée au pied
          du lit, Paulette regarde le défunt.
                         
                          PAULETTE

          Toute la famille regarde Georges, semblant ne pas vouloir admettre
          la réalité. Raymond se penche vers lui et lui touche la main.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Hé !... Hé !... Pour moi, il est mort.
           (A son père)
           Tâte-le voir.
                         
          Le père pose sa main sur la poitrine de Georges.
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Je crois bien qu'oui... qu'il est mort.
           (A sa femme)
           Qu'est-ce t'en dis, la mère ?
                         
          Michel se met à genoux au pied du lit et continue à réciter, à
          voix très basse, ses prières.
                         
          La mère passe le flacon dans la main qui tient la cuiller, et de
          sa main maintenant libre, touche la joue de son fils.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Pour sûr qu'il est mort.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Il est mort !
                         
          Ils ont tous deux la voix rauque de sanglots retenus. La famille
          regarde Georges avec des yeux où la peine, la stupéfaction et même
          une certaine incrédulité se mêlent. Le père enlève sa casquette et
          se mouche dedans.
                         
          Paulette s'approche de Michel.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Il est mort, ton frère ?
                         
          Michel ne lui répond pas et continue à prier à voix basse.
          Paulette s'agenouille à côté de lui.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Tu vas lui faire un trou ?
                         
          Michel se tourne vers elle, visiblement choqué par cette
          proposition.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ

          Toute la famille est en larmes.

           sans rien dire.

          Renée s'écroule par terre en pleurant. La mère, tout en pleurant,
          reverse, un peu maladroitement, le contenu de la cuiller dans le
          flacon d'huile de ricin.

          Le Père Dollé est en train de réparer le plancher du vieux
          corbillard. L'arrière du corbillard est surmonté de la lettre
          « D », et au milieu de chacun des quatre côtés du corbillard, une
          petite croix de bois noir est plantée sur le toit du corbillard.
          Le Père Dollé, qui, à quatre pattes, plante des clous dans le
          plancher, se redresse et se tourne vers Michel, assis sur la boîte
          à clous posée à côté du corbillard, et visiblement rêveur.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oh !... Donne-moi un clou... un grand.
                         
          Michel semble sortir de sa rêverie éveillée, se lève et tend la
          boîte à clous à son père, qui prend le clou dont il a besoin.
          Michel pose la boîte et examine le corbillard avec plus
          d'attention. Il monte sur une roue pour atteindre le toit du
          corbillard, où il examine, avec beaucoup d'intérêt, l'un des
          petits crucifix. Il le touche rêveusement.
                         
          Le père, toujours occupé à clouer, tourne la tête vers son fils,
          dont il ne voit plus que les jambes.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce que tu fabriques ?

           Rien.
                         
          Michel tourne la vis qui tient le crucifix en place, et constate
          qu'elle se dévisse facilement. Il secoue la croix pour la
          détacher, mais n'y arrive pas.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est pas bête... c'est pas mal... bien inventé, un

           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Regarde donc les croix là-haut. C'est-y la peine de les
           reclouer ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oh, non !... Elles tiennent... T'as plus besoin de moi ?
                         
          Michel saute par terre.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Donne-moi deux clous et ça ira.
                         
          Michel, qui allait partir, revient en arrière, prend la boîte à
          clous et la pose sur le plancher du corbillard, devant le nez de
          son père. Il sort en courant de la grange, pendant que son père
          continue à clouer.

          Paulette tient sa robe relevée devant elle, car elle a mis du
          grain à l'intérieur. Elle donne les grains, un par un, aux
          poussins qui l'entourent.
                         
          Par la porte ouverte d'une grange, on voit Michel qui verse par
          terre l'eau que contenait un gros bidon à lait. Il remet le
          couvercle en place, pose le bidon et sort de la grange. Il
          s'approche de Paulette.

          lance à la volée sur les poussins. Puis il se penche vers Paulette

          Paulette s'accroupit et continue à distribuer le grain aux
          poussins. Michel s'accroupit à côté d'elle. Elle repousse un
          poussin.

          Un soldat s'avance sur le chemin qui mène à la ferme des Gouard.
          Il porte un calot, une capote, deux musettes entrecroisées en
          travers de la poitrine, et, dans le dos, une trompette suspendue
          par un cordon. Il s'agit de Francis Gouard, le fils du Père

          s'arrête devant la porte en se mettant au garde-à-vous. Il fait
          tournoyer sa trompette, d'un geste un peu maladroit, puis la porte
          à sa bouche. On entend un affreux « couac ». Francis recommence

          deuxième chaussure.

          Francis vient de s'arrêter de jouer et, la trompette à la main, il
          ouvre la porte d'un coup de pied. Francis crie vers l'intérieur de
          la ferme.

          assise.

           Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
                         
          On entend de nouveau la trompette de Francis, dont la courte
          prestation se termine sur un « couac ». Raymond et son père se
          lèvent en même temps.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben, alors !
                         
          Les deux hommes se dirigent vers la porte d'entrée.

          Michel est déjà sur le pas de la porte, en train de mettre sa
          deuxième chaussure. Le père arrive derrière lui, suivi de Raymond,
          puis de la mère, de Berthe et de Renée. Ils regardent tous en
          direction de la ferme des voisins.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ

           Avec des feignants comme lui, ça serait pas étonnant.
                         
          Le père tape sur l'épaule de Michel.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Vas-y voir par derrière. Tu me diras si c'est le Francis.
                         
          Michel se tourne vers Raymond.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je vais te couper de l'herbe aux lapins.
                         
          Le père décroche une serpette du mur, et la donne à Michel, qui
          ramasse un panier par terre, traverse rapidement la cour de la
          ferme puis s'engage sur la passerelle qui sépare les deux fermes.
                         
          Toute la famille, massée devant la porte de la ferme, le suit des
          yeux.

          Michel longe le mur de la ferme en s'accroupissant pour ne pas
          être vu des fenêtres. Il passe devant le chien, attaché à une
          chaîne, et qui semble totalement indifférent à sa présence. Il
          s'approche de la fenêtre de la salle commune.
                         
          A travers cette fenêtre, on aperçoit Francis attablé qui raconte
          ses aventures guerrières, mais on ne l'entend pas. Il mime un
          avion en piqué, puis une explosion, puis un tir de mitrailleuse.
                         
          Michel, accroupi sur un carré d'herbe en face de la ferme, coupe
          de l'herbe, tout en essayant de voir ce qui se passe à l'intérieur
          de la ferme.

          Francis est à table en train de manger, le calot sur la tête, et
          la vareuse ouverte. Sa trompette est posés à côté de lui, reposant
          sur son pavillon. Son père l'écoute, visiblement passionné, tout
          en mangeant lui aussi. Le cadette de ses soeurs, Marcelle, est
          debout derrière lui, en train de beurrer une tartine. Son autre
          soeur, Marcelle, descend du grenier par une échelle.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD

           Alors quoi, que je me suis dit... C'est pas la peine de
           marcher comme ça jusqu'à perpette.
                         
          Marcelle lui donne la tartine beurrée, pendant que Jeanne s'active
          près de la cheminée. Marcelle prend la trompette pour l'examiner.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD

          Marcelle repose la trompette.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Alors, j'ai foutu le camp... Et me v'là.
                         
          Marcelle touche les glands qui pendent du cordon de la trompette.
          Francis boit son café, pendant que son père le regarde, un peu
          surpris.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Mais les Prussiens ? Où qu'y sont, les Prussiens ?
                         
          Francis repose son bol et réfléchit un peu avant de répondre.

           Alors ? Y a plus d'amour ?... Elle est là, Paulette ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Tu parles si elle est là !
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Allez ! Barrez-vous, les gosses !
                         
          Michel se dirige vers Paulette, assise dans l'herbe au pied d'un
          buisson. Paulette se relève.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tu les as, les poussins ?
                         
          Paulette tâte les poussins, sous sa robe.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Oui. Là.
                         
          Ils se mettent en marche, s'éloignant de Francis et Berthe.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Regarde ce que j'ai, moi.
                         
          Il déballe son journal et montre à Paulette les trois croix du
          corbillard. Paulette examine une des croix. Michel semble très
          fier de lui. Mais Paulette, elle, semble déçue.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Oh !... Elles sont vilaines.
                         
          Elle rend la croix à Michel, qui la remballe, l'air déçu.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'es jamais contente.
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          PLACE DE L'ÉGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Le corbillard s'approche de l'église, où les cloches sont en train
          de sonner. Devant le corbillard, un enfant de choeur portant un
          grand crucifix de métal, et derrière lui, le curé en chasuble
          noire, flanqué de deux autres enfants de choeur. Derrière eux, le
          corbillard, tiré par un cheval, guidé par un homme à pied.
          Derrière le corbillard, la famille Dollé, leurs proches et leurs
          amis, tous en deuil. Le curé et les enfants de choeur s'arrêtent
          devant la porte l'église, mais le corbillard roule encore deux ou
          trois mètres avant de s'arrêter à son tour, de façon à ce que
          l'arrière du corbillard soit au niveau du curé.
                         
          Raymond rejoint le curé et les enfants de choeur à l'arrière du
          corbillard pour sortir le cercueil, mais son père l'arrête et se
          tourne vers le curé.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           C'est-y bien la peine de le faire entrer ?
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Ben, voyons !
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           C'est à cause de la planche du fond. Ce que j'ai bricolé,
           vous savez, c'est pas bien solide... Alors, si on est tout
           le temps à le mettre, à le sortir, et à le remettre...
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           C'est indispensable.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Bon.
                         
          Le curé fait passer les enfants de choeur devant lui et entre dans
          l'église. Raymond relève le drap noir qui recouvre le cercueil, de
          façon à dégager les poignées... sous l'oeil inquiet de son père !
          Un autre homme vient l'aider à tirer le cercueil. Un troisième
          homme et une femme prennent les deux autres poignées du cercueil
          et ils se dirigent tous les quatre vers l'intérieur de l'église.
          Tout le monde les suit, sauf le père Dollé qui s'approche du
          corbillard vide et en inspecte le plancher.
                         
          Sur la route qui mène à la place de l'église, une cousine de la
          famille Dollé, en grand habit de deuil, pédale sur sa bicyclette,
          son voile flottant au vent. Une couronne mortuaire est accrochée
          sur le guidon de son vélo.
                         
          La cousine arrive devant l'église et descend de sa bicyclette,
          qu'elle appuie sur la mur de l'église. Elle échange deux bises
          bien sonores avec le Père Dollé.
                         
                          COUSINE DOLLÉ
           Oh !... En voilà bien une affaire.
                         
          Le Père Dollé hausse légèrement les épaules et regarde la
          couronne.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oh... Fallait pas... fallait pas...
                         
          Elle essaie de détacher la couronne du guidon de son vélo.
                         
                          COUSINE DOLLÉ
           C'était la dernière. Alors, il y a écrit « cousine ».
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ça fait rien... ça fait rien.
                         
          Il l'aide à détacher la couronne.
                         
                          COUSINE DOLLÉ
           Si ! Ça fait... Si, ça fait...
                         
          A deux, ils finissent par détacher la couronne, mais manquent de
          flanquer le vélo par terre.
                         
                          COUSINE DOLLÉ
           Attendez...
                         
          Sur le ruban de la couronne, il est inscrit : « A notre chère
          cousine ». La cousine arrache le « e » final de « cousine ». Elle
          donne la lettre arrachée au père Dollé, qui la met dans sa poche.
          Elle a l'air satisfaite du « A notre chère cousin » !
                         
                          COUSINE DOLLÉ
           On ne dirait pas qu'il y a la guerre ici... Lui, au moins,
           il aura un enterrement de chrétien.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Avec une messe !
                         
          La cousine entre dans l'église avec sa couronne à la main.
                         
                          COUSINE DOLLÉ
           Et vous, Joseph ? Vous n'y allez pas ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tout de suite... Tout de suite...
                         
          Il revient vers le corbillard et ramasse son marteau sur le
          plancher.

          ÉGLISE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Le curé, tournant le dos aux fidèles, est en train de dire la
          messe, entouré de ses deux enfants de choeur, dont l'un agite une
          clochette.
                         
          Sur la galerie qui surplombe la nef, un homme joue de l'harmonium.
          Autour de lui, cinq femmes chantent le « Sanctus ».
                         
          Plan d'ensemble de la nef de la petite église, qui est bien
          remplie.
          Paulette est assise à côté de Michel, qui a un brassard noir sur
          le bras. Ils chantent tous les deux - ou font semblant de chanter.
                         
          La mère Dollé et sa fille Berthe sont assises côte à côte, chacune
          avec un voile noir sur le visage.
                         
          Les deux hommes, assez âgés, qui portaient le cercueil, ont l'air
          très émus. L'un d'eux écrase même une larme, puis s'essuie les
          yeux avec son mouchoir.
                         
          Plan sur deux autres hommes en deuil, puis sur Renée, qui est tout
          habillée en noir, mais sans voile. Elle a l'air tellement absorbée
          par ses pensées, qu'elle ne songe même pas à chasser une mouche
          qui s'est posée sur son nez.
                         
          Raymond, lui aussi, est au bord des larmes.
                         
          Paulette et Michel se regardent avec tendresse. Puis ils tournent
          leur regard vers le chemin de croix, dont chaque tableau est
          surmonté d'une croix. Paulette les montre du doigt.
           PAULETTE & MICHEL DOLLÉ (ensembles)
           Dix... Onze... Douze...
                         
          La mère Dollé se tourne vers eux.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Chut !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Treize... Quatorze. Seulement, celles-là, elles ne se
           dévissent pas.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Et puis, elles sont pas belles.
                         
          Raymond, qui est assis devant eux, se retourne.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           C'est fini, oui ?
                         
          Une clochette retentit. Michel se met à genoux et baisse la tête.
          Paulette l'imite, mais sans baisser la tête. Elle lui tape sur
          l'épaule et lui montre quelque chose du doigt.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Regarde...
                         
          Il s'agit de la petite croix qui pend au bout d'un chapelet que
          tient un fidèle devant eux.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ça irait bien pour une abeille.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oui, mais ça pique.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ça pique, mais, dans le fond, c'est pas méchant.
          PLACE DE L'ÉGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          A travers les montants du corbillard, que le père Dollé est
          toujours en train de réparer, on aperçoit un troupeau de vaches,
          conduites par Marcelle et Jeanne Gouard. Jeanne éclate de rire et
          le père Dollé relève la tête.
                         
                          JEANNE GOUARD
           C'est le corbillard qu'est en panne... comme la chenillette
           au Francis.
                         
                          MARCELLE GOUARD
           Rigole pas.
                         
                          JEANNE GOUARD
           Pourquoi je rigolerais pas ?
                         
          Le père Dollé regarde les filles Gouard d'un air mécontent. On
          entend les cloches des vaches qui s'éloignent. Le père Dollé
          descend du corbillard et prend un peu de recul pour inspecter son
          corbillard. Et il s'aperçoit de la disparition des croix.
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben, ça alors !...
                         
          Il grimpe sur une roue pour atteindre le toit du corbillard, et
          manipule la tige qui tenait la croix en place. Il redescend et se
          met les mains sur les hanches.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben ça, c'est pas banal.
                         
          Il réfléchit un instant, puis se dirige vers la porte de l'église.
                         
          ÉGLISE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La porte s'ouvre, et le père Dollé apparaît sur le seuil. Il
          enlève son chapeau. Il appelle, à voix haute :
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Michel !...
                         
          Michel, en grande conversation muette avec Paulette, ne semble
          même pas l'entendre.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Michel !... Arrive !...
                         
          Le curé, l'air choqué par cette intrusion intempestive, se
          retourne vers la porte.
                         
          La mère Dollé se tourne vers Michel et lui chuchote d'une vois
          néanmoins assez forte :
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben quoi... fais ce que dit ton père !
                         
          Michel de lève et se dirige vers la porte. Le bruit de ses
          galoches résonne sur les dalles du sol de l'église. Il trébuche
          sur une dalle mal jointe. Arrivé à la porte, il se retourne
          brièvement vers l'autel et fait une rapide génuflexion et un signe
          de croix. La porte claque derrière lui.
                         
          PLACE DE L'ÉGLISE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Michel s'avance vers son père, qui, les mains sur les hanches,
          regarde le corbillard.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Je t'avais dit de regarder si les croix tenaient bien.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ben oui, elles tenaient.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Elles ont foutu le camp. Va voir sur le chemin, si on les a
           pas perdues.
                         
          Michel semble un peu embarrassé.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oh non ! On les a pas perdues. J'aurais bien vu.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Si on les a pas perdues, c'est quelqu'un qui les a
           enlevées... Qui que c'est ?... Hmm !...
                         
          Michel baisse la tête.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ben, je sais pas, moi. C'est peut-être les Gouard...
                         
          On entend le son d'une clochette provenant de l'intérieur de
          l'église.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Papa, ça sonne. Faut rentrer pour baisser la tête.
                         
          Michel rentre dans l'église. Le père Dollé reste immobile à
          regarder longuement son corbillard.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben oui... c'est peut-être bien les Gouard.
                         
          Il se dirige, à son tour, vers la porte de l'église.
                         
          ÉGLISE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Michel entre dans l'église, en gardant la tête baissée. Derrière
          lui, son père entre à son tour et enlève son chapeau. On entend le
          son de la clochette agitée par l'enfant de choeur. Toute
          l'assemblée est agenouillée, têtes baissées, même Paulette. Michel
          va s'agenouiller près de Paulette, se penche vers elle et
                         CHUCHOTE :
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Il a vu qu'il y avait plus de croix. Alors, j'ai dit que
           c'était les Gouard.
          Paulette relève la tête et regarde la grande croix au-dessus de
          l'autel. Elle chuchote.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Oh ! Regarde celle-là !
                         
          Michel suit le regarde de Paulette, et affiche un air inquiet.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oui, mais c'est celle du curé !
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Elle est belle !
                         
          FERME DES GOUARDS - REMISE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Remise à bois, encombrée de morceaux de bois de toutes tailles.
                         
          Le père et le fils Gouard sont en train de scier un tronc d'arbre.
          Le père s'arrête et prend, dans sa poche, une feuille de papier à
          cigarettes.
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           J'y serais allé, moi, à l'enterrement, si j'avais su que
           leur fils était mort.
                         
          Il prend du tabac directement dans la poche de sa veste et le
          dépose sur la feuille de papier.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Avec ça, que tu le savais pas !
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Ben, ils me l'ont pas dit. C'est égal, ils ont eu du
           malheur... Avec qui ils vont rester maintenant ? Le
           Raymond, qu'est bon-à-rien.
                         
          On entend, dans le lointain, les cloches de l'église qui sonnent
          la fin de la messe de funérailles.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Il y a la Berthe. Elle est bonne travailleuse, la Berthe.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Une pute.
                         
          Francis sursaute.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Ben quoi !... Ben sois poli !
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Qu'est-ce qui te prend ? Tu la défends ?
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Oui, je la défends.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           T'aurais bien mieux fait de défendre la France, avec tes
           chevaux mécaniques.
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Oh, la France !... Je peux pas l'épouser, non ?
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Tu vas peut-être bien épouser la Berthe Dollé, hein ?
                         
          Il roule lentement sa cigarette.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Ben, peut-être bien, oui...
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Faut être dans la cavalerie à moteur pour être aussi
           bouché.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Oui, et bien si tous les chevaux de la cavalerie à moteur,
           ils te bottaient le train, c'est peut-être bien toi que ça
           déboucherait !
                         
          Le père Gouard hausse la voix.
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           C'est comme ça que tu parles à ton père ?
                         
          Le père lâche sa cigarette et balance, à son fils, une beigne qui
          l'envoie valdinguer par terre. Francis se relève aussitôt.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Parfaitement !... Et pis c'est pas fini... Et pis, la
           Berthe, je l'épouserai... T'entends ?
                         
          CIMETIÈRE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Le cimetière est situé juste à côté de l'église.
                         
          Le corbillard entre dans le cimetière, précédé par l'enfant de
          choeur porteur de la grande croix, du curé et des deux autres
          enfants de choeur. Derrière le corbillard, la famille Dollé et
          leurs proches.
                         
          Délaissant le cortège, Paulette et Michel circulent dans les
          allées du cimetière. Ils observent les croix.
                         
          Les porteurs posent le cercueil à côté de la fosse destinée à
          Georges. Les cloches de l'église sonnent à la volée.
                         
          Michel et Paulette continuent à se promener dans les allées du
          cimetière.
                         
          Le cercueil a maintenant été descendu dans la fosse. Raymond et un
          autre homme récupère les cordes qui ont servi à le descendre.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben, v'là tout...
                         
          Le curé jette une poignée de terre sur le cercueil.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Et maintenant, mes amis, permettez-moi d'adresser quelques
           mots à une famille particulièrement éprouvée... A tous,
           petits et grands, j'adresse l'expression de ma
           douloureuse...
                         
          Michel et Paulette inspectent les croix.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Celle-là, ça irait pour une jument.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Et là pour un pigeon.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Un chat.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Un gros, alors !
                         
          Paulette montre du doigt la très haute croix, plantée à côté de
          l'église, près de l'entrée du cimetière.
                          PAULETTE
           Et là, pour une « girafle » !
                         
          Raymond finit de rouler la corde qui a servi à descendre le
          cercueil. Son père, en manche de chemise et une pelle à la main,
          remet la terre dans la tombe, tout en parlant au curé
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Alors, j'ai dit : forcément, c'est un coup des Gouard.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Vous avez des preuves ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Il nous en veut.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Il dit que je suis déserteur.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Pourquoi vous en veut-il ?
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Il est jaloux.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           C'est tout de même pas une raison pour avoir volé les croix
           du corbillard.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ouais ! Quand je le réparais tout à l'heure, le corbillard,
           il y a ses garces de filles qui sont passées. Et bien,
           elles ricanaient.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Le Francis, et ben, il est plus déserteur que moi.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           J'y crèverai la paillasse, s'il continue. Parce que moi, je
           les respecte, les morts.
                         
          Plan rapproché sur la terre, pelletée par le père Dollé, qui finit
          de combler la tombe. Posée à plat sur le sol, une croix, avec une
          plaque, sur laquelle est inscrit : « Georges DOLLÉ, décédé le 15
          juin 1940 ». Du pied, Michel fait bouger légèrement la croix.
          Paulette et Michel ont l'air fasciné par cette croix.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Et eux, Monsieur le Curé, il les respectent pas.
                         
          Le père Dollé pose sa pelle, prend la croix et la plante dans le
          sol à l'arrière de la tombe. La mère accroche un petit crucifix
          blanc sur la croix.
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          ÉGLISE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La nef de l'église. Elle est vide, sauf pour Berthe, à genoux sur
          un prie-dieu, et qui égrène son chapelet.
          Derrière elle, le confessionnal, dans lequel Michel est à genoux.
                         
          Dans le confessionnal. Le curé, derrière sa grille, confesse
          Michel.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           C'était toi, les croix du corbillard ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oui, Monsieur le Curé.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Mais pourquoi ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Pour faire un cadeau.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           A qui ?
                         
          Michel hésite.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je peux pas le dire.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Bon. Et bien, tu me les rapporteras. Et puis tu vas me
           dire, en sortant d'ici, cinq Pater et cinq Ave. Dis ton
           acte de contrition.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Mon Dieu, j'ai un très grand regret de vous avoir offensé,
           car vous êtes infiniment bon, infiniment aimable, et que le
           péché vous déplait. Je prends la ferme résolution, par
           votre Sainte Grâce, de ne plus vous offenser et de faire
           pénitence.
          Retour dans Dans l'église. Michel sort du confessionnal, fait un
          signe de croix et se dirige, tête baissée, vers un prie-dieu sur
          lequel il s'agenouille. Berthe fait un signe de croix, se lève et
          va s'agenouiller dans le confessionnal.
                         
          Michel commence à réciter son « Notre Père ».
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Notre Père, qui êtes aux cieux, que Votre Nom soit
           sanctifié, que Votre Règne arrive, que Votre Volonté soit
           faite sur la terre comme au ciel. Donnez-nous aujourd'hui
           notre pain quotidien.
                         
          Il relève la tête et regarde la grande croix de métal doré au-
          dessus de l'autel.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Pardonnez-nous nos offenses, comme nous pardonnons à ceux
           qui nous ont offensés.
                         
          Il jette un coup d'oeil vers le confessionnal, puis regarde de
          nouveau la grande croix.
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Mais ne nous laissez pas succomber à la tentation.
                         
          Il regarde de nouveau vers le confessionnal.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Mais délivrez-nous du mal. Ainsi soit-il.
                         
          Discrètement, il enlève ses galoches et les pose à côté du prie-
          dieu. Puis, pieds nus, il se dirige vers l'autel. Au passage, il
          ramasse une chaise dans la nef. Il ouvre la petite porte qui
          permet d'accéder à l'arrière de l'autel, jette un dernier coup
          d'oeil vers le confessionnal et disparaît derrière l'autel.
                         
          Dans le confessionnal, Berthe est en train de se confesser.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Deux fois, Monsieur le Curé.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Ah ! Vous êtes bien toutes les mêmes !
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Mais c'est pour le bon motif.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Bien sûr... Bien sûr... Mais vous avez un peu mis la
           charrue avant les boeufs.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Mais puisqu'on va se marier. Seulement voilà. On n'ose pas
           leur dire... Avec les parents qu'on a !
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Ben oui !
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Ben oui... Alors on a pensé que vous pourriez peut-être...
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Les réconcilier ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Comme vous dites...
                         
          Retour dans l'église. Michel est maintenant debout sur la chaise
          derrière l'autel. Il fait un signe de croix rapide et avance la
          main vers la croix posée sur le tabernacle.
                         
          Retour dans le confessionnal.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Mais puisqu'on va se marier...
                         
          On entend un bruit de chute provenant de l'église. Le curé
          écarquille les yeux.
                         
          Retour dans l'église. La croix tombe par terre, entraînant l'un
          des candélabres dans sa chute.
          Le curé surgit du confessionnal
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Michel !... Je t'ai vu !
                         
          Il avance, à pas rapides, vers l'autel, où il récupère la croix
          tombée à terre et la pose sur l'autel. Il a l'air très en colère.
          Il contourne l'autel, entre par la petite porte et ressort, tenant
          d'une main une chaise cassée et de l'autre l'oreille de Michel. Il
          jette la chaise cassée dans un coin.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           La croix du maître-autel ! T'avais même pas fini ta
           pénitence que tu recommençais encore pire !
                         
          Il gifle Michel à plusieurs reprises.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Prends tes souliers, et fiche-moi le camp !
                         
          Berthe est sortie du confessionnal.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce qu'il a encore fait ?
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Ça te regarde pas.
                         
          Michel ramasse ses galoches et sort de l'église en courant. Le
          curé pousse Berthe dans le confessionnal.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Allez, rentre ! On n'a pas fini !
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - SALLE COMMUNE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
          La mère Dollé a un bout de journal enflammé à la main. Elle prend
          une lampe à pétrole sur la cheminée, la pose au milieu de la table
          et l'allume. Puis elle souffle sur son papier pour l'éteindre.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Alors, tu lui as parlé, au Gouard ?
                         
          Berthe est occupée à coudre et Raymond taille un morceau de bois
          avec un grand couteau. Le père Dollé est en train de rouler une
          cigarette.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oui, je lui ai parlé.
                         
          Il tend la cigarette à Raymond.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tiens...
                         
          Tout en parlant, il craque une allumette pour allumer la cigarette
          de Raymond.
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oui, j'y ai dit : « Alors, tu voles les croix de corbillard
           maintenant ?» Y m'a dit : « Quelles croix de
           corbillard ? » Alors j'y ai dit : « Fais pas le malin. »
                         
          La mère rit en écoutant son mari.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Alors y m'a dit : « Dollé, pour les croix de corbillard, je
           te jure sur la tombe de ma femme. »
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Ben, elle est belle à voir, la tombe de sa femme !
                         
          Le père commence à rouler une autre cigarette.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben, laisse-moi faire. C'est ce que j'y ai dit... J'y ai
           dit : « La tombe de ta femme, t'as pas le droit d'en
           parler. C'est pas une tombe, c'est un taudis... Tu peux
           bien jurer tout ce que tu veux sur la tombe de ta femme, tu
           ferais mieux de la nettoyer. »
                         
          La mère continue à rire.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Et toc !...
                         
          La sculpture, sur laquelle Raymond est en train de travailler,
          représente, de façon assez grossière, le fuselage d'un avion.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Et d'abord, pourquoi ils sont pas venus à l'enterrement ?
           C'est une preuve, ça !
                         
          Elle s'assoit. Derrière elle, Renée essuie des assiettes avant de
          les ranger. Le père se sert un verre de vin, puis allume sa
          cigarette.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           On leur avait pas dit.
                         
          On entend Francis qui joue de la trompette.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ils le savaient pas, peut-être ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Ils le savaient peut-être, mais on leur avait pas dit.
                         
          Après plusieurs essais infructueux, Francis joue « l'extinction
          des feux ». Tous se sont arrêtés pour écouter la musique, mais
          seule Berthe semble l'apprécier : elle bouge doucement la tête en
          mesure. Francis s'arrête de jouer.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Mais, il nous fait suer... avec son clairon.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           C'est pas un clairon, c'est une trompette.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Trompette ou clairon, c'est quand même un déserteur.
                         
          Dans un coin isolé de la salle, en contrebas de deux petites
          marches, Michel et Paulette sont allongés par terre. Michel tient
          un porte-plume dans sa main, et un encrier est posé à côté de lui.
          Il lit le mot qu'il est en train d'écrire sur une petite fiche en
          carton.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Pou... ssin..
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Moi, j'ai décidé. Les Gouard, ça existe plus.
                         
          Michel a découpé d'autres morceaux de carton, sur lesquels il a
          inscrit des noms d'animaux. Il tend à Paulette la fiche qu'il
          vient de terminer.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Il en faut deux, puisqu'il y a deux tombes.
                         
          Gros plan sur les fiches déjà remplies. On peut lire : « Jock,
          chien », « Verre de terre », « Grillon », « Tope »
                         
           BERTHE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Qu'est que ça veut dire que les Gouard existent plus ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Parce que j'ai décidé comme ça.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Réponds pas à ton père !
                         
          Paulette regarde, sur le plancher, la progression d'un cafard.
                          PAULETTE
           Oh !... Comment ça s'appelle ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Un cafard.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Je te dis : Y a plus de Gouard. Et... et... va te
           coucher !...
                         
          Paulette essaie d'attraper le cafard.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ça pique ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Non, mais ça pue !
                         
          Michel lève son porte-plume au-dessus du cafard. Avec le porte-
          plume levé, plume vers le bas, il dessine des spirales autour du
          cafard, en imitant le bruit d'un avion. Il l'abat finalement sur
          le cafard, qu'il transperce.
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Bahoum !...
                         
          Paulette semble très choquée par ce que vient de faire Michel.
          Elle se met à pleurnicher.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Faut pas les tuer !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est pas moi, c'est une bombe... T'es folle ?
                         
          Paulette se cache la tête dans les bras et se met à pleurer.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Faut pas les tuer ! Faut pas les tuer ! Faut pas les tuer !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Faut bien qu'ils soient morts pour qu'on les enterre.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je te parle plus.
                         
          Michel a un sourire très doux vers Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Andouille !
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Et puis d'abord, tu m'avais promis la croix du curé.
                         
          Michel ne sourit plus.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oh ben, t'es pas juste !
                         
          Michel prend, dans sa poche, une main de poupée et chatouille le
          bras de Paulette avec. Elle relève la tête.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           J'en veux pas...
                         
          Elle remet la tête dans ses bras. Puis, un court instant après,
          elle la relève.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Une main de poupée.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           J'en veux pas.
                         
          Elle remet la tête dans ses bras. On entend de nouveau la
          trompette de Francis.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Si c'est pour des croix que tu fais la tête... Oh là là !
          Au son de la trompette, Raymond lève la tête.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Ce con-là ! Il nous ferait bien repérer par les avions !
                         
          Le père lève les yeux, réfléchit un instant, puis se lève et se
          dirige vers les enfants.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Allez, les gosses, au lit.
                         
          Il ouvre la fenêtre et ferme les volets.
                         
          Les enfants se lèvent. Michel ramasse son matériel. Paulette
          brosse sa robe et se dirige vers le père Dollé. Elle lui met les
          bras autour du cou et l'embrasse sur la joue.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Bonsoir, Monsieur Dollé.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Bonsoir, mon lapin.
                         
          Elle s'approche de Raymond et l'embrasse.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Bonsoir, Monsieur Raymond.
                         
          Il sourit et, par les cheveux, la ramène vers lui pour
          l'embrasser.
                         
          Michel met les petits cartons dans sa poche, et pose la bouteille
          d'encre sur la table.
                         
          Paulette se dirige vers la mère Dollé.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Bonsoir, Madame Dollé.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Bonsoir, mon Jésus.
                         
          Paulette embrasse la mère Dollé.
                         
          Michel prend la lampe et commence à monter l'escalier. Il semble
          être jaloux de toutes ces effusions.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Bonsoir, Madame Berthe.
                         
          Elle embrasse Berthe.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Bonsoir.
                         
          Elle monte l'escalier. Michel l'attend, assis sur une marche en
          haut de l'escalier, la lampe à la main.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Qu'est-ce que tu fais ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je t'attends. T'as fini d'embrasser tout le monde ?
                         
          Elle s'assoit à côté de lui sur la marche de l'escalier.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Tu veux que je t'embrasse ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'es pas gentille.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Pourquoi ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ce que tu m'as dit pour la croix du curé.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ben, tu me l'as pas donnée.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           J'ai essayé. J'ai reçu des tartes.
                         
          Il montre sa joue du doigt.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ici, les tartes... Embrasse-moi dessus.
                         
          Paulette l'embrasse sur la joue.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Mieux que ça !
                         
          Elle l'embrasse de nouveau.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           J'ai dit au lit ! Fini de se sucer la pomme !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je viens.
                         
          Les deux enfants se lèvent et finissent de monter l'escalier.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - GRENIER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Paulette s'assoit sur le lit et enlève ses chaussures.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Moi, je connais un endroit où il y en a, des croix.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Où ça ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Au cimetière.
                         
          Michel semble abasourdi par la réponse de Paulette.
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oh ben ! T'as pas peur !
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Pourquoi ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Et si les morts, ils me tirent par les pieds ?
                         
          Paulette se cache sous sa couverture.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je ne veux pas.
                         
          On entend la voix furieuse du père qui appelle Michel.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Tu veux que je monte ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je descends.
                         
          Michel soulève la couverture et dit, très gentiment.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'était pour rire... Les morts, c'est pas méchant.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ah !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oui.
                         
          Fondu enchaîné.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - GRANGE À FOIN - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Berthe et Francis sont couchés dans le foin. Francis a la tête
          posée sur le ventre de Berthe.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Dis donc... Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire, ça : « La charrue
           avant les boeufs » ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Ben, c'est ce qu'on faisait maintenant.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Ah, je savais pas que ça s'appelait comme ça.
                         
          Elle se recouche dans le foin, l'air satisfait. Tout à coup, on
          entend un bruit insolite.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Chut !...
                         
          Berthe se redresse et regarde vers le haut de la grange.
                         
          En haut de la grange, une petite porte s'ouvre, laissant
          apparaître Michel et Paulette.
          Francis se cache dans le foin. Berthe le recouvre complètement,
          faisant aussi tomber pas mal de foin sur elle-même.
                         
          Michel et Paulette sont près de l'échelle, prêts à descendre en
          bas de la grange.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           On va prendre la brouette.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Pourquoi ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Des croix ?... Plein une brouette, je te dis.
                         
          Il commence à descendre, suivi de Paulette. On entend des avions
          qui se rapprochent. Une lueur illumine la grange. Les enfants
          continuent néanmoins à descendre.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           J'ai peur.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est une fusée. Ferme les yeux.
                         
          Paulette ferme les yeux.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           J'y vois rien pour descendre si je ferme les yeux.
                         
          Berthe est à moitié cachée dans le foin. Elle reboutonne le devant
          de sa robe. Michel arrive en bas de l'échelle. Berthe semble aussi
          étonnée de voir Michel que Michel de voir Berthe.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce que vous faites là ?
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ben... et toi ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Ça te regarde ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je peux prendre la brouette ?
                         
          Michel passe devant sa soeur, et, en se penchant pour prendre la
          brouette, il aperçoit les pieds de Francis qui dépassent du foin.
          Il en attrape un, qui se rétracte aussitôt dans le foin.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ah bon !...
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Quoi... Bon ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Rien.
          Michel prend la brouette et se dirige vers la porte de la grange,
          suivi de Paulette, qui se tourne, un court instant, vers Berthe.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           En voilà une heure pour une brouette
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           On va aux escargots !
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          CHEMIN CIMETIÈRE - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          On entend encore des avions, et la scène est régulièrement
          éclairée par des lueurs venant du ciel.
                         
          Michel avance le plus vite qu'il peut en poussant la brouette
          lourdement chargée. Paulette trottine à ses côtés. Dans la
          brouette, il y a plein de croix, avec, sur le dessus, la croix de
          Georges Dollé, ainsi que la petite croix blanche que la mère Dollé
          avait fixé dessus. Paulette semble inquiète.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           T'as pas peur ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Non. Et toi ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non. Tu veux que je te chante ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Si tu veux.
                         
          Le ciel est constellé de lumières provenant des fusées envoyées
          par les avions. Paulette chante en tenant le bras de Michel. Elle
          est visiblement effrayée, mais, ne voulant pas montrer sa peur,
          elle chante avec d'autant plus d'ardeur.
                          PAULETTE
           Compère Guilleri, te laisseras-tu mourir ? On lui banda la
           jambe, et le bras lui remit, Carabi ! Les dames de
           l'hôpital sont arrivées au bruit, Carabi, toto Carabo.
           Compère Guilleri, te laisseras-tu mourir ?
                         
          Les bruits de bombes se rapprochent. Paulette lâche le bras de
          Michel et s'accroupit par terre.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Faut se coucher par terre.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Penses-tu ? Ils peuvent pas nous voir ! Allez, vite !
                         
          Il accélère le pas.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           On a perdu une croix.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ça fait rien, on en avait de trop !
                         
          Les enfants se mettent à courir, sous la lumière blafarde des
          fusées éclairantes.
                         
          Fondu au noir.
                         
          FERME DES GOUARD - SALLE COMMUNE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Le père Gouard verse de l'eau chaude d'une casserole dans un bol,
          puis il se dirige vers un meuble près de la fenêtre. Il pose le
          bol sur le meuble, trempe son blaireau dans l'eau et le frotte sur
          un pain de savon à barbe. Il se rapproche de la fenêtre, et va
          pour appliquer la mousse sur sa joue, lorsqu'il est interpelé par
          les aboiements du chien. Il regarde par la fenêtre.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - COUR - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Renée, tout habillée de noir, sort de la ferme en attachant un
          ruban dans les cheveux de Paulette. Puis Raymond sort, suivi de sa
          mère. Ils sont, tous deux, aussi, habillés de noir. La mère porte
          un bouquet de fleur et une binette. Raymond ramasse, au passage,
          un arrosoir et un râteau.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Il les aimait bien, les marguerites.
                         
          Berthe sort à son tour, elle aussi en grand deuil et les bras
          chargés de fleurs. Puis vient Michel et enfin, le père, en costume
          noir, qui sort le dernier et ferme la porte à clef. Il tient une
          petite binette à la main.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           On va lui faire un beau petit jardin, sur sa tombe.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           C'est le premier dimanche qu'on va à la messe sans lui.
          Le père envoie valdinguer le chapeau que Raymond porte sur la
          tête. Il s'agit du chapeau que Raymond avait récupéré après
          l'exode. Raymond rattrape le chapeau au vol.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Enlève ça. Allez, en route !
                         
          Ils font quelques pas, puis Michel s'arrête brusquement, et dit,
          d'une voix très décidée.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je veux pas y aller, moi, au cimetière !
                         
          Son père lui donne une gifle.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Prends toujours ça !
                         
          Berthe lui colle dans les main un pot de fleurs, fait d'une boîte
          de conserve.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Et ça !
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Et filez !
                         
          Michel se met en marche à contre-coeur. Paulette lui court après et
          lui donne le bras. Ils traversent la cour de la ferme.
                         
          FERME DES GOUARD - CUISINE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Le père Gouard a suivi toute la scène précédente de sa fenêtre. Il
          se retourne.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Jeanne !
                         
           JEANNE GOUARD (voix off)
           Quoi ?
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Va couper des fleurs.
                         
           JEANNE GOUARD (voix off)
           Pourquoi ?
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Fais ce que je te dis : va couper des fleurs ! Et
           grouille !
                         
          Il revient vers son miroir pour étaler la mousse sur son visage.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Ils sont pas les seuls à avoir un défunt.
                         
          CHEMIN CIMETIÈRE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          On entend la cloche de l'église qui appelle les fidèles à la
          messe.
          Gros plan sur une petite croix d'ivoire posée sur le chemin. Il
          s'agit de la petite croix que la mère Dollé avait accrochée sur la
          grande croix de la tombe de son fils, et aussi de la croix qui
          était tombée de la brouette des enfants.
                         
          La famille Dollé s'approche de la croix. Le père la regarde, très
          surpris.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Bon Dieu ! Mais c'est la croix de Georges !
                         
          Il la ramasse pour l'examiner, mais la mère la lui prend des main.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Bien sûr que c'est elle ! Y a encore le prix derrière.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ça, c'est pas banal !
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Elle est pas venue ici toute seule !
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ça, c'est signé !
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Quoi, signé ?
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ça, c'est une preuve !
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Une preuve de quoi ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Elle a raison : c'est une preuve !
                         
          Le père Dollé se remet en marche en accélérant le pas, suivi par
          toute sa famille.
                         
          Michel suit un peu en retrait avec Paulette. Il baisse la tête.
          D'un seul coup, il s'arrête net.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           J'y vais pas.
                         
          Il se retourne, prêt à rebrousser chemin, lorsqu'il aperçoit la
          famille Gouard, qui arrive à grands pas derrière lui. Michel prend
          la main de Paulette et se remet rapidement en marche.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Vite, v'là les Gouard !
                         
          Les Gouards marchent, eux aussi, très vite. Le père Gouard porte
          une binette sur l'épaule, Jeanne un arrosoir et des fleurs,
          Marcelle un pot de fleurs. Francis, en bretelles, porte son veston
          sur le bras.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Un taudis, qu'il a dit !
                         
                          JEANNE GOUARD
           Elle sera plus belle que la leur.
                         
          CIMETIÈRE - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Les Dollé traversent le cimetière à grandes enjambées vers la
          tombe de Georges. La croix n'est plus là.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oh !... Y a plus de croix !
                         
          Michel pose le pot de fleurs par terre. Paulette s'accroupit et
          met sa main dans le trou marquant l'emplacement de la croix
          manquante.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Y a un trou ! Elle y est plus !
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Nom de Dieu !... Regarde !...
          Il bondit vers une tombe sur laquelle est plantée une croix de
          bois avec l'inscription : « Ici repose Amélie GOUARD - 1898-
          1938 ». Il pose son chapeau sur une croix voisine, puis il saisit
          la croix à deux mains, et la casse en deux au ras du sol. La
          partie supérieure tombe à terre. Tourné vers sa famille, il ne
          voit pas les Gouard arriver derrière lui. Il ramasse la croix,
          déplante la partie encore en terre, puis, sur son genou, il se met
          en devoir de casser la croix en plusieurs morceaux. La croix se
          brise et la plaque métallique, qui l'ornait, vole en l'air.
          Derrière lui, la famille Gouard est restée pétrifiée, seul le père
          Gouard vient vers lui.
                         
          La mère Dollé, qui, elle, voit le père Gouard juste derrière son
          mari maintenant, tente de lui faire des signes muets pour
          l'avertir.
                         
          D'un coup de pied, le père Dollé envoie la croix voler dans les
          airs.
                         
          Berthe, ses fleurs à la main, part en courant vers l'église. Sa
          mère essaie toujours, par des signes muets, de prévenir son mari
          de la présence du père Gouard dans son dos.
                         
          Le père Dollé se retourne et voit enfin son voisin, le chapeau à
          la main. Il ramasse le sien et le remet sur sa tête, le père
          Gouard en fait autant. Ce dernier donne une violente bourrade au
          père Dollé, qui manque perdre l'équilibre et perd son chapeau. Le
          père Dollé donne une violent bourrade à son voisin, qui perd son
          chapeau. Le père Gouard revient vers le père Dollé, le prend par
          le col, et le fait reculer lentement.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Salaud !... Vampire !... Salaud !...
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Landru !...
          Sous la poussée du père Gouard, le père Dollé recule de plus en
          plus vite.
                         
          La famille Gouard est toujours pétrifiée à l'entrée du cimetière.
          Francis mord le bord de son chapeau.
                         
          Le père Gouard continue à pousser son adversaire devant lui. Ils
          finissent par tomber, tous les deux, dans une fosse fraîchement
          creusée. Les deux familles accourent, et s'alignent, chacune d'un
          côté de la fosse.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Ah !... vous avez bonne mine, tous les deux !
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tu t'es-t'y fait mal ?
                         
                          JEANNE GOUARD
           Et toi, le père ?
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Et ben, répondez, quoi !
          On entend les coups et les grognements des deux combattants.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Oui !... Tiens !...
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD (voix off)
           Houlà ! La vache !
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Joseph ! Méfie-toi, il est mauvais !
                         
                          JEANNE GOUARD
           Le lâche pas !
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Allez, c'est pas un endroit pour se battre !
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Je voudrais bien savoir où tu t'es battu, toi, déserteur !
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           Oh, mais... déserteur, toi même !
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Je suis pas déserteur, je suis réformé... Moi, j'ai
           l'albumine.
                         
                          FRANCIS GOUARD
           L'albumine !...
                         
          Francis, d'un coup de main, fait voler le chapeau de Raymond.
                         
          Berthe, tenant toujours ses fleurs à la main, arrive en courant,
          suivie du curé, qui porte encore son aube et son étole.
                         
          Les deux familles se retournent vers le curé.
          Au fond du trou, les deux hommes continuent à se battre.
                         
          Les familles s'écartent légèrement pour laisser passer le curé,
          qui se penche, l'air très mécontent.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           C'est fini, non ?
                         
          Les bruits de bagarre continuent. Comme le curé est penché, le bas
          de son étole est au niveau des yeux de Paulette accroupie. Elle
          semble fascinée par les deux belles croix brodées qui ornent
          l'étole, qu'elle touche délicatement.
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Des pères de famille ! Vous n'avez pas honte ?
                         
          Dans le trou, les deux hommes se tiennent toujours par le col.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Monsieur le Curé, il m'a cassé la croix d'Amélie !
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Monsieur le Curé, il m'a volé les deux croix de Georges !
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           C'est pas vrai : je vole pas les morts, moi !
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Si c'est pas toi, qui c'est, alors, ?
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Vous n'avez pas honte !... Non, Dollé, c'est pas lui. Je le
           connais, celui qui s'amuse à voler les croix.
                         
          Derrière le curé, Michel s'éloigne le plus discrètement possible.
          Paulette le regarde partir en hochant la main, avec un air de
          « Ben dis donc, qu'est-ce que vas prendre ! »
                         
                          LE CURÉ
           Il a déjà essayé de voler la croix du maître-autel !
                         
          Michel se sauve en courant à travers les tombes
                         
           LE CURÉ (voix off)
           Michel !... Michel !... Viens ici !
                         
          Michel court de plus en plus vite.
                         
          Les têtes des deux combattants, soudain calmés, émergent du haut
          de la fosse. Ils sont échevelés et ils ont le col en bataille.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Michel !... Michel !...
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (hurlant)
           Michel !...
                         
          Michel sort du cimetière en courant. Les membres des deux
          familles, accompagnés du curé, se lancent à sa poursuite. Sauf les
          deux pères, coincés dans la fosse, et Paulette, qui regarde toute
          cette agitation avec une certaine indifférence.
                         
                          VOIX DIVERSES
           Michel !... Michel !... Michel !... Viens ici !...
           Michel !...
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Michel !... Viens ici !... Qu'est-ce que tu as fais ?...
           Regarde ce que tu nous fais, hein !...
                         
          Le père Gouard fait la courte échelle à son voisin, qui sort de la
          fosse et rejoint, en courant, les poursuivants de Michel.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Ben !... Et moi !...
                         
          Il essaie désespérément de sortir de la fosse.
                         
           LE PÈRE GOUARD
           Bande de fumiers !
                         
          Paulette continue à regarder, sans bouger, les gens qui sortent en
          courant du cimetière.

          MOULIN - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Les croix du cimetière sont plantées dans le sol de terre battue
          du vieux moulin. Certaines croix sont décorées de fleurs. Sur
          chaque croix, soit fixées sur croix, soit posées au pied de la
          croix, l'une des « étiquettes » rédigées par Michel et portant le
          nom du « défunt » : « Jock, chien », « Tope », « Poussin »,
          « Verre de terre », « Papillon », « Rouge-gorge », etc. Michel,
          assis par terre, face à « son cimetière », contemple son oeuvre
          avec un certain orgueil. Il s'essuie les mains avec des feuilles,
          prend une pomme et mord dedans.

          FERME DES DOLLÉ - SALLE COMMUNE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          La mère Dollé est en train de se déshabiller. Elle jette son jupon
          sur le lit de Georges, sur lequel il n'y a plus ni drap, ni
          couverture, et se retrouve en combinaison. Assis à table, et
          éclairés par une lampe à pétrole, le père en train d'écrire et
          Renée est en train de lire.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           S'il est pas rentré, c'est qu'il a peur de toi.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Il a pas tort.
                         
          La mère Dollé s'est assise sur son lit et enlève ses bas.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Fais-y pas de mal.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Je ne peux pas lui en faire du mal, je ne sais pas où il
           est !
                         
          Le père se cure les dents avec un morceau d'allumette, puis
          crachote un coup.
                         
          Raymond, déjà couché, joue avec l'avion qu'il s'est fabriqué. Il
          finit de clouer l'hélice.
                         
          Renée tourne une page de son livre, et, très absorbée par sa
          lecture, ne se rend plus compte de ce qu'il se passe autour
          d'elle. Elle se bouche même les oreilles pour être certaine de
          bien s'isoler de sa famille.
                         
          Le père se verse un verre de vin, et le regarde pensivement avant
          de le boire.
                         
          Raymond souffle sur l'hélice de son avion, mais celle-ci ne bouge
          pas.
                         
          Le père boit la moitié de son verre.
          Raymond fait tourner l'hélice avec le morceau de métal qui lui a
          servi à la clouer.
                         
          Le père fait naviguer un peu le vin dans sa bouche avant de
          l'avaler. Il hoche la tête, conscient de la faiblesse
          intellectuelle de son fils. Il finit son verre de vin, se lève un
          peu brusquement, et immédiatement porte les mains sur ses reins.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ouh !...
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           T'as toujours mal ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Mais, Bon Dieu... mais qu'est-ce qu'il a bien pu foutre de
           quatorze croix ? Je comprends pas.
                         
          La mère se glisse dans son lit. Le père Dollé s'approche de Renée.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Allez, toi, va te coucher.
                         
                          RENÉE DOLLÉ
           Oh, laisse-moi finir.
                         
          Le père Dollé regarde le livre, qui n'est pas en très bon état, et
          dont les pages ont tendance à se détacher.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce que c'est ?
                         
                          RENÉE DOLLÉ
           Je sais pas, mais c'est beau !... Ah !...
                         
          Elle râle parce que le père, en lui rendant le livre, l'a quelque
          peu malmené. Le père remet sa casquette sur sa tête. Il prend la
          lampe-tempête pour sortir.
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Quatorze ?... Quatorze ?...
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Quatorze. J'ai refait le compte avec le curé... Et encore,
           je dis même pas celle du Georges.
                         
          Il pose la lampe sur la table et compte sur ses doigts.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tiens... Il y a les Galuchet, un... les Brillon, deux... la
           veuve Contrat, trois...
                         
          Raymond imite son père et compte aussi sur ses doigts.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Celle des Gouard.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oui, celle des...
          Il se tourne vers Raymond.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ta gueule !
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Qu'est-ce ça va nous coûter ?
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Oh, c'est pas compliqué... Celle de Georges faisait deux
           cent cinquante francs... Deux cent cinquante multiplié par
           quatorze...
                         
          Derrière la fenêtre, on distingue le visage de Michel qui regarde
          à l'intérieur de la ferme.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Je pose quatorze et je retiens...
                         
          Dans son lit, Raymond essaie de calculer mentalement, mais n'y
          arrive visiblement pas.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           T'as jamais su... Attends seulement que je le retrouve.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - COUR - EXTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Michel, derrière la fenêtre, regarde ce qui se passe dans la
          ferme, et voit son père se diriger vers la porte. Entendant la
          porte s'ouvrir, Michel s'éloigne en courant. Le père sort de la
          ferme et regarde autour de lui. Mais il ne voit rien et n'entend
          que le chant des grenouilles.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - GRANGE À FOIN - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Michel entre précipitamment dans la grange, et grimpe rapidement à
          l'échelle. Arrivé en haut de l'échelle, il ouvre la petite porte
          qui communique avec le grenier.
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - GRENIER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Par la grange, Michel entre dans la « chambre de Paulette ». Il
          chuchote.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Paulette !... Paulette !...
                         
          Michel s'aperçoit que le lit est vide. Il tend l'oreille, et
          entendant des voix, il descend quelques marches de l'escalier.
                         
          A travers les barreaux verticaux qui longe l'escalier, il aperçoit
          Renée toujours assise à table en train de lire. Il entend aussi la
          voix de Berthe venant de juste en-dessous de l'escalier. Il tourne
          la tête, puis se rapproche des barreaux.
                         
           BERTHE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Pourquoi tu veux pas ?... Tu vas me le dire... Hein ?...
                         
          A travers les barreaux, Michel voit Berthe qui embrasse Paulette
          et l'assoit sur un lit.
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - SALLE COMMUNE - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Michel se colle le visage entre les barreaux pour mieux suivre ce
          qui se passe.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Et puisque tu le sais, dis-le moi.
                         
          Paulette regarde Berthe en pleurnichant.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non ! Je le sais pas.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Mais si, tu le sais, ton nez remue.
                         
          Paulette se prend le nez entre les doigts.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Pourquoi ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Quand il remue, c'est qu'on a menti.
                         
          Paulette semble un peu inquiète.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Ah ?...
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Tu te rends compte de ce qu'il a fait, Michel ? Voler la
           croix de son frère !... Tu crois que c'est beau, ça ?
                         
          Berthe s'agenouille au pied du lit. Paulette se met à pleurer,
          tout en continuant à se tripoter le nez.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Je te demande pas de pleurer, je te demande où elles
           sont... Mais à quoi ça vous sert, des croix ? C'est pas des
           jouets !
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non, c'est pas des jouets...
                         
          Berthe lui pousse la main avec laquelle elle tient son nez.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Écoute... Tiens pas ton nez... Monsieur Dollé, il te tapera
           dessus jusqu'à ce que tu aies le derrière tout noir. Alors,
           t'as qu'à me le dire à moi... J'irai les chercher et
           personne ne vous dira rien... C'est pas mieux comme ça ?
                         
          A travers les barreaux, Michel mime le mot « Non ».
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Oui.
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Tu vois... Où elles sont ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je ne sais pas.
                         
          Le ton de Berthe se durcit.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Ben alors, pourquoi vous êtes venus prendre la brouette
           dans la grange ?... Je vais lui dire, moi, à Monsieur
           Dollé.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tu lui diras quoi, à Monsieur Dollé ?
                         
          Berthe et Paulette lève la tête vers le haut de l'escalier.
          Paulette sourit, mais Berthe semble un peu surprise.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Ah ! Te voilà, toi !
                         
          Elle se lève.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Et moi aussi je vais lui dire.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Tu lui diras quoi ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Avec qui que t'étais dans la grange.
                         
          Berthe semble un peu mal à son aise, tout à coup.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Menteur.
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Menteuse.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Je l'appelle ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Vas-y !
                         
          Le père Dollé rentre dans la pièce et tire le verrou de la porte.
          Berthe se tourne vers Michel, et prend un ton doucereux pour
                         DIRE :
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Fais pas le malin.
                         
          Michel grimpe rapidement en haut de l'escalier.
                         
          Le père Dollé pose sa lampe sur une petite table.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (à Renée)
           J'ai dit : « Au lit ! »
                         
          Renée se lève précipitamment de la table, son livre à la main. Son
          père la pousse vers son lit. A la lumière de la bougie posée près
          du lit, Renée continue à lire, tout en se déshabillant. Le père se
          tourne vers Berthe qui tient Paulette dans ses bras.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           J'ai tout bouclé. Si jamais il vient taper cette nuit, mine
           de rien, tu le fais rentrer et tu m'appelles... Compris ?
                         
          On voit furtivement Michel qui observe la scène entre deux
          barreaux de l'escalier. Berthe, qui se sait observée et écoutée,
          prend un ton faussement enjoué pour répondre
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Oui, papa.
                         
          Le père Dollé regarde Paulette dans les bras de Berthe.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Elle n'a rien dit ?
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Non.
                         
          Berthe pose Paulette par terre. Celle-ci ne quitte pas le père
          Dollé des yeux. Berthe embrasse Paulette.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Bonsoir, mon Jésus.
                         
          Berthe pousse Paulette à s'éloigner d'elle. Le père s'approche de
          la bougie qui éclaire le livre de Renée, et la souffle.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           La lumière, c'est pas fait pour lire.
          La scène est tout à coup plongée dans l'obscurité complète.
                         
                          RENÉE DOLLÉ
           J'y vois rien à me déshabiller.
                         
          Le père Dollé ricane.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oh, pour ce que t'as à montrer.
                         
          Paulette commence à monter deux marches de l'escalier et s'arrête
          pour regarder Raymond, allongé dans son lit au pied de l'escalier.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Bonsoir, Monsieur Raymond.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Je te dirai bonsoir quand vous aurez rendu les croix.
                         
          Paulette regarde un instant autour d'elle, puis, comprenant
          qu'elle n'est plus aussi aimée qu'auparavant, elle reprend sa
          marche dans l'escalier.
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - GRENIER - INTÉRIEUR NUIT
                         
          Michel attend Paulette, qui gravit les dernières marches.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tu viens... On y va.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Où ça ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Au cimetière.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Oh non ! Pas maintenant, il fait noir.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Et puis d'abord, il a tout bouclé. On ira demain.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Il est beau ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ah !... S'il est beau ! Y a toutes les croix... et les
           étiquettes.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Raconte-moi.
                         
          Michel entraîne Paulette loin de l'escalier, de peur qu'on les
          entende.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           J'ai mis des cailloux. Y a toutes les bêtes... et puis des
           fleurs... Y a des assiettes cassées... des escargots.
                         
          Paulette rit. On entend du bruit venant d'en bas. Michel se
          précipite vers la petite porte qui mène à la grange. Mais avant de
          sortir, il lui chuchote :
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je vais me coucher dans la grange.
                         
          Michel referme la porte. Paulette semble très heureuse et elle se
          jette toute habillée sur son lit. Elle se glisse sous la
          couverture sans même enlever ses chaussures.
                         
          Fondu au noir
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - GRANGE À FOIN - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          On entend le chant du coq. Michel dort dans le foin, enveloppé
          dans un sac à blé. Paulette s'approche de lui et lui chatouille
          l'oreille avec une paille. Il se réveille et se frotte les yeux.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tiens, tu es là ?
                         
          Il se lève, et s'assoit dans le foin à côté de Paulette.
                          PAULETTE
           Bonjour.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Bonjour... Allez... on y va.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Où ça ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Ben, voir le cimetière.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           J'ai faim.
                         
          Michel sort une pomme de sa poche et la tend à Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tiens.
                         
          Paulette prend la pomme et la sent. Puis elle la remet dans la
          main de Michel.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           J'aime pas les pommes.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           J'ai pas autre chose.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je veux du café au lait.
                         
          Michel se lève, l'air un peu agacé.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ

          On voit les deux fermes voisines, et, au loin, une voiture qui
          s'approche et finit pas s'arrêter.
                         
          Dans la cour des Gouard, Francis regarde la voiture et semble très
          inquiet. Il entre rapidement chez lui.
                         
          Près du ruisseau, Raymond est en train de puiser de l'eau. Lui
          aussi voit la voiture s'arrêter, et il semble un peu intrigué.
                         
          Sur le chemin qui mène aux deux fermes, deux gendarmes marchent
          vers les bâtiments.
                         
          Raymond, son broc à la main court vers la ferme.

          Le père, debout près de la table, est en train d'essuyer un verre.
          La mère essuie autre chose derrière lui. Berthe est assise à
          table, et Renée est debout derrière elle
          La porte vers l'extérieur est grande ouverte, et Raymond entre en
                         RIGOLANT :
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           Ça y est, les Gouard ont porté plainte !
                         
          Le père se tourne vers lui.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ça te fait rigoler, toi ? Et les croix, hein ?... C'est toi
           qui les paieras ?
                         
          Il donne une gifle à Raymond, puis sort sur le pas de la porte. La
          mère et Renée le rejoignent. Le père se tourne vers sa femme.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Et ce cochon qui est même pas rentré !
                         
          Berthe est maintenant debout près de la table.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Il est pas loin.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tu pouvais pas le dire.
                         
                          BERTHE DOLLÉ
           Tu me l'as pas demandé.
                         
          Le père se met à crier :
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Michel !... Michel !...
                         
          Il s'éloigne dans la cour.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - COUR - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
          Les deux gendarmes traversent la passerelle et s'approchent de la
          ferme Dollé.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - SALLE COMMUNE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          La mère Dollé rentre dans la pièce, suivie de Renée.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Michel !...
                         
          La mère arrange sa coiffure. Elle semble très nerveuse.

           Michel !...
                         
          Michel regarde par la lucarne et revient vers Paulette.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Merde, v'là les gendarmes !
                          PAULETTE
           Qu'est-ce qu'ils vont nous faire ?
                         
          Paulette prend un sac a blé, et se le met sur le dos en
          frissonnant.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je sais pas... Y a qu'à rien leur dire... Tu jures ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Oui.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Non. Dis : « Je jure » !
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je jure.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Bon, moi aussi, je dis « Je jure ». Croix en bois, croix en
           fer, celui qui ment, y va en Enfer.
                         
          Il tend la main et crache par terre, puis se retourne vers la
          lucarne.
                         
          Le père Dollé ouvre la porte de la grange.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Michel !...
                         
          Il se dirige vers son fils.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Saligaud, t'as gagné, v'là les gendarmes.
                         
          Il grimpe sur le tas de foin, sur lequel Michel et Paulette sont
          serrés l'un contre l'autre, près de la lucarne.
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tu vas dire où elles sont, ces croix ?
                         
          Il trébuche sur un manche de fourche caché dans le foin et s'étale
          dans le foin. Il se relève, jette la fourche loin de lui et se
          dirige vers Michel.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tu le diras, hein ?
                         
          Il essaie d'attraper Michel, qui lui échappe. Paulette se met à
          pleurer.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tête de cochon, tu vas le dire où elles sont, ces croix,
           hein ?
                         
          Il réussit à attraper Michel et le secoue.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Hein ?...
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Non, je le dirai pas.
                         
          Le père jette son fils dans le foin.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Alors, tu finiras en prison !
                         
          Michel se relève.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oui, j'aime mieux !
                         
          Alors que Michel essaie de se sauver, le père l'attrape par un
          pied et le fait trébucher. Il le secoue dans tous les sens et lui
          donne des baffes.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Quatorze croix ! Mais, Bon Dieu de Bon Dieu, mais qu'est-ce
           que t'avais à foutre de quatorze croix, hein ?
                         
          Il le soulève comme s'il s'agissait d'une plume et le jette par
          terre.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Oh !... Quatorze croix !... Quatorze milles coups de pied
           au cul, oui ! Hein ?...
                         
          Michel commence à grimper à l'échelle, et son père lui donne un
          grand coup de pied dans le derrière. Puis il l'attrape par une
          jambe et le jette par terre, où il le frappe.
                         
          Paulette se caresse la joue, comme elle le fait chaque fois
          qu'elle est perturbée.
                         
           MICHEL DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Aïe !... Aïe !... Aïe !...
          On entend les bruits de la raclée que prend Michel. Paulette
          pleure doucement, tout en se frottant la joue.
                         
           MICHEL DOLLÉ (voix off)
           Aïe !... Aïe !... Aïe !... Aïe !...
                         
          Paulette suit la punition des yeux et se met à pleurnicher.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Michel !... Michel !... Michel !...
                         
          La porte s'ouvre et la mère apparaît. Elle semble apaisée, et même
          joyeuse.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Joseph !... Joseph !... Hé, laisse-le !
                         
          Michel saute du haut du la grange, pendant que son père descend
          plus prudemment par l'échelle.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tu vois bien que je suis occupé.
          Comme sa mère est devant la porte, Michel ne peut pas se sauver
          comme il l'escomptait et son père le rattrape.
                         
          La mère s'approche de son mari.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Hé, laisse-le. C'est pas pour ça qu'ils sont venus.
                         
          La mère détache Michel des mains de son père.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           C'est pour Paulette.
                         
          Elle se dirige pour Paulette, toujours pleurnichant contre le mur
          avec son sac sur les épaules.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Paulette ?
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Mais oui, ils viennent la chercher.
                         
          Elle prend Paulette pour l'emmener avec elle. Paulette résiste.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je veux pas !... Je veux pas !... Je veux pas y aller !...
                         
          La mère emmène Paulette avec elle.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Allez, viens, toi !
                         
          Paulette continue à pleurnicher et à pleurer, pendant que la mère
          l'entraîne vers la porte de la grange.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je veux pas y aller ! Je veux pas y aller ! Je veux pas y
           aller !
                         
          Michel réalise, tout à coup, ce qui se passe.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Je veux pas qu'on l'emmène.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           On te demande rien.
                         
          Il repousse son fils
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Mais ils vont pas lui faire du mal. C'est pour l'amener à
           l'orphelinat avec les petites filles.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je veux pas y aller.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Elle ira pas à l'orphelinat.
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           On ne peut tout de même pas la garder.
                         
          Le père, toujours en colère contre son fils, le foudroie du
          regard.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Parce que c'est toi qui commandes, oui ?
                         
          Il se tourne vers Paulette et sa voix se fait plus douce.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Faut pas avoir peur, va... Ils sont gentils.
                         
          Alors que son père, sa mère et Paulette sont à la porte de la
          grange, Michel se rapproche d'eux, et dit, d'une voix plus calme :
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Et si je te dis où elles sont, tu la gardes ?
                         
          Son père et sa mère s'arrêtent et se tournent vers lui.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ça n'a rien à voir.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Et ben, tu le sauras jamais. T'entends ? Jamais.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Je m'occuperai de toi après.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           C'est pas comme ça que tu les auras !
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Et comment alors ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Y a qu'à la garder... Si elle reste, on rendra les croix,
           et puis on demandera pardon à tout le monde. Et puis elle
           ira au catéchisme, et puis à l'école, et elle aidera à la
           maison.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Et puis, à la fin, vous vous marierez !
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Alors dis-le où elles sont.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'as pas promis.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Bon... Ben... Ça va, dis-le... Alors, dis-le où elles sont.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Dis-le, Michel.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Elles sont au moulin.
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Au moulin ?
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Mais pourquoi au moulin ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'as qu'à venir avec moi.
                         
          Michel ouvre la porte pour sortir, mais il bute dans son frère
          Raymond, qui entre suivi des deux gendarmes, qui saluent le père
          Dollé. Le père leur rend un vague salut. Michel recule. Un des
          gendarmes se penche vers Paulette.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ben... la voilà, ce pauvre petit chou.
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           Bonjour, ma petite fille.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non !
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           Comment t'appelles-tu ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non !
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           Comment elle s'appelle ?
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Nous, on l'appelle Paulette, tout simplement.
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           Ah !...
                          (A PAULETTE)
           Ton papa et ta maman, ils ont été tués par les
           bombardements ?
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Non !
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           Ben, alors, quoi ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           C'est elle qui nous l'a dit.
                         
          La mère se penche vers Paulette.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Comment non ? Mais rappelle-toi bien, mon poulet.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ayez pas peur, ça va lui revenir.
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           Elle a peut-être été commotionnée.
                         
          Le gendarme essaie de prendre Paulette par le menton. Dans un
          premier temps, elle tend le menton, puis elle se recule.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Comme vous dites, oui.
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           On n'a même pas son nom.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           A moi, elle va le dire.
                         
          Elle se penche vers Paulette.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tu t'appelles Paulette comment ?... Hein ?... Paulette
           comment ?...
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Dollé.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Dollé !... Ben, elle dit qu'elle s'appelle Dollé
           maintenant !
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Je veux m'appeler comme Michel.
                         
                          RAYMOND DOLLÉ
           C'est bien ça, les gosses.
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           Ça manque d'éléments.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Mais vous allez la prendre quand même ?
                          UN GENDARME
           On la passera à la Croix-Rouge.
                         
          Le père Dollé se penche vers Paulette.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ah, tu vois, tu vas faire une belle promenade avec ces
           messieurs.
                         
           LA MÈRE DOLLÉ
           Et en automobile encore...
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Ah !...
                         
          Un gendarme sort un livret de sa poche et le pose sur un tonneau.
          Michel semble ne pas vouloir croire ce qu'il voit.
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           Allez... vous signez là, Monsieur Dollé.
          Il tend son crayon au père Dollé. Ce dernier, machinalement, le
          mouille avec sa bouche avant d'écrire. Au moment où son père va
          signer, Michel explose.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           T'as pas le droit, t'as promis.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           D'abord, j'ai pas promis... Et puis d'abord, ta gueule !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Menteur !
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           C'est comme ça que tu parles à ton père ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oui, il m'avait dit qu'on la garderait si je lui disais
           où... où sont les croix.
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Tu vas te taire ?
                         
          Michel lève machinalement le bras, comme pour éviter la baffe
          qu'il sent imminente.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Et ben, tu les auras pas, tes croix !
                         
          Michel sort en courant de la grange. Le gendarme le regarde
          partir, un peu intrigué.
                         
                          UN GENDARME
           Quelles croix ?
                         
           LE PÈRE DOLLÉ
           Des croix ?... Pfff !...
          Il hausse les épaules et signe.
                         
          FERME DES DOLLÉ - COUR - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Michel saute une barrière à l'extrémité de la cour, et part en
          courant à travers champs.
                         
          MOULIN - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Michel entre en courant dans le moulin.
                         
          MOULIN - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Michel commence à arracher les croix, qu'il jette dans un coin
          près de la fenêtre, qui donne sur la rivière.
                         
          Installé sur sa poutre, près de son nid, le hibou le regarde, un
          peu indifférent.
                         
          Michel continue à arracher les croix et à les empiler près de la
          fenêtre. Arrivé à la tombe du chien de Paulette, il décroche une
          croix plus belle que les autres, attachée sur la croix
          rudimentaire que Michel avait fabriqué avec un bout de bois et du
          fil de fer. Cette croix ouvragée a été réalisée avec du fil de fer
          torsadé sur lequel des petites perles ont été enfilées. Puis il
          décroche aussi, très délicatement, le bracelet cassé de Paulette,
          qui, lui aussi, orne la croix rudimentaire. Il le regarde un
          instant, puis le met dans sa poche. Il s'approche de la la
          fenêtre, qui est en fait un grand trou dans la maçonnerie du
          bâtiment, la véritable fenêtre ayant disparu depuis longtemps. Il
          prend toutes les croix empilées et les jette dans la rivière, où
          elle s'éloignent, emportées pas le courant. Puis, tenant toujours
          la croix ouvragée dans sa main, il court vers l'échelle qui monte
          vers la charpente du moulin. Il grimpe à toute vitesse.
                         
          Arrivée dans la charpente, il s'arrête, car il vient d'entendre le
          bruit d'un moteur de voiture. Il a les larmes aux yeux. Par la
          fenêtre, on aperçoit le nuage de poussière laissée par ce que l'on
          devine être la voiture des gendarmes qui emmènent Paulette. Il
          regarde, une dernière fois, la croix ouvragée, et la jette
          rageusement dans la rivière avec les autres. Il ne lui reste plus
          que le bracelet.
                         
          Il s'approche du hibou, et lui montre le bracelet.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Tiens, garde-le cent ans.
                         
          Le hibou cligne des yeux. Puis Michel suspend le bracelet sur une
          cheville qui dépasse d'une poutre, au-dessus de la tête du hibou,
          qui regarde, un peu intrigué, cet objet brillant. Michel le
          caresse et le hibou ferme les yeux.
                         
          HALL DE LA CROIX-ROUGE - INTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Une femme assez âgée fait boire un petit chat dans un bol. La
          femme se retourne pour prendre un autre bol que lui tend une
          religieuse (qui porte l'uniforme d'époque des soeurs de Saint-
          Vincent de Paul). La femme boit dans un bol et le chat dans
          l'autre.
          Autour de la vieille femme, on aperçoit la foule des réfugiés,
          ainsi que les bénévoles civils ou religieux. Le décor, avec les
          piliers qui supportent des croisées d'ogive, nous indique que nous
          sommes dans un établissement religieux, église ou cloître.
                         
          Une religieuse marche à travers la foule, une étiquette à la main,
          et un dossier sous l'autre bras. Elle cherche visiblement
          quelqu'un. Elle finit par s'approcher de Paulette, assise sur un
          banc. La petite fille a l'air totalement absente. La religieuse
          lui accroche l'étiquette autour du cou, à l'aide d'un cordon.
                         
                          LA RELIGIEUSE
           Voilà ! Il faudra bien la garder.
                         
          Paulette ne regarde même pas la religieuse. Elle a le regard
          absent, fixé dans le vide. La religieuse sort de sa poche une
          petite barre de chocolat, qu'elle donne à Paulette, qui la prend
          machinalement, mais ne cherche même pas à la manger.
                         
                          LA RELIGIEUSE
           Tiens.
          Arrive une femme très distinguée, tailleur élégant et collier de
          perles. C'est visiblement une femme du monde, qui oeuvre en tant
          que bénévole pour la Croix-Rouge.
                         
           DAME BÉNÉVOLE CROIX-ROUGE
           Ah ! Elle a fini par vous dire son nom, ma soeur ?
                         
          Gros plan sur l'étiquette pendue autour du cou de Paulette. Il y
                         EST INSCRIT :
                         
                          CROIX-ROUGE FRANÇAISE
           CONVOIS DE MALADES
           OU D'ENFANTS ISOLÉS
           Date : 20 juin - N° d'ordre : 2608
           Centre départ : Mérimont ?? (mot illisible)
                          NOM : DOLLÉ
           Prénom : Paulette - Age : 5 ans
           Destination : Clermont Ferrand
                         
                         
                          LA RELIGIEUSE
           Et puis tu verras, ma petite...
                         
          La religieuse lit le nom écrit sur l'étiquette.
                         
                          LA RELIGIEUSE
           ...Paulette... tu verras comme tu seras bien... Tu seras
           avec tout plein de petites filles comme toi, qui ont eu
           beaucoup de malheur, mais, toutes ensembles, vous serez
           quand même bien contentes...
                         
          Paulette, le regard toujours fixé dans le vide, ne semble pas
          écouter la religieuse qui lui parle, ne cherchant même pas à
          comprendre ce qu'elle lui dit.
                         
          La religieuse ramasse son dossier et se relève pour partir
          s'occuper d'autres réfugiés.
                          LA RELIGIEUSE
           Surtout, ne bouge pas... Sois sage...
                         
          La religieuse s'éloigne. Paulette regarde, d'un air absent, les
          gens qui l'entourent. Tout à coup, on entend une voix de femme,
          plus forte que le brouhaha ambiant.
                         
           UNE FEMME (voix off)
           Michel !... Michel !...
                         
          Paulette tourne la tête vers la voix.
                         
          Au milieu de la foule, on voit une femme, qui était assise, se
          lever et appeler :
                         
                          UNE FEMME
           Michel !...
                         
          Paulette se lève, tenant toujours sa barre de chocolat à la main.
          Elle dit, d'une voix de plus en plus sanglotante :
                          PAULETTE
           Michel !... Michel !... Michel !... Michel !... Michel !...
           Michel !...
                         
          Elle se faufile au milieu des réfugiés et se dirige vers l'endroit
          d'où provenait la voix.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Michel !... Michel !...
                         
          Elle finit par retrouver la femme, en train de serrer dans ses
          bras le « Michel » qu'elle cherchait.
                         
          Paulette murmure alors :
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Maman !... Maman !...
                         
          Elle part en courant à travers le hall de la Croix-Rouge, tenant
          toujours sa barre de chocolat à la main, et se faufilant au milieu
          de la foule des réfugiés, vers une destination inconnue, tout en
                         CRIANT :
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Michel !... Michel !... Michel !...
                         
          Le mot « FIN » apparaît en lettre blanches sur la foule des
          réfugiés, filmée en plongée.
                         
          Fondu au noir et musique du film.
                         
                         NOTE
          Ceci marque la fin de la version la plus courante du film. La
          scène qui suit, comme l'était déjà la première scène du film, a
          été coupée dans de nombreuses copies projetées de nos jours. Cette
          scène se déroule d'ailleurs dans le même décor, et avec les mêmes
          personnages que dans la première scène, dont elle est, en fait, la
          suite. Dans cette version « originale », Le mot « FIN » ne
          s'inscrit pas sur l'écran, et on passe directement à la scène
          suivante.
                         
          ILOT BOISÉ - EXTÉRIEUR JOUR
                         
          Le petit garçon, qui ressemble à Michel, referme le livre, pendant
          que la petite fille, qui ressemble à Paulette, pleure à chaudes
          larmes. Les deux enfants sont toujours assis sur le même tronc
          d'arbre que pendant la première scène du film. Michel essaie de
          rouvrir le livre, mais Paulette l'en empêche.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Faut pas pleurer comme ça, c'est une histoire, c'est pas
           vrai.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Mais les histoires aussi c'est vrai !
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Mais c'est pas fini, attends que je te lise la fin...
                         
          Michel rouvre le livre à la dernière page, qu'il cache pour que
          Paulette ne voit pas qu'il s'agit, en fait, d'une page blanche. Il
          improvise donc le texte qu'il fait semblant de lire, tout en
          suivant une ligne imaginaire avec son doigt.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Paulette a retrouvé Michel, ils se sont sauvés tous les

          Il ferme prestement le livre et constate, avec satisfaction, que
          Paulette ne pleure plus. Elle s'essuie les yeux.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Et si on leur disait de venir avec nous... ici, dans notre
           île.
                         
          Michel balaie du regard le paysage qui l'entoure.
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oui... Elle est assez grande pour quatre : elle a mille
           kilomètres.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Et puis on les aimera, tu veux bien ?
                         
                          MICHEL DOLLÉ
           Oui, je veux bien. Je vais leur écrire.
                         
                          PAULETTE
           Dis leur le chemin pour venir. Ils n'ont qu'à suivre la
           mère canard et les canetons. Dis-leur qu'ici, personne
           pourra leur faire de mal... Dis-leur qu'on les attend...
           Dis-leur qu'ils viennent...
                         
          Michel sourit à Paulette, se penche sur elle, l'embrasse sur la
          joue et lui caresse les cheveux. Puis il se lève. Paulette ramasse
          son panier, et se lève à son tour, aidée par Michel, qui la tient
          par la main.
          La caméra s'éloigne des enfants, découvrant la rivière, sur
          laquelle nage une famille de canards. Paulette prend du pain dans
          son panier et le jette aux canards. Puis elle se tourne vers
          Michel.
                         
          Les deux enfants marchent sur le tronc d'arbre, se dirigeant vers
          la rive, Michel tenant Paulette par la main, et la guidant pour
          lui éviter de tomber. Une fois arrivés sur la rive, ils
          s'éloignent en courant.
                         
          Le mot « FIN » s'inscrit sur la rivière et le tronc d'arbre
          couché.

THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS


                                Written by

                     Michael Mann & Christopher Crowe






	FADE IN

	The screen is a microcosm of leaf, crystal drops of precipitation, a stone, 
	emerald green moss. It's a landscape in miniature. We HEAR the forest. Some 
	distant birds. Their sound seems to reverberate as if in a cavern. A piece of 
	sunlight refracts within the drops of water, paints a patch of moss yellow. The 
	whisper of wind is joined by another sound that mixes with it. A distant 
	rustling. It gets closer and louder. It's shallow breathing. It gets ominous. 
	We're interlopers on the floor of the forest and something is coming. 

	SUDDENLY: A MOCCASINED FOOT
	
	rockets through the frame scaring us and ... 

	EXTREMELY CLOSE: PART OF AN INDIAN FACE
	running hard. His head shaved bald except for a scalp-lock. Tattoos. He's 
	twenty-five. He seems tall and muscled. Heavy, even breathing. We'll learn later 
	this man is UNCAS, the last of the Mohicans. 

	PROFILE: UNCAS' ARMS

	flash as he runs. One carries a flintlock musket. Sweat on the man's skin. A 
	calico shirt is gathered at the waist with a wampum belt of small white beads 
	over a breechcloth. He wears leggings to protect his legs. A long-handled 
	tomahawk is stuffed in his belt. 

	CUT TO ... 

	ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - MASSIVE WAR CLUB - DAY

	in the hand of another running man. He's heavier, older ... 
	
	CHEST

	A green bear claw is tattooed there. Silver armband. A snake is tattooed over 
	his left eyebrow. Silver rings in his ear. He's forty to forty-five. His head is 
	shaved into a scalp-lock. It says: "Come and lift this from me. Take it, if you 
	can ..." That prospect strikes us as extremely unlikely. This man is 

	CHINGACHGOOK.

	The French call him "Le Gros Serpent," the Great Snake, because 
	"he knows the winding ways of men's nature and he can strike a sudden, deathly 
	blow." 

	WIDE ANGLE: CHINGACHGOOK

	runs, disturbing no leaves, no branches; making no sound. He's running parallel 
	to Uncas through the cathedral of mature forest. It's heavily canopied. There's 
	very little brush. The girth of the trees is huge. Shafts of light illuminate 
	motes of dust and turn leaves emerald where the sun breaks through. Sometimes 
	there's ferns; rhododendron, sometimes pale grass and outcroppings of rock. 
	These men run the forest streams, over boulders, fallen trees and down into 
	ravines as if they own them. They do. 

	CUT TO ... 

	ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - LONG BLACK HAIR - DAY

	rocketing through trees. His torn buckskin shirt is tied at the waist with a 
	wampum belt holding a tomahawk and a large knife. A long rifle in which is 
	carved the name "Killdeer" is in his right fist. Indian tattooing on his chest. 
	His name is NATHANIEL POE. He's a few years older than Uncas. The French and 	the French-speaking tribes know him as La Longue Carabine (Long Rifle). Other 
	frontiersmen in New York colony and the Iroquois and Delaware-speaking tribes 
	know him as Hawkeye. Sweat stains his shirt. He flashes through the tree 
	branches disturbing nothing. Making no sound. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: A PIECE OF TAN

	two hundred and fifty yards away, a few square inches buried in the foliage ... 

	SUDDENLY HE STOPS

	Killdeer's at his shoulder ... 

	HAWKEYE'S THUMB

	cocks the lock holding the piece of flint: click. 

	UNCAS

	stops dead, holding out his hand ... no sound. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	slips through young trees and stops, shouldering his smoothbore musket. Is this 
	an ambush? 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: RACK FOCUS THROUGH THE GUN SIGHT

	Five feet and fourteen pounds of rifle is elevated a half inch and shifted left, 
	off target. It's a precise, smooth movement. No human quiver. 

	KILLDEER'S TRIGGER

	tighter ... 

	THE COCK

	holding the flint hits the iron file of the frizzen, shooting sparks into the 
	pan of priming powder which flashes and ... 

	TAN
	is a huge elk that leaps at the sound. 

	KILLDEER'S MUZZLE

	CRACKS like lightning. 

	AN ELK

	leaps where the .59 caliber round was programmed to intercept him. On the moment 
	of impact ... 

	WIDE

	three men approach the fallen elk and each other. We realize they're hunting 
	together. Hawkeye steps aside for Chingachgook. His massive war club is flat and 
	angles to one side with a stabbing blade. Hawkeye is stepson and stepbrother. 
	The two younger men treat Chingachgook with an easy deference and affection. 
	Hawkeye's a dialectic of two cultures. In his coloration and worldliness he's 
	more the Anglo-Saxon frontiersman. In his independent views and candid manner 
	and in his combat skills and woodsmanship, he's more native American (Mohican). 
	As Chingachgook takes out his long knife and they approach the fallen elk ...]

			We're sorry to kill you, Brother. 
			Forgive us. I do honor to your courage and

	roasts potatoes on a stick in the stone fireplace next to CAPTAIN JACK WINTHROP, 
	an American in very worn quasi-military gear. On a rough table in the tiny cabin 
	ALEXANDRIA, his wife, is kneading bread. Three children climb on their father. 
	He grabs their wild seven year old son, JAMES, who shrieks laughter and dodges 
	away. The cabin has two primitive rooms, waxed paper windows, log walls. O.S. a 
	dog barks. Others pick it up. Cameron & Jack are suddenly alert, reaching for

					CAMERON
			Alexandria! Set three more places.
				(to the fence)
			How is Chingachgook, then? 

	Behind him, emerging from the dark trees are Hawkeye, Uncas, cradling flint 
	locks, blankets and packs over their shoulders, leading a mule laden with skins 
	and the elk carcass. Crossing the splitrail fence ... 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			The Master of Life is good. Another year pass ... 
			How is it with you, John? 

					CAMERON
			Gettin' along. Yes, it is.

			Nathaniel. 

					HAWKEYE
			Hello John. Cleared another quarter, I see. 

					CAMERON
				(shakes hands with Uncas)
			Yes, I did. 

	JAMES CAMERON

	tears past his father & runs full bore. Just before he's going to collide into 
	Uncas, he leaps into the air and Uncas snatches him with one hand and swings him 
	up onto his shoulders. The kid screams with delight and rides back towards the 
	cabin that way. Alexandria comes to the door.

			If Uncas is with you, that means he has not 
			found a woman and started a family yet. 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Your eyes are too sharp, Alexandria Cameron. 
			They see into my heart. 

					UNCAS
			Your farm good to you this year, John? 

					CAMERON
			It was a good year for corn. 

					UNCAS
			Mohawk field we saw was 5 mile long on 
			the river. Chief Joseph Brandt's field. 

					CAMERON
			You take much fur? 

					HAWKEYE
			That we did. John. But the horicane 
				(sic)
			is near trapped out. 

					JACK
			Tradin' your skins in Castleton? 

					UNCAS
			No, Schylerville. With the Dutch for silver.
			French & English want to buy with wampum 
			& brandy. 

	Pause, then ... 

					HAWKEYE
			So what is it, Jack? What brings you up here? 

					JACK
			A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's 
			heading south to war against the English. I'm 
			here to raise this county's militia to aid the 
			British defense. 

					HAWKEYE
			Folks here goin' to join in that fight? 

					JACK
			We'll see in the morning ... 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Fathers of England & France, both, take more 
			land, furs, than they need. They're cold & full 
			of greed ... 

					JACK
			Few'd deny that? Where you headin'? 

					HAWKEYE
			Trap over the fall and winter among the 
			Delawares in Can-tuck-ee. 

					UNCAS
			So I can find a woman and make Mohican 
			children so our father will leave my brother 
			& me in peace. 

	Alexandria laughs. So do Hawkeye & Chingachgook. 

					JAMES
			A son like me? 

	Uncas grabs James & suspends him upside down.

					UNCAS
			No. You are too strong. Turn me old 
			too fast! 

	Hawkeye grabs the kid from Uncas. The kid's laughing & can't stay still. 
	Chingachgook watches, content, smoking his clay pipe.

					ALEXANDRIA
			That's what he's doin' to his mama ... 

	She ruffles his hair and lifts the heavy iron pot off the tibbet. Uncas goes to 
	help her, she shrugs his hand away and carries it to the table herself. The men 
	gather around. There's pan-baked bread, a dish of salt, and the pot has venison 
	and yellow cornmeal in a kind of stew. Everyone waits.

			Dear Father, thank you for rewardin' the fruits
			of our labor with plenty. Amen.

	slam into other kids as they battle through a Lacrosse game. In the background are
	sixty men, women and children. It's a community gathering held out of doors. 
	We've entered mid-scene. Captain Jack is standing on a box. Some women and kids
	mill around some tables and boards laid over barrels. Cooking fires. Smoke. 
	Most but not all around Captain Jack are men, nine settlers, 3 hunter/trappers, 
	eight Mohawk farmers in mixed European and native clothing. Off to the side are 
	an English Lieutenant on horseback and a ten-man escort from whatever regiment's in
	Albany. A man named HENRI speaks in French. His son, MARTIN, translates. 

					HENRI
				(O.S. in French)

					MARTIN
				(translates) 
			My father says he was driven out of France by 
			the black robe priests and he would fight them 
			now but he lost his arm and so I will go in his 
			place. 

	Meanwhile ... 

	ONGEWASGONE

	is an unusually large Mohawk in a blue match coat with a little girl holding his hand. He
	says something to Chingachgook who nods. Hawkeye and Uncas are a little apart in an
	outer grouping of the men. Ongewasgone is a war chief and wears a white plume and is
	tattooed. As Martin finishes, he steps forward. 

					ONGEWASGONE
			John Cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... 
			Twin River Mohawk got no quarrel with Les 
			Francais. Trade furs with Les Francais. Now Les 
			Francais bring Huron onto Mohawk hunting grounds ... 

	These people are English, Scots-Irish and Dutch farmers; some French Huguenot
	"mechanics" (craftsmen). They're in shirt-sleeves and Indian moccasins & leggings. The
	Mohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. They 've been
	acculturated for over a hundred years. Some wear European calico hunting shirts.
	Their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. They've politically and
	commercially played France & England against each other very adroitly for over a
	hundred years because of their military power and geographic position. Their relations
	with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of 
	co-existence because there's always been more than enough for all. This is a WPA
	 mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier America. The Europeans are former
	indentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier
	hunters and trappers ... working people.

					ONGEWASGONE
				(continues) 
			Now Mohawk will fight Huron and Les Francais. 
			My brothers have asked me to lead them in this 
			war so I speak for the Twin River Council. 

	The importance of this commitment is apparent to the lieutenant. 

					LIEUTENANT
			His Majesty King George II is very grateful for 
			your support. 

					IAN
			How far up the valley? 

					LIEUTENANT
			To Fort William Henry. 

					COLONIAL #1
			... two days from here. 

	Some don't like this.

					LIEUTENANT
			It should be enough to remind you France is 
			the enemy. 

					HAWKEYE
			Your enemy ... 

	Heads turn to Hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd.

					LIEUTENANT
			What did you say? 

					HAWKEYE
				(loud)
			I said ... France is your enemy. Not ours. 

					LIEUTENANT
			Really? Do you want them to overrun all 
			New York colony? 

					HAWKEYE
			First place, you started it with the French over 
			fur-trapping claims to the head waters of the Ohio. 
				(smiles) 
			Now you're sayin' these people have a fight on 
			their hands ... 

					LIEUTENANT
				(ignoring Hawkeye)
			Will you men help us stop the French? 

					HAWKEYE
			... and while they are cooped up in your fort, 
			what if the French send war parties to raid 
			their homes? 

					IAN
			What then, Lieutenant? 

					LIEUTENANT
			For your own homes, for king, for country, that's 
			why you men ought to join this fight! 

					HAWKEYE
			You do what you want with your own scalp.
			Do not be tellin' us what to do
			with ours. 

					LIEUTENANT
				(furious; to Hawkeye)
			You, sir! You call yourself a loyal subject? 

					HAWKEYE
			... No ... Do not call myself much of a subject 
			at all. 

	Light laughter.

					COLONIAL #2
			Nathaniel's right. But if I got to fight, figure I'll 
			try and do it fifty miles north of here instead of 
			my bean field. 

					AD LIBS
			Yes. Yeah. No ... 

					CAMERON
			I am stayin' on my farm. And any man who goes,
			his family is welcome to fort-up with us 'til he 
			comes back. 

					JACK
			Boys. My sense of it is enough of us will join-up to 
			fill the county's levy. But only if General Webb 
			accepts a few terms I got in mind ... 

	HAWKEYE & UNCAS

	cross through the people. A few men drift off to their women at the tables. 
	It is apparent two-thirds of the men will join. A couple of jokes, light banter,
	no hostility. 

					AD LIBS 
				(O.S.) 
			Webb? what's that, Jack ...? 

	As they cross through they start removing their shirts and weapons.

					IAN
			You boys marchin' with us? What do you say? 

					UNCAS
			We had our say, Ian. 

	They approach the Lacrosse field. Chingachgook stands with Cameron in the
	background, watching.

	braid, blue-black facing and blue-black breeches, cavalry boots, spurs, a tricorn, white
	wig (?) and a gorget (large medallion) around his neck. He's 28-30 and tough. He is
	self-sure, principled reactionary. He believes human society is static & layered into
	hierarchies of class and they are absolutely impermeable. He opens a simple gold-
	clasped case & contemplates its contents ... 

	HEYWARD'S POV: CASE

	an enameled portrait of a dark-haired young woman. 

	HEYWARD

	as a soldier is militarily first-rate in his milieu: the open battlefields of Europe. 
	Right now, however, he is about to enter the forests of North America. He closes 
	his clasp and glances out the window as we enter Albany and as a facade of 
	buildings & people pass.

	Four Grenadiers come to attention as Heyward enters mid-scene.

					JACK
				(O.S.)
			... if they are not allowed leave to defend their 
			families if the French or Hurons attack the 
			settlements, no colonial militia is goin' to Fort 
			William Henry.

					HEYWARD
				(low)
			You, there. Help my man outside with the baggage. 

	GENERAL JEROME WEBB sees Heyward and nods. Three of Webb's Adjutants are
	on either side. Three remaining Grenadiers in bearskin-covered mitred caps are at the
	door. Facing Webb are a half dozen colonial representatives, including Captain Jack
	Winthrop. Heyward watches Jack ... 

					LIEUTENANT
			They will report or be pressed into service! 

					LARGE COLONIAL REP
			Any of the boys worth havin' can disappear into 
			forest ... time it takes you to blink. Where's that 
			leave ya, then? 

	Heyward, preparing to hand over dispatches, is interrupted by the insubordinate tone.
	Equally wound tightly is the Lieutenant.

					LIEUTENANT
			They will be found! Arrested ... 

					WEBB
				(cuts in)
			I cannot imagine his Majesty, in his benevolence, 
			would ever object to his American subjects 
			defending their hearth & home, their women & children, 
			if threatened by the "scourge" of attack from savages, 
			aroused to such excess by our enemy, the 
			ever-perfidious French. 

					JACK
			Does that mean they will be granted leave to 
			defend their homes if the settlements are 
			attacked? 

					WEBB
			Of course. 

	Heyward's more amazed by what he's just heard from Webb. These Americans,
	including Jack, are streaming past him on their way out.

					JACK
			You got yourself a colonial militia, General. 

					HEYWARD
			Major Duncan Heyward reporting, Sir! 

	Webb's pouring gin.

					WEBB
			Duncan. How was your journey? 

	The door closes. Dispatches are passed. They are now alone except for the General's
	two Adjutants and a shadowy form waiting patiently in a corner. He's MAGUA. In the
	dim light, he's motionless. Webb slides a glass across to Heyward.

					HEYWARD
			I didn't experience anything so surprising from 
			Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today. 

					WEBB
			And what is that? 

					HEYWARD
			The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service? 

					WEBB
			I know.
				(assuming a co-commiserator)
			One has to give Americans "reasons" and make 
			agreements to get them to do anything at all. 
			Tiring, isn't it? 
				(throws up his hands)
			But that's the way of it here. 

					HEYWARD
				(tight)
			I thought British policy is 'Make the 
			World ... England', sir. 

	A chill. Majors don't upbraid Generals.

					WEBB
			You will take command of the 62nd Regiment 
			of Foot. At Fort William Henry under Colonel 
			Munro. I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward. 

					HEYWARD
			Sir! ... Might I enquire if General Webb has heard 
			from Colonel Munro's daughters? I was to 
			rendezvous with them in Albany and escort them 
			to the fort. 

					WEBB
			Yes. You may.
				(to Magua, after a glance at Heyward)
			You there. What does Munro call you?
				(to Heyward) 
			The "Scotsman" has sent one of his Indian allies 
			to guide you. 

	MAGUA

	rises and slowly walks into the light. He is reserved and over six feet tall. His head is
	shaved into a mohawk. Rings, beads & feathers pierce his ears. A blanket is worn as a
	shawl over his left shoulder exposing his right arm and heavy tattooing. A long
	tomahawk is in the belt of his breechcloth.

					WEBB
			The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's 
			house. A company of the 33rd will accompany 
			you and Magua will show you the way. 

					HEYWARD
			By your leave, sir. 

	Webb holds Heyward a moment

					WEBB
				(to Adjutants)
			Explain to the Major we care little about toying 
			with colonial militia because we have little to 
			fear from the French. They have not the nature 
			for war. Their Latinate voluptuousness combines with 
			their Gallic laziness and the result is: they would
			rather make love with their faces than fight. 

	Webb's Adjutants laugh uproariously at his wit. Heyward's stiff, perfunctory smile. He's
	been made the butt of the joke. He does not share Webb's derisive view of the French.
	Webb doesn't like Heyward's manner. We don't like Webb. Then:

					WEBB
				(continuing) 
			Dismissed. 

	Heyward stiffly salutes. Webb casually, perfunctorily salutes the younger man in
	return.

					HEYWARD
				(to Magua)
			Dawn. At the encampment. Six a.m. sharp. See 
			to it you're there.

	Beneath Magua's barely deferential manner we sense intelligence & menace. None of 	these Brits see it. We do.

	courtyard. Suddenly he hears ... 

					CORA

			Heyward! Duncan Heyward. 

	Heyward looks to the side. An inner light turns on. In this mode, this is a man we could
	like.

	enters from the garden. She's vivacious, dark-haired, unconventional in that she's
	educated, but with conventional values and attitudes. She hugs Duncan to her and 
	then pushes him away to look at him.

					HEYWARD
			My God it's good to see you. 

	He takes her hand in both of his and kisses it. He is open and lit up. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR POLTROON'S HOUSE, BACK YARD - CORA & HEYWARD - DAY

	A vegetable plot behind the Poltroon's house is a provincial substitute for a formal
	garden setting. Heyward and Cora sit on rough wooden chairs. Wind blows. In the
	background a servant hangs laundry. The white sheets billow. A table holds a tea
	setting. They're sitting close to each other, talking seriously and quietly. Duncan's
	jacket is removed. Time's passed. Long pause. Then:

					CORA
			I'm embarrassed to be so indecisive ... after so 
			long apart and after you've traveled so far ... 

					HEYWARD
			And by sea! 

					CORA
			You still have an aversion to the water? 

					HEYWARD
			Aversion? No. ... "Hatred" ... "Loathing" ... 

	Cora laughs.

					HEYWARD
			But it was worth it all to end in a garden by 
			your side.

	She looks askance at him. Then the banter drops.

					CORA
				(difficult)
			Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest 
			friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect 
			you immensely ... I wish they did, but my feelings 
			don't go beyond that. Do you see? 

					HEYWARD
			Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis 
			for a man and woman to be joined? And all 
			else may grow in time ...? 

					CORA
			Some say that's the way of it. 

					HEYWARD
			"Some"? 

					CORA
			Cousin Eugenie, my father, but ... 

					HEYWARD
				(interrupts)
			Cora, in my heart, I know once we're joined, 
			we'll be the happiest couple in England. Let 
			those whom you trust, your father, help 
			settle what's best for you. In view of your 
			indecision, why not rely on their advice and 
			judgment as well as mine? 

	Cora stares directly at Heyward. Then she looks away. She has no answer. Something
	subterranean disturbs her about delegating judgment over the fate of her life.


					HEYWARD
			Will you consider that? 

					CORA
				(pause; smiles)
			Yes. Yes, I will. 

	She's still unsettled.

					ALICE
				(O.S.)
			Duncan! 

	REVERSE: ALICE MUNRO

	eighteen years old, white-blonde hair, wide blue eyes. She's effervescent and runs 
	to hug him. Heyward is taken aback by her enthusiasm and laughs.

					HEYWARD
			My God, you've grown up. 

					ALICE
			We leave in the morning?! 

					HEYWARD
				(rises)
			Yes, miss. 

					ALICE
			I won't sleep tonight. What an adventure! 
			I absolutely cannot wait to return to Portman 
			Square, having laid eyes upon the full-blooded, 
			red men in the wild! 

					CORA
			My God, Alice. 

					HEYWARD
				(smiles)
			It can be dangerous ... 

					ALICE
			Nonsense. Papa wouldn't have sent for us 
			if it were dangerous. 

	Alice takes Hewyward's hand. Cora pours Heyward more tea. The white sheets billow. 

					AMBROSE
				(O.S. - barks)
			Atten-shun! 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR BRITISH ARMY HQ - TWENTY BRITISH REGULARS - DAY

	jolt upright as if electrified.

			Shoulder arms! 

	AMBROSE

	a sergeant major of forty-one is wide and deep and built like a fullback. You do not 	mess with Sgt. Major Ambrose.

					AMBROSE
				(barks) 
			Form two companies of nine ... MARCH!! 

	THE MEN

	march in perfect drill into two groups, each three across and three deep. 

	MILITARY HQ, ENTRANCE - MAJOR DUNCAN HEYWARD

	steps out. Rigid salutes. 

	HEYWARD

	climbs onto his white military charger. It's spirited. Cora & Alice are in riding dresses
	 and veils. The veil doesn't completely cover Alice's golden hair and blue eyes and the
	flush of her complexion. They're riding two sidesaddled Narragansetts. The tight
	 traveling dress reveals that Cora, two or three years older than Alice, is fuller and more
	mature. All three ride to the front of the column. The baggage horses and mule are in
	the gap between the two companies. 

	MAGUA

	cradling his musket. 

	REAR SHOT: THE COLUMN

	down the path that leads into the wall of forest looks impressive. 

	WIDER: THE COLUMN

	marching. Now they look brave but smaller. The forest - with all its mysteries and
	dangers - now impresses us as a towering dark, sinister, and it's immensity swallows up
	the living mass which slowly enters its bosom.

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FOREST

	TRACKING the Redcoats, their faces now filmed with dust, cut with lines of
	perspiration. They march in perfect formation. 

	We TRACK PAST the pack horses, the first company, Sgt. Major Ambrose and on to
	Cora & Alice. Alice seems fatigued. Cora's turned, looking up into the forest canopy,
	astonished at the deep beauty of the place. 

	CORA'S POV: FOREST CANOPY

	of trees is dark, except for spots where leaves are sparse, and there the light is golden.
	It's the forest of childhood. 

	In a ravine a buck disappears into a deeper stand of trees.

					CORA
				(O.S.)
			Alice, did you see that ...? 

	CORA'S

	reverie's broken by Heyward entering the frame. 

					CORA
			Alice? 

	Alice rouses from fatigue.

					HEYWARD
			Are you alright? 

					ALICE
			Can we rest soon? 

					HEYWARD
			Absolutely. 

	Heyward rides to the front of the column to Magua, who's twenty to thirty yards ahead
	of everybody else.

					HEYWARD
			You there, Scout! 

	Magua slowly turns towards Heyward.

					HEYWARD
				(overly articulated) 
			We must ... stop ... soon. Women are ... tired. 
			You ... understand? 

					MAGUA
				(perfect English)
			I understand. This is not good place to stop. 
			Two leagues from here. No water 'til then. 
			That where we stop. Better place. 

					HEYWARD
			No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the 
			ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you 
			understand? 

					MAGUA
				(in Huron: English subtitle)
			"Magua understand paleface is a dog to his women.
			When his women want to eat, he lay aside his 
			tomahawk to feed their laziness." 

					HEYWARD
			Excuse me. What did you say? 

					MAGUA
			Magua say: "Yes. Good idea." 

	As they begin to stop ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR MOUNTAINS & FOREST - WIDE - DAY

	Silently entering on either side of us come Chingachgook, followed by Hawkeye and
	Uncas. Even relaxed, they carry themselves with a degree of alertness. They're
	eighteenth century Viet Cong moving through the rain forest. The Maxfield
	Parrish/Hudson Valley of tall trees, ravines and streams is idyllic in front of them. All
	three cradle their long guns and move silently on moccasined feet. 

	FRONTAL: CHINGACHGOOK

	- in a stream - relaxed but attentive, abruptly stops. The others freeze in their tracks.
	Chingachgook sees and then stoops to examine ... 

	ROCK

	under the water in the stream. It's been turned from its bed. Chingachgook finds
	another. Uncas, moving up on his flank, climbs the bank and moves off into the trees,
	searches and then he gestures ... he's found another sign of something. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	has headed off further down the stream and discovers nothing. Rapidly he rejoins Uncas
	and Hawkeye who've become extremely alert. They move up the bank into the forest
	ninety degrees from their previous path. 

	TRACKING: HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

	moving. Fast. Nearly soundless. They hardly disturb a blade of grass. The impression:
	expertise, deadliness and an impression something's wrong. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST, TRAIL - MAGUA - DAY 

	on point. The trail cuts the side of a hill. The ground on one side rises into a forest
	acclivity and on the other falls off into a forested ravine. Magua walking towards
	camera. 

	CLOSER - MAGUA'S

	slid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist. He lets the shaft
	drop into his hand. He shrugs off his blanket. There is a solidity to his dark, tall figure
	we didn't see before. Magua turns about face and advances on the column. 
	TRACK WITH Magua.
	Heyward and the Munro girls pass the camera as does Sgt. Major Ambrose, marching
	in advance of the men. Magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row. 
	We see Magua has caught the Redcoat's eye.

	REDCOAT

	is curious, starts to smile. What does the Huron want to say to him? When Magua is
	two steps away he caves in the side of the infantryman's head at the temple with the
	spike end of his tomahawk and, backhanded, hacks the blade through the side of the
	neck of the center man in the first row. 

	SIMULTANEOUSLY

	thirteen muskets EXPLODE from the wooded rise. 

	FIVE REDCOATS

	are blown off the path, two others are wounded ... 

	AMBROSE

					AMBROSE
			Form company! Left face! March! 

	ALICE

	shrieks. Cora grabs Alice's reins and her own. 

	HEYWARD

	pulling his fusil (short musket), seeing, firing, reaching for the women ... 

	CORA'S HORSE

	bucking. 

	ALICE'S HORSE

	bolting, dodging sideways, spilling Alice to the earth. 

	AMBROSE

					AMBROSE
			Company make ready! 

	The regulars slam into a firing line, stepping over the bodies of their comrades. All
	thirteen face the incline. 

	FORESTED RISE - HURONS

	flash downhill through the trees. Partnered in two-man teams, one loads and prepares
	and fires while the other advances to the next cover. He, then, prepares and fires
	covering his partner's advance. Leaping fallen trees and boulders, they're athletic, fast
	and rapidly closing.
	Even though the disciplined English regulars are a killing machine, we now see their
	tactics in the dense forest are grossly inferior to the Hurons' ... 

					AMBROSE
			Present!! 

	CORA

	covers Alice with her body, holding the reins of their bolting horses. 

	HEYWARD

	from horseback aims his horse pistol, FIRES ... 

	AN ATTACKING HURON

	leaping at him past Alice & Cora drops. 

	MULE

	with baggage crashes off, down the ravine. Another two Redcoats drop. Nine left.
	Then eight. 

	AMBROSE

					AMBROSE
			Fire!! 

	A musket volley as eight muskets go off as one shot, sending a lead scythe through
	leaves. But ... 

	REVERSE:

	Hurons were behind cover. Only one was exposed and hit. 

					AMBROSE
				(continuing)
			Load! Prime! 

	The English rush to complete the reload. Will they do it in time? 

					AMBROSE
				(continuing)
			Present! Present! 

	Suddenly, Hurons - en masse - CRASH down onto the Redcoats line with tomahawks,
	war clubs and point-blank musket fire. 

	ALICE

	on the ground, screaming insanely, covered by Cora who's protecting her little sister,
	and ... 

	HEYWARD'S

	horse shot from beneath him, the animal folding, falling straight to the earth, and ... 

	MAGUA

	shoots Ambrose in the chest, and ... 

 	HEYWARD

	by the Munro daughters spins, swinging his fusil like a ball-bat, upending one Huron
	and lunges with his bayonet in his left towards another. But this Huron easily slips the
	thrust and slams Heyward with his rifle butt. 

	BRITISH

	dead and dying. 

	AMBROSE

	blood gushing from his chest wound, fires his pistol, dropping a Huron; slashes a
	second with his sword. Then he's chopped down. Hurons begin scalping the British
	while four race towards Heyward and the two women. 

	HEYWARD & CORA & ALICE

	ready to die. Heyward has only his fusil as a bludgeon. He readies ... 

	THREE LOUD SHOTS

	BLOW three of the Hurons sideways, head over heels down the rise. 

	REVERSE: THREE MEN

	barely seen, running diagonally across the fall line of the ravine. In parts, we recognize
	Nathaniel, recharging Killdeer on full run, and Uncas. 

	HURON'S

	not sure where the shots came from. Suddenly Chingachgook slams him, head first into
	the ravine with the war club. He didn't even slow down. 

	HURON

	warrior spins. Uncas tomahawks his shoulder. The Huron swings downwards. Uncas
	ducks beneath the swing and slashes his throat, sending him downhill into CAMERA 
	as ... 

	HAWKEYE'S

	momentum and thrown tomahawk spread-eagles one Huron, near a couple of wounded
	Redcoats who fight on ... 

	MAGUA

	calmly sees the odds have changed. His attention becomes focused. He commits a very
	revealing act seen through the blurred foreground action of struggling bodies. We will
	remember it. He raises his musket and aims at ... 

	CORA MUNRO

	who's unaware she's a target. Why is he singling out a Munro girl to kill? 

	HAWKEYE

	sees. Killdeer's at his shoulder ... 

	TIME SLOWS: MAGUA

	senses Hawkeye. Moving through liquid, his eyes drift left. The moment is frozen.
 	Their eyes lock, each to the other's. Then ... 

	TIME UNFREEZES

	Magua swings at Hawkeye and FIRES ... 

	HAWKEYE

	shifts. The .65 caliber musket ball rockets past his ear and he's already squeezing
	Killdeer's trigger as ... 

	HAWKEYE'S POV OVER BARREL: SMOKE

	from Magua's musket blast clears. Magua's gone. He almost shape-shifted, it happened
	so quickly. It's nearly mystical. 

	HAWKEYE

	lowers Killdeer, impressed. 

	CORA

	glances back at Hawkeye. She doesn't know why he's looking at her. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	pursues two fleeing Hurons up the incline. Two strides gain him the first man, who he
	hamstrings and runs over to pursue the second up the hill ... as ... 

	HEYWARD

	in the confused melee, grabs a found musket and aims it at an Indian. We recognize that
	he's aiming at Chingachgook pursuing the second Huron up the hill ... 

					CORA
			No, Duncan! 

	Duncan ignores her. 

	HEYWARD'S MUSKET

	is jerked from his hands.

					HAWKEYE
			 ... case your aim is any better'n your judgment. 

	He's drawn his sword, reflexively. Hawkeye flips the musket around one-handed. It's
	pointed at Heyward's chest. And Hawkeye FIRES, killing an attacking Huron behind
	Heyward. As Heyward spins ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK'S WAR CLUB

	flashes up the hill. It cleaves the second man's back and bowls him over. Chingachgook
	retrieves his club as his scalping knife slashes down ... 

	UNCAS

	scalps the man he killed. Chingachgook dispatches the Huron he hamstrung. 

	WIDE

	Sudden silence. Heyward's motionless. The women are frozen, as terrified of the
	savages and apparent half-breed rescuers as they were of those who attacked them. 

	ALICE

	Cora, holding her, is stunned but functioning. Moments ago both women were clean
	and demure. Now their riding dresses are torn, mud-stained, blood-spattered and their
	baggage is gone. 

	HEYWARD'S

	crossed to his slaughtered soldiers. Moments ago they were a testament to British
	military power. Now they're dead meat. Ambrose's body is against a tree. In the B.G. 	two of the wounded start to rise ... 

					ALICE
				(O.S.)
			Stop it! 

	Heyward spins. 

 	UNCAS

	just cut the throat of the second Narraganset. It drops into the brush. Alice attacks
	him.

					ALICE
			We need them to get out of here! 

	Uncas gently restrains her. Cora reaches Alice and grabs her away from the "savage".
	Heyward runs in to protect the women ...

					HEYWARD
				(to Nathaniel)
			... why the bloody hell he do that to the horses?! 

	Uncas, all business, is now reloading, lifting powder horns, scanning the trees.

					UNCAS
				(matter of fact) 
			... too easy to track ... they can be heard for 
			miles ... find yourself a musket ... 

	Cora's surprised by Uncas' easy English. Hawkeye's scanning the forest.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Heyward)
			Your wounded should try walkin' back to Albany. 
			They'll never make a passage north. 

					HEYWARD
				(breathless)
			We were headed ... 

					HAWKEYE
				(appropriating a knife)
			... Fort William Henry. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	to Hawkeye: let's go ... Then a fast exchange of Delaware. Cora's surprised to see it's
	Chingachgook's decision. Chingachgook looks at the survivors, gives his assent, starts
	off.

					HAWKEYE
			... take you as far as the fort. 

	Hawkeye throws Heyward a musket. Cora & Alice look towards Heyward. He looks at
	them: the women are totally terrified and do not move.

					HAWKEYE
			If we are goin' to take you, we need to move. 
			Fast ... And the fort is well off our course. 
			So if you all rather wait for the next Huron 
			war party to come by, we'll be on our way. 

	Heyward quickly decides to go. The women follow. Hawkeye starts off after Uncas and
	Chingachgook. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - HAWKEYE - DAY

	moves through the trackless forest. Uncas is far out on the left flank. Cora, Alice &
	Duncan Heyward follow in Hawkeye's and Chingachgook's steps ... 

	HAWKEYE'S FEET

	walking through a creek, stepping in the stream bed instead of on stones. The others
	follow. Hawkeye looks at Heyward. 

	HEYWARD

	conforms. He's ill at ease not being in command, following the lead of some half-Indian
	frontiersman through a foreign wilderness.] 

					HEYWARD
			How far is it, scout? 

					HAWKEYE
			Day and a half 
				(pause) 
			Where did you get ... the guide? 

					HEYWARD
			Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our 
			Mohawk allies. 

					HAWKEYE
			He is Huron and nothing else. 
				(checking the Munro girls are 
				not too close)
			Why would he want to murder the girl? 

					HEYWARD
			What?! 

					HAWKEYE
			Dark haired ... 

					HEYWARD
			Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on 
			her before today. 

					HAWKEYE
			No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult? 

					HEYWARD
			Of course not! 
				(pause) 
			And how is it you were nearby? 

					HAWKEYE
			Came across the war party, tracked 'em. 

					HEYWARD
			Then you're assigned to Fort William Henry? 

					HAWKEYE
			No. 

					HEYWARD
			Fort Edward, then? 

					HAWKEYE
			No. Headin' west. To Can-tuck-ee. 

					HEYWARD
			I thought all our colonial scouts were in 
			the militia? 

	Off to the side, Uncas smiles at the idea.

					HAWKEYE
			I ain't your "scout". And I am in no damn 
			militia. 

					HEYWARD
				(stops) 
			Then you are one of those who would allow 
			England to fight alone while she protects 
			you from France? 

					HAWKEYE
			England does not protect me and does not 
			war against France on our account. She uses 
			us to war against France on her own account ... 
			of greed for land and furs. 

	CORA'S

	appalled.

					HAWKEYE
				(turns) 
			Clear it up any? 

					HEYWARD
				(loud) 
			I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out! 

					HAWKEYE
				(low)
			Do not let gratitude get in the way ... 

	Cora's hand holds back Heyward's sword arm because suddenly Chingachgook looms
	over him.

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(to Hawkeye) 
			Yengeese no good in woods. Make more 
			noise, I kill him. 

	Heyward spins. Hawkeye coolly watches Cora. Her attitude is hostile; aligned with
	Heyward. He turns away. Meanwhile ... 

	UNCAS

	stops, alarmed. Something in the air bothers him. Hawkeye smells it, too. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	is already moving out front, low and fast ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - GREEN BRANCHES - DAY

	After we HOLD, we realize Chingachgook's been there all along. Hawkeye and Uncas
	join him where the branches meet the ground. Smoke drifts through the trees. 
	Hawkeye sees and dips his head, then looks again ... 

	EXTERIOR CAMERON CABIN - WIDE - DAY

	Burned, smoldering, having fallen in on itself. TRACK LEFT past what was the
	doorway. A dead child's hand protruding from the ruin. A fragment of a dress. Charred
	and smoldering wood. John Cameron's body in the wreckage. And then, through the
	collapsed posts and timbers, Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas have advanced and
	are seeing what we've just seen; and then Cora and Alice. 

	ALICE

	approaches and is frozen in horror. Cora shields her from the sight. Cora is affected but
	confronts it directly.

					HEYWARD
				(O.S.) 
			Anything to be done? 

	UNCAS

	returns from under one part of the wreckage, ashen, stoic, as they all are. We know the
	degree of their inner pain.

					UNCAS
			All dead ... 

	HAWKEYE

	bends over a moccasin print that Chingachgook's examining. They look at each other
	grimly. Heyward joins them.

					HEYWARD
			Who were these people? 

					HAWKEYE
				(re: print) 
			Ottawa! 

					HEYWARD
			Excuse me ... 

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(to Hawkeye) 
			Ottawa. 

	UNCAS

	enters, very careful where he places his feet ... Hawkeye gestures to Heyward to stay
	where he is: on the periphery with the women.

					UNCAS
			Mirrors ... tools ... clothes ... all inside. 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Chingachgook)
			Movin' fast, not able to carry much ... 
			this was a war party? 

	Chingachgook nods confirmation and indicates a direction in Mohican. The significance
	is very ominous to them. We don't know why yet. Chingachgook starts away ... 

					HEYWARD
			Let us look after them ... 

	He starts approaching the bodies.

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Leave them. 

	Heyward stops. Hawkeye and Uncas follow Chingachgook, leaving the cabin.

					CORA
				(hasn't moved)
			Though they are strangers, they are at 
			least entitled to a Christian burial! 

					HAWKEYE
				(shaking his head) 
			Let us go, miss. 

					CORA
			I will not. I have seen the face of war 
			before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on
			women and children. And almost as 
			cruel is your indifference. 

	Hawkeye turns back and rapidly approaches her. She takes a step back, fearful.

					HAWKEYE
				(contained)
			Miss Munro.
				(pause)
			They are not strangers .... 
			And they stay as they lay ...! 

	CORA

	realizes Hawkeye knew these people and is deeply affected. She also realizes for the
	first time this is a whole new world with dynamics and complexities, behavior and
	rhythms she doesn't understand. He turns away from her and walks on. She hesitates a
	moment. 

	WIDE ON THE SMALL CLEARING IN FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE

	as Chingachgook and Hawkeye, extremely alert and cradling their cocked flintlocks,
	walk to camera, eyes sweeping the forest perimeter; they're followed by Cora, Heyward
	helping Alice and Uncas as rearguard.

	The ruined cabin and the dead dream of a family smolders behind them. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR GLADE - PROFILE: HAWKEYE - NIGHT

	moves through to where the trees seem sparse and are unnaturally white birch and
	some thin grass grows. The land rises into a mound. Chingachgook and the others
	avoid stepping on the grass and cross to the other side of it. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	mutters something to Uncas. He nods and disappears amongst the white birch,
	soundlessly. 

	HAWKEYE

	throws Heyward a blanket. Heyward spreads the blanket below the top of the mound
	and - maintaining silence - he gestures for Cora & Alice to rest there. 

	ALICE'S HEAD

	hits the blanket. She curls into a fetal position and she's out. Heyward is nearby on
	watch.
	Hawkeye has taken a position two-thirds of the way around the crescent shaped
	mound.
	Cora has sought him out. 

	HAWKEYE

	doesn't react as Cora enters. He's scanning the trees; not looking at her. 
	They whisper ... 

					CORA
			Why didn't you bury those people? 

					HAWKEYE
			Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would 
			see it as a sign of our passing ... 

					CORA
			You knew them. 

	Hawkeye looks at her and nods.

					CORA
				(stiffly)
			You were acting for our benefit. And I 
			apologize. I misunderstood you. 

					HAWKEYE
			Well that is to be expected. My father ... 

					CORA
			Your "father"? 

					HAWKEYE
			Chingachgook. He warned me about 
			people like you. 

					CORA
			He did? 

					HAWKEYE
			Yes. He said ... "do not try to make them 
			understand you." 

					CORA
			What?! 

					HAWKEYE
			Yes. And "do not try to understand them. 
			That is because they are a breed apart and 
			they make no sense ..." 

	Cora's indignation is cut off because ... 

	UNCAS

	moving fast. He gestures back the way he came and it means they're in jeopardy. Uncas
	disappears around the mound. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR BIRCH FOREST - TREES - NIGHT

	Nothing. Imperceptibly we move closer and start to see shapes blocking out part of the
	white birch. 

	RED-PAINTED FACE

	white eyes. A ruff of red hair stands straight up at the back of the large man's head. 
	Slit and monstrously elongated earlobes are weighted with silver. He's followed by
	others. Wary, silently, they hunt. 

	DEEPER: MORE OTTAWA

	Towards the rear are two French Rangers ("Coureurs des Bois") from Le Regiment de
	la Sarre. They're bearded, dirty, dressed Indian-style in moccasins, leggings and
	breechcloths with hooded hunting shirts. There's nothing clumsy about them. They're
	the 18th century version of Special Forces who've gone indigenous. If they and the
	Ottawa find our people, it's all over. 

	ALICE

	seeing the red-painted Ottawa approach, starts to panic. Her hyperventilating and
	involuntary small sounds of fear will reveal their position. A hand covers her mouth and
	silences her struggling. WIDEN. It's Uncas. His other arm is around her, holding her,
	looking towards the advancing Ottawa. 

	HAWKEYE

	on his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground. 

	OTTAWA & FRENCH

	are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people. Mist
	envelops them ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	His massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand. 

	HAWKEYE

	waiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there. Nathaniel's
	impressed with her cool. He hands her a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop
	of moccasined feet ... 

	OTTAWA

	through the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. Then their leader
	gestures and they start backing out. The French Rangers continue towards the crescent.
	The Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers
	something inaudible. The Ottawa chief shakes his head, "Non. Pas possible ..." 
	And means it. They retreat. 

	SEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA

	tensely monitor the Ottawa retreat. 

	UNCAS & ALICE

	He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, then she looks up,
	catches his eyes. Then she averts her face. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	sees all of it; doesn't like it. 

	HAWKEYE

	The Ottawa are gone.

					CORA
				(quietly)
			Why did they turn back? 

	In answer Hawkeye looks behind & above her head.

	CORA

	turns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted
	against the night sky in the distance. They have camped on sanctified ground, a burial
	place. 

	CORA & HAWKEYE

	She thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the
	danger & complexity of this place. She hands the pistol back to him. Their hands almost
	touch.

					CORA
				(still pissed off)
			"We're a breed apart and we make no 
			sense" ...? 

					HAWKEYE
				(smiles) 
			In your particular case, miss, I would 
			make some allowance ... 

					CORA
				(sarcastic)
			Thank you so much. 

	Cora is angry. Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her. She settles, looking at him.
	Her mood changes. Then ... 

					CORA
			You called Chingachgook your "father"?
			Where is your real family? 

	Hawkeye's surprised by her question.

					HAWKEYE
			They buried my ma & pa and my sisters.
			And Chingachgook - who found me with 
			two French trappers - raised me up as his 
			own. 

					CORA
			I'm sorry. 

					HAWKEYE
			I do not remember them. I was one or two. 

					CORA
			How did you learn English? 

					HAWKEYE
			My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend 
			Wheelock's school when I was ten. So
			we would know both worlds ... though 
			we were told only bother learning readin' &
			arithmetic from yous. 

					CORA
			And what were the consequentialities of 
			European culture you didn't bother with? 

					HAWKEYE
			The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas 
			about the government of men. My father's 
			people already know each man is his own 
			nation. And only he can have dominion 
			over himself. Not kings. No man is better 
			than any other man. 

					CORA
			In London those radical ideas could land 
			you in Newgate prison. 
				(changing the subject)
			Why were those people living in this 
			defenseless place ...? 

					HAWKEYE
			'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable
			to poor people. So after seven years 
			indentured service in Virginia, they headed
			out here where they are beholden to none
			and not livin' by another's leave ... 
			Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria.

	Cora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of stars. She looks at 	Hawkeye; then again up at the night sky. 

					HAWKEYE
				(continuing; looking up)
			My father's people say ... at the birth of the 
			sun and of his brother, the moon, their 
			mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth 
			her body, from which was to spring all life.
			And he drew forth from her breast the stars.
			The stars he threw into the night sky to 
			remind him of her soul. 
				(the sky)
			So there is the Camerons' monument ... 
			my folks', too, I guess. 

	CORA'S

	pensive. Hawkeye's watching her. Her reaction is enigmatic. After a pause ... 

					CORA
				(low)
			You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not 
			understand what is happening here.
			And it is not as I imagined it would be, 
			thinking of it in Boston and London ... 

					HAWKEYE
			Sorry to disappoint you ... 

					CORA
				(eyes downcast)
			On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ... 
			to my blood ...
				(then up into his eyes)
			... than any imagining could possibly have 
			been ... 

	She closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep. Hawkeye is the one left staring
	into the birch forest, a little surprised. Some of his assumptions about her were 
	wrong ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - WIDE - LATE AFTERNOON

	Deep fog has set in. A hand entering the frame scares the hell out of us. It moves a
	branch aside. It's Uncas. Spread to the right is Chingachgook, far to the left is
	Hawkeye. They hike up a steep forested slope in the heart of the Adirondacks.

					CORA
			Much further? 

					HAWKEYE
			Top of this ridge. Fort and Lake George are 
			downhill of it. 

	ALICE

	Re-energized, her spirits pick up.

					ALICE
			Will we be able to bathe? 

	Before Cora can answer they hear a deep, rolling roar. Alice is alarmed.

					CORA
			Thunder ... Papa will arrange something. 

	UNCAS

	looks over his shoulder, sees something in the far distance, gestures to Hawkeye and
	Chingachgook. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: DISTANT HILLS

	and the band of red-painted Ottawa and Coureurs des Bois, who have now split into
	two groups, are still on their trail. Meanwhile, oblivious ...

					HEYWARD
			The men of the regiment will fetch water from 
			the lake, build fires and provide every comfort 
			you desire, Alice ... 

					ALICE
			Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora 
			doesn't marry you, I shall. 

					CORA
			Alice! 

	Heyward laughs. Hawkeye sees them. It bothers us: will these Europeans, including
	Cora, shed their frontier experience?

					ALICE
			I can't wait to see Papa ... 

					CORA
			And you, Duncan? What are you looking 
			forward to? 

					HEYWARD
			Posting to a different continent. 

	He and Alice laugh. Cora does not.

					CORA
			I think it's very important and exciting. 

	Heyward looks at her. She's not kidding. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: HEYWARD

	helps Alice. As he does, he stares at Cora's seperation and now her proximity to
	Hawkeye, who's walking on ahead, is something Heyward doesn't like. His dark
	thoughts are distracted by a FLASH of light and more ROLLING THUNDER. 

	WIDE FROM THE FRONT - HAWKEYE

	drops and pulls Cora to the ground.

					CORA
			Lightning? 

	Hawkeye doesn't answer as he, Chingachgook, Uncas and Heyward make their way to
	the top of the ridge. 

	CLOSER ANGLES: CORA & ALICE

	join them and look down upon their expectation of a secure piece of England in the
	wilderness, a safe harbor, a father's warm welcome. 

	THEIR POV: FORT WILLIAM HENRY

	is none of those things. The thunder is the roar of French siege cannon clouded in dense
	smoke. The flashes of light are mortar bombs exploding and illumination rockets' red
	glare. Fort William Henry is under a massive siege by a French and Huron army. 

	UNCAS

	looks over his shoulder. 

	HIS POV: OTTAWA

	pursuing them. There's no way back. They're propelled forward. 

	DISSOLVE TO ...

	EXTERIOR BATTLEFIELD, FRENCH BATTERY #1 - CLOSE SHOTS - DUSK

	French cannons roar black smoke and gouts of red flame. 

	TRENCH

	dug by sappeurs behind the cover of a huge gambio pushed toward the fort by two
	poles and fascis on the sides. 

	ENGLISH GUN CREW

	searching the night. 

	POV: BATTLEFIELD

	is black. 

	ENGLISH ROCKETS

	light the battlefield revealing the French trenches. 

	ENGLISH GUN CREW

	excited. Colonial militia and Mohawk snipers fire their rifles. The British gun crew
	scrambles to adjust their 18 pounders. 

	FRENCH BATTERY #1 

	FIRES. 

	FRENCH BATTERY #2

	FIRES. 

	EXTERIOR FORT, WEST BATTERY

	TRACKING. French cannon FIRE rips into the fortifications, exploding wood and
	earth, shredding the English gun crew with cannister. The English fight stubbornly, but
	we feel they're outgunned. Meanwhile ... 

	WIDE ANGLE FROM THE WATER

	A new artillery duel erupts. The action is to the west side of the fort. On the north, the
	fire fight is reflected on the black water of Lake George in our foreground. Then a dark
	shape wiping to the right cuts off those reflections. We see in silhouette the outline of a
	birch canoe moving silently, barely rippling the mirrored surface of the lake. 

	EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE BANK - DEBRIS

	Behind it, two Canadiens and a Huron alternately snipe at the ramparts. 

	LOW & WIDE: SNIPERS

	Behind them is black water. Its surface is broken by the rising mass of Chingachgook,
	followed by Uncas and Hawkeye. Muzzle flashes from the cannon reveal the canoe and
	the forms of the girls further out. Chingachgook's war club is held low. The Huron
	senses and turns and Hawkeye's thrown tomahawk knocks him back. Hawkeye's knife
	flashes in the night. Chingachgook drives the war club up, smashing a Canadien onto
	the debris. The second Canadien jabs bayonet at Uncas, slashing his side. Uncas jerks
	him forward by the musket, folds him over and tomahawks him. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, NORTH WALL - SALLY-PORT TUNNEL
	- NIGHT

	Amidst the cannonade roar, ad-libbed shouts from Hawkeye and Heyward convince
	battle begrimed soldiers to open the sally-port. Our people rush in. 

	TORCH LIGHT

	the group moves through the long, dank, tunnel. Enlisted men escorting them. Another
	torch from the other direction: CAPTAIN BEAMS is revealed.

					HEYWARD
			I'm Major Duncan Heyward! 

					BEAMS
			Captain Jeffrey Beams. We didn't think 
			you'd make it through! 

					HEYWARD
			Where's Colonel Munro? His daughters are 
			here, too. 

	Beams raises his torch, sees the muddied, soaked women. He is shocked that they
	traveled with Heyward. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY, PARADE GROUND - GROUP - NIGHT

	emerges from a sally-port tunnel. It's smokey. NOISE is deafening. The group has
	traveled through a nightmare, only to arrive in hell. 

	HEYWARD WITH BEAMS, CORA & HAWKEYE, ALICE, UNCAS &
	CHINGACHGOOK

	run diagonally past pyramidal stacks of cannon ball, smoldering beams and shrapnel,
	wounded men. Just then a mortar is fired and explodes, killing the gun crew. On the
	ramparts Mohawks and Colonial Militia, sniping at the French. Women huddle in 
	corners next to the sick and dying. 

	UNDER RAMPARTS: MILITIA

					AD LIBS
				(shouts over roar)
			Uncas! Nathaniel ... 

	HAWKEYE

	waves. One wounded man, IAN, intercepts Uncas.

					IAN
			Thought you and Nathaniel weren't 
			joinin'-up. 

					UNCAS
				(on the run) 
			Didn't! 

					HAWKEYE
			Dropped in to see how you boys is doin'. 

	COLONEL MUNRO

	running from his quarters is shocked to see them.

					ALICE
				(hysterical) 
			Papa, Papa!! 

					MUNRO
				(enraged) 
			Why are you here?! 

	Cora is stunned. Alice is decimated by her father's anger. Munro sees and whips off his
	coat to cover them and takes Alice under his arm. Bombardment resumes. Alice clings
	while they race for the cover of his quarters:] 

					MUNRO
				(to Heyward; re: Alice & Cora) 
			Why did you allow them to come? ... And
			where the bloody hell are my reinforcements!! 

	They race into the yellow lantern light of Munro's quarters and slam and bolt the heavy
	door. Heyward's confused ... 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR MUNRO'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

					MUNRO
				(embracing his daughters; softer) 
			Told you to stay away from this hell hole!
			Why did you disobey me? 

					CORA
			When? How? 

					MUNRO
			My letter ... 

					CORA
			There was none! 

					MUNRO
			What? 

					CORA
			There was no letter. 

					MUNRO
			I sent three men to Webb! 

					HEYWARD
			One called Magua arrived. 

					CORA
			He delivered no such message. 

	Munro's stunned.

					MUNRO
			Does Webb not even know we are besieged? 

					HEYWARD
			Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does 
			not know to send reinforcements! 

	Munro has nowhere for his rage to go. Meanwhile, Alice clings to her father. At 45-55,
	the British Army has been his life. He blindly believes in its institutions, though officers
	like Webb would disdain his Scots origins. 
	From under his fury: 

					MUNRO
				(flat)
			What happened to you? 

					HEYWARD
				(suddenly tired) 
			Ambush ... on the George Road. This
			Magua led us into it.
				(pause)
			... eighteen killed. It's these men who 
			saved us. They guided us here ... 

					MUNRO
			Thank you. How can I reward you? 

	No answer. Then ...

					HAWKEYE
			Help ourselves to a few horns from your 
			powder stores. 

					MUNRO
			What else? 

					UNCAS
			Some food. 

					MUNRO
				(to Uncas)
			I'm indebted to you. And get your side sewn up, 
			young man. 

	MUNRO

	sees his exhausted and bloodstained surgeon in the doorway that leads to the next
	rooms. 

					MUNRO
				(bellows) 
			Mr. Phelps! 

	PHELPS' face lights up when he sees Cora Munro.

					PHELPS
			Miss Cora! How are you? 

					CORA
				(smiles) 
			Fine, Mr. Phelps. Have you cat gut and a 
			suturing needle? 
				(for Uncas)
			And we could use some rum, clothes, and 
			a place to wash ... 

	Cora tries to remove Alice from her father, but she clings to him. Munro holds her
	tighter. Then he whispers something to her. She nods her head. And Cora takes her.
	They exit. 

	MUNRO

	is moved beyond words by his daughters' presence. There's a break, a pause ...

					MUNRO
				(to Heyward over table map)
			What a place for them ... 


					HEYWARD
			Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given 
			that I've seen of the French engineering from 
			the ridge above? 

					MUNRO
				(perfunctory)
			 Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine 
			and he has more of them. They keep our heads 
			down while his sappers make thirty yards of 
			trench a day. His thirteen inch mortars have a 
			two hundred yard range, so when they're close 
			enough, they'll move them in, lob explosive 
			rounds over our walls and pound us to dust. 

					HEYWARD
			They look to be three hundred yards out. 
			You have three days. 

					MUNRO
			Bloody murderers. 

					HAWKEYE
			A man, here, can make a run straight through 
			to Webb. 

					MUNRO
			... not enough time to get to Albany and back 
			with reinforcements ... 

	A Sergeant enters, snaps to attention, says something to Beams, exits.

					HEYWARD
			Webb's not in Albany. He marched the 33rd to 
			Fort Edward two days ago. 

					MUNRO
			Webb's at Edward? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes, sir. 

					MUNRO
			Only twelve miles away! He could be here day 
			after tomorrow. 
				(to Hawkeye)
			Find your man, sir! Captain Beams will give you 
			the message. 

	Beams nods. Munro turns back to the map. Hawkeye has something else to say.

					HAWKEYE
			John Cameron's cabin. We come upon it last 
			night. Burned out. Everyone murdered. And 
			it was Ottawa. They're allied to the French. 

	Munro looks at him.

					MUNRO
			Yes, Mr. Poe? So? 

					HAWKEYE
			It was a war party. It means they're on the 
			attack up and down the frontier. 

	Munro turns to look at him for a long beat. Munro doesn't like what his response must
	be to this news. He turns to Heyward and the map.

					MUNRO
				(cold)
			Thank you. 

	Hawkeye's dismissed, frozen out.

					HAWKEYE
			Many men here, their homes are in the path. 

					MUNRO
			That's all, sir. 

	Hawkeye is furious. Chingachgook gestures Hawkeye out. He leaves Munro's quarters
	almost knocking over an entering Adjutant who backs way up to let Chingachgook
	pass.

					HEYWARD
			Things were done. Nobody was spared ... 

					MUNRO
			Terrible feature of war in the Americas. 
				(beat; a mantra)
			Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty. 
			Our duty is to defeat France. That hangs 
			on a courier to Webb. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR MONTCALM'S MARQUEE - CHORAL GROUP - NIGHT

	of three Seneca women and five boys, led by a Jesuit, sing the Te Deum in the Iroquois
	language. This is a large tent that could sleep twenty. Montcalm's four personal guards
	are at the entrance as well as COMTE DE LEVIS in dirty lace, a facial wound and a
	braceful of pistols on a sash. Inside is simple campaign furniture and a six by eight foot
	battle standard and flag of France. 

	MONTCALM

	stands with a huge and fearsome elaborately tattooed and robed Seneca chief in a silk
	turban ...

					SENECA CHIEF
				(low)
			... and the Black Robes of Michilimackinac left 
			us no time to put our cabins in order before telling 
			us our French father had need of our aid. We rolled 
			our blankets and were the first to be here. Yet we 
			are not the first and closest to my father's campfire. 

	The Marquis de Montcalm is forty-five, wears a large wampum belt as a sash over his
	waistcoat. He has an acute intellect, an elegant manner. He is more aristocratic than
	Munro, but a consummate professional soldier. Over the Seneca's shoulder, Montcalm
	sees and nods to ... 

	MAGUA

	entering with four Huron braves. This is not the Magua we saw on the trail. In his scalp
	lock, now red-stained and cut to a Huron roach, are three blacl plumes. A match-coat
	blanket drapes his left shoulder. 

					MONTCALM
				(to Seneca Chief)
			For my children and the children of the true 
			faith, my friendship and esteem is boundless ... 
			I will give you three oxen for a feast and tomorrow 
			I, myself, will sing the war song with you in the 
			great council house. 

	The Seneca Chief is satisfied and his people, plus the Jesuit, exit. The look on Magua's
	face and the wry expression on Montcalm's allows us to understand their relationship is
	based on realpolitik.

					MONTCALM
			Le Renard Subtil, how are things with your 
			English friends? 

	Magua exhales in derision as he brings a chair to face Montcalm and sits, European
	style ...

					MONTCALM
				(over his shoulder)
			Louis Antoine, join us. 

	LOUIS ANTOINE DE BOUGAINVILLE enters. He wears a functional melange of
	Indian moccasins over white linen breeches and an officer's waistcoat. 

					MONTCALM
			Hear what le Subtil has to tell us ... 

	Bougainville published a book on integral calculus at twenty-five, at twenty-six was a
	secretary to the French Ambassador in London, in January 1756 at twenty-seven he
	was elected a member of the British Royal Academy of Science and at age twenty-eight
	he's aide de camp to the Marquis de Montcalm with the rank of captain. Later in life, he
	brought "bougainvillea" from Tahiti to Europe to America.

					MAGUA
			English war chief, Webb goes to Fort Edward 
			with 33rd Regiment. He does not know my 
			father's army attacks Fort William Henry. 

					BOUGAINVILLE
			But by now Munro knows his couriers didn't 
			get through. He'll send another. 

					MAGUA
			The Grey Hair will try. 

					BOUGAINVILLE
			Four or five, including two women entered the 
			fort ... 

					MAGUA
			The Grey Hair's children were under Magua's 
			knife but escaped. They'll be under it again. 

					MONTCALM
			Why do hate the Grey Hair, Magua? 

					MAGUA
			When the Grey Hair is dead, Magua will eat 
			his heart. Before he dies Magua will put his 
			children under the knife so the Grey Hair will 
			see his seed is wiped out forever. 

	Montcalm won't get a direct answer.

					MONTCALM
			My sappeurs are advancing the trenches through 
			the night, now. You may have your opportunity 
			soon.

	INTERIOR SURGERY, ENTRANCE - PHELPS - NIGHT

	exhausted, sitting on a low stool, taking a breath.

					HAWKEYE (O.S.)
				She know what she's doin'? 

	Phelps looks up, then he looks over his shoulder at Cora. She's in a borrowed
 	launderess dress/blouse ... She looks different. He's a little indignant.

					PHELPS
			First assisted me in Austria when she was 
			fourteen. I would say she does ... 

	Her apron is stained. Hawkeye sees this may be her first time in the New World, but it's
	not her first military campaign. Still angered at Munro's dismissive response, he's
	nevertheless falling for Cora.

					HAWKEYE
			She does not shy away from much ... 

					PHELPS
				(elsewhere) 
			What's that? 

					HAWKEYE
			Nothin'. 

	Alice Munro has caught Hawkeye's attention. Outside the surgery where a casement
	meets a wall, she sits, withdrawn. A catatonic older woman in a fine dress sits next to
	her.

					PHELPS (O.S.)
			Miss Cora? Gentleman looking for you. 

	HAWKEYE

	enters. Cora's sewing up Uncas.

					CORA
				(looks up) 
			Mr Poe? 

					HAWKEYE
			Miss. 
				(re: cotton) 
			May I? 

	Cora, curious, nods. Hawkeye cuts some pieces from her ruined and discarded dress
	that she now uses to bandage Uncas. We don't know why; neither does Cora.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Uncas) 
			You 'bout done holdin' hands with Miss Munro? 

	Uncas laughs, looking from her to Hawkeye. Then he's up and he hurts. Cora starts to
	tend another wounded man. As they start out, Hawkeye hesitates. Sensing it, Cora
	turns.

					CORA
			What are you looking at, Mr. Poe? 

					HAWKEYE
			Why, I am looking at you, Miss. 

	Cora measures the directness of Hawkeye's manner. It's not insolent, only unsettling.
	Feeling foolish; she turns. He leaves.

 	Killdeer. He charges it once, then overloads the powder by a quarter charge.

	EXTERIOR HILLSIDE - THREE HALF-SAVAGE CANADIENS

	are running down the hill to intercept the courier. One fires ... 

	COURIER

	a near miss. 

	EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - HAWKEYE

	FIRES. A half second later, Uncas FIRES. 

	EXTERIOR HILLSIDE

	One Canadien's falling through the trees as the second one's hit by Uncas' shot. 

	HAWKEYE

	reaches out his hand. Killdeer with the heavier load is slapped into it. Hawkeye aims.
	Looks away a second and comes back to the sight in deep concentration. The world
	goes silent ... 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: COURIER & CANADIEN

	pursuer are barely visible. Only patches appear momentarily between the trees. They're
	three hundred yards away: an impossible shot in 1757. 

	EXTERIOR FOREST - THE CANADIEN

	will intersect the courier. His arm is back with his tomahawk to throw ... 

	EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - HAWKEYE

	judges wind, elevates the long rifle ... and FIRES at us. 

	JUMP CUT BACK: 

	TREES

	Hawkeye's heavy round rips through. We HEAR the ball cut air. A few leaves flutter ... 

	EXTERIOR FOREST - CANADIEN

	whacked head over heels by the impact. 

	COURIER

	looks over his shoulder. He didn't know the Canadien was there. He stumbles in the
	half light. Then he runs on ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - WEST SALLY-PORT

	The three companies of the 62nd Regiment of Foot file back into the fort in perfect
	order. The sally-port is closed. Three men are wounded. The diversion worked
	perfectly. 

					HEYWARD
			Sergeant Major! 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Sir! 

					HEYWARD
			Thank you, Sergeant Major. Thank the men. 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Atten-hut! 

	TROOPERS & MILITIA

	have seen no action for three days & nights. Heyward got their blood running and won
	their respect. They step aside and nod to him. Heyward keeps walking. He is home. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR MUNRO'S BEDCHAMBER - DOOR - NIGHT

	a knock and Heyward enters. 

	CORA & ALICE

	Alice is in her father's bed. Cora is collecting and tearing linen into strips for bandaging.

					HEYWARD
			Cora ... I wanted to talk to you, but I'll 
			come back another time ... 

	Alice looks at the two of them and rises out of the bed.

					CORA
			Alice ... 

					ALICE
			Talk to Duncan, Cora ... I must manage ... 
			I cannot be an invalid schoolgirl. 
				(starts
				for door)
			I'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything ... 

	She leaves.

					HEYWARD
			I'm sorry, I didn't mean to ... 

					CORA
			Her nerves are shattered. She's trying 
			to be brave. 

	There's a lot going on under Cora's surface. We don't know what it is, but it's
	disconcerting.

					HEYWARD
			Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, 
			we will be the happiest couple in England ... 
			I am certain of that. More than ever before. 
				(softens)
			I believe you must trust the judgment of others 
			who hold your welfare so close to their hearts ... 

					CORA
			Duncan ... 
				(pause)
			Duncan, I promised you an answer. You 
			have complimented me with your persistence 
			and patience ... But the decision I've come 
			to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes 
			than surrender my own judgment. 

	Heyward is stunned.

					CORA
			And it's been unfair to you, while I search 
			myself for feelings, which, if they were
			there and as strong as they ought to be, 
			would've made themselves known long ago ...
				(pause)
			Take my admiration and friendship, Duncan. 
			And please take this as my final answer. 
			It must be no. 

	Heyward' shattered inside.

					HEYWARD
			I see ... 

					CORA
			I am sorry, Duncan ... 

	Heyward nods. He's speechless. He's errect as he leaves the room. 

	CLOSE: CORA

	The tension rushes out of her and she shudders and leans against the quarter-timbered
	walls for support. Then she collects the linen and starts out. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FORT, INNER CORRIDOR - CORA

	moving through the corridor past wounded. Two French mortar bombs explode above
	one of the casements. We hear shrill screams in the distance and ...  

					HAWKEYE (O.S.)
			... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. The 
			cabin was attacked by a war party. They are 
			sweeping south down the frontier spreading 
			terror among farms and Mohawk villages 'cos 
			all the men are here. 

					IAN (O.S.)
			And my cabin's not thirteen miles south of 
			Cameron's! 

	Cora, passing the open door to Munro's crowded office, now hesitates. 

	CORA'S POV: THE ROOM

	Hawkeye, Captain Jack Winthrop, Ian, seven or eight other militia spokesmen, Munro,
	Heyward, two adjutants, one lieutenant of Rangers.

					MUNRO
				(to Jack)
			I must receive proof more conclusive than 
			Mr. Poe's opinion before I weaken our 
			defenses by allowing militia to withdraw. 

					JACK
			Chingachgook's of the same opinion. Taken 
			together, that's gospel. Your fort will	 stand 
			or fall depending on Webb and reinforcements, 
			not these colonials' presence. 

					MUNRO
			I judge military matters, Captain Winthrop, not 
			you. 

					HAWKEYE
			That judgment is not more important than their 
			right under agreement with Webb to defend their 
			farms & families ... Major Heyward was at John 
			Cameron's. He saw what it was. 

					MUNRO
				(looking to Heyward for 
				confirmation of his point of view) 
			What did you see, Major? 

	Heyward looks around the room. And he catches the doorway ... 

	CORA

	beyond the periphery of men, staring at him. 

	HEYWARD

	Munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of British military interests.
	At the same time ... 

	CORA

	examines him with a cool, level stare. 

	HEYWARD

	looks at Munro. More French rounds detonate O.S. What if Webb gets here and they
	need to launch a counter-attack? They need every man they have. It's his moment of
	decision ...  

					HEYWARD
				(to Munro)
			I saw nothing that would lead me to the 
			conclusion it was other than a raid by savages 
			bent on thievery. 

	Jack Winthrop grabs Nathaniel.

					HAWKEYE
			You're a liar! 

	CORA'S

	saddened. Heyward's stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes. 

	HEYWARD

	can't help it. He turns to look at Cora ... 

	HEYWARD'S POV: DOORWAY

	She's gone. 

	HEYWARD

	suffused with an inner sadness, turns to Hawkeye.

					HAWKEYE
			And the blood is on your hands! 

	Heyward reaches for his sword. 

					MUNRO
				(to Heyward) 
			I'll have none of that! 
				(to colonials) 
			Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. 
			Not a butcher. 

					HAWKEYE
			Easy for you to suppose. While it is their 
			women and children, not yours, alone in 
			their farms! 

					MUNRO
				(exploding)
			You forget yourself! 

					JACK
			We are not forgettin' Webb's promise! 

					MUNRO
			British promises are honored. And the militia 
			will not be released. Because I need more 
			definite proof than this man's word! 

					JACK
			Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a 
			long time before you got here! 

					MUNRO
			This interview's over! The militia stays! 

					JACK
				(to Munro) 
			Does the rule of English law no longer govern? 
			Has it been replaced by absolutism? 

	This is very dangerous talk.

					HAWKEYE
			And if English law cannot be trusted, maybe 
			these people would do better makin' a peace 
			with the French! 

					HEYWARD
			That is sedition! Treason! 

					HAWKEYE
			That is the truth! 

					HEYWARD
				(restaining himself) 
			I ought to have you whipped from this fort! 

					HAWKEYE
			Major! 
				(changes down)
			Some day I think you and I are gonna have 
			a serious disagreement. 

					MUNRO
				(steel) 
			Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving 
			Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition. 
			Anyone leaving will be shot for desertion. 
				(pause)
			 My decision is final. Get out. 

	Hawkeye and the others are not intimidated. Their rage smolders. The look on
	Hawkeye's face says this is not over. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR FORT, PARADE GROUND - BONFIRE - NIGHT

	Sparks shower skyward. Impromptu music. Some Celtic proto-bluegrass played on
	fiddle & drums. It's stirring. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: SOME WOMEN

	laundresses, dance from soldier to soldier - English foot and American Rangers. A few
	people lit by the firelight are solemn. Most are stirred to lift their morale for a while. 

	THEIR FACES

	underlit by the red firelight. They are a disposable people, a diverse plurality stuck in a
	postage stamp-size fort in an ocean of forest, locked into mortal deadly conflict
	 because of the policies of cold and distant European monarchs. 

	A PLACE A LITTLE DISTANT FROM THE FIRE

	We can barely make out the eyes and faces of a number of men behind logs, crates and
	new wreckage from the day's bombardment. 

					HAWKEYE
				(low)
			... got no kin in the settlements. If I did, 
			I'd be long gone. 

					IAN
			You didn't think it right to be here in the 
			first place. 

					HAWKEYE
			By my light that's how I saw it then and I 
			see it that way now ... 

					IAN
				(low)
			But we are under English military authority. 

					JACK
				(low) 
			I believe if they set aside their law as and when 
			they wish, their law no longer has rightful 
			authority over us. All they have over us is 
			tyranny, then. And I'll stay here no longer. 
			No force on earth will keep me here ... Anyone 
			caught leavin' the fort could be shot. So each 
			man make your own decision ... Those who 
			are goin', be back here in an hour. 

					HAWKEYE
			Out the northern sally-port. Strike for the east 
			side of the swamp until you clear the French 
			picket line. Head north over the ridge, then 
			come about southeast and fork left in Little 
			Meadow and you're free of the outpost and 
			skirmishers ... 

					A COLONIAL
				(grumbles)
			 Should've skinned outta this long ago. 

					COLONIAL #2
			Got no families, Captain. Figured we'd stay 
			and give 'em a hand even though ... 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Colonial #2)
			I'll cover them from the top of the casement. 

					JACK
				(in amazement)
			You're not coming with us? 

	Hawkeye shakes his head. 

					HAWKEYE
			Got a reason to stay. 

					JACK
			That reason wear a blue dress and work 
			in the surgery? 

	Low laughter

					HAWKEYE
				(dry)
			 It does and it is a better lookin' reason 
			than you, Jack Winthrop. 
				(more laughs) 
			Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French 
			outpost by dawn. 
				(sticks out his hand and
				grasps Winthrop's) 
			Good luck, Jack. 

	The men split up ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	FIRE - HAWKEYE

	wanders among the dancers and musicians clustered in groups, lit by the firelight.
	 Someone catches his eye and he moves in that direction ... 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: CORA

	in the shadows, leaning against the wall, searching ... we sense she's been looking
	for him. He comes up to her. She turns in surprise. 

	CLOSER

	Somehow she breathes easier because he's there. She's in a white shirt with the sleeves
	rolled up. Hawkeye leads her away from some of the people. 

	CORA & HAWKEYE

	Hawkeye takes Cora's hand. Cora is awakening to a new spirit, a new wind blowing
	through a new land, a new self-determination ... She's drawn to this rough yet graceful
	man with his direct manner. Hawkeye settles against a wall. She leans next to him.
	Their shoulders touch. 

	CORA

	To her everything about him seems to be somehow right. She's discovered that the
	passions and outrage that move him, move her ... And her readiness to give herself to
	what stirs the deepest resonances of her soul is the same as his. 

	HAWKEYE

	looks at her. She's beautiful in the firelight. Cora's eyes find his and she folds into his
	arms. His lips find hers and tears stream down her face. She's suffused with an elation
	she can't explain. In the night before doomsday a romance is born in rebellion amid the
	huddled people in this small stockade ripped from the black earth of the forests of a
	wild continent. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR BARRACKS - LOW & WIDE - DAY

	door CRASHES inwards. Twelve British sentries storm in. Four bear torches. 

	REVERSE: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO COLONIALS &

					SERGEANT (O.S.)
			You! Halt! 

	BRITISH SENTRIES

	their muskets aimed mostly at Hawkeye.

					SERGEANT
			As you were!! 

	Hawkeye freezes. The others slow down, indecisive ... Hawkeye drops his tomahawk
	and says something in Mohican to restrain Chingachgook and Uncas. The British in the
	torchlight with the long muskets and bayonets are an image out of Goya. 

					SERGEANT
			Take him! 

	Hawkeye's spun around and while his hands are bound. 

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(Mohican; subtitled)
			Why do they make my son prisoner? 

					HAWKEYE
				(Mohican; subtitled)
			I helped Winthrop and the others leave ... 
			This fight is not yours, father. I love 
			you and my brother. And you should leave 
			this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee ... 

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(Mohican; subtitled)
			What will they do with my white son? 

	One of the guards - scared to death by Chingachgook - nervously fingers his musket. 

					GUARD
			Get back from him! 

	HEYWARD

	enters. 

	HAWKEYE

	shrugs in answer to Chingachgook's question. 

	HAWKEYE'S

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR MUNRO'S QUARTERS - CORA - DAY

					CORA
			He saved us! We are alive only because 
			of him ... 

	WIDEN:

	Heyward, Munro, Cora. We've entered mid-argument. An adjutant comes and goes.
	Heyward and Munro are sensitive to appearances in front of the adjutant. Cora couldn't
	give a damn. 

					MUNRO
			The man encouraged the colonials to desert 
			in this very room, in my presence. He is 
			guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged 
			like any other criminal, regardless of what he 
			did for my children. 

					CORA
			He knew the consequences. And he stayed. 
			Are those the actions of a criminal? 
			... Duncan, do something. 

					HEYWARD
			He knew the penalty for breaking regulations. 
			He ought to pay without sending you to beg. 

					CORA
			You know he wouldn't send me ...! You 
			misrepresented what you saw and caused
			this. 
				(frustrated)
			I, too, was at that farm. It was as he said ... 

					MUNRO
			Not with enough certainty to outweigh British 
			interests in this fort. 

					HEYWARD
			And who empowered these provincials to pass 
			judgment upon England's policies in her own 
			colonies? To come and go without so much as 
			a "by your leave." 

					CORA
			They do not live their lives "by your leave." 
			... They hack it out of the wilderness with 
			their own two hands, burying their dead and 
			their children along the way. 

					HEYWARD
				(distant)
			 You are defending him because you've become 
			infatuated with him.

	Cora is having her intelligence written off as a hormone attack. She contains her fury. 

					CORA
			Duncan, you are a man with a few admirable 
			qualities. But taken as a whole, I was wrong 
			to have thought so highly of you. 

	Heyward's shot through the heart.

					MUNRO
			But the man is guilty of sedition and subject 
			to military justice and beyond pardon. 

					CORA
			"Justice"? If that's "justice" ..., then the 
			sooner French guns blow the English army
			out of America, the better it will be for 
			these people. 

					MUNRO
			You do not know what you are saying! 

					CORA
				(explodes)
			Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying. 
			And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of 
			sedition, too! 

	She exits, leaving them there. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FORT, STOCKADE - NIGHT

	Heavy timbered door. A sentry. They stand at attention when Cora passes as opposed
	to barring her entry. 

	INTERIOR CELL - HAWKEYE

	comes to the door, grips the bars with his hands and looks at Cora. 

	THROUGH THE BARS TO CORA

	They are silent for a moment, then ... 

					HAWKEYE
			Sorry ... can't ask you in. 

	Cora's pale smile. 

					CORA
			They're going to hang you. 
				(pause; soft)
			Why didn't you leave when you had the
			chance? 

					HAWKEYE
			Because what I am interested in is right 
			here ... 

					CORA
			What would you have me do? 

	He touches her hand. 

					HAWKEYE
			Webb's reinforcements will arrive or not. 
			If they do not arrive, the fort will fall. If 
			that happens, stay close to your father. 
			The French will protect the officer class 
			among the English. 

					CORA
			No. I will find you. 

					HAWKEYE
			Do not. 
				(pause)
			Promise me. 

	Cora drops her forehead to Hawkeye's hands wrapped around the bars. She acquiesces,
	nods. Then HEAVY SHELLING commences. Cora & Hawkeye look up. Mortar
	bombs begin striking the fortress. Still dark. The final French bombardment has
	started. 

					CORA
			The whole world's on fire, isn't it? 

	A pause.

					HAWKEYE
			This part of it sure is ... 

	Reaching through the bars set in the thick door, their hands clasp each others. On that

	French cannoneers in Batteries #1 and #2 fire again and again. They work like precision

	FRENCH TRENCH

	ending in Battery #3 is complete and surprisingly close to William Henry's walls. Crews
	reload the squat and massive newly arrived thirteen inch mortars. 

	MORTAR ONE

	The flash-hole is primed. The burning fuse is jammed into the bomb. The primer charge
	is lit off and the crew ducks as the crude iron belches red flame and black smoke into
	the lightening sky. The second mortar ROARS. Then a THIRD. 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR FORT WILLIAM HENRY - ENGLISH CANNON CREW - NIGHT

	tries to return fire but can't under the heavy French bombardment. The French mortar
	bomb arcs in and EXPLODES smoke, flame and shrapnel, wiping out most of the
	crew. The fortress is under the heaviest attack we've seen. Wounded are in shock or
	terrorized. Another mortar bomb arcs in and explodes part of a building and casement,
	starting a fire.
	Another lands in the grounds. People scatter. It doesn't explode. One soldier dashes to
	rip out the fuse. As his hand is inches away ... EXPLOSION.

	INTERIOR FORT - STOCKADE - HAWKEYE

	crosses to an awakened Cora. He touches her face. He's desperate to drill these next

					CORA
			What is it?

	Cora looks up at Hawkeye. We feel forboding. O.S. are heard drums ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FRENCH LINES - MUNRO, HEYWARD, BEAMS - DAY

	The drums are from Munro's honor guard. They stop. 

	REVERSE: FRENCH SOLDIERS

	Marquis de Montcalm, immaculate, backed by his guard of honor in white, grey and
	medium blue with six foot by eight foot regimental colors and the French flag (gold
	fleur-de-lis on a field of blue). 

	FACES

	They carried two hundred and forty-five bateaux across a ten mile portage, all their
	supplies and artillery, and then rowed down the length of Lake George to get here. To 	them, assaulting this fort is the easy part. The drummers of the honor guard play a
	tattoo behind them. 

	INDIAN FACES

	Huron, Ottawa, Osage, Choctaw, Fox ... hear the drum of the honor guard and wait.
	They're in war paint. Many tattoos. Split ears. The Osage scalping locks are hennaed
	red. Canadiens among them are bearded, dirty, half savage ... At their head ... 

	MAGUA

	in full war paint, with a coterie of Huron warriors, silent, waiting. Drums. 

	INTERIOR FORT - ENGLISH TROOPS (TABLEAUX)

	grim, silent, watchful. 

	COLONIAL MILITIA & MOHAWK INDIANS IN WAR PAINT (TABLEAUX)

	watching the parlay from a blown apart battery. Silent. 

	WIDE: FRENCH & ENGLISH

	and their honor guards. Montcalm steps forward and sweeps his plumed hat to the
	ground in a courtly bow. Munro bows coldly. 

					MONTCALM
			Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant 
			antagonist. I am happy to make your 
			acquaintance as a friend. 

					MUNRO
			And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis. 

					MONTCALM
			Please accept my compliments for the strong 
			and skillful defense of your fortress. Under 
			the command of a lesser man it would have 
			fallen long ago given the superior numbers and 
			material ... mere chance has allowed me to 
			array against you ... 

					MUNRO
			Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a 
			diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason. 

					MONTCALM
			You have already done everything which is 
			necessary for the honor of your Prince. I 
			will forever bear testimony that your resistance 
			has been gallant and was continued as long as 
			there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen 
			to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to 
			consider my terms for your surrender. 

					MUNRO
			However I may apprise such testimony from 
			Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is 
			strong and stands. 

					MONTCALM
			Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may 
			be refused obstinacy ... These hills afford to 
			us every opportunity to reconnoiter your 
			works and I am possibly as well acquainted 
			with your weak condition as you are yourselves. 

	Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British
	reinforcements arrive? 

					MUNRO
			Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the 
			Hudson and he knows the size and imminence 
			of the army of Webb ...? 

	Montcalm takes a moment to reply and appears genuinely sympathetic to Munro. 

					MONTCALM
				(quietly)
			My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended 
			for you. 

	Munro is puzzled, suspicious. 

					MONTCALM
				(to Bougainville)
			Read the dispatch. 

	HEYWARD & MUNRO]

					BOUGAINVILLE 
				(O.S. - reading)
			"Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry. I have 
			no men available to send to your rescue. It is 
			impossible. I  advise you to seek terms for 
			surrender. Signed Webb." 

	Munro is rocked, as if struck by a blow. Bougainville hands Heyward the letter. 

					HEYWARD
				(confirming)
			This is the signature of Webb. 
				(to Munro)
			And I know the temper of our men. Rather 
			than spend the war in a French prison hulk 
			in Hudson Bay, they'd fight to the end. 

					MUNRO
				(to Montcalm)
			 You have heard your answer, Monsieur le 
			Marquis. 
				(salutes) 

	Munro starts off. Montcalm stops him. 

					MONTCALM
			Sir. 
				(challengingly)
			I am incapable of mistreating brave men. 
			I beg you not to sign the death warrant 
			of so many until you have listened to my 
			terms. 

	Munro turns. 

					MUNRO
			Such as ...? 

					MONTCALM
			My master requires the fort be destroyed. 
			But, for you and your comrades, there is 
			no privilege that will be denied. None of 
			your men will see the inside of a prison
			barge. They're free to go so long as they 
			return to England and fight no more on this
			continent, and the civilian militia return to 
			their farms. 

					MUNRO
			Their arms? 

					MONTCALM
			They may leave the fortress fully armed, but 
			with no ammunition ... Other than that, ask 
			what you wish. 

	Munro's impressed with Montcalm's generosity. 

					MUNRO
			The honors of war? 

					MONTCALM
			Granted. 

					MUNRO
			My colors? 

					MONTCALM
			Carry them to England to your King with pride. 

					MUNRO
			Allow me to consult with my officers. 

	As he turns away something's been disconnected inside Munro that can never get put
	back together. As the men move away from the French ... 

					MUNRO
			I have lived to see two things I never expected. 
			An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And 
			a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage. 

					HEYWARD
			General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back 
			and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our 
			mission is to fight. 

					MUNRO
				(flares)
			Death and honor are sometimes thought to be 
			the same. Today I have learned that they are not. 

	Munro looks at the fortress behind him. 

					HEYWARD
			Sir! 

					MUNRO
				(stops him with his eyes)
			The decision is final. 

	A beat. Then Munro turns toward Montcalm. Their eyes meet across the churned,
	scarred earth of the battlefield. 

					MUNRO
			I am deeply touched by such unusual and 
			unexpected generosity ... The fort is yours 
			under the condition that we be given until 
			dawn to bury our dead, prepare our men and 
			women for their march and turn our wounded 
			over to your surgeon. 

					MONTCALM
			Granted, Monsieur. 

	And Montcalm bows deeply and as he does so ...

			Le mot d'ordre? 

					MONTCALM
			La victoire. 

					SENTRY
			C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, 
			monsieur! 

					MONTCALM
			Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant. 

	The cloak parts. By the light of the moon the man's face is dimly perceived by us and
	the soldier as General Montcalm. The soldier snaps erect as Montcalm continues
	walking out beyond the line to a small stand of trees. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: MONTCALM

	The moon is broken into pieces of light on the water and behind Montcalm; from the
	front of the stand of trees emerges a tall figure.

					MAGUA
			Is the hatchet buried between the English 
			and my French father? 

					MONTCALM
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men 
			become friends. 

					MONTCALM
			My master owns these lands and your father 
			has been ordered to drive off the English 
			squatters. They have consented to go. So 
			now he calls them enemies no longer. 

					MAGUA
			Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood. 
			It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will 
			be buried. 

					MONTCALM
			But so many suns have set since Le Renard 
			struck the war post. Is he not tired? 

					MAGUA
			Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill. 
			It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, 
			they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell 
			all of their lands to enrich the European masters 
			who are always greedy for more than they need. 
				(threatening)
			And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have 
			been many clouds and many mountains. But now
			he has come to lead his nation. 

					MONTCALM
			That Le Renard has the power to lead his people 
			into the light, I know well. 

	Magua grabs the hand of the French commander. Imperceptible surprise in Montcalm's
	eyes. Magua jams Montcalm's fingers to his chest. 

					MAGUA
			Does my father know that? 

	MAGUA'S CHEST

	A deep indentation and scar. 

					MONTCALM
			That's where a lead bullet has torn you. 

					MAGUA
			And this? 

	Magua turns his naked back to Montcalm and puts Montcalm's hand on his back ... 	deep ridges of a scar a half inch wide.] 

					MONTCALM
			My son has been sadly injured. Who did 
			this? 

					MAGUA
				(laughs; sardonic)
			Magua slept hard in the English wigwams. 
			And the sticks left their mark ... 
				(pause; for real)
			Magua's village and lodges were burnt. 
			Magua's children were killed by the English. 
			Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks 
			who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife 
			believed he was dead and became the wife of 
			another. The Grey Hair was the father of all 
			this. 
				(pause)
			In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk 
			to become free. In his heart he always was Huron. 
			And his heart will be whole again on the day 
			when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead! 

					MONTCALM
			My son Magua's pain is my pain. 

					MAGUA
			Does the chief of the Canadas believe the 
			English will keep the terms? 

					MONTCALM
			Munro would. But General Webb will not
			send their soldiers across the salt lake. 
			Having let them go, I fear I will only fight 
			the same men again when I move south.
				(pause; shrugs)
			And yet, I cannot break the terms of the 
			capitulation and sully the lilies of France ... 

	Long pause, wheels turn. Then: 

					MAGUA
			Many things my French father cannot do, 
			Magua can. 

	Montcalm reacts as if he hadn't thought of that. 

					MONTCALM
			As the English march away, our soldiers 
			and the Canadiens will be drawn to the 
			looting of the fort ... except for a small 
			guard ... 

	Magua abruptly leaves Montcalm. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR WOODS - MAGUA - NIGHT

	walking back to the Huron camp. Reveal a Huron sub-chief has been in the woods,
	waiting for Magua. Now he joins him. They walk in silence. Then ...

					MAGUA
				(in Iroquois; re: Montcalm)
			I wonder at the blindness and pride of the 
			white man. He believes only he knows 
			how to speak falsely to make other men do 
			his bidding. 

	Magua exhales in derision. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FORT, MAIN GATE - MUNRO - DAY

	at the end of the column, rides out on his horse. Both sides of the gate are jammed with
	armed French troops standing at attention. The French colors and honor guard are just
	outside the gate along with Bougainville, Chevalier de Levis, both on horseback as 
	is - at the head - Montcalm. 

	CLOSER: MUNRO

	trots past his walking column out the gate. He does not look at the French. 

	MONTCALM

	salutes Munro and bows gravely from the saddle. 

	CLOSER: MUNRO

	salutes Montcalm.

					MUNRO
				(eyes forward)
			Monsieur, the fort is yours. 

	MID-COLUMN - ON HEYWARD

	marching with his 33rd Regiment of Foot well beyond the fort. The French troops have
	thinned out. Repressing shame, his backbone is rigid, his face is straight ahead. The
	33rd marches in perfect cadence to the drum. In the B.G. Munro on his horse passes
	Heyward as he rides towards the front of his column. Heyward does not look at him. 

	FRONT OF COLUMN - CORA WITH ALICE

	on the back of a mare. Alice, living through a wide-awake nightmare, is huddled under
	the arm of her sister. They ride behind the standard bearers. In the B.G. her father is
	seen approaching and takes his position at their side. Cora looks down the column,
	sheilding her eyes against the sun. We know who she's looking for ... Hawkeye. 

	CORA'S POV: THE COLUMN

	The 62nd and 42nd Highlanders including Heyward ... thirty to forty women and a
	number of children - for safety - in the middle, some frontiersmen, Ongewasgone and
	many Mohawk, walking wounded. The column is still snaking its way out of the fort.
	No Hawkeye. 

	CORA

	straining to see. 

	EXTERIOR FORT - PRISONERS

	being assembled, their hands shackled. Hawkeye is among twelve or thirteen. He stands
	erect, walking out of the gate. The French are starting to pour in to loot the interior.
	Hawkeye looks to his left about twenty paces in front of him and sees ... 

	UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

	on the other side of the column. Chingachgook cradles Killdeer as well as his own
	musket. They fall back to walk beside the prisoners on the other side of Hawkeye.
	Their eyes connect... We don't expect Hawkeye to stay shackled for the duration. 

	RANK AND FILE FRENCH

	A few insults. The British soldiers answer. Nobody breaks rank. It's just talk. 

	EXTERIOR ROAD - HAWKEYE

	His eyes sweep the column snaking its way into the v-shaped valley. The path cuts
	through the forested hills ahead. He sees ... 

	HAWKEYE'S DISTANT POV: CORA

	riding near the front where there are no more French soldiers. Only a few scattered and
	curious Huron and Ottawa. She does not see him. 

	PROFILE OF COLUMN - HIGH & WIDE

	as it passes left to right below like a long snake through the narrow valley. We're
	shooting from inside the dark woods. Lower, in the light, we see a scattering on both
	slopes of a couple of hundred Ottawa and Huron. They are in no order, are spread out
	and don't constitute a threat. They watch the column. 
	SLOWLY THE CAMERA ... slides across the shoulders and back of a large man
	wearing black plumes in his scalp-lock and other than a breechcloth is almost naked. He
	is heavily war-painted ... 

	FRONTAL - MAGUA

	and the left two-thirds of his face is painted red. The right third is painted black. Much
	silver is in his ears. His tomahawk is in his left hand. His cut-down musket in his right
	fist. Magua's attention is all focused to one point. 

	MAGUA'S LONG & TIGHT POV: MUNRO & CORA & ALICE

	at the head of the column. This is the focus of Magua's attention. 

	WIDE FRONTAL: COLUMN, STANDARD BEARERS & MUNROS

	Cora turns again to look for Hawkeye. 

	CLOSER: CORA

	doesn't see him, but something else has caught her eye. 

	YOUNG HURON

	running toward the column. Just one man. No musket. He's running and whooping like
	a dog charging from his master's front yard. Why? 

	CLOSER

	the Huron arrives at the column, his tomahawk swings into his hand and he brains a
	British trooper who falls dead. The single Huron never breaks stride. He simply runs off
	again ... 

	CORA

	horrified, holds Alice tighter. 

	MUNRO

	has seen it too. And now he sees ... 

	62ND REGIMENT OF FOOT

	fixing bayonets. A large sergeant unsheathes a two-handed claymore, facing the Hurons
	and other Indians ... 

	TROOPERS

	of the 33rd present arms. Did they violate the surrender by carrying ammunition? Locks
	are cocked. There's the answer. 

					MUNRO
			Steady! No one fires! 

	EXTERIOR FORESTED HILLSIDES - OTHER TRIBES

	are watching what happens. 

	HEYWARD

	scanning them. 

					HEYWARD
				(to Sergeant Major)
			Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major! 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Yes sir! 

	Drums beat the cadence.

	TROOPERS

	step over the fallen soldier. Heads turn, they're on edge ... 

	END OF COLUMN - HAWKEYE, UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK

	watching. They exchange looks. This is not good. Chingachgook cocks both Killdeer
	and his own musket. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: FORESTED SLOPES

	Hold. We start to make out details in the shadow. Tree trunks. We become accustomed
	to the dimness. Now in the lower light we see deeper in the forest. 

	CLOSER

	Many Huron and Ottawa are hidden in the shadows. They're moving along parallel to
	the column, stalking it. Waiting ... 

	ANOTHER BRAVE

	racing down the hill from the opposite flank towards the 62nd. 

	TWO SOLDIERS

	look at their sergeant. He nods. They wait until he's within ten feet of the column. Both
	bayonet the Indian. He's dead. 

	EXTERIOR HILLSIDES - HURON & OTTAWA

	saw what happened. But, they hold their ranks. 

	MOHAWKS

	among the British are slipping tomahawks into their hands, surreptitiously. Some are
	cocking flintlocks. 

	MUNRO

	gallops his horse away from Cora and Alice towards the scene of the last attack. We
	hear him from the distance ordering ...

					MUNRO
			Do not break ranks! I want these ranks 
			to hold ...! 

	Cora's frightened.

	HAWKEYE'S

	frustrated. He saw Munro leave Cora. He knows events have a momentum and it's
	accelerating. 

	CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

	move next to the sergeant with the shackle keys who looks at them curiously as ... 

	WOMEN

	with children nervously search the threatening trees, hoping against hope these are
	isolated incidents. 

	HEYWARD

	draws his sword and is passing orders to his sergeant major, scanning the hills ... 

	EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA

	His eyes see Munro. 

	WIDER & LOWER: MAGUA

	raises his musket in his fist and emits a war whoop. WE NOW SEE ... hundreds have
	been stalking the column, hidden in the trees, maybe thousands. Then ... 

	WIDE: ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

	FIRE from the trees crescendos within seconds revealing a spontaneous and massive
	ambush of mostly Hurons. They appear from behind every tree and it turns to a ROAR
	of musket fire, war whoops and screams as ... 

	SOLDIERS & CIVILIANS

	dropping like flies and seemingly thousands of Hurons attack down both slopes. 

	HAWKEYE

	is being unshackled by Uncas. The sergeant is rising from the ground where
	Chingachgook knocked him. Chingachgook throws Hawkeye Killdeer and Hawkeye
	shrugs into his pouch and powder horn as he races with Uncas for the head of the
	column ... 

	EXTERIOR FORESTED SLOPE - MAGUA

	charging down the hill ... with his coterie of twenty Huron warriors, heading for the
	area in which he saw Munro. 

	CORA & ALICE

	at the head of the disintegrating column. Cora's holding Alice's head to her bosom,
	covering her ears as if to protect her from the sounds. 

	HEYWARD

	shouting orders. 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Right - about face! March! First rank present! 

					HEYWARD
			Fire! 

	REVERSE:

	The volley knocks down fifteen of a horde of attacking Hurons. 

					SERGEANT MAJOR
			Prime! Load! Second rank six paces forward! 
			Present! 

	Hurons are twenty yards away and closing.

					HEYWARD
			Fire! 

	As the line of muskets belch smoke and fire ... 

	WIDE: THE HILLS & PATH

	We're shooting into the "v" of the valley with Hurons and other tribes pouring down
	from both sides. (IMPORTANT: the combined musket fire of Hurons, English and
	Mohawks generates tremendous clouds of smoke which obscure action, close off
	views, isolate pockets of combat into surreal tableaux that we'll move in and out of.

	BRITISH TROOPERS

	using their useless muskets as clubs or with fixed bayonets - as the smoke and fog
	swirls among the men - fighting for their lives ... 

	MAGUA

	glides through the scenes, striking and hunting. Some of his coterie of braves near him.
	He sees ... 

	BLONDE WOMAN

	hugging the ground in fear. Magua throws her over. It's not Alice Munro. It's a woman
	protecting her baby. Magua walks on. One of the braves behind Magua raise his
	tomahawk. On his downswing ... 

	HAWKEYE

	running through surreal patches, thinks he glimpses Cora two hundred yards away. 

					HAWKEYE
			Cora! 

	Chingachgook, on Hawkeye's left, slams down two Hurons with his war club. 

	CORA & ALICE

	running through the chaos and murder and British troopers and Mohawks locked in
	struggle with Hurons. Cora's dress is torn. She holds Alice to her. There's a pistol in
	Cora's hand. 

	ONE HURON

	scalping a prone soldier, rips the trophy from his head, turns and faces us. 

	CORA

	shoots him in the face. 

	EXTREMELY CLOSE: ALICE

	and her eyes take it all in. And her affect starts to flatten. A blankness suffuses her
	expression and the girl withdraws from this reality into a deep dark cave inside her
	head. 

	HAWKEYE

	locked in combat. He tomahawks one Huron's arm with a slashing downstroke and
	comes right back into the face of the second with his backswing while his right hand
	fires Killdeer at ... 

	HURON

	six feet from Uncas and about to shoot him in the back. 

	HAWKEYE

	free for a moment, spins. He has no idea of direction any more. Everything is death in
	strange tableaux. Meanwhile: 

	MUNRO

	hollering

					MUNRO
			Cora! Alice! 

	He cuts down a Huron with his sword who is trying to leap at him from the right. An
	Osage warrior with red scalp-lock leaps on the back of Munro's horse, reaching over to
	stab down into Munro's neck. The old man's left hand grabs the warrior's knife hand in
	an iron grip. His right hand pulls his horse pistol and under his upraised arm fires
	backward, point blank, blowing the Osage off the back of his horse. 

	WIDER

	Just then Munro's mount is shot. His horse rears up, throws Munro and falls on him. 

	HEYWARD

	shouting orders over the deafening noise.

					HEYWARD
			Second rank fire! Six paces back! Prime! 
			Load! Third rank! Present! 

	A well-oiled, well-drilled fighting machine, but there are fewer of them. They're getting
	cut off. They close ranks automatically as a man drops. They're retreating in perfect
	order. 

	HURON WARRIOR

	about to strike a downwards blow is pushed aside by Magua. 

	CLOSER: MAGUA

	His eyes drop to what's in front of him. The field goes quiet. 

	OVER MAGUA'S SHOULDER: MUNRO

	his lower body is trapped under his dead horse. Magua leans in towards him. 

					MAGUA
			Grey Hair. I will cut your heart from your 
			living chest in front of your eyes. As you die, 
			know that I will put under the knife your 
			children and wipe your seed from this earth 
			forever ... 

	Magua pulls his knife and as he leans down towards Munro ... 

	MOHAWK & HURON

	spin and flail furiously at each other with tomahawks and knives. The Huron goes down
	and then the Mohawk is shot. The Huron who shot him is cut down by a Ranger with
	tomahawk in one hand and bayonet in the other. Two Mohawks and three Rangers
	fighting back to back. They become an island swamped by Huron and Ottawa: amidst
	bodies and ground slippery with blood. As smoke obscures their image. 

	CORA & ALICE

	in a group of civilian militia. Two of the militiamen are shot down. The third engages a
	Fox warrior. Cora & Alice run. 

	MUNRO'S FACE

	frozen in agony by shock. 

	MAGUA

	reaching down and up into something, emerges and jams an object we barely see into
	the air. But his arm and shoulder and half his chest are splashed red with blood. 

	LONG SHOT: MAGUA

	seen from far away, holding aloft the heart of Munro. 

	REVERSE: HAWKEYE

	saw him and fights his way to attack when ... 

	WHITE HORSE

	crazed, CRASHES through men, knocking Hawkeye over ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	protecting Hawkeye, slams his war club into one Huron, breaking his attack, his arm
	and his skull and swings the other way burying the bladed end into the chest of an
	Ottawa who's behind him. Then ... 

	HAWKEYE'S

	up, looking wildly ... 

	CAMERA JAMS INTO CLEARING SMOKE:

	33rd Regiment of Foot and Heyward. They FIRE into our face. 

	CLOSER: HEYWARD

					HEYWARD
			Six paces back! Prime! Load! Rank two, 
			present! Rank two, hold! 

	He grabs a partially loaded musket, the ramrod still in the barrel. They're taking fire.
	Men are dying. They're being pushed back. 

	AN ABNAKI

	wearing a large cross, attacks Heyward from the side. One-handed, Heyward fires the
	musket into the man's chest, sending the ramrod through him. Then Heyward's shot in
	the thigh and a thrown tomahawk hits him in the head and knocks him sideways.
	Dazed. Barely able to stand. He uses the musket as a cane and ...

					HEYWARD
			Rank two, six paces back! Rank one, 
			present! 

	Rank two did not retreat six paces. They stand in confusion. Heyward looks to see
	what's wrong. 

	HEYWARD'S POV: THE REMNANTS OF THE 33RD REGIMENT OF FOOT

	are standing in water. They're up against Lake George. Their backs are to the wall. Last
	stand. Heyward straightens. 

	TWO FRENCH OFFICERS

	on horseback try to intercede in the slaughter of five women. One French officer is shot
	by a Huron. The other French officer runs through that Huron and shoots the second.
	Then his horse is shot out from under him and he goes down ... 

	JESUIT

	pleads with an Abnaki to give up a child he's holding by the legs in one hand. He offers
	his cross. The Abnaki throws the baby to the Jesuit, Pere Roubaud. 

	UNCAS

	sees a flash of something yellow. So does Hawkeye. They charge into the swirling
	chaos of attacking bodies. As we lose sight of them ... 

	ALICE

	on her hands and knees. A massive Ottawa pulls her upright by her hair about to take
	her life and her scalp. He's struck by a rock in the hands of Cora which barely phases
	him. He bats her aside and returns to Alice, when suddenly ... 

	OTTAWA WARRIOR

	is spun, punched and tomahawked into the ground by Hawkeye. Uncas has Alice and
	Cora ... 

	TWO RANGERS AND A MOHAWK WARRIOR

	from the earlier group are nearby. They combine with Hawkeye to fight their way out
	 with bayonets and tomahawks. 

	HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, TWO RANGERS, A MOHAWK &
	MUNRO'S DAUGHTERS

	back through the swirling smoke. There seems to be a lull. Then they're hit from the
	side by musket fire. One of the Rangers is shot, the other wounded. Hurons attack. The
	Mohawk supports the wounded Ranger. 

	HAWKEYE

	shields Cora as they back up. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	smashing his war club straight down on a Huron, reaches for the man's musket and
	shoots another. Then he sees ... 

	SMOKE DRIFTING OVER WATER

	It's glass-smooth. And the bows are barely visible of three or four Huron war canoes. 

	THE SHALLOWS - HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK, UNCAS, CORA, ALICE,
	THE RANGER & THE MOHAWK

	back into the water. They're pursued by Ottawa and Hurons as they fight their way to
	the canoes. 

	CORA

	held up by Hawkeye, suddenly screams. 

	ANGLE

	something underwater is pulling her down. An Ottawa brave rockets out of the
	shallows. Before he's erect, Hawkeye slams him back into the water and FIRES. 

	WOUNDED RANGER

	has shoved a large birch canoe at them. 

	HAWKEYE

	Suddenly, the Mohawk fighting with them is shot and spins to face Hawkeye. His hands
	rest on Hawkeye's shoulders. Hawkeye looks into his face. Tries to hold him up, tries
	to rescue him. A frozen moment. Hawkeye's staring into his eyes and the man is staring
	into Hawkeye's as the light goes out ... Hawkeye lets him slide into the water and float
	away. He moves Cora and Alice towards the canoe ... 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR LAKE GEORGE - WATER & SWIRLING SMOKE - DAY

	The bottom of the frame is water like glass. Smoke obscures the background. Fingers
	tendril towards us. Out of the mist we HEAR small splashing and then the high bow of
	a war canoe defines itself. It's paddled towards us. 

	HAWKEYE, CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

	Cora's behind Hawkeye. Alice and the wounded Ranger are near Uncas. 

	CLOSER: HAWKEYE & CORA

	Cora looks left. Her eyes go wide. 

					CORA
			No! 

	HAWKEYE

	spins. 

	HEYWARD & TWO TROOPERS OF THE 33RD IN A SECOND CANOE

	have emerged from the smoke ten feet from them. Heyward's aiming a horse pistol at
	Hawkeye. 

	HAWKEYE

	is non-plussed. He doesn't stop paddling. 

					HAWKEYE
			You got nothin' better to do today on 
			Lake George than shoot me, Major,
			then go ahead ... 

	Heyward's a hair's breadth from firing. Suddenly they hear the boom of muskets and
	rounds come in. 

	WIDE

	They're being pursued by three boatloads - and then a fourth and fifth - of Huron. 

	HEYWARD

	is indifferent to Huron musket balls. Hawkeye hasn't stopped paddling and pays
	Heyward no heed.

					CORA
			Stop it!! 

	Heyward comes to his senses. His head is gashed. A scarf, as a tourniquet, is tied
	around his leg. He lowers the gun. 

					HEYWARD
			When you fall into British hands again, 
			Nathaniel Poe, I will have you hanged. 

	HURON CANOES

	paddle hard and deep and the canoes power across the lake. 

	HAWKEYE & HEYWARD'S CANOES

	with less paddlers, plus wounded, are slower and will be overtaken. 

	HAWKEYE

	looks to Uncas. They both realize the same thing. Hawkeye nods and he, Uncas &
	Chingachgook begin to paddle furiously. The others match the doubled pace. They're
	sprinting ahead but the effort is exhausting. 

	HURON CANOES

	maintain their steady pace. Three or four Hurons fire. 

	HAWKEYE'S CANOE

	Musket balls ricochet on the water's surface. One rips a hole through the bow.
	Hawkeye sees one of the Redcoats in Heyward's canoe is giving out ... 

					REDCOAT #1
			Can't ... keep it up ... 

					HAWKEYE
			Pull! 

	He renews the attack on the water with the paddle.

					HEYWARD
				(shouts)
			How long? 

					HAWKEYE
				(shouts)
			Only chance we got is ... 
				(breathless)
			 ... to get more distance on 'em and go 
			to ground! 

	Heyward digs in. Like firecrackers in the distance, Huron muskets sound. A new hail
	of musket balls cut the fabric of the canoes. One Redcoat is shot in the back. He falls
	overboard.

					HAWKEYE
				(shouts)
			Pull!!

	HAWKEYE CANOE

	sprints forward. 

	CLOSE: HAWKEYE

	looks over his shoulder. 

	THE HURON CANOES

	They're pulling away from them.

					HAWKEYE
			Pull ...! 

	More Huron musket balls hit water nearby. 

	REDCOAT

	in Heyward's boat is shot. BUT ... the .65 caliber ball didn't penetrate his skin. The
	Redcoat - amazed - picks it off the floor of the canoe. 

					REDCOAT #2
			Spent. 

	Distance caught up with eighteenth century ballistics. They're out of smoothbore
	musket range. 

	HAWKEYE CANOE]

					HAWKEYE
				(to Heyward)
			Head for ... for the white water. 

					HEYWARD
			Do you hear me, sir! 
				(exhausted)
			If you ever fall ... into British hands ...
				(breathes)
			What white water? 

	HEYWARD & REDCOAT'S POV: LAKE

	divided by a spit of land. The right fork becomes a river with white water rapids. 

	HAWKEYE CANOE - HAWKEYE

	paddling now, too, as they furiously jam for the white water that will shoot them way
	ahead of the Hurons. 

	UNCAS

	leaps off the stern of Hawkeye's canoe and climbs up the stern of Heyward's and takes
	control. He roughly gestures to the Redcoat and the Major to stop paddling. He and
	Hawkeye will pilot the two canoes. 

	EXTERIOR WHITE WATER - WIDE - DAY

	The canoes enter the white water and they're so light, they're jet-propelled. 

	CANOE POV: EIGHT FOOT WAVE

	racing in the same direction they are. They hit it straight on and it shoots over them and
	they're drenched by two waves coming from the sides. 

	HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	paddle like fiends to get momentum and control. 

	UNCAS' CANOE

	Same thing. When they crested the wave Uncas hollers at them to "pull" and they do.
	As soon as they're through it, Uncas slams the paddle in the water and makes the canoe
	revolve a hundred and eighty degrees in a vortex so that now it's going through 
	stern-first or the stern becomes the bow, so that Uncas could pilot it a different way
	through a hazard of ... 

	EXPOSED ROCKS

	jutting out of the water. 

	WIDE - BOTH CANOES

	Hawkeye didn't have to turn because Chingachgook, at the bow, uses his paddle to
	shove the canoe away from jutting rocks. Uncas does the same. Past the jutting rocks,
	Uncas swings it back around while ... 

	WHITE WATER

	smashes into the camera. 

	ALICE & CORA

	as the canoe roller-coasters and water bursts the bow. Then suddenly it's through and
	the water is miraculously smooth. 

	CANOES

	The Ranger, the Redcoats and even Heyward feel the exhilaration of the ride. That's
	because they think they're home free.

					HAWKEYE
			Here's where it gets tricky ... 

	Heyward turns to look in front of him. He doesn't know what the hell Hawkeye's
	talking about. 

	HEYWARD'S POV: THE RIVER AHEAD

	looks glass-smoth. Although there is a distant ROAR of sorts. Then Heyward realizes:
	something's wrong with this picture. 

	CLOSER: HEYWARD

	The look on his face starts to change. 

	HEYWARD'S POV: TIGHTER

	The glass surface of the river continues to a line then falls off the end of the world. The
	river just ends ... 

	BOTH CANOES: HEYWARD, REDCOATS, THE RANGER

	realize they're heading for the lip of a waterfall. There's a couple of outcroppings of
	rock in the center at the very edge. We are at Glen Falls.

					HAWKEYE
			Don't move ... 

	AERIAL SHOT

	from the other side of the falls. It's a two hundred foot high, death-defying cataract.
	The canoes - slightly above us - will go right over. 

	TWO CANOES

	At the last moment, Hawkeye & Uncas land both on either side of the larger rock
	outcropping. It is literally at the lip of the falls. 

	HEYWARD

	grabs a rock to anchor the bow of the canoe. He loses his grip. The canoe rockets for
	the edge. 

	UNCAS

	lurches sideways, grabs a tree root. He is the only link of the canoe to earth. The bow,
	with Heyward, is literally hanging over the edge. Uncas strains and pulls the canoe to
	the rock. He gestures to Heyward. 

	HEYWARD

	crawls forward and makes the island. Then the two Redcoats. Finally Uncas. The canoe
	rockets over the falls. Meanwhile ... 

	THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND

	Hawkeye has beached his canoe and is camouflaging it with driftwood and brush. As
	they clamber over the high pieces of broken limestone, we see Hawkeye is slipping into
	a crevice. He motions to Cora. Uncas carries the wounded Ranger. Heyward helps
	Alice ... 

	CUT TO ...

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVES - FISSURE - TWILIGHT

	The irregular opening of medium blue sky is obscured by the black silhouetted forms of
	Hawkeye, Cora and then the others entering.

					HEYWARD
			Where do we go from here? 

					HAWKEYE
			We don't. 

					HEYWARD
			I don't understand! 

					HAWKEYE
			This is it, as far as we can go ... If we're 
			lucky, they'll be figurin' we can't have 
			come this way and must've beached our 
			canoes and headed cross land. If we're 
			very lucky, they'll figure we went over 
			the falls. 

					HEYWARD
			Then what? 

					HAWKEYE
			Then we take the south rim down the 
			mountain and it's 12 miles cross country 
			to Fort Edward. 

					HEYWARD
			And if we're unlucky? 

					HAWKEYE
			You will have to forego the pleasure of 
			hangin' me. 

	REVERSE: WIDE

	Hawkeye helps Cora; Heyward, the Ranger. Chingachgook carries Alice, down the
	rockface into a cave. We hear a distant ROAR reverberating off the walls. 

	ANOTHER ANGLE: THE WALLS

	are scooped out, bone-like hollows eroded by tumbling water. At an earlier time the
	formation was part of the falls. 

	HAWKEYE & CORA

	reach the irregular floor of the chamber. The ROAR is louder. 

	WIDEN TO REVEAL

	a curtain of falling water. They're behind the cataract, probably a third of the way down
	its height. Light through the water stikes them with a silver luminescence. They're
	exhausted. The others join them. They almost have to shout to be heard. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	followed by Uncas, takes stock of their supplies. They check their powder. They have
	almost none. Uncas shares his with Hawkeye. The Redcoat's cartridge case is soaked,
	the paper cartridges a soggy mess. Heyward has none. The Ranger has two left. In
	Mohican, Chingachgook decides some things. Hawkeye and Uncas nod. Heyward
	approaches Hawkeye.

					HEYWARD
			Any powder? 

					HAWKEYE:
				(crossing to Cora)
			Only one or two loads. 

	CORA

	is soaked to the bones. Hawkeye strips off his buckskin hunting shirt and wrings it out.
	Cora turns her back, strips off her white blouse and puts on the faster-drying chamois. 

					CORA
			Are we safe? 

					HAWKEYE
			Maybe ... 

					CORA
			Our father? Did you see my father? 

	EXTREME CLOSE UP: HAWKEYE

	The look on his face tells it all 

					CORA
			Tell me! 

	TWO SHOT

	Hawkeye takes Cora away from the group and turns her by her shoulders and whispers
	to her. We don't hear what he says. Cora drops to her knees and places her hands over
	her eyes and face like a little girl trying to make something bad go away. 

	HAWKEYE

	Leads her to a depression, his arm around her shoulders, her face covered and she cries
	softly into his shoulder. 

	EXTREME CLOSE UP: CORA

	says into Hawkeye's ear, after she looks O.S. ...

					CORA
			Say nothing to Alice ...! 

	Hawkeye nods.

	ALICE

	stands in the chamber not far from the wall of water, fascinated with its shimmer. She's
	oblivious to all the events and everything going on around her ... 

	HEYWARD

	sees Cora & Hawkeye together and turns away. 

	GROUP

	Uncas watches Alice. The wounded Ranger has fallen asleep. The Redcoat is
	exhausted. Hawkeye & Cora against the wall. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR RIVER BANK - RIVER FALLS ARE IN MIST & RED SKY -
	TWILIGHT

	A landscape with mist rearlit by the red light of the sun that's already behind the
	mountains. The blues are turning purple and the greens are turning black and the white
	highlights of the foaming water are going rose. Reflecting the darkening sky, where the
	surface isn't broken, the water is fast-moving metal ... SUDDENLY: a shaved head and
	muscled back stands into the foreground. It moves down the shore away from camera.
	He's followed by other Huron warriors. They're two hundred yards away from Glen
	Falls island. 

	HURON

	looks at the island of rock & trees and tilts his head curiously ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR FOREST ABOVE CANYON & FALLS - GREY WOLF - TWILIGHT

	watches the Hurons below make their way towards the edge of the falls. 

	OVER HIS SHOULDER: THREE MORE WOLVES

	join him, moving frenetically, uneasily ... The leader of the pack looks up & howls as
	his eyes go white reflecting the new moon. 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - HAWKEYE -NIGHT

	hears the distant howl. He's now lit silver blue by the moonlight through the falling
	water. Hawkeye knows it means Hurons are out there. He exchanges worried glances
	with Uncas & Chingachgook. 

	UNCAS

	immediately starts up the right acclivity to one fissure, and Chingachgook moves
	carefully to the first fissure. Hawkeye follows. 

	HAWKEYE

	His countenance gives way momentarily. All his experience seems of no avail. He
	touches the side of Cora's face. Grabs Killdeer and follows Chingachgook. 

	ALICE

	sensing new danger, slips away on her own. 

	CORA

	crosses to the Ranger who's semi-conscious, feverish and getting delirious. She can't do
	a thing except hold his hand and think of her father. 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR SOUTH FISSURE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	below the edge, listen & wait, testing the environment with all their senses ... 

	NORTH FISSURE - UNCAS

	against one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky ... 

	ALICE

	looks at the sky through the fissure. She sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight
	pull her forward. She starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them.
	Suddenly ... 

	UNCAS

	yanks her down next to him. He pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the
	edge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand. There is no sign she
	was seen. 

	UNCAS & ALICE

	He relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent.
	Languorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up,
	as if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy. Uncas tries to restrain her. 

	ALICE'S

	eyes slowly open. Oblivion disappears. It's replaced with escalating fear. She holds onto
	Uncas with desperation. Her fingers claw his shoulders. She buries her face in his
	chest. 

					ALICE
			Uncas ... 

	Her body shudders. Her terror's total. He tries to restrain and calm her. She won't let
	him. Then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life,
	she holds him between her thighs. And Uncas is confused, but Alice whispers his name
	and he responds. He loves her in the half-light. 

	UNCAS

	his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems to reach some
	emotional climax and begins to cry softly, and Uncas stops making love to her and
	holds her. Then she's flooded with shame. He reaches for her. She jerks away. He
	reaches for her again and clutches her to him. And she breaks down. Then he turns her
	face to him, but her expression has completely flattened. 

	WIDER ANGLE

	She's not a lover to Uncas now. She's pitiful & stricken and he comforts her. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR RIVER - MAGUA - NIGHT

	beaches a canoe on the bank. He and eight braves ease out. His war paint is fresh:
	green handprints on his chest and black and green on his face. Black plumes are affixed
	to his scalp-lock and his shawl is over his left shoulder. The right arm carrying his
	musket is exposed. Many scalps are tied to his tomahawk. He walks towards us
	approaching the island, two hundred yards away ... 

	CUT TO ...

	checks his powder horn. Nearly empty. He looks at Chingachgook. 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS ISLAND, CAVE - CORA - NIGHT

	been discovered. Now they're backed into a hole in the ground with no powder and no
	way out.

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK - NIGHT

	Chingachgook talks to him in Mohican. Momentarily the anger and frustration is seen
	on Hawkeye's face. All his experience & craft has been to no avail. He looks at Cora.
	Back to Chingachgook. Chingachgook states something terse in Mohican. Hawkeye
	agrees. Heyward's confused. He doesn't know what they're talking about. Cora has
	understood Chingachgook's intent perfectly.

					CORA
			Yes. Go ahead. 

					HEYWARD
				(explodes)
			What the bloody hell plan is this? 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Cora)
			In this there is a chance. If I live, I can 
			try to free you. If we don't go, there is 
			no powder, there's too many of them. 
			Though my heart would keep me here, 
			in that there is no chance. None. I can do 
			nothing. Do you understand? 

					CORA
			Yes. I want you to go. 

					HEYWARD
			Coward! Coward back at the fort. 
			Coward here. 

	Hawkeye uses discipline not to kill the man. 

					CORA
			You try. With all you have. To save 
			yourself. If the worst happens, and 
			only one of us survives, something of 
			the other does, too ...

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS CAVE - CORA & HAWKEYE - NIGHT

	She's holding him. In the rigid language of her body is the struggle to contain her fear. 

					HAWKEYE
				(very close)
			 If they don't kill you, they may take you 
			north up into Canada. A warrior may take 
			you for a wife. 

	CORA

	turns aside. Hawkeye insists. 

					HAWKEYE
				(continues)
			Listen. Submit. You hear me? You're 
			strong. You stay alive. I will find you ... 
			no matter how far, how long it takes ... 

					CORA
				(nods, low)
			 ... never doubt what you are doing. 

	RANGER

	conscious now, arranges his crushed body to face the direction from which will come
	the attack as ... 

	HEYWARD

	puts Alice, who's entered, behind him as ... Uncas hits the floor of the cave. Now the
	first glow from Huron torches starts to light the walls. They're coming ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	has their weapons slung over his back. He says something in Mohican. Uncas spins
	looks at Alice: her expression's vacant. 

	HAWKEYE'S KNIFE

	cuts a lock of Cora's hair. He folds it into his shirt. The orange light from Huron
	torches, now closer, plays on the wall behind her. We hear many Huron approach. 

	CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS

	now run out of the cave and throw themselves into the curtain of water. This is their
	exit. 

	HAWKEYE

	engraves her image in his memory one last time and then sprints across the floor
	towards the water ... 

	WHAT HAWKEYE SEES: JAMMING AT THE WATERFALL

	and then through it into ... 

	SUBJECTIVE CAMERA: UP

	An awful crushing roar. We explode out the front of a white cataract a third of the way
	from the top and we fall down away from the world. 

	EXTERIOR GLEN FALLS - HAWKEYE - NIGHT

	tumbles down the falls; rolling, tumbling through the white water; then through air;
	then back into cascading white water again, disappearing ... 

	THE RIVER BELOW - UNCAS & CHINGACHGOOK'S

	bodies hit, disappear and don't surface. It looks unsurviveable. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: FALLING

	Sheets of water fall with us. The bottom races towards us at a hundred miles an hour ...
	Just before we hit ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	INTERIOR GLEN FALLS, CAVE - FLAMING TORCH - NIGHT

	WIDEN. The cave is filled with Hurons. The Redcoat is dead in the corner. A group of
	braves moves away from the body of the Ranger. 

	HEYWARD'S

	surrounded. The women are behind him. He slashes at one Huron with his sword and is
	clubbed down by a giant. 

	MAGUA

	enters. His blanket, like a shawl, over his left shoulder, black plumes in his hair. He's
	imperturbable. 

	MAGUA'S HAND

	reaches out and touches Cora's hair. Cora is frozen to the spot. His hand drops away
	from the hated Munros and as Magua turns to go, he says something low in Huron and
	the two women are jerked towards the fissures. Heyward is dragged by the arms. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR RIVER - WHITE WATER - NIGHT

	miles from the falls. We see a figure. It's Chingachgook, nearly spent, rolling and
	tumbling through the fast-moving white water. He submerges, then surfaces again. He
	appears exhausted by the fall and ride. 

	CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: WATER

	rocketing at us, battering and drowning us. We glimpse something downstream ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	tries to focus, slammed against rocks, he's striking out towards the right, swimming
	against the current. He's grabbing for something. 

	KILLDEER'S MUZZLE

	and leather shoulder-strap. Chingachgook's hand grabs it. The current rushing past tries
	to steal him from Uncas and Hawkeye, who're also beaten, bloodied, exhausted. They
	pull the older, larger man from the water and ... 

	ON THE ROCK

	all three lie there, almost devoid of energy. Then Hawkeye rises, looks at the others.
	Chingachgook nods. He's up. Then Uncas, and they're moving off into the calm eddy
	between the rock they landed on and the shoreline. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR FOREST - HURONS - DAY

	move along animal paths. 

	CORA & ALICE

	struggle through the branches of trees. No one helps them. When they fall behind, they
	are pushed forward. 

	HEYWARD

	badly beaten, bound, staggers ahead to get behind Maqua. Then:

					HEYWARD
			If Magua give women to Yengeese soldiers 
			... will receive many gifts. 

					MAGUA
				(as if considering)
			Gifts? 

					HEYWARD
			Three, four oxen ... much wampum. 

					MAGUA
			Wampum? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			Does Yengeese Major have property 
			across salt sea? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			Yengeese Major give all property to Magua. 
			Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum, 
			many gifts, maybe three, four oxen. 

	Magua looks at Heyward derisively. Does this white man think he's an idiot?

					HEYWARD
			Gold could be arranged. 

					MAGUA
			For Munro children? 

					HEYWARD
			Yes. 

					MAGUA
			How much gold has the master of the 
			Yengeese? 

					HEYWARD
			The King? The King has mountains of 
			gold! 

	Long pause as if Magua and King George II were seriously considering this 	transaction.

					MAGUA
			Not enough. 

	Heyward is first realizing with whom he's playing.

					HEYWARD
			What is enough? 

					MAGUA
			Heart. Give Magua new heart. 

	Magua totally disdains the Englishman and walks away from him, starting up a steeper
	forested hill.

	CLOSER: HAWKEYE

	lips are drawn back, determined, flashing through the hard verticals of the forest, now

	CUT TO ...

	EXT. HURON VILLAGE - ORNATE CHAIR - DAY

	on a rude platform. The entire village is crowded in a large circle. They all wait for
	someone. They've been waiting a long time. In the perimeter warriors keep Huron at
	bay for some reason. We see Magua. He stands apart. They wait. Then ... 

	ANCIENT SACHEM

	is led to the dais by three women down the main street between the neat rows of birch
	bark lodges. Many scalps and trophies from the massacre are in evidence. He sits on the
	raised platform. He looks to be in his nineties. His dark wrinkled face is contrasted by
	his long white hair. His robe is painted in hieroglyphical representation of combat. He
	wears numerous silver & gold medals, gifts of French, English and Dutch governors.
	Most startling is his face. His dark & lined skin is enhanced by delicate lines of
	tatooing. He looks up to Magua. 

					SACHEM
				(in Huron; subtitled)
			The tomahawks of your young men have 
			been very red. 

					MAGUA
				(in Huron; subtitled)
			Many of the Yengeese are dead, great 
			Sachem. 
				(sound dissolve to English)
			I have brought three of my prisoners, 
			to honor you. Two are the children
			of Munro. Whose scalp hangs on my 
			lodge pole. And whose heart I cut from 
			his chest. 

	Now we see Cora on the ground. Defeat & fear are held in place by her determination.
	Alice looks around, in another place. Heyward's hands are bound between his back with
	a piece of wood wedged through his elbows.

			officer to Les Francais and the reward is 
			my gift to you, wise one ... The women - 
			children of the white war chief - will burn 
			in our fires so all can share in this. 

	The sachem considers this. Then he looks up and sees something beyond Magua. 

	MAGUA

	senses the sachem's eye line ... 

	HAWKEYE

	unarmed, walking through the Hurons. A young boy rushes at him. Hawkeye, at the
	last possible second, dodges. Others catch and restrain the boy. The Hurons are
	astounded a European would simply walk into their camp. 

	CORA

	sees him enter, doesn't believe he's there. 

					CORA
			Nathaniel! 

	Hawkeye glances at her, doesn't respond. The situation is a stick of dynamite ready to
	go off.
					HAWKEYE
				(to Heyward; low)
			Translate for me, Major. Into French. 
			Every word ... as I say it. 

	Magua starts towards Hawkeye, his tomahawk slipping into his hand.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Sachem)
			I come to you unarmed and in peace to 
			unstop your ears, wise one. Because the 
			Hurons are mislead by the words of the 
			wolf who's never spoken the truth.

	Sachem gestures with his hand to Magua. Magua reluctantly stops advancing on
	Hawkeye. Heyward's French translation has faded to a murmur. We hear Hawkeye's
	English.

					HAWKEYE
			Let the children of the dead Colonel Munro 
			go free and take the fire out of the English 
			anger over the murder of their helpless ones. 

					MAGUA
				(to Sachem)
			Our father, Montcalm, is greater than the 
			Yengeese in the arts of war. The Huron 
			do not fear English anger. 

					HAWKEYE
				(to Sachem)
			Wise one, the French fathers made peace 
			and swore to their honor not to break the 
			friendship. Magua broke it. It is false that 
			the French would not be friends, still, to 
			the Huron. 

	Sachem reacts.

					MAGUA
				(laughs)
			It made our French father happy to never 
			have to fight the same Yengeese again. 
			He told me this without telling me this. 

	Hawkeye realizes this is true.

					HAWKEYE
			So the Huron are the servants of the French? 
			To do what the French are shamed to do? 

					MAGUA
			No. 
				(to Sachem)
			Huron serve no one. The French father 
			believes he fooled Magua because he is so 
			proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it 
			is the Huron path that Magua walks down, 
			not the French one ... Now, Les Francais, 
			also, fear Huron. That is good. When the 
			Huron is strong from their fear, we will make 
			the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we 
			will trade as the white man trades. Take land 
			from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk 
			& Fox. And make the Huron great. Over 
			other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong 
			as the whites. 

	Hawkeye appears to be losing his debate with Magua.

					HAWKEYE
				(to Sachem)
			Magua would use the ways of Les Francais 
			and the Yengeese ... 

					MAGUA
				(to Sachem)
			The red man put down the bow, picked up 
			the fire stick and became the best warrior 
			in the forest. Yes. It is the only way. 

					HAWKEYE
			Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers 
			foolish with brandy and steal his lands to sell 
			them for gold to the white man? Would the 
			Huron have greed for more land than a man 
			can use? Like Francais Black Robes do? 
			Would Huron kill tribes with disease? Would 
			the Huron fool Seneca into taking all the 
			animals in the forest for beads & brandy? But 
			sell the fur to the white man for gold? ... 
				(to Sachem)
			 Those are the ways of Yengeese and Les 
			Francais masters. Are they the ways of Huron 
			men who hunt & work the land? Or of dogs? 
			... Magua's heart is twisted. He would make 
			himself into what twisted him. A Dog, become 
			Master of Dogs. But are Hurons dogs? 
			... Magua's way is false. It is like the white 
			sickness. Magua's way will bring only sadness 
			and shame. Is there another way? I don't know. 
				(pauses)
			I am Nathaniel of the Yengeese; Hawkeye, 
			adopted son of Chingachgook, of the Mohican 
			people ... Let the children of the dead Munro go 
			free ... I speak the truth. 

	Magua starts to rebut. Sachem holds up his hand and stops him. Nobody talks. Sachem
	whispers to the older men on either side of him. 

	MAGUA

	waits for the decision. 

	CORA

	looks to Alice, then to Hawkeye. 

	HAWKEYE

	exchanges a desperate look with Cora and then senses the Sachem is staring at him
	from the perspective of nearly a century of laws & judgments. Then ... to every word. 

					SACHEM
			The white man comes like a day that has 
			passed. And night enters our future with 
			him ... 
				(pause)
			Our council talks since I was a boy: 
			What is the Huron to do? 
				(pause)
			But Magua would lead Huron down paths 
			that make us not Hurons. 
				(the judgment)
			Dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted 
			heart of Magua. 

	Cora, hearing the sentence ... Hawkeye's losing her.

					SACHEM
				(continuing)
			Munro daughter with moon in her hair 
			must be Magua's wife so Munro's seed 
			doesn't die. 

	Alice is gone, living in some dark recess of her mind.

					SACHEM
				(continuing; dissolves 
				back to French)
			 ... and Yengeese officer not go to Les
			Francais, but back to Yengeese so their 
			hatred burns less bright. La Longue Carabine, 
			go in peace. 

	People move, start to implement the sentence. Hawkeye's panicked. Cora is jerked
	upright. She looks at Hawkeye in terror: Sachem is starting to depart.

					HAWKEYE
			No! listen. 
				(to Heyward)
			Tell him I'll trade him! Me for her! Tell him!! 

	Heyward translates into rapid-fire French. 

					HAWKEYE
				(shouts)
			I am La Longue Carabine! My death is a 
			great honor to the Huron. Take me! 

	Cora is jerked forward by three Hurons. Magua grabs Alice. Cora strikes at Magua. He
	knocks her aside. Chaos & confusion. Meanwhile: 

					MAGUA
				(French; subtitled)
			This is not the voice of wisdom. I go to 
			the Hurons of the Lakes! You are women. 
			Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca, 
			beg from them venison to eat, corn to grind. 
			Slaves, dogs, rabbits, thieves ... I spit on you! 

	Those Hurons who hear, do so in deadly, boding silence. Magua and his fourteen hard
	core braves start out as ... 

	SACHEM

	heard Heyward's translation. He looks at Heyward, then looks at Hawkeye and he nods
	his head. 

	HAWKEYE

	sees this. His eyes go to Cora. They've stopped dragging her towards the fire pit.
	Hawkeye steps forward to surrender. Cora is thrown at him. Cora looks around wildly.
	Instead of taking Hawkeye, two warriors grab Heyward. 

	HEYWARD

	is immediately hamstrung and his legs collapse. He gasps. He's caught under the arms
	and dragged forward.

					HAWKEYE
			I said to trade me! 

	Hawkeye's holding Cora. Heyward struggles to be seen.

					HEYWARD
			... compliments, Mr. Poe. 
				(pause)
			Take her and get out. 

					CORA
				(standing)
			What are they doing to Duncan? 
			Duncan! 

	He's gone. They start to ease away from the mass of Hurons.

					HAWKEYE 
				(low to himself)
			And my compliments to you ... 

					CORA
			Alice? 

	Hawkeye's concentration is on backing out of the Huron mob. Will the Sachem's
	judgment be honored? Will some warriors hack down Hawkeye & Cora? As they go ... 

	CORA

	moves towards her sister. But Hawkeye holds her tightly as they retreat. 

	CORA'S POV: ALICE

	with Magua's group crosses the path. He drags Alice behind him like baggage. She
	regains her feet. Magua is oblivious to her. He's heading towards the plateau. 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR FOREST, TREE LINE - CHINGACHGOOK & UNCAS - DAY

	Uncas sees Magua's direction. Uncas touches his father, grabs his musket and races off.
	Chingachgook reaches to stop him, but he's too late. Chingachgook's hand in the air ... 

	TWO-SHOT: HAWKEYE & CORA

	near the tree line. Hawkeye has eyes only for ... 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: HURONS

	moving towards fire pit. One turns to watch Hawkeye & Cora depart. Will he arouse
	others to attack? Behind him, others are doing something to Heyward and flames leap
	up. 

	CORA'S EYES

	are on Alice, off to the right in the meadow. 

	HAWKEYE

	tense. They're almost there. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	holding Killdeer. 

	CHINGACHGOOK'S POV: MASSED HURON

	Sky & flames. Suddenly, Heyward's stood upright into the fire, bound to a bracket by
	his arms. As the flames start devouring him ... 

	HAWKEYE & CORA

	close to Chingachgook and the tree line ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	tosses Hawkeye Killdeer. As fast as he jams it into his shoulder he FIRES. 

	HEYWARD

	among the hollering Hurons, is shot dead. It goes unnoticed. 

	CUT TO ...

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS - DAY

	half-way up the rock face. He's approaching an overhang. He climbs with a reckless
	desperation ... 

	EXTERIOR STREAM - HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	pound across the (sic) to the meadow towards Magua's path ... 

	CORA

	trying to stay with them, scrambles up ... 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS

	reaches the overhang. It juts away from the face six feet. 

	THE CEILING OF THE OVERHANG

	Uncas' hand jams into a crack in the granite, forms a fist and twists, making a wedge.
	He swings out, dangling in space by the hand wedged into the rock. His right hand
	reaches out and up, searching the vertical face for ... 

	UNCAS' HAND

	... a rock flake. An indentation. Anything ... His fingers find a diagonal crevice and ... 

	UNCAS

	swings out, now hanging by the vertical face above the overhang. His features are
	distorted with determination. Nothing will stop him. His right hand grabs another rock.
	His arms snap him up. Then push. He's on the ledge. Moving fast ... 

	CUT TO ... 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - HURONS - DAY

	on point are approaching the path above the promontory. Five warriors are ahead of
	Magua. One behind him drags Alice. 

	FIRST

	Huron starts up the narrow path. Suddenly ... 

	UNCAS

	slams him off the rock with the butt of his musket. 

	WIDE ANGLE

	Two's musket coming up. Uncas swings. FIRES. Before he's fallen, Uncas bayonets
	Three. 

	FOURTH

	FIRES, misses, swings. Uncas slips the swung musket, but it catches his elbow. Uncas'
	musket falls. Before it hits the ground his tomahawk is out and hacks Four over the
	edge ... 

	MAGUA

	running forward past Five, confronts Uncas head on. It's incredibly fast. 

	UNCAS'

	three tomahawk swings are dodged by Magua whose own knife streaks like silver
	flashes. Uncas, gashed on arms and chest, feints right and slams Magua with an open
	hand, closes and the men are intertwined steel and muscle ... and Magua throws Uncas.
	Going with him and rolling off Uncas, Magua's knife flashes into his armpit. Uncas'
	right arm is useless. He scrambles up. Next to the expertise of a mature warrior like
	Magua, Uncas' raw, young determination may not be enough. 

	EXTERIOR - MEADOW - CHINGACHGOOK

	freezes. 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - UNCAS

	closing, swings. Magua moves inside, stabs Uncas twice, turns him to face the edge,
	ripping his head left to expose the right underside of his throat. 

	CLOSE: MAGUA'S

	knife arm punches forward. 

	WIDE: PROMONTORY

	Uncas falls down the face onto to the rocks. 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	seeing his boy killed, CRIES out and is charging up the path, Hawkeye following. 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - ALICE

	backs to the edge. 

	MAGUA

	moves on Alice. His knife is low, about to strike. She stares at him. Her eyes are like
	pools of deep water, calm, open, almost beatific. It stops Magua ... 

	MAGUA

	inexplicably, drops his knife hand. He's riveted by her. About him, there's a glimmer of
	something else. He wears a human face for this one moment. He reaches out with his
	other hand to offer her safety. To bring her back from the edge ... 

	ALICE

	looks down at Uncas, her lover, dead on the rocks below. She turns to Magua with
	enigmatic calm. Her eyes seem to see into him. She steps off the edge. She falls to her
	death next to Uncas ... 

	EXTERIOR MEADOW - CORA

	collapses to her knees on the ground and her face falls forward into her hands ... 

	HURON WARRIORS

	are running down the path to intercept Chingachgook, charging uphill, fueled by a
	father's rage, and Hawkeye. One Huron aims at the center of Chingachgook's chest ... 

	HAWKEYE

	FIRES past his father's side. The Huron's blown off the path. Hawkeye races to reload
	on the run ... 

	EXTERIOR PROMONTORY - MAGUA

	sees the approach of Chingachgook. 

	TO CHINGACHGOOK

	Huron warriors are an irrelevance. He slams one aside with his musket. 

	HAWKEYE FIRES. 

	HURON

	with tomahawk, about to blindside Chingachgook, is SHOT DOWN. 

	MAGUA

	charging Chingachgook. 

	VERY WIDE

	Two men, like dots, race to collide at the center of the promontory. Now the others fall
	back... It's one-on-one. Hawkeye slows ... 

	COMBATANTS

	Magua - confident, pumped up - feints with his left, his tomahawk appearing in his
	right, sweeping backhand, while his left, magically holding his blade, is jamming up to
	gut Chingachgook. Chingachgook's dead. Except ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	isn't there. He rolled and, on one knee with his back to Magua, his arm slams rearward.
	The massive war club crashes into Magua's back. 

	MAGUA

	stunned, turns to hatchet Chingachgook ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	now up and towering - slams his club right into Magua's assault ... destroying it,
	 breaking Magua's right arm. And ... 

	CHINGACHGOOK

	... with his momentum, spins like a shot-putter and the next blow cripples Magua's left
	side and crushes part of his chest. 

	ANOTHER BLOW

	destroys Magua's collar and shoulder. 

	MAGUA

	amazed. His body is broken and crippled, but he still stands. He looks into the eyes of
	the last warrior of the Mohicans. 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			UNCAS!!! 

	And he spins and swings. The blade side of the war club punches into Magua's chest,
	caving him in two. 

	WIDE

	Magua dies in the dust. 

	HAWKEYE

	watching Chingachgook's heaving back. It's over. 

	CORA

	alone, kneeling in the meadow. Her eyes downcast ... 

	FADE OUT ...

	FADE IN 

	EXTERIOR - MOUNTAIN TOP - WIDE REAR SHOT - NEXT DAY

	Chingachgook's at the edge, facing the endless rolling forests to the west. A haze of
	sunlight illuminates silver and lead clouds. Hawkeye is a little apart, watching his father. 

	HAWKEYE'S POV: CHINGACHGOOK

	speaks to the sky.

					CHINGACHGOOK
				(Mohican)
			Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life ... 

	ON HAWKEYE & CHINGACHGOOK

	We HEAR Hawkeye's English translation in VOICE OVER: 

					CHINGACHGOOK/
					HAWKEYE (V.O.): 
				(in English)
			... a warrior goes to you swift and straight 
			as an arrow shot into the sun. Welcome him 
			and let him take his place at the council fire 
			of my people. 
				(pause)
			He is Uncas, my son. 
				(pause)
			Bid them patience and ask death for speed; 
			for they are all there but one
			- I, Chingachgook - Last of the Mohicans. 

	Chingachgook's hands drop to his sides. He lets out his breath with a weariness. His
	eyes seek Hawkeye's. They hold ... 

	CORA

	is standing, her back to us, in front of a rock-covered grave with a wooden cross. Next
	to it is Uncas' burial platform. Cora [says a] silent prayer. Then she pauses, crosses
	herself. Her emotions are spent. She moves next to Hawkeye. He takes her hand. 

	HAWKEYE & CORA]

					HAWKEYE
			Will you go back to England? 

					CORA
			I have nothing to go back for. 

	Long pause. 

					HAWKEYE
			Then will you stay in America? 

	She turns to face him.

					HAWKEYE
			And will you be my wife? 

	Pause. 

					CORA
			Yes. 

	They hold each other's eyes. She searches his face.

					CORA
			Where will we go? 

					HAWKEYE
			Winter with the Delaware, my father's 
			cousins. And in the spring, cross the 
			Ohio and look for land to settle with my 
			father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee. 

	They move next to Chingachgook. He senses they're beside him. Hawkeye's arm is
	around her shoulders.

					CHINGACHGOOK
			The frontier moves with the sun and pushes 
			the red man of the wilderness forests in front 
			of it. Until one day there will be nowhere left. 
			Then our race will be no more, or be not us ... 
			The frontier place is for people like my white 
			son and his woman and their children. 

					HAWKEYE
			That's my father's sadness talking. 

	Hawkeye puts a hand on his shoulder.

					CHINGACHGOOK
			No. It is true ... One day ... there will be no 
			more frontier. Then men like you will go, too. 
			Like the Mohicans. 
				(pause)
			And new people will come. Work. Struggle 
			to make their light ... One mystery remains. 

					HAWKEYE
			What is that? 

	Cora, listening to Chingachgook, takes Hawkeye's hand. 

					CHINGACHGOOK
			Will there be anything left to show the world 
			that we ever did exist? 

	REAR SHOT

	Cora stands next to her man. Hawkeye puts his arm around his father. They stare out
	over the wilderness. 




					THE END
